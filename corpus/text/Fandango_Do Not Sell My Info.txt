Do Not Sell My Personal Information




Like many ecommerce companies, we provide some of your information, including your interests, activities on our site and device identifiers, to third parties in order to improve the marketing messages you receive and to enhance the data they have about you for their own advertising and marketing purposes.

Additional Details About Do Not Sell My Personal Information Opt Out




Filling out this webform will not opt you out of a âdata saleâ that uses cookies or mobile advertising IDs.
Below, we explain how you can make choices about this information.



Digital Advertising Alliance (âDAAâ) Opt-Out



The Digital Advertising Alliance (âDAAâ) offers tools to provide consumers with choices as to whether participating third parties can use your information to provide targeted advertising.
To opt out of sharing your information with participating third parties for targeted advertising, please use the following tools:

For websites: the DAA WebChoices Tool
For mobile applications: the DAA AppChoices Tool




Google Opt-Out



If you are on the web, you can also opt out of Google Analytics by installing Googleâs opt-out browser add-on, and opt out of interest-based Google ads using Googleâs Ads Settings.
Google may also participate in the DAA WebChoices Tool (above).



Mobile Ad Settings



If you no longer wish to receive interest-based advertising on your mobile applications, please refer to your deviceâs operating system settings, which may include âLimit Ad Trackingâ on iOS devices and "opt-out of interest-based advertising" on Android devices.



Facebook Ad Preferences



Facebook offers settings that may control what information Facebook uses about you or your device activity for advertising purposes.
Login to Facebook and go to Settings &gt.
Ads &gt.
Ad Settings (web) or Ad Preferences &gt.
Ad Settings (app) for more information.



PLEASE NOTE:



The opt-outs described above are device and browser based.
Because the information being shared relates to your device ID and/or browser ID, you must opt out on each device and each browser where you want your choice to apply.
Opt-outs may be stored via cookies.
Therefore, if you clear your cookies, your opt outs will be cleared and you will have to redo them.



We do not maintain or control the opt-out mechanisms and settings for the third parties mentioned above (e.g.
Facebook, Google, Apple, DAA) and are not responsible for their operation.



The Internet Advertising Bureau would like us to inform you of the following:



Exercising these choices does not prevent you from receiving contextual advertising, being served first-party ads through cross-device tracking, or having information used for non-targeted advertising purposes, such as attribution and analytics.



Personal information may be shared with our partners (who will function as our service providers in such instance) to help us perform functions to improve ads, such as measuring ad effectiveness, controlling how many times you see an ad, determining ad performance, providing and securing ad, providing aggregate statistics and analytics, and/or reducing ad fraud.



Usage of previously collected and shared information or all interest-based advertising (such as that conducted on other sites) will not be opted out of by these choices.






Fandango Media, LLC.
