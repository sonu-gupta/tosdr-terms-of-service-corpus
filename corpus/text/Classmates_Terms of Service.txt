BECOMING A MEMBER OF AND REGISTERING FOR THE SERVICES
A.
Accessing the Services and Becoming a Member.

THE SERVICES ARE INTENDED SOLELY FOR ACCESS AND USE BY INDIVIDUALS 18 YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER.
BY ACCESSING AND USING THE SERVICES, YOU ARE CERTIFYING THAT YOU ARE AT LEAST 18 YEARS OLD.
Our Services are primarily intended to be utilized by residents of the United States and we may limit or restrict access to the Websites and Services based on your geographic location or ISP.
While there are parts of the Services where access requires the payment of a fee (âPaid Servicesâ), there is no cost to register to become a member of the Services.
The specific Services available to you will vary depending upon (1) whether you register as a member, (2) the community affiliation(s) to which you have self-identified (if you are a Classmates member), and (3) whether or not you choose to purchase Paid Services.



B.
Your Information.

We will collect, store, compile and utilize information about you, your computer, smartphone or other device, and your use of the Services, including information that you provide in response to questionnaires, surveys and registration forms.
Please review our Privacy Policy for more information about our privacy policies and practices.
For your part, you agree that all information that you provide to us or post on the Services is complete, accurate and up to date.
If any of your information changes, you agree to immediately update it.
If you fail to update your information or if all or part of your information is (or appears to be) untrue, inaccurate, or incomplete, we may suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Services, without refund to you of any fees paid.
Without limiting any of the foregoing, you are responsible for ensuring that the email address you provide to us is valid and that the services, software or systems you use to access your email ("Email Systems") do not block or filter Communications (as defined below).
We ask that you use your personal email address when registering.
If you provide us with a non-personal email address or use an Email System that interferes with the delivery of Communications, we may not be able to provide you with certain Services.
Your failure to provide us with an email address to which we can consistently deliver email may result in the termination of your account.



C.
Your Password.

During the registration process we may provide you with a unique registration number.
We will also either ask you to create a password or assign you a random password, which you can change at any time by logging onto the "Account" portion of the Services.
Alternatively, you may have the option of using your Facebook login credentials or similar login processes or co-registration forms from or on other third party websites to create an account and authenticate your access to the website.
Because any activities that occur under your account are your responsibility, it is important for you to keep your password secure.
Notify us immediately if you believe that someone has used your account without your authorization.



D.
Communications.

From time to time we will send you communications, in keeping with our Privacy Policy and as otherwise permitted in these Terms of Service ("Communications").
Please note that any number of issues may interfere with your receipt of such Communications, including some types of Email Systems that may use filtering or blocking techniques that are intended to block email.
We are not responsible for the actual delivery or your actual receipt of these Communications.

2.
PAID SERVICESAccess to some of the Services requires the purchase of Paid Services.
If you elect to purchase Paid Services, you agree to our storage of your payment information and understand that your Paid Services are personal to you, such that you may not transfer or make available your account name and password to others.
Any distribution or sharing by you of your account name and password may result in cancellation of your Paid Services without refund and/or additional charges based on unauthorized use.
We reserve the right, from time to time, to change the Paid Services, with or without prior notice to you.

A.
Payment.

Prices for all Paid Services are in U.S.
dollars and exclude any and all applicable taxes, unless expressly stated otherwise.
To the extent permissible under law, you are responsible for any applicable taxes, whether or not they are listed on your receipt or statement.
All applicable taxes are calculated based on the billing information you provide us at the time of purchase.
If you purchase Paid Services, you agree to pay, using a valid credit or debit card or other form of payment that we may accept from time to time (âPayment Methodâ), the applicable fees and taxes (if any) set forth in the offer that you accepted.
We reserve the right, upon prior notice to you, to change the amount of any fees and to institute new fees, effective at the end of your current subscription period.
All authorized charges will be billed to your designated Payment Method on the terms described in the specific offer.
If payment cannot be charged to your Payment Method or your payment is returned to us for any reason, we reserve the right to either suspend or terminate your access to the unpaid-for Paid Services.
It is your responsibility to ensure that sufficient funds are available to cover the charges for the Paid Services, and we have no liability for any overdraft or other fees that you may incur as a result of our processing of your payment.



B.
Automatic Renewal Program.

Upon your acceptance of an offer for the purchase of any subscription-based Paid Services, you will be enrolled in our automatic renewal program to help ensure that there is no interruption in your access to such Paid Services.
Under this program, you authorize us to automatically renew your subscription at the end of the term of the subscription you purchased, and each subsequent term, for the same term length of the subscription you initially purchased (unless otherwise stated in the offer you accepted).
Unless you change your renewal status as described below, at the time of each such renewal you authorize us to charge your designated Payment Method at the then-current, non-promotional price (unless otherwise stated in the offer you accepted) for the renewal of your subscription.
If you no longer want to be enrolled in our automatic renewal program, you can change your renewal status at any time by completing the following steps:



Classmates.com - logging onto the Account portion of the Classmates.com Website, clicking on "Account &amp.
Billing" and changing your renewal option from "automatic" to "manual."
Intelius.com â logging onto the My Account portion of the Intelius.com Website and click on âcancel my membership.â
USSearch.com - logging onto the Your Account portion of the USSearch.com Website and click on âcancel service.â

Please note that completing these steps will only stop future automatic renewals of your current subscription and will not impact any automatic renewals that occurred prior to the date that you completed these steps.

C.
Current Information.

You must provide us with current, complete and accurate information for your Payment Method.
You must promptly update all information to keep your Payment Method current, complete and accurate (such as a change in billing address, card number or expiration date), and you must promptly notify us if your Payment Method is cancelled (including if you lose your card or it is stolen), or if you become aware of a potential breach of security (such as an unauthorized disclosure or use of your name or password).
Changes to such information can be made by accessing the Account portion of the applicable Website or by contacting the applicable Customer Support.
If you fail to provide us with any of the foregoing information, you agree that you are responsible for fees accrued under your Payment Method.
In addition, you authorize us to obtain updated or replacement expiration dates and card numbers for your credit or debit card as allowed or provided by your credit or debit card issuer.



D.
No Refund Policy.

All fees relating to Paid Services, including the initial fees and any subsequent automatic renewal fees (as described above), are non-refundable.
If you initiate a chargeback or otherwise reverse a payment made with your Payment Method, we may in our discretion cancel your Paid Services immediately.
If we successfully dispute the reversal, and the reversed funds are returned to us, you are not entitled to a refund or to have your Paid Services reinstated.

3.
SPECIAL TERMS THAT APPLY TO CLASSMATES USERS
A.
Classmates Member Conduct - Community Guidelines.

The Classmates Services contain areas that enable members to communicate and share information, including without limitation sending email through the Services, providing information on your profile pages, and posting information on message boards, forums and other areas where you may interact with other members (collectively, the "Communication Tools").
When you use the Communication Tools, you may have the opportunity to disclose, post, upload, or otherwise publicly display, or to share directly with other members, information and other content, including without limitation biographical information, photographs, stories and comments (collectively, "Content").
While we may provide you with these Communications Tools, we also wish to remind you that you should choose carefully what information you post via the Services and share with other members.
You are required to use the Communication Tools responsibly, just as you would act responsibly when communicating or interacting with others in your offline communities.
As a result, we expect and require that you take full responsibility for the Content that you post on or send through the Classmates Services.
We have established some "Community Standards" that outline your responsibilities when using the Communication Tools.

B.
Classmates Member Conduct - Monitoring and Enforcement.

We do not actively monitor the Communication Tools or the Content that is provided through such Communication Tools, nor are we obligated to do so.
Accordingly, we do not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of the Content.
Because individuals sometimes choose not to comply with our policies and practices, you may be exposed to Content that you find offensive or otherwise objectionable.
We encourage you to use the tools available on the Classmates Services to report any Content that you think may violate the Community Standards.
We may investigate the complaints that come to our attention, but are not obligated to do so.
If we choose to investigate, we will take any action that we believe is appropriate in our sole discretion, such as issuing warnings, removing the Content, or suspending or terminating accounts.
However, because situations and interpretations vary, we also reserve the right not to take any action.
In such cases, we may not remove Content that you believe is objectionable.
Please remember that you can always choose to refrain from using any part of the Services that exposes you to something that you are uncomfortable with.
Under no circumstances will we be liable in any way for any Content, including any errors or omissions in any Content or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of, access to or denial of access to any Content.
In addition, we are not responsible for the conduct, whether online or offline, of any user of the Website or member of these Services.



C.
Submitting or Posting Content on Classmates.

We do not claim ownership of any of the Content you submit or post through the Classmates Services or allow us to obtain from third parties to include in the Services.
Instead, you hereby grant us a royalty-free, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, non-exclusive license to use, reproduce, publish, store, distribute, display, communicate, perform, transmit, create derivative works based upon, and promote such Content (in whole or in part) in any medium now known or hereafter devised.
Please remember that you are ultimately responsible for all of your Content, and you therefore warrant and represent that you are entitled to grant the foregoing license and that the Content does not violate any third party rights.
No compensation will be paid for the use of your Content.

MANDATORY ARBITRATION, DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY â IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.
YOU AND THE PEOPLECONNECT ENTITIES EACH AGREE THAT ANY AND ALL DISPUTES THAT HAVE ARISEN OR MAY ARISE BETWEEN YOU AND THE PEOPLECONNECT ENTITIES SHALL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION, RATHER THAN IN COURT, EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY ASSERT CLAIMS IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT, IF YOUR CLAIMS QUALIFY.

You and PeopleConnect and/or its parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, and/or any and all of their respective directors, officers, employees and contractors (each a âPeopleConnect Entityâ and, together, the âPeopleConnect Entitiesâ) agree to arbitrate any and all disputes and claims between them ("Dispute(s)"), except as otherwise specifically provided below.
Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.
Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts.
Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.
This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted.
It includes, but is not limited to: (1) Disputes related in any way to the Services, billing, privacy, advertising or our communications with you.
(2) Disputes arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory.
(3) Disputes that arose before your agreement to these Terms of Services or any prior agreement.
(4) Disputes that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class.
and (5) Disputes that may arise after the termination of your use of the Services.

A.
CONTACT US FIRST.

If you intend to pursue or participate in any Dispute in arbitration or small claims court (solely to the extent specifically provided below), you must first notify us of the dispute in writing at least thirty (30) days in advance of initiating arbitration or the small claims court action (if applicable) and attempt to informally negotiate a resolution to the Dispute in good faith.
Notice to us should be sent via certified mail to: PeopleConnect, Inc., 1501 4th Avenue, Suite 400, Seattle, WA 98101, Attention: Legal Department.
The notice of Dispute must: (a) include your name, address, phone number, and email address(es) used to register with or use the Services.
(b) describe the nature and basis of the Dispute.
(c) enclose and/or identify all relevant documents and/or information.
and (d) set forth the specific relief sought.
If the applicable PeopleConnect Entity and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the notice is received, you may commence with a formal arbitration proceeding or small claims court action (if applicable).



B.
MANDATORY AND BINDING ARBITRATION PROCEDURES


YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY THIS PROVISION, YOU AND THE PEOPLECONNECT ENTITIES ARE FOREGOING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.
THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT GOVERNS THE INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE.



Rules. The arbitration will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ), if applicable, as modified by this section.
The AAAâs rules and a form for initiating the proceeding are available at www.adr.orgor by calling the AAA at 800.778.7879.
The arbitration will be presided over by a single arbitrator selected in accordance with the AAA rules.

Location. Unless otherwise required by the AAA rules, the arbitration shall be held in Seattle, Washington.
You and PeopleConnect may elect to have the arbitration conducted based solely on written submissions, subject to the arbitratorâs discretion to require an in-person hearing.
In cases where an in-person hearing is held, you or the applicable PeopleConnect Entity may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.

Cost Sharing. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAAâs rules, unless otherwise stated in this agreement.
The applicable PeopleConnect Entity will pay as much of the filing, administration and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, unless the arbitrator determines that a Dispute was filed for purposes of harassment or is patently frivolous.
Reasonable documented attorneys' fees of both parties will be borne by the party that ultimately loses.

Arbitratorâs Decision. The arbitrator will decide the substance of the Dispute in accordance with the laws of the state of Washington, regardless of choice of law principles, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law.
The arbitrator will have the power to award a party any relief or remedy that the party could have received in court in accordance with the law(s) that apply to the Dispute.
The arbitratorâs award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.


C.
