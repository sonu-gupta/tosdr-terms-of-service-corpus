Refunds are discretionary and a decision will be made on a case by case basis.
All requests for a refund will be considered on their merits that you submit all relevant information, such as your user credentials when making your request.
Requests for refunds should be sent as a logged enquiry to the Support Team either through the Support Chat Interface, or any of the administrative emails provided in the Contact Us section.
We will endeavor to deal with refund requests within 7 to 10 business days.

Where you have terminated your agreement with us, the particular provisions relating to your liability on termination will apply.
We are unable to refund money used in submitted and decoded CAPTCHAs.
Once any CAPTCHA is submitted and solved, that sale is final and is non refundable.
However, if you feel your request deserves an exception you may send your request through the aforementioned protocol and our management team will revise it to make a fair decision.

*Disclaimer*: No refunds will be made for orders more than 30 days old.
