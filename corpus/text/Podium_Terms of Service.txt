FEES AND PAYMENT.

 7.1.
Fees. Unless otherwise specified on the applicable Subscription Documentation, the Services are provided on an ongoing, per license subscription-basis including automatically recurring payments for periodic charges, according to the terms and conditions referenced in the Subscription Documentation ("Subscription").
Client agrees to pay to Podium the fees for the Subscription to the Services or any Bundle ("Subscription Fees") and any additional fees (if applicable), all as set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation (collectively, the "Fees").
Except as otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription documentation, unless Client terminates a Free Access Subscription prior to the lapse of the Free Access Subscription term, such Services will convert to a paid Subscription and Client agrees to pay Podium the applicable Subscription Fees according to the terms of this Agreement.
Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, payment for all Fees is due within thirty (30) days of the invoice date.

 7.2.
Payment of Fees. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, all Subscription Fees will be paid annually in advance, though overage fees (if any) may be charged in arrears, and all references to currency set forth herein will mean U.S.
dollars, with all payments hereunder to be made in U.S.
dollars.
Subscription Fees are non-refundable and non-creditable, except as expressly set forth in Sections 2.3 (Modification of the Services) and 8.3 (Termination for Cause).
If the payment method selected on the applicable Subscription Documentation is credit card, ACH, or direct debit, Client authorizes Podium to charge the Subscription Fees automatically, on an auto-renew basis on your Subscription Start Date (as defined below) for each subsequent Subscription Term.
For the avoidance of doubt, all additional Subscription Fees for additional Services accessed by Client will be billed when the Service is first accessed by Client and automatically, on an auto-review basis on Clientâs existing Subscription Start Date.
The Subscription will continue unless and until you or Podium terminate your Subscription in accordance with Section 8.
You must cancel your Subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next periodic Subscription Fees to your account.
If Client elects to pay by credit card, then you are responsible for both (a) enabling auto-recharge on your account and (b) ensuring that your account has a sufficient positive balance to cover all Fees when due.
Should Podium be unable to process/receive the Fees when due and owing, payment shall be considered overdue.
Podium shall have the right to charge interest on all overdue amounts at the annual rate of 12%, compounded monthly, or the maximum lawful amounts, whichever is less.
Additionally, after payment becomes overdue, Podium shall have the right to immediately suspend Clientâs access to the Services and/or seek to enforce Clientâs payment obligations including through the use of third-party services.

 7.3.
Taxes. Podiumâs Fees are exclusive of all taxes, and Client must pay any applicable taxes or levies, whether domestic or foreign, other than taxes based on the income of Podium.
Client will make tax payments to Podium to the extent amounts are included on Podiumâs invoices.

 7.4.
Annual Fee Increase. Podium reserves the right to increase Fees for any Services, upon sixty (60) daysâ prior written notice, effective on the start date of your subsequent Subscription Term.

8.
TERM AND TERMINATION.

Term. This Agreement is effective until the applicable Subscription Term for the Services has expired or the Subscription is terminated as expressly permitted herein.
Unless otherwise stated in Clientâs Subscription Documentation, the initial term for any Subscription to the Services is twelve (12) months and will automatically renew for subsequent periods of equal duration (the "Subscription Term"), unless either party gives written notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days before the end of the then-current Subscription Term.
Client may give notice of non-renewal by sending an email to support@podium.com.
If no Subscription start date is specified on the applicable Subscription Documentation, the Subscription starts when Client first obtains access to the Services ("Subscription Start Date").
By agreeing to any Subscription Documentation, Client is agreeing to pay applicable fees for the entire Subscription Term.
Client cannot cancel or terminate a Subscription Term except as expressly permitted by Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause).

 8.2.
Suspension of Services.
Podium may suspend Clientâs access to the Services if: (a) Clientâs account is overdue or (b) Client has exceeded its Scope of Use limits.
Podium may also suspend Clientâs access to the Services, remove Client Data or disable Third-Party Products if it determines that: (i) Client has breached Sections 3 (Use Rights.
Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations).
or (ii) suspension is necessary to prevent harm or liability to other Clients or third parties or to preserve the security, stability, availability or integrity of the Services.
Podium will have no liability for taking action as permitted above.
For avoidance of doubt, Client will remain responsible for payment of Fees during any suspension period.
Unless this Agreement has been terminated, Podium will cooperate with Client to restore access to the Services once it verifies that Client has resolved the condition requiring suspension.

 8.3.
Termination for Cause.
Either party may terminate this Agreement, including any related Subscription Documentation, if the other party: (a) fails to cure any material breach of this Agreement (including a failure to pay fees) within thirty (30) days after written notice detailing the breach.
(b) ceases operation without a successor.
or (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditorsâ arrangement, composition or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against that party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter).
If Client terminates during the Subscription Term for any reason other than the foregoing, Client will be responsible for the Fees due for the entire Subscription Term.
Podium may also terminate this Agreement or any related Subscription Documentation immediately if Client breaches Sections 3 (Use Rights.
Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations), for repeated violations of other Sections of this Agreement, or if applicable, a breach of the partiesâ BAA.

 8.4.
Effect of Termination.
Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement or any Subscription Documentation: (a) Clientâs license rights will terminate and it must immediately cease use of the Services (including any related Podium Technology) and delete (or, at Podiumâs request, return) any and all copies of any Podium documentation, scripts, passwords or access codes and any other Podium Confidential Information in Clientâs possession, custody or control and (b) Clientâs right to access any Client Data in the applicable Services will cease, and unless otherwise precluded by a BAA, Podium may delete any such data in its possession at any time.
If Podium terminates this Agreement for cause as provided in Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause), any payments for the remaining portion of the Subscription Term will become due and must be paid immediately by Client.
Except where this Agreement specifies an exclusive remedy, all remedies under this Agreement, including termination or suspension, are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights or remedies that may be available to a party.

and (b) use the other partyâs Confidential Information only as necessary to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights under this Agreement.
Each party may share the other partyâs Confidential Information with its employees, agents, contractors or subcontractors having a legitimate need to know (which, for Podium, includes the subcontractors referenced in Section 16.4), provided that such party remains responsible for any recipientâs compliance with the terms of this Section 9 and these recipients are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective than this Section.

 9.2.

 9.3.
Remedies.
The parties acknowledge that disclosure of Confidential Information may cause substantial harm for which damages alone may be an insufficient remedy, and so upon breach of this Section each party is entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to any other remedies it may have at law.
