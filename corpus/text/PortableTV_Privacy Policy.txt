Using Monitoring Tools: Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website.
We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called âtracking pixelsâ or âclear gifsâ) to better tailor the Site in order to provide a better service.
These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Site.
These technologies usually work in conjunction with cookies.

We use IP Addresses for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, and administering the Site.

Social Media Plug-Ins: We use social media plug-ins from social media networks like Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter, which are labeled on our Site with the well-known symbols of the respective social network.

5.
INTEREST BASED ADVERTISING.

We may collect information about your online activities on our Site and when you interact with our email advertisements.
We use this information to provide you with advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests.
We also may obtain information for this purpose from third-party websites on which our ads are served.
In addition, we work with third party service providers who use their own automated information collection and tracking technologies on our Site.
This section of our Notice provides details and explains how to exercise your choices.


You may see certain ads on other websites because we work with advertising partners (including advertising networks) to engage in remarketing and retargeting activities.
Our advertising partners allow us to target our messaging to users through demographic, interest-based and contextual means.
These partners track your online activities over time and across websites by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of third-party cookies, web server logs, and web beacons.
They use this information to show you advertisements that may be tailored to your individual interests.
The information our advertising partners may collect includes data about your visits to websites that participate in the relevant advertising networks, such as the pages or advertisements you view and the actions you take on the websites.
This data collection takes place both on our Site and on third-party websites that participate in the ad networks, as well as when you interact with our email advertisements.
This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.
For example, we utilize certain of our ad partnersâ targeted advertising services to show you our ads on other websites based on your prior visits to our Site and other online activity.

Provided that a company participates in industry-developed programs designed to provide consumers choices about whether to receive targeted advertising, you may opt out of ad network interest-based advertising generally through the Network Advertising Initiative website or by visiting http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ (web-based advertising) or http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices (for mobile advertising).
To learn more, please visit the websites operated by the Network Advertising Initiative and Digital Advertising Alliance at www.networkadvertising.org/choices.
Opting-out does not mean that you will stop receiving ads from us.
It means that you still stop receiving ads from us that have been targeted to you based on your visits and browsing activity across websites over time.

6.
Social Media.

Some aspects of the Site may allow you to interface with other websites, social media, and other online services, such as Facebook and Twitter.
We will diligently work to identify these aspects of the Site to you, for example, by identifying them with the applicable third party logos or trade names.
By using these interfaces, you will allow us to access information about you from those other online services, including information and other content that you submit to those online services.
These interfaces may also allow the social media or other service to automatically collect information about you, such as browser information and IP address.
If you interface with the Site through your social media account, we may contact you or enable you to share your experience and content via your social media account, which information may be publicly viewed by other users of those services.
For a description on how such social media services and other third-party platforms, plug-ins, integrations, and applications handle your information, please refer to their respective privacy policies and terms of use, which may permit you to modify your privacy settings with that service or platform.

7.
SECURITY.

We take what we believe to be reasonable steps to protect the Personal Information collected by us from loss, misuse, unauthorized use, access, inadvertent disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
However, no network, server, database, or Internet or e-mail transmission is ever fully secure, error-free, or âhacker proof.â Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you provide to us.
Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Information.

DATA RETENTION.

We generally retain Personal Information for so long as it may be relevant to the purposes above, or for longer when required by law.
