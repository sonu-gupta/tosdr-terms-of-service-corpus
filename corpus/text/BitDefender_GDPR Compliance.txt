 Protection against data loss â lost/stolen device 
Key facts:

 According to Verizonâs 2016 Data Breach Investigation Report (DBIR), there were 554 million data losses records in the first half of 2016, alone.
The same report also revealed that this type of data breach is common for healthcare organizations, making up almost half (45%) of healthcare data breaches with many data losses resulted from lost or stolen devices.





Bitdefenderâs response: GravityZone Full-Disk Encryption

 GravityZone Full Disk Encryption is leveraging the encryption mechanisms provided by Windows (BitLocker) and Mac (FileVault), taking advantage of the native device encryption, to ensure compatibility and performance.
There will be no additional agent to deploy and no key management server to install.
The solution provides: 
 There will be no additional agent to deploy and no key management server to install.

The solution provides:

 Encryption management from the same cloud or on premise console used for endpoint protection 
 Native encryption for Windows (BitLocker) and Mac (FileVault), avoiding performance issues with no new agent required 
 Simple deployment of Full Disk Encryption to endpoints and management of restore keys from the console 
Encryption specific reports that help companies demonstrate compliance 
Pre-boot authentication enforcement 
 Hyperdetect 
It offers prevention at pre-execution
It leverages machine learning + advanced heuristics
It stops sophisticated threats (PowerShell, file-less attacks, shelter attacks, unknown ransomware)
It provides maximum detection accuracy without false positives
It offers Flexible settings to optimize aggressive protection with low false positives
It delivers full visibility into suspicious activities 
 Sandbox Analyzer 
It offers automatic submission of suspicious files from endpoints for sandbox analysis
It provides Options to blocking or monitoring mode 
verdict in real-time
It provides Insight into behavior of unknown files
It assures enterprise-wide protection
 Anti-exploit 
It protects commonly used Microsoft and third-party applications 
It focuses on attack tools and techniques
It serves as an additional layer of security for unpatched known and zero-day vulnerabilities
It works out of the box and designed for precision
 Application Control 
It validates applications that run on the end-point
It helps stopping ransomware, advanced targeted attacks or zero day malware
 â¹âº Sandbox Analyzer 
Key facts:
 According to the same Verizon report, there were 1,616 social attacks in 2016, approximately half (828) of which with confirmed data disclosure.
In 95 percent of cases, attackers followed up a successful phish with software installation.
Thatâs to be expected given most social attackersâ motivations and targets.
Two-thirds of these actors chase after financial gain, whereas another third is in it for conducting espionage.
Both these motivations involve the theft of credentials, personal information, and trade secrets.

 Bitdefenderâs layered next-gen endpoint protection platform is designed and built from ground up to protect against elusive, advanced targeted attacks.
Several layers of security provide protection both at the pre-execution (Hyperdetect, Sandbox Analyzer), on-execution (Advanced Anti-exploit and Application Control), as well as a breakthrough technology for datacenter specific protection (HVI- Hypervisor Introspection).
 Enhanced visibility on data breaches 
Key facts:
 According to a study carried out in 2017 by Ponemon Institute on the cost of data breaches, the results showed that the average time to identify a data breach is 191 days and the average time to contain the breach is 66 days.
In the case of Equifax, the data breach occurred from mid-May to July 2017, was discovered at the end of July and was publicly disclosed in early September.


Bitdefenderâs response

 Visibility is key to tackle inside threats and data breaches.
If discovered early enough, the efforts and related costs required to respond and mitigate internal threats resulted from data breaches could be substantially reduced.

Bitdefenderâs layered next-gen endpoint protection platform was built from ground up based on the principle of adaptive security, which means that apart from the prediction, prevention and detection technologies, the security suite also includes dedicated visibility tools such as Endpoint Security HD Insight and Security Analytics for EDR  Endpoint Security HD Insight 
It allows for remote detonation (Sandbox)
It provides better context on threats
It connects threats with threat actions
It offers enhanced endpoint optics for future analysis and further actions 
It exposes suspicious threats (HD reports)
 EDR Security Analytics 
Events correlation and analytics automate detection and offer clear visibility into suspicious activity and indicators of compromise
High fidelity detection and alert triage enables security resources to focus on real threats
Incident visualization, threat investigation instruments and incident response workflows
 â¹âº Synopsis  GDPR has become a reality and soon enough all companies will need to implement the necessary steps to become compliant.
The process itself is complex and it involves several steps such as an assessment and gap analysis of the data privacy maturity, a detailed roadmap to address the new legislative requirements, a comprehensive map for security testing, audit and process evaluation and a continuous communication loop for constant compliance and improvement.

 However, in the center of all these initiatives, companies will need to invest in technology as the main facilitator to achieve compliance.
GDPR is talking about defining the state-of-the-art technology attributes for managing structured and unstructured data with a strong focus on data protection and privacy.

 Through its integrated, layered next-gen security solution, Bitdefender is perfectly positioned to help companies becoming compliant by offering a set of technologies that seamlessly respond to the most rigorous GDPR requirements.
