Introduction 
VarageSale, Inc.
("VarageSale"/"we"/"us"/"our") owns and operates the VarageSale website located at http://www.varagesale.com ("Site") and the VarageSale mobile applications available for download via various platforms ("Apps"), collectively referred to as the "VarageSale Platform".
The VarageSale Platform is a conduit for registered users ("Members") to buy and sell goods.
Our Terms of Service ("Terms"), privacy policy and user policies including our Prohibited Item List ("Policies") are designed to create a fair, friendly and safe environment for all Members.
Being informed on what is permitted on the VarageSale Platform can help you avoid unintentionally breaking the rules and helps create a community full of trustworthy Members.

Please read these Terms carefully as they govern our relationship with our Members and your use of the VarageSale Platform.
By using the VarageSale Platform, Members are agreeing to our Terms and Policies, which may be updated from time to time at our sole discretion.
VarageSale has created the Terms and Policies so that all Members follow the same basic rules of conduct.
These Terms and Policies are here to benefit and protect everyone.
Capitalized terms not defined in the body of these Terms are defined in Section 15.

 2.
What is VarageSale? 

The VarageSale Platform is an online marketplace used by "Communities" or groups comprised of Members who share common interests and/or a geographical location.


Communities are managed and moderated directly by Community administrators and moderators and/or by VarageSale (see further: Section 3 below).


Each Community may have specific rules that are not created by VarageSale and are not reviewed or controlled by VarageSale.
However, if there is any discrepancy between specific rules in a Community and these Terms, these Terms will govern in all matters.
If you are concerned about any specific rules in a Community, you may contact VarageSale to seek clarifications.
Our contact information is at the end of these Terms.



 3.
Community Management An "Administrator" is someone who creates a Community on the VarageSale Platform and/or is given the role of administrator for a Community.
Administrators are in charge of the success of a Community by keeping Members happy and involved, by promoting the Community and by encouraging the good behaviour of its Members.
A "Moderator" is someone who was generally given this title by a Community Administrator.
Their primary role is to help Administrators maintain and promote the Community.
Administrators and Moderators, jointly named "Community Managers" or "Managers", have access to additional features of the VarageSale Platform which enable them to monitor and better manage their Community.
The ideal Community Manager is friendly, compassionate, motivational and quick to answer its Members.
Such an approach has proven time and time again to be extremely effective at fostering healthy and thriving communities.
The Community Manager's role is also foster strong, tight knit, happy communities.
From time to time this role may including helping to privately mediate conflict between Members in a peaceful and impartial manner.
Their ultimate goal should be to have happy and satisfied Members who will participate in their community while encouraging others to do so.
To this effect, we insist that Community Managers treat their Community Members with the utmost respect.
Although Community Managers may act voluntarily as mediators, they have no legal obligation and assume no liability for resolving conflicts among Members.
Community Managers should accept people requesting to join their Community in a timely fashion to ensure a smooth and easy transition into the Community.
Managers of local communities may, at their own discretion, opt to only allow people within a reasonable distance of the Community epi-centre, a location which is determined by the Community Managers, to join but may not unreasonably prevent access to people who frequently visit the Community area.
Community Managers may also occasionally and with serious cause restrict access to people committing a serious offence on the VarageSale Platform, such as but not limited to, breaches of these Terms or House Rules (as defined further below), selling stolen or counterfeit goods or other items on the Prohibited Items list.
Community Managers may not restrict access to VarageSale for reasons other than their behaviour on the VarageSale Platform such as but not limited to their personal relationship with the member, their actions and status on another social network or their method of signup.
Community Managers may optionally implement "House Rules" as long as they are reasonable and do not prevent Members from benefiting fully from the VarageSale Platform.
Community Managers may also not restrict Members from using certain features of the VarageSale Platform, force Members to use features in ways they were not intended or limit the frequency of their actions (such as posting) other than with the help of the tools provided by the VarageSale Platform.
Additionally, Community Managers may not charge their Members any kind of fee to use VarageSale.
Community Managers may remove content they deem inappropriate, illegal or against VarageSale's Terms.
They may not, however, remove Items because of how long they have been listed for, the level of or the status or past behaviour of that member in the community.
VarageSale reserves the right but shall have no obligation to monitor and/or override any House Rules or decisions made by Community Managers that do not adhere to the letter or spirit of the Terms or any other Policies that are referenced herein.
VarageSale reserves the right to revoke a Community Manager from the VarageSale Platform for breach of the VarageSale Terms of Service or for the making, publishing, ratifying or endorsing of any disparaging remarks including but not limited to defamatory or malicious content against or about VarageSale, its employees and/or its members.

 4.
Rules for Buying and Selling VarageSale is not involved in the actual transactions between Members - sellers or buyers.
For further clarity:


All agreements made for the exchange or purchase of goods or services are made directly between Members.
The VarageSale Platform is a marketplace in which the communication between sellers and buyers takes place.


VarageSale does not pre-screen or vet the products or services offered by sellers through the site.

In other words â buyer beware.

Sellers must be legally able to sell the Item(s) posted for sale.

Members may elect to inform Community Managers of disputes.
Community Managers and/or VarageSale may at their own discretion endeavour to assist where possible in the resolution of member disputes.
VarageSale may be called upon via email at http://contact.varagesale.com to assist in resolution of disputes.
VarageSale will, at its own discretion, endeavour to help resolve disputes as an informal mediator based on its experience working with the membership, however responsibility for resolution of disputes remains solely with buyers and sellers.


VarageSale has a no tolerance policy for breach of its Terms and Policies including but not limited to if a member is reported or found to be selling Prohibited Items, VarageSale reserves the right to remove the item and/or, subject to the severity of the breach, the member from VarageSale.


The VarageSale Platform is used for the posting of Items for sale by third parties and we do not advertise or sell our own products or services through the VarageSale Platform.

Prohibited Items VarageSale prohibits the sale of a number of items, such as firearms, regulated products and services and illegal goods and services.

It is up to Members to ensure that they are not posting any goods or services that are illegal in their jurisdictions.
This list is updated from time to time and is the part of VarageSale's Terms and Policies.
VarageSale may, at its sole discretion and without notice, remove any item, content or information that it views as being a Prohibited Item.
Community Managers also have authority within their community/communities to remove Prohibited Items without notice.
Members may report any Prohibited Items they see posted via email at http://contact.varagesale.com.
