 Online demo Cookie Policy Last modified: May 16, 2018
This cookie policy (âCookie Policyâ) describes the use of Cookies (as defined below) by AlienVault, Inc.
and its respective subsidiaries (âAlienVault,â âwe,â âus,â or âour,â if not explicitly referring to one company).
Please remember that your use of the Sites is at all times subject to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which incorporates this Cookie Policy.
Any terms we use in this Cookie Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. HOW ALIENVAULT USES COOKIES The Sites use cookies and similar technologies such as pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs, JavaScript, and local storage.
Cookies are small files â usually consisting of letters and numbers â placed on Your Device, when you use that device to visit a Site.
We will refer to cookies and similar technologies simply as âCookiesâ for the remainder of this Cookie Policy.
We use Cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you visit and otherwise use the Sites through the internet, to analyze trends, and to learn about our user base.
We may combine non-personally identifiable information collected through Cookies with other Personal Information that we have about you, for example, to tell us who you are or whether you have an account.
We may also supplement the information we collect from you with information received from third parties in order to enhance our Sites, or to offer you information that we believe may be of interest to you.
Where we use Cookies to collect information that is personally identifiable, or that can become personally identifiable if we combine it with other information, the AlienVault Privacy Policy will apply in addition to this Cookie Policy.
You can control and/or delete Cookies as you wish â for details, see www.aboutcookies.org.
Most browsers have an option for turning off the Cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new Cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways.
You can delete all Cookies that are already on your computer and you can set most browsers to prevent them from being placed.
If you do this, however, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit a site and some services and functionalities may not work.
We strongly recommend that you leave Cookies active, because they enable you to take advantage of the most attractive features of the Sites.
Further information on Cookies can be found at http://ec.europa.eu/ipg/basics/legal/cookies/index_en.htm
Please reference the chart and general description below to learn more about the kinds of cookies we use and for what purpose. WHAT TYPES OF COOKIES DO WE USE AND FOR WHICH PURPOSES? 
Essential Cookies are Cookies that are required to provide you with features or services that you have requested.
For example, Cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our Site or use a shopping cart.
Disabling these Cookies will encumber the Sitesâ performance and may make certain features and services unavailable.

Functionality Cookies are used to recognize you when you return to our Sites.

This includes information about the number of visitors to the site, what pages visitors view on our site and how long visitors are viewing pages on the site.
Analytical Cookies also help us measure the performance of our advertising campaigns in order to help us improve our advertising campaigns and to optimize our Sitesâ content for those who engage with our advertising.

Third Party Cookies are Cookies placed by a third party on Your Device and may provide information to those third parties about browsing habits (including your visits to our Sites, the pages you have visited, and the links and advertisements you have clicked) that may help identify if certain services that such third parties provide are being used, identify your interests, retarget you, and serve advertisements that are relevant to you.

We use Persistent Cookies to store your preferences so that they are available for the next visit, and to keep a more accurate account of how often you visit our Sites, how often you return, how your use of the Sites may vary over time, and measure the effectiveness of advertising efforts.
Your browser may offer you a âDo Not Trackâ option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites.
