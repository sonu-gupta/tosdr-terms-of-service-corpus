Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognizes that cookie.
A pixel tag (also called a web beacon or clear GIF) is a tiny graphic with a unique identifier, embedded invisibly on a webpage (or an online ad or email) that links web pages to particular web servers and their cookies, and may be used for a variety of purposes, such as counting the number of visitors to the Sites, analyzing how users navigate around the Sites, assessing what content or ads are viewed or clicked on by our visitors.
Some ad companies and game developers use â flash cookiesâ for ads and games that use Flash media technology.
We use the term âcookiesâ in this policy to refer to cookies and all such similar technologies.

Cookies are widely used in order to make websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site.
