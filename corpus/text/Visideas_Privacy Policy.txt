Cookies

The Shield Security plugin never stores any sensitive, personally identifiable information in any cookie at any time.
In the case that the Shield Security plugin needs to redirect a visitor or any request, it may use a cookie to prevent repeated/infinite redirect loops.
For registered/logged-in users, the Shield Security plugin uses a cookie to track user sessions and control display of certain in-plugin admin notices.
The Shield Security plugin does not normally use Cookies for unregistered site visitors.
It may however use a cookie to register the closure of the Shield Security security badge to prevent repeated display.

Data Storage: User Sessions
For logged-in users, the Shield Security plugin stores information on the username, the IP address and the time of last login and last activity.
This information is purged upon logout or data cleanup.
Data Storage: Audit Trail
The Shield Security plugin has an Audit Trail feature that will log the following information:

Audit Trail message that may include email addresses
Logged-in username (where applicable)
Originating IP address of the request

For logged-in users this represents information that may be used to locate (by IP address) and identify individuals and their activity on the site.
This information is stored for security purposes by the site administrator.
This data will be retained and then automatically purged from the database after a fixed time period, as determined by the site administrator.
(Currently this is set to 14 days.)
Caching
This site utilizes caching in order to facilitate a faster response time and better user experience.
Caching potentially stores a duplicate copy of every web page that is on display on this site.
All cache files are temporary, and are never accessed by any third party, except as necessary to obtain technical support from the cache plugin vendor.
Cache files expire on a schedule set by the site administrator, but may easily be purged by the admin before their natural expiration, if necessary.
