BETWEEN &nbsp.
(1) Customer.
and   (2) Qualtrics.
&nbsp.


BACKGROUND


Purpose and Application. This document is incorporated into the Agreement and forms part of a written (including in electronic form) contract between Qualtrics and Customer.
This DPA applies to Personal Data processed by Qualtrics and its Subprocessors in connection with its provision of the Cloud Service.
This DPA does not apply to non-production environments of the Cloud Service if such environments are made available by Qualtrics, and Customer shall not store Personal Data in such environments.

Structure. Appendices 1 and 2 are incorporated into and form part of this DPA.
They set out the agreed subject-matter, the nature and purpose of the processing, the type of Personal Data, categories of data subjects and the applicable technical and organizational measures.

GDPR. Qualtrics and Customer agree that it is each partyâs responsibility to review and adopt requirements imposed on Controllers and Processors by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (âGDPRâ), in particular with regards to Articles 28 and 32 to 36 of the GDPR, if and to the extent applicable to Personal Data of Customer/Controllers that is processed under the DPA.
For illustration purposes, Appendix 3 lists the relevant GDPR requirements and the corresponding sections in this DPA.

Governance. Qualtrics acts as a Processor and Customer and those entities that it permits to use the Cloud Service act as Controllers under the DPA.
Customer acts as a single point of contact and is solely responsible for obtaining any relevant authorizations, consents and permissions for the processing of Personal Data in accordance with this DPA, including, where applicable approval by Controllers to use Qualtrics as a Processor.
Where authorizations, consent, instructions or permissions are provided by Customer these are provided not only on behalf of the Customer but also on behalf of any other Controller using the Cloud Service.
Where Qualtrics informs or gives notice to Customer, such information or notice is deemed received by those Controllers permitted by Customer to use the Cloud Service and it is Customerâs responsibility to forward such information and notices to the relevant Controllers.



SECURITY OF PROCESSING


Appropriate Technical and Organizational Measures. Qualtrics has implemented and will apply the technical and organizational measures set forth in Appendix 2.
Customer has reviewed such measures and agrees that as to the Cloud Service selected by Customer in the Order Form the measures are appropriate taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing of Personal Data.

Changes. Qualtrics applies the technical and organizational measures set forth in Appendix 2 to Qualtricsâ entire customer base hosted out of the same Data Center and receiving the same Cloud Service.
Qualtrics may change the measures set out in Appendix 2 at any time without notice so long as it maintains a comparable or better level of security.
Individual measures may be replaced by new measures that serve the same purpose without diminishing the security level protecting Personal Data.



QUALTRICS OBLIGATIONS


Instructions from Customer. Qualtrics will process Personal Data only in accordance with documented instructions from Customer.
The Agreement (including this DPA) constitutes such documented initial instructions and each use of the Cloud Service then constitutes further instructions.
Qualtrics will use reasonable efforts to follow any other Customer instructions, as long as they are required by Data Protection Law, technically feasible and do not require changes to the Cloud Service.
If any of the before-mentioned exceptions apply, or Qualtrics otherwise cannot comply with an instruction or is of the opinion that an instruction infringes Data Protection Law, Qualtrics will immediately notify Customer (email permitted).

Processing on Legal Requirement. Qualtrics may also process Personal Data where required to do so by applicable law.
In such a case, Qualtrics shall inform Customer of that legal requirement before processing unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest.

Personnel. To process Personal Data, Qualtrics and its Subprocessors shall only grant access to authorized personnel who have committed themselves to confidentiality.
Qualtrics and its Subprocessors will regularly train personnel having access to Personal Data in applicable data security and data privacy measures.

Cooperation. At Customerâs request, Qualtrics will reasonably cooperate with Customer and Controllers in dealing with requests from Data Subjects or regulatory authorities regarding Qualtricsâ processing of Personal Data or any Personal Data Breach.
Qualtrics shall notify the Customer as soon as reasonably practical about any request it has received from a Data Subject in relation to the Personal Data processing, without itself responding to such request without Customerâs further instructions, if applicable.
Qualtrics shall provide functionality that supports Customerâs ability to correct or remove Personal Data from the Cloud Service, or restrict its processing in line with Data Protection Law.
Where such functionality is not provided, Qualtrics will correct or remove any Personal Data, or restrict its processing, in accordance with the Customerâs instruction and Data Protection Law.

Personal Data Breach Notification. Qualtrics will notify Customer without undue delay after becoming aware of any Personal Data Breach and provide reasonable information in its possession to assist Customer to meet Customerâs obligations to report a Personal Data Breach as required under Data Protection Law.
Qualtrics may provide such information in phases as it becomes available.
Such notification shall not be interpreted or construed as an admission of fault or liability by Qualtrics.

Data Protection Impact Assessment. If, pursuant to Data Protection Law, Customer (or its Controllers) are required to perform a data protection impact assessment or prior consultation with a regulator, at Customerâs request, Qualtrics will provide such documents as are generally available for the Cloud Service (for example, this DPA, the Agreement, audit reports or certifications).
Any additional assistance shall be mutually agreed between the Parties.



DATA EXPORT AND DELETION


Export and Retrieval by Customer. During the Subscription Term and subject to the Agreement, Customer can access its Personal Data at any time.
Customer may export and retrieve its Personal Data in a standard format.
Export and retrieval may be subject to technical limitations, in which case Qualtrics and Customer will find a reasonable method to allow Customer access to Personal Data.

Deletion. Before the Subscription Term expires, Customer may use Qualtricsâ self-service export tools (as available) to perform a final export of Personal Data from the Cloud Service (which shall constitute a âreturnâ of Personal Data).
At the end of the Subscription Term, Customer hereby instructs Qualtrics to delete the Personal Data remaining on servers hosting the Cloud Service within a reasonable time period in line with Data Protection Law (not to exceed six months) unless applicable law requires retention.



CERTIFICATIONS AND AUDITS


Customer Audit. Customer or its independent third party auditor reasonably acceptable to Qualtrics (which shall not include any third party auditors who are either a competitor of Qualtrics or not suitably qualified or independent) may audit Qualtricsâ control environment and security practices relevant to Personal Data processed by Qualtrics only if:

Qualtrics has not provided sufficient evidence of its compliance with the technical and organizational measures that protect the production systems of the Cloud Service through providing either: (i) a certification as to compliance with ISO 27001 or other standards (scope as defined in the certificate).
or (ii) a valid ISAE3402 and/or ISAE3000 or other SOC1-3 attestation report.
Upon Customerâs request audit reports or ISO certifications are available through the third party auditor or Qualtrics;
A Personal Data Breach has occurred;
An audit is formally requested by Customerâs data protection authority.
or
Mandatory Data Protection Law provides Customer with a direct audit right and provided that Customer shall only audit once in any twelve month period unless mandatory Data Protection Law requires more frequent audits.



Other Controller Audit. Any other Controller may audit Qualtricsâ control environment and security practices relevant to Personal Data processed by Qualtrics in line with Section 5.1 only if any of the cases set out in Section 5.1 applies to such other Controller.
Such audit must be undertaken through and by Customer as set out in Section 5.1 unless the audit must be undertaken by the other Controller itself under Data Protection Law.
If several Controllers whose Personal Data is processed by Qualtrics on the basis of the Agreement require an audit, Customer shall use all reasonable means to combine the audits and to avoid multiple audits.

Scope of Audit. Customer shall provide at least sixty days advance notice of any audit unless mandatory Data Protection Law or a competent data protection authority requires shorter notice.
The frequency and scope of any audits shall be mutually agreed between the parties acting reasonably and in good faith.
Customer audits shall be limited in time to a maximum of three business days.
Beyond such restrictions, the parties will use current certifications or other audit reports to avoid or minimize repetitive audits.
Customer shall provide the results of any audit to Qualtrics.

Cost of Audits. Customer shall bear the costs of any audit unless such audit reveals a material breach by Qualtrics of this DPA, then Qualtrics shall bear its own expenses of an audit.
If an audit determines that Qualtrics has breached its obligations under the DPA, Qualtrics will promptly remedy the breach at its own cost.



SUBPROCESSORS


Permitted Use. Qualtrics is granted a general authorization to subcontract the processing of Personal Data to Subprocessors, provided that:

Qualtrics shall engage Subprocessors under a written (including in electronic form) contract consistent with the terms of this DPA in relation to the Subprocessorâs processing of Personal Data.
Qualtrics shall be liable for any breaches by the Subprocessor in accordance with the terms of this Agreement;
Qualtrics will evaluate the security, privacy and confidentiality practices of a Subprocessor prior to selection to establish that it is capable of providing the level of protection of Personal Data required by this DPA.
and
Qualtricsâ list of Subprocessors in place on the effective date of the Agreement is published by Qualtrics or Qualtrics will make it available to Customer, upon request including the name, address and role of each Subprocessor Qualtrics uses to provide the Cloud Service.



New Subprocessors. Qualtricsâ use of Subprocessors is at its discretion, provided that:

Qualtrics will inform Customer in advance (by email or by posting within the Cloud Service) of any intended additions or replacements to the list of Subprocessors including name, address and role of the new Subprocessor.
and
Customer may object to such changes as set out in Section 6.3



Objections to New Subprocessors.

If Customer has a legitimate reason under Data Protection Law to object to the new Subprocessorsâ processing of Personal Data, Customer may terminate the Agreement (limited to the Cloud Service for which the new Subprocessor is intended to be used) on written notice to Qualtrics.
Such termination shall take effect at the time determined by the Customer which shall be no later than thirty days from the date of Qualtricsâ notice to Customer informing Customer of the new Subprocessor.
If Customer does not terminate within this thirty day period, Customer is deemed to have accepted the new Subprocessor.
Within the thirty day period from the date of Qualtricsâ notice to Customer informing Customer of the new Subprocessor, Customer may request that the parties come together in good faith to discuss a resolution to the objection.
Such discussions shall not extend the period for termination and do not affect Qualtricsâ right to use the new Subprocessor(s) after the thirty day period.
Any termination under this Section 6.3 shall be deemed to be without fault by either party and shall be subject to the terms of the Agreement.



Emergency Replacement. Qualtrics may replace a Subprocessor without advance notice where the reason for the change is outside of Qualtricsâ reasonable control and prompt replacement is required for security or other urgent reasons.
In this case, Qualtrics will inform Customer of the replacement Subprocessor as soon as possible following its appointment.
Section 6.3 applies accordingly.

Appendix 2 to the DPA and, if applicable, the Standard Contractual Clauses â Technical and Organizational Measures


TECHNICAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL MEASURES
The following sections define Qualtricsâ current technical and organizational measures.
Qualtrics may change these at any time without notice so long as it maintains a comparable or better level of security.
Individual measures may be replaced by new measures that serve the same purpose without diminishing the security level protecting Personal Data.


Physical Access Control.
Unauthorized persons are prevented from gaining physical access to premises, buildings or rooms where data processing systems that process and/or use Personal Data are located.
Measures:

Qualtrics protects its assets and facilities using the appropriate means based on the Qualtrics Security Policy
In general, buildings are secured through access control systems (e.g., smart card access system).
As a minimum requirement, the outermost entrance points of the building must be fitted with a certified key system including modern, active key management.
Depending on the security classification, buildings, individual areas and surrounding premises may be further protected by additional measures.
These include specific access profiles, video surveillance, intruder alarm systems and biometric access control systems.
Access rights are granted to authorized persons on an individual basis according to the System and Data Access Control measures (see Section 1.2 and 1.3 below).
This also applies to visitor access.
Guests and visitors to Qualtrics buildings must register their names at reception and must be accompanied by authorized Qualtrics personnel.
Qualtrics employees and external personnel must wear their ID cards at all Qualtrics locations.

Additional measures for Data Centers:

All Data Centers adhere to strict security procedures enforced by guards, surveillance cameras, motion detectors, access control mechanisms and other measures to prevent equipment and Data Center facilities from being compromised.
Only authorized representatives have access to systems and infrastructure within the Data Center facilities.
To protect proper functionality, physical security equipment (e.g., motion sensors, cameras, etc.) undergo maintenance on a regular basis.
Qualtrics and all third-party Data Center providers log the names and times of authorized personnel entering Qualtricsâ private areas within the Data Centers.



System Access Control.&nbsp.
Data processing systems used to provide the Cloud Service must be prevented from being used without authorization.
Measures:

Multiple authorization levels are used when granting access to sensitive systems, including those storing and processing Personal Data.
Authorizations are managed via defined processes according to the Qualtrics Security Policy
All personnel access Qualtricsâ systems with a unique identifier (user ID).
Qualtrics has procedures in place so that requested authorization changes are implemented only in accordance with the Qualtrics Security Policy (for example, no rights are granted without authorization).
In case personnel leaves the company, their access rights are revoked.
Qualtrics has established a password policy that prohibits the sharing of passwords, governs responses to password disclosure, and requires passwords to be changed on a regular basis and default passwords to be altered.
Personalized user IDs are assigned for authentication.
All passwords must fulfill defined minimum requirements and are stored in encrypted form.
In the case of domain passwords, the system forces a password change every six months in compliance with the requirements for complex passwords.
Each computer has a password-protected screensaver.
The company network is protected from the public network by firewalls.
Qualtrics uses upâto-date antivirus software at access points to the company network (for e-mail accounts), as well as on all file servers and all workstations.
Security patch management is implemented to provide regular and periodic deployment of relevant security updates.
Full remote access to Qualtricsâ corporate network and critical infrastructure is protected by strong authentication.



Data Access Control. Persons entitled to use data processing systems gain access only to the Personal Data that they have a right to access, and Personal Data must not be read, copied, modified or removed without authorization in the course of processing, use and storage.
Measures:

As part of the Qualtrics Security Policy, Personal Data requires at least the same protection level as âconfidentialâ information according to the Qualtrics Information Classification standard.
Access to Personal Data is granted on a need-to-know basis.
Personnel have access to the information that they require in order to fulfill their duty.
Qualtrics uses authorization concepts that document grant processes and assigned roles per account (user ID).
All Customer Data is protected in accordance with the Qualtrics Security Policy.
All production servers are operated in the Data Centers or in secure server rooms.
Security measures that protect applications processing Personal Data are regularly checked.
To this end, Qualtrics conducts internal and external security checks and penetration tests on its IT systems.
An Qualtrics security standard governs how data and data carriers are deleted or destroyed once they are no longer required.



Data Transmission Control. Except as necessary for the provision of the Cloud Services in accordance with the Agreement, Personal Data must not be read, copied, modified or removed without authorization during transfer.
Where data carriers are physically transported, adequate measures are implemented at Qualtrics to provide the agreed-upon service levels (for example, encryption and lead-lined containers).
Measures:

Personal Data in transfer over Qualtrics internal networks is protected according to Qualtrics Security Policy.
When data is transferred between Qualtrics and its customers, the protection measures for the transferred Personal Data are mutually agreed upon and made part of the relevant agreement.
This applies to both physical and network based data transfer.
In any case, the Customer assumes responsibility for any data transfer once it is outside of Qualtrics-controlled systems (e.g.
data being transmitted outside the firewall of the Qualtrics Data Center).



Data Input Control. It will be possible to retrospectively examine and establish whether and by whom Personal Data have been entered, modified or removed from Qualtrics data processing systems.
Measures:

Qualtrics only allows authorized personnel to access Personal Data as required in the course of their duty.
Qualtrics has implemented a logging system for input, modification and deletion, or blocking of Personal Data by Qualtrics or its subprocessors within the Cloud Service to the extent technically possible.



Job Control. Personal Data being processed on commission (i.e., Personal Data processed on a customerâs behalf) is processed solely in accordance with the Agreement and related instructions of the customer.
Measures:

Qualtrics uses controls and processes to monitor compliance with contracts between Qualtrics and its customers, subprocessors or other service providers.
As part of the Qualtrics Security Policy, Personal Data requires at least the same protection level as âconfidentialâ information according to the Qualtrics Information Classification standard.
All Qualtrics employees and contractual subprocessors or other service providers are contractually bound to respect the confidentiality of all sensitive information including trade secrets of Qualtrics customers and partners.



Availability Control.&nbsp.
Personal Data will be protected against accidental or unauthorized destruction or loss.
Measures:

Qualtrics employs regular backup processes to provide restoration of business-critical systems as and when necessary.
Qualtrics uses uninterrupted power supplies (for example: UPS, batteries, generators, etc.) to protect power availability to the Data Centers.
Qualtrics has defined business contingency plans for business-critical processes and may offer disaster recovery strategies for business critical Services as further set out in the Documentation or incorporated into the Order Form for the relevant Cloud Service.
Emergency processes and systems are regularly tested.



Data Separation Control.
Measures:

Qualtrics uses the technical capabilities of the deployed software (for example: multi- tenancy, system landscapes) to achieve data separation among Personal Data originating from multiple customers.
Customer (including its Controllers) has access only to its own data.



Data Integrity Control.
Personal Data will remain intact, complete and current during processing activities.
Measures:
Qualtrics has implemented a multi-layered defense strategy as a protection against unauthorized modifications.
In particular, Qualtrics uses the following to implement the control and measure sections described above:

The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter about the existence of legislation applicable to it or any sub-processor preventing the conduct of an audit of the data importer, or any sub-processor, pursuant to paragraph 2.
In such a case the data exporter shall be entitled to take the measures foreseen in Clause 5(b).


Clause 9


Governing law

The Clauses shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established.

Clause 10


Variation of the contract

The parties undertake not to vary or modify the Clauses.
This does not preclude the parties from adding clauses on business related issues where required as long as they do not contradict the Clause.

Clause 11


Sub-processing


The data importer shall not subcontract any of its processing operations performed on behalf of the data exporter under the Clauses without the prior written consent of the data exporter.
Where the data importer subcontracts its obligations under the Clauses, with the consent of the data exporter, it shall do so only by way of a written agreement with the sub- processor which imposes the same obligations on the sub-processor as are imposed on the data importer under the Clauses.
Where the sub-processor fails to fulfill its data protection obligations under such written agreement the data importer shall remain fully liable to the data exporter for the performance of the sub-processorâs obligations under such agreement.
The prior written contract between the data importer and the sub-processor shall also provide for a third-party beneficiary clause as laid down in Clause 3 for cases where the data subject is not able to bring the claim for compensation referred to in paragraph 1 of Clause 6 against the data exporter or the data importer because they have factually disappeared or have ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent and no successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law.
Such third-party liability of the sub-processor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.
The provisions relating to data protection aspects for sub-processing of the contract referred to in paragraph 1 shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established.
The data exporter shall keep a list of sub-processing agreements concluded under the Clauses and notified by the data importer pursuant to Clause 5(j), which shall be updated at least once a year.
The list shall be available to the data exporterâs data protection supervisory authority.


Clause 12


Obligation after the termination of personal data-processing services


The parties agree that on the termination of the provision of data-processing services, the data importer and the sub-processor shall, at the choice of the data exporter, return all the personal data transferred and the copies thereof to the data exporter or shall destroy all the personal data and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, unless legislation imposed upon the data importer prevents it from returning or destroying all or part of the personal data transferred.
In that case, the data importer warrants that it will guarantee the confidentiality of the personal data transferred and will not actively process the personal data transferred anymore.
The data importer and the sub-processor warrant that upon request of the data exporter and/or of the supervisory authority, it will submit its data-processing facilities for an audit of the measures referred to in paragraph 1.
