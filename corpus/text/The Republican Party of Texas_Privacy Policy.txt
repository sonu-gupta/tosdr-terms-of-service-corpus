 Opting-Out of Use of Certain Information That May be Collected by Tracking Technologies.


Tracking Technologies: Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies (other than Flash cookies) and allow local storage, but you should be able to change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, local storage is being used, and/or to block cookies and/or the use of local storage altogether.
Please consult the âHelpâ section of your browser for more information.
Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features, content and/or other personalization available through the Services.
Flash Cookies: Users can manage the use of Flash technologies, with the Flash management tools available at Adobeâs website, see http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security/privacy_policy/faq.html. 
Do-Not-Track Signals: Certain browsers transmit âdo-not-trackâ signals to the websites with which such browsers communicate.
however, this feature, and how it is used and activated, varies from browser to browser.
Therefore, it is not clear whether the signals are intentionally transmitted by a user, or whether a user is even aware of this.
Despite current efforts, there is still disagreement amongst leading Internet standards organizations, industry groups, technology companies and regulators, concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals and no standard has been adopted to date.
The Republican Party of Texas takes privacy and security very seriously.
With respect to âdo not track signals,â we currently do not respond to do-not-track signals.
Third parties may collect information about an individual consumerâs online activities over time and across different Internet websites or online services when the consumer uses our Services.&nbsp.
If a standard is established and accepted, we may reassess how to respond to do-not-track signals.

We will respond to such verified requests within 60-90 days.
