         Privacy policy Last updated August 6, 2020
 Welcome to Handshake, a career services platform that connects students and employers to democratize the job finding experience, in college and beyond.
From the very beginning, our goal has been to design privacy into our platform in a way that respects the rights of students, the obligations of Universities, and the needs of employers.
We understand that student data privacy is a hot topic these days so we want to make clear the very basic privacy principles that guide our policies and practices: 

 Students are in complete control of what data they make public  We give students control over whether they want to make their profile public to employers and what information they share on it.
No student data uploaded to Handshake is ever viewable by any employer until a student has chosen to make their profile public.


 Universities choose the student data they share with Handshake  We respect the rights of students regarding their own personal data, and we are proud to work with Universities to find the best ways to maximize their career centerâs value without compromising student privacy.


 Handshake will never sell personal student data  We have never done it and we never will! Our business model is based on offering valuable tools for our student and employer users that enhance the career discovery process.
Your email address and personal data will never be sold to any third party.



 You should read our full Privacy Policy to understand what data we collect, how we use it, and the limited circumstances where we may share it.
Please note if that you reside in the EU or other regions outside the US, information collected through our Service will be transferred to and processed in the US or elsewhere.
While Handshake participates in the EU/US Privacy Shield program as described below, these locations may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially used our Services.
By using our Services, you consent to any transfer and processing in accordance with this Policy.
If you have any questions, please contact us at privacy@joinhandshake.com.
