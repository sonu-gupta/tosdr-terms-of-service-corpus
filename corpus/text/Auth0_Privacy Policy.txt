Transfers of EU &amp.
Swiss Data into the USAuth0 (âwe,â âusâ) has committed to comply with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield. We have certified that we adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such data.
If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and data subject rights under the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.
To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/
We are aware that, on July 16, 2020, in the Schrems II case, the European Court of Justice invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield as a means of ensuring adequate protection for personal data transferred to the US.
We are also aware that the Swiss Data Protection Authority and Information Commissioner invalidated the Swiss-US Privacy Shield in September 2020.
In reflection of these rulings, where we transfer personal data originating in the EEA or in Switzerland to the US, those transfers are made under the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission for the transfer of personal data to processors established in third countries which do not ensure an adequate level of data protection.
Auth0 is subject to the investigatory and enforcement authority of the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
Pursuant to the Privacy Shield principles we still acknowledge the right of EU and Swiss individuals to access their personal data to inspect, update, or correct it.
EU and Swiss individuals wishing to exercise this right may do so by emailing Auth0 at compliance@auth0.com.
Under the Privacy Shield, we may be liable for the onward transfer of personal data to third parties as described above under, âWho we give your information to.â
Note that we do not share any personal data with non-agent third parties or for uses other than those for which the information was originally provided.
If this practice should change in the future we will update this policy accordingly and provide individuals with opt-out or opt-in choice, as required.
We may be required to release personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities including to meet national security and law enforcement requirements.
In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Auth0 commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield.
European Union and Swiss individuals with Privacy Shield inquiries or complaints should first contact Auth0 at: compliance@auth0.com or Adam Nunn at:
Auth0 Inc.10800 NE 8th Street Suite 600 Bellevue, Washington 98004
Auth0 has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Privacy Shield Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus.
If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers&nbsp.
for more information and to file a complaint.
This service is provided free of charge to you.
If your Privacy Shield complaint cannot be resolved through the above channels, under certain conditions, you may invoke binding arbitration for some residual claims not resolved by other redress mechanisms.&nbsp.
See Privacy Shield Annex 1 at https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introductionChanges to this policyAny changes we make to our privacy policy in future will be posted on this page and, in relation to substantive changes, will be notified to you by e-mail.
This policy was last updated on November 20, 2020.Contact UsQuestions, comments and requests regarding this privacy policy are welcomed and should be addressed to:
