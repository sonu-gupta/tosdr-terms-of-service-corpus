        Terms of UseCryptoKitties Terms of UseLast Updated: Nov 15, 2018
CryptoKittiesÂ® is a distributed application that runs on the Ethereum network, using specially-developed smart contracts (each, a âSmart Contractâ) to enable users to own, transfer, and breed genetically unique digital cats, which can then be visualized on a website that the user can interact with (the âSiteâ).
The Smart Contracts and the Site are collectively referred to in these Terms as the âAppâ.
Using the App, users can view their cats and use the Smart Contracts to acquire, trade, and breed cats with other App users via clock auction.
Dapper Labs Inc.
("Dapper", "we", or "us") is making the App available to you.
Before you use the App, the Smart Contracts, or the Site, however, you will need to agree to these Terms of Use and any terms and conditions incorporated herein by reference (collectively, these "Terms").
PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, OR THE SITE.
THESE TERMS GOVERN YOUR USE OF THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, AND THE SITE, UNLESS WE HAVE EXECUTED A SEPARATE WRITTEN AGREEMENT WITH YOU FOR THAT PURPOSE.
WE ARE ONLY WILLING TO MAKE THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, AND THE SITE AVAILABLE TO YOU IF YOU ACCEPT ALL OF THESE TERMS.
BY USING THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, THE SITE, OR ANY PART OF THEM, OR BY CLICKING âI ACCEPTâ BELOW OR INDICATING YOUR ACCEPTANCE IN AN ADJOINING BOX, YOU ARE CONFIRMING THAT YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL OF THESE TERMS.
IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO ACCEPT THESE TERMS ON THAT ENTITYâS BEHALF, IN WHICH CASE âYOUâ WILL MEAN THAT ENTITY.
IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, OR IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT ALL OF THESE TERMS, THEN WE ARE UNWILLING TO MAKE THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, OR THE SITE AVAILABLE TO YOU.
IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, OR THE SITE.
1.
THE APP
A.
To most easily use the App, you may first install a web browser (such as the Google Chrome web browser) and an electronic wallet compatible with the Non-Fungible Token (NFT) standard on the Ethereum network, such as the MetaMask electronic wallet.
MetaMask and other electronic wallets allow you to purchase (either directly via Coinbase if you are in the United States, or via other third party sites), store, and engage in transactions using Ethereum cryptocurrency.
You will not be able to engage in any transactions on the App other than through MetaMask, or other Ethereum-compatible browsers.
B.
Transactions that take place on the App are managed and confirmed via the Ethereum blockchain.
You understand that your Ethereum public address will be made publicly visible whenever you engage in a transaction on the App.
C.
We neither own nor control MetaMask, Coinbase, Google Chrome, the Ethereum network, or any other third party site, product, or service that you might access, visit, or use for the purpose of enabling you to use the various features of the App.
We will not be liable for the acts or omissions of any such third parties, nor will we be liable for any damage that you may suffer as a result of your transactions or any other interaction with any such third parties.
D.
You must provide accurate and complete registration information when you create an account for the App.
By creating an account, you agree to provide accurate, current and complete account information about yourself, and to maintain and promptly update as necessary your account information.
You are responsible for the security of your account and your MetaMask wallet (and other Ethereum wallets and accounts).
If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your password or of your account with us, you agree to notify us immediately at meow@cryptokitties.co.
2.
THE KITTIES
A.
We have utilized Smart Contracts to develop our initial generation of CryptoKitties (âGen-Zero catsâ).
We will release a certain number of Gen-Zero cats âinto the wildâ (and make them available for purchase) on the day we first launch the App.
We will then release an additional Gen-Zero cat into the wild every fifteen minutes, and we will make each newly-released Gen-Zero cat available for purchase via a zero-reserve clock auction.
Our Smart Contracts enforce a hard limit of 50,000 Gen-Zero cats.
B.
As users breed their CryptoKitties, new and unforeseen generations of CryptoKitties will come into existence! Using our proprietary genetic combination algorithm that we have designed as part of the App, each newly-bred CryptoKitty will have some of the genetic traits of its parents.
At the same time, other, new genetic traits may be expressed.
Unique and surprising traits may be expressed when CryptoKitties are bred in the right combinations.
The Smart Contracts have total control over the pseudo-random elements of our breeding process, which means that we cannot manipulate or influence them.
C.
How you breed your CryptoKitties is entirely up to you.
You may breed your own CryptoKitties with one another, or offer to breed your CryptoKitties with other usersâ CryptoKitties.
CryptoKitties have no fixed gender, which means that in any particular breeding transaction, the CryptoKittiesâ owners can choose which cat will be the sire, and which will be the matron.
When the new kitten is born, it will always be assigned to the owner of the matron cat.
The breeding of two CryptoKitties will always produce a kitten.

RESTRICTIONS
A.
Definitions.
For the purposes of this Section 3, the following capitalized terms will have the following meanings:
âArtâ means any art, design, and drawings that may be associated with a CryptoKitty that you Own.
âExtensionsâ means third party designs that: (i) are intended for use as extensions or overlays to the Art, (ii) do not modify the underlying Art, and (iii) can be removed at any time without affecting the underlying Art.
âOwnâ means, with respect to a CryptoKitty, a CryptoKitty that you have purchased or otherwise rightfully acquired from a legitimate source, where proof of such purchase is recorded on the relevant blockchain.
âPurchased Kittyâ means a Kitty that you Own.
âThird Party IPâ means any third party patent rights (including, without limitation, patent applications and disclosures), copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, know-how or any other intellectual property rights recognized in any country or jurisdiction in the world.
B.
Ownership
i.
You Own the NFT.
Each CryptoKitty is a non-fungible token (an âNFTâ) on the Ethereum blockchain.
When you purchase a CryptoKitty, you own the underlying NFT completely.
This means that you have the right to trade your NFT, sell it, or give it away.
Ownership of the NFT is mediated entirely by the Smart Contract and the Ethereum Network: at no point will we seize, freeze, or otherwise modify the ownership of any CryptoKitty.
ii.
Dapper Owns the App.
You acknowledge and agree that Dapper (or, as applicable, our licensors) owns all legal right, title and interest in and to all other elements of the App, and all intellectual property rights therein (including, without limitation, all Art, designs, systems, methods, information, computer code, software, services, âlook and feelâ, organization, compilation of the content, code, data, and all other elements of the App (collectively, the âDapper Materialsâ)).
You acknowledge that the Dapper Materials are protected by copyright, trade dress, patent, and trademark laws, international conventions, other relevant intellectual property and proprietary rights, and applicable laws.
All Dapper Materials are the copyrighted property of Dapper or its licensors, and all trademarks, service marks, and trade names associated with the App or otherwise contained in the Dapper Materials are proprietary to Dapper or its licensors.
Except as expressly set forth herein, your use of the App does not grant you ownership of or any other rights with respect to any content, code, data, or other Dapper Materials that you may access on or through the App.
We reserve all rights in and to the Dapper Materials that are not expressly granted to you in these Terms.
For the sake of clarity, you understand and agree: (a) that your purchase of a CryptoKitty, whether via the App or otherwise, does not give you any rights or licenses in or to the Dapper Materials (including, without limitation, our copyright in and to the associated Art) other than those expressly contained in these Terms.
(b) that you do not have the right, except as otherwise set forth in these Terms, to reproduce, distribute, or otherwise commercialize any elements of the Dapper Materials (including, without limitation, any Art) without our prior written consent in each case, which consent we may withhold in our sole and absolute discretion.
and (c) that you will not apply for, register, or otherwise use or attempt to use any Dapper trademarks or service marks, or any confusingly similar marks, anywhere in the world without our prior written consent in each case, which consent we may withhold at our sole and absolute discretion.
C.
License to Art
i.
General Use.
Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, Dapper grants you a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to use, copy, and display the Art for your Purchased Kitties, along with any Extensions that you choose to create or use, solely for the following purposes: (i) for your own personal, non-commercial use.
(ii) as part of a marketplace that permits the purchase and sale of your Purchased Kitty, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each Kitty ownerâs rights to display the Art for their Purchased Kitty to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art.
or (iii) as part of a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of your Purchased Kitty, provided that the website/application cryptographically verifies each Kitty ownerâs rights to display the Art for their Purchased Kitty to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the Purchased Kitty leaves the website/application.
ii.
Commercial Use.
Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, Dapper grants you a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use, copy, and display the Art for your Purchased Kitty for the purpose of commercializing your own merchandise that includes, contains, or consists of the Art for your Purchased Kitty (âCommercial Useâ), provided that such Commercial Use does not result in you earning more than One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) in gross revenue each year.
For the sake of clarity, nothing in this Section will be deemed to restrict you from (i) owning or operating a marketplace that permits the use and sale of CryptoKitties generally, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each Kitty ownerâs rights to display the Art for their Purchased Kitty to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art.
(ii) owning or operating a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of CryptoKitties generally, provided that the third party website or application cryptographically verifies each Kitty ownerâs rights to display the Art for their Purchased Kitty to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the Purchased Kitty leaves the website/application.
or (iii) earning revenue from any of the foregoing, even where such revenue is in excess of $100,000 per year.
D.
Restrictions.
You agree that you may not, nor permit any third party to do or attempt to do any of the foregoing without Dapperâs express prior written consent in each case: (i) modify the Art for your Purchased Kitty in any way, including, without limitation, the shapes, designs, drawings, attributes, or color schemes (your use of Extensions will not constitute a prohibited modification hereunder).
(ii) use the Art for your Purchased Kitty to advertise, market, or sell any third party product or service.
(iii) use the Art for your Purchased Kitty in connection with images, videos, or other forms of media that depict hatred, intolerance, violence, cruelty, or anything else that could reasonably be found to constitute hate speech or otherwise infringe upon the rights of others.
(iv) use the Art for your Purchased Kitty in movies, videos, or any other forms of media, except to the limited extent that such use is expressly permitted in these Terms or solely for your own personal, non-commercial use.
(v) sell, distribute for commercial gain (including, without limitation, giving away in the hopes of eventual commercial gain), or otherwise commercialize merchandise that includes, contains, or consists of the Art for your Purchased Kitty, except as expressly permitted in these Terms.
(vi) attempt to trademark, copyright, or otherwise acquire additional intellectual property rights in or to the Art for your Purchased Kitty.
or (vii) otherwise utilize the Art for your Purchased Kitty for your or any third partyâs commercial benefit.
To the extent that Art associated with your Purchased Kitty contains Third Party IP (e.g., licensed intellectual property from a celebrity, athlete, or other public figure), you understand and agree as follows: (w) that you will not have the right to use such Third Party IP in any way except as incorporated in the Art, and subject to the license and restrictions contained herein.
(x) that the Commercial Use license in Section 3.C(ii) above will not apply.
(y) that, depending on the nature of the license granted from the owner of the Third Party IP, Dapper may need to pass through additional restrictions on your ability to use the Art.
and (z) to the extent that Dapper informs you of such additional restrictions in writing (email is permissible), you will be responsible for complying with all such restrictions from the date that you receive the notice, and that failure to do so will be deemed a breach of this license.
The restrictions in this Section will survive the expiration or termination of these Terms.
E.
Other Terms of License.
The license granted in Section 3.C above applies only to the extent that you continue to Own the applicable Purchased Kitty.
If at any time you sell, trade, donate, give away, transfer, or otherwise dispose of your Purchased Kitty for any reason, the license granted in Section 3.C will immediately expire with respect to that Kitty without the requirement of notice, and you will have no further rights in or to the Art for that Kitty.
If you exceed the $100,000 limitation on annual gross revenue set forth in Section 3.C(ii) above, you will be in breach of these Terms, and must send an email to Dapper at legal@dapperlabs.com within forty-five (45) days, with the phrase âCryptoKitty License - Commercial Useâ in the subject line, requesting a discussion with Dapper regarding entering into a broader license agreement or obtaining an exemption (which may be granted or withheld in Dapperâs sole and absolute discretion).
If you exceed the scope of the license grant in Section 3.C(ii) without entering into a broader license agreement with or obtaining an exemption from Dapper, you acknowledge and agree that: (i) you are in breach of these Terms.
(ii) in addition to any remedies that may be available to Dapper at law or in equity, Dapper may immediately terminate the license that was granted to you in Section 3.C, without the requirement of notice.
and (iii) you will be responsible to reimburse Dapper for any costs and expenses incurred by Dapper during the course of enforcing these Terms against you.
F.
Feedback.
You may choose to submit comments, bug reports, ideas or other feedback about the App, including without limitation about how to improve the App (collectively, âFeedbackâ).
By submitting any Feedback, you agree that we are free to use such Feedback at our discretion and without additional compensation to you, and to disclose such Feedback to third parties (whether on a non-confidential basis, or otherwise).
You hereby grant us a perpetual, irrevocable, nonexclusive, worldwide license under all rights necessary for us to incorporate and use your Feedback for any purpose.
G.
Your Obligations.
You agree that you are responsible for your own conduct while accessing or using the App, and for any consequences thereof.
You agree to use the App only for purposes that are legal, proper and in accordance with these Terms and any applicable laws or regulations.
By way of example, and not as a limitation, you may not, and may not allow any third party to: (i) send, upload, distribute or disseminate any unlawful, defamatory, harassing, abusive, fraudulent, obscene, or otherwise objectionable content.

If we delete your CryptoKittiesâ images and descriptions from the App and/or the Site, such deletion will not affect your ownership rights in any NFTs that you already Own.
4.
FEES AND PAYMENT
A.
If you elect to purchase, trade, or breed CryptoKitties on the App, or with or from other users via the App, any financial transactions that you engage in will be conducted solely through the Ethereum network.
We will have no insight into or control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any transactions.
With that in mind, we will have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any transactions that you engage in via the App, or using the Smart Contracts, or any other transactions that you conduct via the Ethereum network.
B.
Ethereum requires the payment of a transaction fee (a âGas Feeâ) for every transaction that occurs on the Ethereum network.
The Gas Fee funds the network of computers that run the decentralized Ethereum network.
This means that you will need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction that occurs via the App.
C.
In addition to the Gas Fee, each time you utilize the CryptoKitties marketplace Smart Contract to conduct a transaction with another user via the App, you authorize us to collect a commission of 3.75% of the total value of that transaction (each, a âCommissionâ).
You acknowledge and agree that the Commission will be transferred directly to us through the Ethereum network as part of your payment.
We will not collect a Commission for interactions that do not involve our marketplace.
D.
As between us, you will be solely responsible to pay any and all sales, use, value-added and other taxes, duties, and assessments (except taxes on our net income) now or hereafter claimed or imposed by any governmental authority (collectively, âTaxesâ) associated with your use of the App (including, without limitation, any Taxes that may become payable as the result of your ownership, transfer, or breeding of any of your CryptoKitties).
Except for income taxes levied on Dapper, you: (i) will pay or reimburse us for all national, federal, state, local or other taxes and assessments of any jurisdiction, including value added taxes and taxes as required by international tax treaties, customs or other import or export taxes, and amounts levied in lieu thereof based on charges set, services performed or payments made hereunder, as are now or hereafter may be imposed under the authority of any national, state, local or any other taxing jurisdiction.
and (ii) shall not be entitled to deduct the amount of any such taxes, duties or assessments from payments made to us pursuant to these Terms.
You confirm that you are not a resident in Canada nor are you registered for Goods and services tax / Harmonized sales tax (GST / HST) or Provincial sales taxes (PST) in Canada, and will inform Dapper if your status changes in the future.
5.
TERMINATION
You may terminate these Terms at any time by canceling your account on the App and discontinuing your access to and use of the App.
You will not receive any refunds if you cancel your account, or otherwise terminate these Terms.
You agree that we, in our sole discretion and for any or no reason, may terminate these Terms and suspend and/or terminate your account(s) for the App.
You agree that any suspension or termination of your access to the App may be without prior notice, and that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any such suspension or termination.
If we terminate these Terms or suspend or terminate your access to or use of the App due to your breach of these Terms or any suspected fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activity, then termination of these Terms will be in addition to any other remedies we may have at law or in equity.
Upon any termination or expiration of these Terms, whether by you or us, you may no longer have access to information that you have posted on the App or that is related to your account, and you acknowledge that we will have no obligation to maintain any such information in our databases or to forward any such information to you or to any third party.
Sections 1.C and 3 through 16 will survive the termination or expiration of these Terms for any reason.
6.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES IN CONTRACTS WITH CONSUMERS, SO SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
B.
YOU ACCEPT THE INHERENT SECURITY RISKS OF PROVIDING INFORMATION AND DEALING ONLINE OVER THE INTERNET, AND AGREE THAT WE HAVE NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY BREACH OF SECURITY UNLESS IT IS DUE TO OUR GROSS NEGLIGENCE.
C.
WE WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY LOSSES YOU INCUR AS THE RESULT OF YOUR USE OF THE ETHEREUM NETWORK OR THE METAMASK ELECTRONIC WALLET, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY LOSSES, DAMAGES OR CLAIMS ARISING FROM: (i) USER ERROR, SUCH AS FORGOTTEN PASSWORDS OR INCORRECTLY CONSTRUED SMART CONTRACTS OR OTHER TRANSACTIONS.
(ii) SERVER FAILURE OR DATA LOSS.
(iii) CORRUPTED WALLET FILES.
OR (iv) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR ACTIVITIES BY THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE USE OF VIRUSES, PHISHING, BRUTEFORCING OR OTHER MEANS OF ATTACK AGAINST THE APP, ETHEREUM NETWORK, OR THE METAMASK ELECTRONIC WALLET.

ALL SMART CONTRACTS ARE CONDUCTED AND OCCUR ON THE DECENTRALIZED LEDGER WITHIN THE ETHEREUM PLATFORM.
WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER AND MAKE NO GUARANTEES OR PROMISES WITH RESPECT TO SMART CONTRACTS.
E.
DAPPER IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR LOSSES DUE TO BLOCKCHAINS OR ANY OTHER FEATURES OF THE ETHEREUM NETWORK OR THE METAMASK ELECTRONIC WALLET, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LATE REPORT BY DEVELOPERS OR REPRESENTATIVES (OR NO REPORT AT ALL) OF ANY ISSUES WITH THE BLOCKCHAIN SUPPORTING THE ETHEREUM NETWORK, INCLUDING FORKS, TECHNICAL NODE ISSUES, OR ANY OTHER ISSUES HAVING FUND LOSSES AS A RESULT.
7.
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
A.
YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT WE, OUR SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, AND LICENSORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES WHICH YOU MAY INCUR, HOWSOEVER CAUSED AND UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY LOSS OF PROFITS (WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY), LOSS OF GOODWILL OR BUSINESS REPUTATION, LOSS OF DATA, COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR ANY OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

C.
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT WE HAVE MADE THE APP AVAILABLE TO YOU AND ENTERED INTO THESE TERMS IN RELIANCE UPON THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN, WHICH REFLECT A REASONABLE AND FAIR ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND FORM AN ESSENTIAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN US.
WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE APP TO YOU WITHOUT THESE LIMITATIONS.
D.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, AND SOME JURISDICTIONS ALSO LIMIT DISCLAIMERS OR LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY FROM CONSUMER PRODUCTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS.
8.
ASSUMPTION OF RISK
You accept and acknowledge each of the following:
A.
The prices of blockchain assets are extremely volatile.
Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect the value of your CryptoKitties, which may also be subject to significant price volatility.
We cannot guarantee that any purchasers of CryptoKitties will not lose money.
B.
You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your CryptoKitties-related transactions.
Dapper is not responsible for determining the taxes that apply to your transactions on the App, the Site, or the Smart Contracts.
C.
The App does not store, send, or receive CryptoKitties.
This is because CryptoKitties exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on the Appâs supporting blockchain in the Ethereum network.
Any transfer of CryptoKitties occurs within the supporting blockchain in the Ethereum network, and not on the App.
D.
There are risks associated with using an Internet-based currency, including, but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your wallet.
You accept and acknowledge that Dapper will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the Ethereum network, however caused.
E.
A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of the CryptoKitties ecosystem, and therefore the potential utility or value of CryptoKitties.
F.
The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the CryptoKitties ecosystem, and therefore the potential utility or value of CryptoKitties.
G.
Upgrades by Ethereum to the Ethereum platform, a hard fork in the Ethereum platform, or a change in how transactions are confirmed on the Ethereum platform may have unintended, adverse effects on all blockchains using the ERC-20 standard, including the CryptoKitties ecosystem.
9.
INDEMNIFICATION
You agree to hold harmless and indemnify Dapper and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, employees, advertisers, licensors, suppliers or partners from and against any claim, liability, loss, damage (actual and consequential) of any kind or nature, suit, judgment, litigation cost, and attorneys' fees arising out of or in any way related to (i) your breach of these Terms, (ii) your misuse of the App, or (iii) your violation of applicable laws, rules or regulations in connection with your access to or use of the App.
You agree that Dapper will have control of the defense or settlement of any such claims.
10.
EXTERNAL SITES
The App may include hyperlinks to other web sites or resources (collectively, âExternal Sitesâ), which are provided solely as a convenience to our users.
We have no control over any External Sites.
You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for the availability of any External Sites, and that we do not endorse any advertising, products or other materials on or made available from any External Sites.
Furthermore, you acknowledge and agree that we are not liable for any loss or damage which may be incurred as a result of the availability or unavailability of the External Sites, or as a result of any reliance placed by you upon the completeness, accuracy or existence of any advertising, products or other materials on, or made available from, any External Sites.
11.
CHANGES TO THE TERMS
We may make changes to the Terms from time to time.
When we make changes, we will make the updated Terms available on the App and update the âLast Updatedâ date at the beginning of these Terms accordingly.
Please check these Terms periodically for changes.
Any changes to the Terms will apply on the date that they are made, and your continued access to or use of the App after the Terms have been updated will constitute your binding acceptance of the updates.
If you do not agree to any revised Terms, you may not access or use the App.
12.
CHANGES TO THE APP
We are constantly innovating the App to help provide the best possible experience.
You acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the App, and any part of it, may change from time to time without prior notice to you, and that we may add new features and change any part of the App at any time without notice.
13.
CHILDREN
You affirm that you are over the age of 13, as the App is not intended for children under 13.
IF YOU ARE 13 OR OLDER BUT UNDER THE AGE OF 18, OR THE LEGAL AGE OF MAJORITY WHERE YOU RESIDE IF THAT JURISDICTION HAS AN OLDER AGE OF MAJORITY, THEN YOU AGREE TO REVIEW THESE TERMS WITH YOUR PARENT OR GUARDIAN TO MAKE SURE THAT BOTH YOU AND YOUR PARENT OR GUARDIAN UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO THESE TERMS.
YOU AGREE TO HAVE YOUR PARENT OR GUARDIAN REVIEW AND ACCEPT THESE TERMS ON YOUR BEHALF.
IF YOU ARE A PARENT OR GUARDIAN AGREEING TO THE TERMS FOR THE BENEFIT OF A CHILD OVER 13, THEN YOU AGREE TO AND ACCEPT FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT CHILD'S USE OF THE APP, INCLUDING ALL FINANCIAL CHARGES AND LEGAL LIABILITY THAT HE OR SHE MAY INCUR.
14 Privacy Policy
Our Privacy Policy describes the ways we collect, use, store and disclose your personal information, and is hereby incorporated by this reference into these Terms.
You agree to the collection, use, storage, and disclosure of your data in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
15 Dispute Resolution.
Arbitration
Please read this Section 15 carefully.
It requires you to arbitrate disputes with Dapper, and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.
All disputes arising out of or in connection with these Terms, including without limitation your access or use of the App, the Site, or the Smart Contracts, or to any products sold or distributed through the App, the Site, or the Smart Contracts, will be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration under the rules of the British Columbia International Commercial Arbitration Centre.
The appointing authority will be the British Columbia International Commercial Arbitration Centre.
The case will be adjudicated by a single arbitrator and will be administered by the British Columbia International Commercial Arbitration Centre in accordance with its applicable rules.
Each party will cover its own fees and costs associated with the arbitration proceedings.
however, if the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay the fees and costs reasonably associated with the arbitration proceedings, Dapper will pay them for you.
The place of arbitration will be Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.
You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions.
The language of the arbitration will be English.
The award of the arbitrator will be final and binding, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
