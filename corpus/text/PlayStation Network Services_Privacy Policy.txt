We may also index and use content which you have shared publicly, as part of our platformâs features like Game Help, PlayStation profiles, or future PlayStation Network services.

Information Handling and Your Choices
Childrenâs Information
Accounts for children between the age of 7 to 17 years old, must be created by your parent or legal guardian ("Responsible Adult").
If you are creating an account for your child, we recommend that you and your child read our Privacy Information for Young Players to help them understand how we handle their PI and their rights over their PI.
If you are aged 7 - 17, you can ask your Responsible Adult to explain anything you do not understand.
You can also read our Privacy Information for Young Players to help you understand how we use your information and your privacy rights over your information.
We will collect, use and share information collected from or about children in accordance with the practices described in this document, with the following exceptions.
Information You Provide to Us

A Responsible Adult only needs to provide limited information about their child (an email address and date-of-birth) to create an Account for their child.
Providing gender is optional.
Only with the Responsible Adultâs approval to create an Account for the child, can a child add their address.
The spending limit of the Account for your child is set by the associated Responsible Adultâs Account.

Information You May Choose to Share

A Responsible Adult can control, through the âFree Communicationâ setting on their child's Account, their child's ability to use (and share PI through) text chat, voice chat, video chat, and other messaging features from communicating directly with other users in games, apps or via system software features.
Please note that a child's Account can still:
Send and receive predetermined text messages created by a game or app
Create and see other users' in-game character names, designs, and clan titles
Use communication services via an Internet browser unless specifically disabled
Communicate via system messaging on PS3 and PS Vita


A Responsible Adult can control their child's ability to post or view user-generated content, including photos, videos, drawings, and content imported from outside sources (any of which might contain PI) through the user-generated content control.
This will not prevent video capture of a child Account user's online gameplay.
A Responsible Adult can agree to our collection and use of their child's PI without consenting to our disclosure to third parties, except when the disclosure is inherent to the Services we are providing.

When a Responsible Adult allows their child's Account to participate in games, chat or user-generated content features, they also allow consent to SIE sharing information with the publishers of the games, applications, or services that incorporate those features and the collection of information entered into such features by the child's Account (e.g.
typing text into the chat feature).
If you discover your child under the age of 18 has created an Account, once we verify you are the child's Responsible Adult parent, we will promptly give access and control of the childâs account to you.
