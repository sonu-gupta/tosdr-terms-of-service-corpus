These stay on your browser after itâs closed and are often used so you donât have to re-enter information every time you visit a site.
For example, if you abandon a shopping cart and visit it again a few weeks later to find the items are still in your checkout â this will be because of persistent cookies.

They may be used to track preferences and even store personal information within a site.
