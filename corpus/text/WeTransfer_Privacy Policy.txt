block Child Sexual Abuse Imagery (CSAI).
Detection of CSAI leads to automated decisions whether such Content is potential CSAI.
Cases of potential CSAI will be reported directly to law enforcement agencies.

In all these cases we withhold the right to preserve your Content and share it, together with other identifying information, with law enforcement agencies.

We do this either by market research (for instance by sending out surveys) or by performing analyses (for example by tracking and bringing together your personal information across our Services or across your mobile devices).
We do this in order to understand how our user base as a whole interacts with our Services, but also to review the effect of our advertisements and to improve those Services and advertisements accordingly.

Marketing, advertisement &amp.

In order to connect with our target audience, we might use sequential messaging, which is basically a form of storytelling: each time you interact with our Services on a different device, you may receive a slightly different ad in a different form, but the ads are part of the same story.
Moreover, based on the way you interact with our Services through your devices, we might promote one of our (other) Services or features.
Finally, we enable you to engage in any (personalised) actions, promotions or events we offer.

Legal: in so far as necessary, we might use your personal information to defend WeTransfer in legal proceedings in relation to or as a result of your use of our Services, following a court order, abiding by any law, regulation or governmental request, cooperating with law enforcement, cooperating in fraud investigations of third parties, safeguarding national security, defense, public security, and to uphold our Terms of Services.

Those countries have different data protection laws in place.
However, when we transfer- and host data globally, we will make sure that appropriate safeguards are in place in order to ensure your personal information enjoys a similar level of protection as it would within the EEA.

Personal information

WeTransfer retains your personal information as long as its necessary to provide our Services to you (e.g.
upholding your user account), to conduct our business activities and fulfill our legitimate interests, such as providing safe and secure services, to fix bugs and to reach out to you, to comply with applicable laws (e.g.
retaining financial information for 7 years for tax purposes) and legal requests and to resolve (legal) disputes.

Files you transfer

When data is older than 12 months, we scrub it from the database, pseudonymise or anonymise it for analysis.
Pseudonomising your personal information means that we do not use your email address or IP address for analytical purposes, but create a random pseudonym for both and use that pseudonym instead.
That way we donât have to handle directly identifiable personal information, which is privacy-friendly.
