Welcome to www.krisp.ai (âSiteâ), hosted by Krisp Technologies, Inc.

Krisp provides noise cancellation technology to individuals and businesses (âServicesâ).
In order to provide our Site and Services, we collect personal data from our Site visitors (âSite Visitorsâ) and our customers (âCustomersâ).
We also collect the personal data of our Customersâ end users (âEnd Usersâ) when they use the Services, namely our Customerâs employees, consultants or any other persons to whom access is granted by the Customer. 
This Privacy Policy applies to personal information collected by Krisp when you use our Site and/or Services, or otherwise provide us with personal information.
Please read it carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your personal information and how we will treat it.
If you do not agree with our Privacy Policy, please do not download, install, register with, access, or use the Site or Services.

IF YOU ARE AN INDIVIDUAL LOCATED IN THE EEA: If you are located in the European Economic Area (âEEAâ), this entire Privacy Policy applies to you.
However, please see the section titled Additional Information for Users in the EEA, which will inform you in detail about our legal bases for processing and your rights regarding the processing of your personal data.

IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF NEVADA: If you are a resident of Nevada, this entire Privacy Policy applies to you.

WHO WE ARE
Krisp is a Delaware corporation with the following contact information:
Krisp Technologies, Inc. 2150 Shattuck Ave, Suite 1300, Berkeley, CA 94704, United States security@krisp.ai 
For users in the EEA and the U.K., note that we may collect your personal data as:

A âdata controllerâ when we determine the means and purpose of processing, such as when we process the personal data of our Site visitors and/or customers, or as 
A âdata processorâ when we collect and process End User personal data on behalf of our Customers who use our Services. 

When we act as a âdata processorâ, our Customers are primarily responsible for making sure that they have properly informed End Users of their policies and practices and your rights.
However, Krisp handles and secures your personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy (except as noted otherwise in this Privacy Policy).


CHILDRENâS PRIVACY
Krisp does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 16.
If you are under the age of 16, please do not submit any personal data to us.
We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their childrenâs Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide personal data without their permission.
If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 16 has provided personal data to Krisp through the Site or Services, please contact security@krisp.ai and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.
CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
This Privacy Policy was last updated on the date indicated above, but we suggest that you review it from time to time, as our Site and/or Services and our business may change.
As a result, at times it may be necessary for Krisp to make changes to this Privacy Policy.
Krisp reserves the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time without prior notice.
However, if we make changes that we believe will materially impact this Privacy Policy or your rights, we will promptly notify you of those changes.
Your continued use of the Site and/or Services after any changes or revisions to this Privacy Policy shall indicate your agreement with the terms of such revised Privacy Policy.
TO WHOM DOES THIS POLICY APPLY
Note at the outset that this Privacy Policy does not cover our Customersâ websites, products or services.
Each Customer is responsible for posting its own terms, conditions, and privacy policies, and ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

Site Visitors: visitors to our Site, including those who may also opt-in to receive commercial communications from Krisp. 

End Users: Krisp processes End User data on behalf of its Customers.
While our Customers are responsible, as data controllers, for how and why they collect and process their End User personal information, this Privacy Policy also applies to any End User personal information that we process, as a data processor, in order to provide Services to our Customers, except where specifically indicated.

INFORMATION WE COLLECT
What personal information we collect and process depends on how and why you use our Site or Services.
Generally, we process personal information that we receive:

ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROCESSING OF SUCH VOICE CONTENT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED TO THE USER DIRECTLY. 


We have 
robust access controls
 to prevent unauthorized access to meeting recordings stored on Krisp Servers.
We store recordings until the user instructs us to delete the recording and/or his/her account with Krisp.

Information from Third Parties

This consists of data from our partners, such as transactional data from providers of payment services, or information from third parties who assist us with fraud prevention.
From time to time, we may combine information we collect as described above with personal information we obtain from third parties.

Customers

When we act on behalf of our Customers (as a data processor or service provider), we may provide End Usersâ personal information to our Customers in order to comply with their requests, End Usersâ requests and/or regulator requests, among others.
Occasionally, we will provide our Customers with aggregated information that does not identify End Users directly, in order to provide information about usage, demographics (such as location) or other general information.

Legal Obligations and Security

In addition, Krisp will preserve or disclose your personal information in limited circumstances (other than as set forth in this Privacy Policy), including: (i) with your consent.
(ii) when we have a good faith belief it is required by law, such as pursuant to a subpoena, warrant or other judicial or administrative order (as further explained below).

HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

General Retention Periods

We use the following criteria to determine our retention periods:

The amount, nature and sensitivity of your information
The reasons for which we collect and process the personal data
The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide you with access to our Site and/or Services
Applicable legal requirements

We retain personal information for as long as needed to provide our Services.
Note, however, that with respect to our Customers with active accounts, we may retain certain essential account information, but otherwise regularly delete other information that is less essential to the provision of our Services in order to minimize our storage of data.
We also will retain personal information that weâve collected from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).
Additionally, we cannot delete information when it is needed for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims (also known as a âlitigation holdâ).
In this case, the information must be retained as long as needed for exercising respective potential legal claims.
When we no longer have an ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
For any questions about data retention, please contact security@krisp.ai.

Anonymization

In some instances, we may choose to anonymize your personal data instead of deleting it, for statistical use, for instance.
When we choose to anonymize, we make sure that there is no way that the personal data can be linked back to you or any specific user.
OPTING-OUT OF MARKETING
You may opt-out at any time of marketing that we may send you by clicking on the unsubscribe link contained in each email, or you may contact us directly at security@krisp.ai.
NOTICE TO NEVADA CONSUMERS
We do not sell your personal information within the scope of, and according to the defined meaning of, a âsaleâ under NRS 603A.
INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS
Krisp is a United States corporation, which primarily stores information in the United States.
To facilitate our global operations, we may process personal information from around the world, including from other countries and in other countries in which Krisp has operations, in order to provide the Site and/or Services.

If you are accessing or using our Site and/or Services or otherwise providing personal information to us, you are agreeing and consenting to the processing of your personal information in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we operate. 
If you are a Customer, you are responsible for informing your End Users of how and where their personal information will be processed at the time of collection.
Because different countries may have different data protection laws than the United States we take steps to ensure adequate safeguards are in place to protect your data as explained in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp.
We enter into data processing agreements with our Customers on request.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR USERS IN THE EEA AND THE U.K.
Rights and Choices
If the GDPR applies to you because you are in the EEA or the U.K., you have certain rights in relation to your personal data:

The right to be informed: our obligation to inform you that we process your personal data (and thatâs what weâre doing in this Privacy Policy)
The right of access: your right to request a copy of the personal data we hold about you (also known as a âdata subject access requestâ)
The right of rectification: your right to request that we correct personal data about you if it is incomplete or inaccurate (though we generally recommend first making any changes in your Account Settings)
The right to erasure (also known as the âright to be forgottenâ): under certain circumstances, you may ask us to delete the personal data we have about you (unless it remains necessary for us to continue processing your personal data for a legitimate business need or to comply with a legal obligation as permitted under the GDPR, in which case we will inform you)
The right to restrict processing: your right, under certain circumstances, to ask us to suspend our processing of your personal data
The right to data portability: your right to ask us for a copy of your personal data in a common format (for example, a .csv file)
The right to object: your right to object to us processing your personal data (for example, if you object to us processing your data for direct marketing)
Rights in relation to automated decision-making and profiling: our obligation to be transparent about any profiling we do, or any automated decision-making.
These rights are subject to certain rules around when you can exercise them.

How you may exercise these rights depends on how you use the Site and/or Services, as explained below.
For End Users in the EEA or the U.K., please skip to here.

Customers, Site Visitors in the EEA or the U.K.

If you are located in the EEA or the U.K.
and you are a Customer or Site Visitor, and wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, you may contact us at security@krisp.ai using the term âDSRâ as your email subject line.
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights) unless your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.
Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request under those circumstances.
If we cannot reasonably verify your identity, we will not be able to comply with your request(s).
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity.
This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
Note that this is especially true when you engage a third party to assist you in exercising your rights.
We will respond to all legitimate requests within one month.
Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests.
In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated as required by law.
In addition, we will always balance your rights against those of other data subjects in connection with any requests, and in some cases this may require us to redact our responses or deny a request.
If you no longer wish to receive our marketing/promotional information, we remind you that you may withdraw your consent to direct marketing at any time directly from the unsubscribe link included in each electronic marketing message we send to you.
If you do so, we will promptly update our databases, and will take all reasonable steps to meet your request at the earliest possible opportunity, but we may continue to contact you to the extent necessary for the purposes of providing our Services. 
Finally, you have the right to make a complaint at any time to the supervisory authority for data protection issues in your country of residence.
We would, however, appreciate the chance to address your concerns before you approach the supervisory authority, so please contact us directly first.

End Users in the EEA or the U.K.

Krisp has no direct relationship with End Users.
Our Customers are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations with respect to their End Users, and this includes handling all data subject requests.
We rely on our Customers to comply with the underlying legal requirements and respond directly to End Users when End Users wish to exercise the rights set forth above.
However, if an End User sends a request to Krisp to access, correct, update, or delete his/her information, we will direct that End User to contact the Customerâs website(s) with which he/she interacted directly, and cooperate with our Customers as required by applicable law in order to ensure that our Customers satisfy their End Usersâ requests.
 
CONTACT US
If you have questions about data protection, or if you have any requests for resolving issues with your personal data, we encourage you to first contact us so we can reply to you more quickly.
