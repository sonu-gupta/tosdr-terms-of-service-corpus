When We Disclose Your Personal Information

Except with your consent, we will not sell, license, trade or rent your personal information to or with others.
OpenChannel may share personal information with third parties engaged to assist us in providing the Services to you or to carry out one or more of the purposes described above.&nbsp.
These service providers are prohibited from using your personal information for any purpose other than to provide this assistance and are required to protect personal information collected by them on behalf of OpenChannel or disclosed to them by OpenChannel and to comply with the general privacy principles described in this Privacy Policy.
OpenChannel reserves the right to disclose personal information to a third party if a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order legally requires or authorizes us to do so.
OpenChannel also reserves the right to disclose and/or transfer personal information to a third party in the event of a proposed or actual purchase, sale (including a liquidation, realization, foreclosure or repossession), lease, merger, amalgamation or any other type of acquisition, disposal, transfer, conveyance or financing of all or any portion of OpenChannel or of any of the business or assets or shares of OpenChannel or a division thereof in order for you to continue to receive the same products and services from the third party.

Knowledge and Consent

OpenChannel collects personal information about you, from you, or from third parties you authorize us to collect such information from, only when you voluntarily provide it or authorize us to collect it.&nbsp.
Typically, we will seek consent for the use or disclosure of your personal information at the time of collection.&nbsp.
In certain circumstances, consent may be sought after the information has been collected but before use (for example, when we want to use information for a purpose not previously identified).
The form of consent that we seek, including whether it is express or implied, will largely depend on the sensitivity of the personal information and the reasonable expectations of the individual in the circumstances.
You may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice.&nbsp.
If you wish to withdraw your consent at any time, please contact us using the contact information provided in the âContact Usâ section of this Privacy Policy.&nbsp.
We will inform you of the implications of withdrawing consent.
We will not, as a condition of the supply of a product or service, require you to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of information beyond that required to fulfill the explicitly specified and legitimate purposes for which the information is being provided.

Use or Disclosure for Marketing Purposes

If you have not opted out of receiving marketing materials, we may also use (but will not disclose) your personal information to promote and market additional goods, services and special offers from us, including by means of direct marketing.
You can choose not to allow us to use your personal information for direct marketing purposes by indicating your preference on the sign up page or by contacting us as outlined below (see âContacting Usâ).
