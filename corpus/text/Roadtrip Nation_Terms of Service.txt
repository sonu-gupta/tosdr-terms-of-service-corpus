In no event, including but not limited to negligence, shall RTN, any of its affiliates, or any of their directors, officers, employees, agents or content or service providers (including moderators or administrators) (collectively, the "protected entities") be liable for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, consequential, exemplary or punitive damages arising from, or directly or indirectly related to, the use of, or the inability to use, the Services or the content, materials and functions related thereto.

or in connection with any content posted, transmitted, exchanged or received by or on behalf of any user or other person on or through the Services, even if such protected entity has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

We control and operate the Services from our offices in the United States of America.
We do not represent that materials which are part of the Services are appropriate for use in other locations.

The laws of the State of California will govern these Terms of Use, as well as any claim that might arise between you and us, without regard to any conflict of law provisions.

Arbitration

All parties to these Terms of Use waive their respective rights to a trial by jury.
The exclusive means of resolving any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use (including any alleged breach thereof) or the Services shall be binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association.
The one exception to the exclusivity of arbitration is that you have the right to bring an individual claim against RTN in a small-claims court of competent jurisdiction.
But whether you choose arbitration or small-claims court, you may not under any circumstances commence or maintain any class action, class arbitration, or other representative action or proceeding against the RTN.



By using the Services, you agree to the above arbitration agreement.
In doing so, you give up your right to go to court to assert or defend any claims between you and RTN or its affiliates (except for matters that may be taken to small-claims court).
You also give up your right to participate in a class action or other class proceeding.
Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury.
You are entitled to a fair hearing before the arbitrator.
The arbitrator can grant any relief that a court can, but you should note that arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings.
Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.
Any proceeding to enforce this arbitration agreement, including any proceeding to confirm, modify, or vacate an arbitration award, may be commenced in any court of competent jurisdiction.
If this arbitration agreement is for any reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against RTN (except for small-claims court actions) may be commenced only in the federal or state courts located in Orange County, California.
You hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such purposes.
No Waiver

Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
If any provision of the Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms of Use remain in full force and effect.

Termination

RTN may terminate, change, suspend or discontinue any aspect of the Services at any time.
RTN may restrict, suspend or terminate your access to the Services if we believe you are in breach of our Terms of Use, Privacy Policy or applicable law, or for any other reason without notice or liability.
Additionally, RTN may terminate the privileges of users who are repeat infringers of intellectual property rights.
