All recurring Fees (including without limitation, as applicable to the Contract(s): platform fees, support fees, and bundled use allotment fees (e.g.
for transcoding, streaming, delivery, processed content, storage, etc.)) are due and payable in advance, all usage-based fees (e.g., for transcoding, streaming, delivery, processed content, storage, etc.
in lieu of or in excess of the prepaid allotments, as applicable) are due and payable monthly in arrears, and all non-recurring Fees (e.g.
pursuant to statement(s) of work) are due and payable on the effective date of the order unless otherwise stated in a particular statement of work.
Any unused portions of included and/or bundled use allotments that may be stated in the Contract(s) (including without limitation use allotments relating to streams, transcoding, processed content, and/or delivery) will expire at the end of each time increment stated in the Contract(s) and will not rollover to subsequent timeframes or time increments.
If a payment fails multiple times, the subscription will be deactivated and all videos unpublished.
You will be notified about this by email and have another 7 days to contact us and solve the issue.
After that period, all videos will be deleted and due payments sent to a collecting agency.
Flowplayer will not be held responsible for any damage this might cause to your business, or any costs for reuploading videos afterwards.

Flowplayer may, with or without notice, suspend access to the Services and/or terminate the Contract(s) if You are delinquent in paying all or any portion of the Fees.

In addition, You will be liable for any collection costs (including without limitation attorneys fees and other legal fees and expenses, collection agency fees and expenses, court costs, collection bonds, and reasonable staff costs at standard billing rates for time spent in efforts to collect) incurred by Flowplayer and/or its Agents to collect sums due and owing under the Contract(s).

If any provision of a Contract, including without limitation these Terms of Service is held unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable and such decision shall not affect the enforceability of such provision under other circumstances, or of the remaining provisions hereof under all circumstances.
