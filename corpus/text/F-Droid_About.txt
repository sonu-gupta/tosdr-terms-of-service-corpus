 Terms, etc.
F-Droid is a non-profit volunteer project.
Although every effort is made to ensure that
everything in the repository is safe to install, you use it AT YOUR OWN
RISK.
Wherever possible, applications in the repository are built from
source, and that source code is checked for potential security or privacy
issues.
This checking is far from exhaustive though, and there are no
guarantees.
F-Droid respects your privacy.
We donât track you, or your device.
We donât
track what you install.
You donât need an account to use the client, and it
sends no additional identifying data when talking to our web server other
than its version number.
We donât even allow you to install other
applications from the repository that track you, unless you first enable
âTrackingâ in the AntiFeatures section of preferences.
Any personal data you
decide to give us (e.g.
your email address when registering for an account
to post on the forum) goes no further than us, and will not be used for
anything other than allowing you to maintain your account. Contributors The F-Droid project was founded in 2010 by Ciaran Gultnieks, and is brought
