The California Consumer Privacy Act (âCCPAâ) gives California residents the right to opt- out of the âsaleâ of their personal information.
 

Interest-based Advertising Opt-Outs

 
Certain NBCUniversal brands feature interest-based advertising.
Advertising, including interested-based advertising, enables these NBCUniversal brands to provide you certain content for free and offers that are more relevant to you.
The CCPA broadly defines âsaleâ of personal information in a way that may include allowing third parties to receive certain information to add to a profile about your device, browser, or you.
This profile enables interest-based advertising on applicable NBCUniversal services and other online services.
 

Advertising Opt-Out Tools

 
The Digital Advertising Alliance (âDAAâ) provides you with a choice as to whether participating third parties can use your information to provide interest-based advertising.
To opt out of sharing your information with such participating third parties for interest-based advertising, please use the following tools:

For websites: the DAA WebChoices Tool, available at http://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN.
For mobile applications and connected devices, such as smart TVs or streaming devices, you should review the deviceâs settings and select the option that allows you to disable automatic content recognition or ad tracking.&nbsp.
Typically, to opt out, such devices require you to select options like âlimit ad trackingâ or to disable options such as âinterest-based advertising,â âinteractive TV,â or âsmart interactivityâ.&nbsp.
These settings vary by device type. 

When enabling advertising opt-out tools please understand the following:

The opt-outs described above are device and browser based.
