This Privacy Notice should be read in conjunction with the Terms of Service that apply to each BECU website, including but not limited to the BECU Website Terms and Conditions and the BECU MIX Terms of Use.
When you use our financial services or otherwise provide us with your personal information, you consent to our collection, use, and sharing of the data as described in this Privacy Notice.
