Arbitration Agreement and Waiver of Certain Rights
Arbitration: You and Cameo agree to resolve any disputes between you and Cameo through binding and final arbitration instead of through court proceedings.
You and Cameo each hereby waive any right to a jury trial of any controversy, claim, counterclaim, or other dispute arising between you and Cameo relating to these Terms or our Site (each a âClaim,â and collectively, âClaimsâ).
Any Claim will be submitted for binding arbitration in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association (âAAA Rulesâ).
The arbitration will be heard and determined by a single arbitrator.
The arbitratorâs decision will be in writing, will include the arbitratorâs reasons for the decision, will be final and binding upon the parties, and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.
The parties agree that the arbitration will be kept confidential and that the existence of the proceeding and any element of it (including any pleadings, briefs, or other documents submitted or exchanged, any testimony or other oral submissions, and awards) will not be disclosed beyond the arbitration proceedings, except as may lawfully be required in judicial proceedings relating to the arbitration or by applicable disclosure rules and regulations of securities regulatory authorities or other governmental agencies.
Costs and Fees: If you demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Cameo will pay as much of the administrative costs and arbitratorâs fees required for the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the cost of the arbitration from being prohibitive.
In the final award, the arbitrator may apportion the costs of arbitration and the compensation of the arbitrator among the parties in such amounts as the arbitrator deems appropriate.
No Preclusions: This arbitration agreement does not preclude you or Cameo from seeking action by federal, state, or local government agencies.
You and Cameo each also have the right to bring any qualifying Claim in small claims court.
In addition, you and Cameo each retain the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for provisional relief, including pre-arbitral attachments or preliminary injunctions, and any such request will not be deemed to be either incompatible with these Terms or a waiver of the right to have disputes submitted to arbitration as provided in these Terms.
No Class Representative or Private Attorney General: You and Cameo each agree that with respect to any Claim, neither may: (i) act as a class representative or private attorney general, or (ii) participate as a member of a class of claimants.
You agree that no Claim may be arbitrated on a class or representative basis.
The arbitrator can decide only individual Claims (whether brought by you or Cameo).
The arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated.
Severability/No Waiver/Survival: If any provision of this Section 17 is found to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be deemed appropriately modified to give effect to the intent of the provision or, if modification is not possible, will be severed and the remainder of this Section 17 will continue in full force and effect.
No waiver of any provision of this Section 17 will be effective or enforceable unless recorded in a writing signed by the party waiving such a right or requirement.
Such a waiver will not waive or affect any other provision of these Terms.
This Section 17 will survive the termination of your relationship with Cameo.
30-Day Opt-Out Right: You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending, within 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement, written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: Baron App, Inc.
dba Cameo, 2045 West Grand Avenue, Suite B, PMB 71534, Chicago, IL 60612-1577.
Your notice must include your name and address, any usernames, each email address you have used to submit your CAMEO Video requests or set up an account on our Site (if applicable), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement.
You agree that if you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of these Terms will continue to apply to you.
Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.

LIMITATIONS: This 
Section 17
 limits certain rights, including the right to maintain certain court actions, the right to a jury trial, the right to participate in any form of class or representative claim, the right to engage in discovery except as provided in AAA rules, and the right to certain remedies and forms of relief.
In addition, other rights that you or Cameo would have in court may not be available in arbitration.

Other Provisions

Force Majeure: Under no circumstances will any Cameo Party be liable for any delay or failure in performance due in whole or in part to any acts of God (such as earthquakes, storms, floods, etc.), epidemics, natural disasters, unavoidable accidents, internet and communication service interruptions, laws, rules, regulations or orders of government authorities, acts of war (declared or not), terrorism, hostilities, blockades, civil disturbances, embargoes, strikes, or any other event or cause beyond the reasonable control of any Cameo Party.

Choice of Law and Jurisdiction: These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois, without giving effect to any conflict of laws rules or provisions.
You agree that any action of whatever nature arising from or relating to these Terms or our Site will be filed only in the state or federal courts located in Chicago, Illinois.
You consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of any such action.

Severability: If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be deemed appropriately modified to give effect to the intent of the provision or, if modification is not possible, will be severed from these Terms and will not affect the enforceability of any other provision.

No Waiver or Amendment: The failure by Cameo to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not prevent Cameo from enforcing such right or provision in the future and will not be deemed to modify these Terms.


Assignment: Cameo may, at any time, assign its rights and obligations under these Terms, including to an affiliated entity or in connection with a sale of assets, merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, other transaction, or by operation of law.

Miscellaneous: The term âincludingâ in these Terms will be interpreted broadly and will mean âincluding, without limitation.â Titles are for convenience only and will not be considered when interpreting these Terms.

Last Updated: April 13, 2020
â
These Additional Terms (which are Additional Terms as described in Section 5 of the Site Terms of Service (âSite Termsâ) govern your use of the Customer Referral Program (defined below).
âYouâ and âUserâ refers to you as a user of the Site and of the Customer Referral Program.

We provide each User who has created a Site account with a unique referral URL (âURLâ) that may be shared with the Userâs friends, family members, or other personal contacts and used by them when they create a User Site account for the first time, pursuant to the terms set out below (âCustomer Referral Programâ).
Participation in the Customer Referral Program is limited to: (a) each User.
and (b) Userâs friends, family members, or personal contacts who have never either: (i) purchased a Cameo Video, DM, or Sticker (even without creating a Site account); or(ii) created a Site account.
Employees, officers, directors, contractors, agents, and representatives of Cameo may not participate.
For each eligible friend, family member, or personal contact who creates a User Site account for the first time using your URL (each, a âReferred Userâ), Cameo will issue a one-time credit to the Referred User and, after the Referred Userâs first purchase of a Cameo Video priced at the minimum amount specified or more, to you (each, a âCustomer Referral Creditâ) as described below:


After the Referred User creates a Site account, Cameo will issue a Customer Referral Credit to the Referred Userâs Site account (in approximately one or two business days).
and
After the Referred User makes their first request on the Site for a Cameo Video priced at the minimum amount specified or more (a Cameo Video only.
not a Cameo Direct, Sticker, or merchandise) and that request is paid for and fulfilled (excluding any Cameo Video for which a promo code was used and, at Cameoâs discretion, that was subject to a promotion), Cameo will issue a Customer Referral Credit for that Referred User to the referring Userâs (your) account (in approximately one or two business days from the date on which the request for the Cameo video was fulfilled).


Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in these Additional Terms, you acknowledge and agree that:


a new User will not be one of your Referred Users under the Customer Referral Program and no Customer Referral Credit will be due to that new User or you if:


your URL is not used when a new User creates a new Site account;
your friend, family member, or personal contact has previously either purchased a Cameo Video, DM, or Sticker (with or without creating a Site account) or created a Site account, (with or without another URL), whether or not, in either case, under the same or different name or email address, or otherwise.
or
anyone else has received or is receiving a Customer Referral Credit in connection with that friend, family member, or personal contact.



each new User may have only one referring User, and we are not obligated to pay more than one Customer Referral Credit to each Referred User for creation of a Site account or to pay a Customer Referral Credit to more than one referring User with respect to any Referred User.


Any Customer Referral Credit received from Cameo will be maintained in your Site account and may be redeemed only for your purchase of a Cameo Video, DM, or Sticker (not Cameo merchandise) from our Site.
If your Site account has a credit balance when you make a purchase while logged into your Site account, the balance will be redeemed for that purchase (until fully redeemed) and your payment card will be charged for any remaining portion of the purchase price.
any remaining balance will remain in your Site account to be redeemed for your next purchase.
If you have a credit balance in your Site account, you may not use a promo code and, at Cameoâs discretion, might not be able to participate in an offering that is subject to a promotion.
A credit balance is not refundable, may not be redeemed for cash, cannot be transferred, cannot be used outside of the Site, and expires or extinguishes immediately when redeemed.
The Customer Referral Program may be used only for personal purposes and you may share your URL only with your personal connections.
You may not advertise your URL or share it with anyone other than your friends, family, or other personal contacts.
The Customer Referral Program cannot be used for any commercial purpose, including affiliate lead generation.
The Customer Referral Program is void where prohibited by law.
You represent and warrant that when you share your URL with your personal connections, you will: (a) distribute it in a personal manner.
(b) not distribute it in a bulk manner.
and (c) not create or send any unsolicited commercial email or a âspamâ message under any applicable law or regulation.
Any sharing that does not meet these requirements is expressly prohibited and constitutes grounds for immediate termination of your Site account, including deletion of any Customer Referral Credits, and your participation in the Customer Referral Program.
Any Site account created using a URL that was distributed through an unauthorized channel will not be valid and any Customer Referral Fees issued in connection with that Site account may be revoked.
We reserve the right to deactivate your Site account and any Referred Userâs Site account, cancel all related Customer Referral Credits, and seek repayment, if we determine, in our sole discretion, that either you or the Referred User has: (a) tampered with the Customer Referral Program.
(b) used (or attempted to use) the Customer Referral Program in a fraudulent, abusive, unethical, unsportsmanlike, or otherwise questionable or suspicious manner.
(c) breached any of these Additional Terms.
or (d) violated any law or regulation or infringed or violated the rights of any third party.
Credits do not expire, but the terms of the Customer Referral Program are subject to change at any time, for any reason, in our sole discretion.
Cameo reserves, at any time, for any reason, in its sole discretion to:


suspend or terminate the Customer Referral Program;
disqualify anyone from participating in the Customer Referral Program.
and
revoke, refuse to issue, or refuse to redeem any Customer Referral Credits that we suspect were generated through improper channels or in violation of these Additional Terms.

Without limiting the foregoing, we reserve the right to review and investigate activities undertaken in connection with the Customer Referral Program and suspend your Site account, revoke all Customer Referral Fees, or take other action in our sole discretion.

By participating in the Customer Referral Program, you agree to release and hold harmless Cameo Parties from and against any and all economic liabilities, claims, damages, loss, harm, costs, or expenses, including property damage, that arise from or relate in any way to the Customer Referral Program.

â Return to TopCAMEO PASS AND CAMEO NFTS
Last Updated: February 11, 2022
â
These Additional Terms apply to your ownership and use of a Cameo Pass or any other non-fungible token issued by Cameo(a âCameo NFTâ) and all of the Cameo products, services, features, events, opportunities, offerings, and benefits available to you when you own a Cameo NFT (âCameo Privilegesâ).
â


Ownership of Cameo NFTs.


Each Cameo NFT is a unique, non-fungible token recorded on the designated blockchain for that NFT.
The Cameo Pass is hosted on the Ethereum blockchain.
The designated blockchain acts as a public, decentralized ledger system that records transfer, purchase, sale, and ownership of digital assets, including Cameo NFTs.
To transfer, purchase, sell, or own Cameo NFTs you must set up, maintain, and agree to the terms and conditions of one of the supported third party electronic wallets, such as MetaMask or Coinbase Wallet and may also need to maintain an account with third party providers and agree to their terms and conditions.
Whenever proof of purchase or ownership of a Cameo NFT is rightfully recorded on the designated blockchain, the then-currently recorded owner is deemed to own a Cameo NFT and receives a license and other benefits under these Additional Terms, subject to the ownerâs compliance with the obligations and limits described below.
Current ownership of a Cameo NFT, as rightfully recorded on the designated blockchain, entitles the owner to certain Cameo Privileges as described on Cameoâs Site.
From time to time, Cameo may add or change Cameo Privileges in its sole discretion and without notice.
In addition, access to some Cameo Privileges may include other requirements or limitations for participation.
For instance, attendance at some events or access to some opportunities may be limited to a maximum number of participants and to Cameo NFT owners who meet age, residency, or other requirements and limitations.
You may transfer or sell a Cameo NFT provided that:


 you are the current owner of the Cameo NFT;
the transfer, purchase, sale, or ownership of the Cameo NFT does not violate any applicable laws;
you make the new owner, purchaser, or transferee of the Cameo NFT aware of these Additional Terms.
and

you acknowledge and agree that all transfers, purchases, or sales are subject to the automatic fee that is encoded in the smart contract associated with the Cameo NFT.
for secondary sales of Cameo Pass or other Cameo NFTs, Cameo receives a fee of up to 10% of the gross amount paid by the purchaser, exclusive of any fees, âgas,â or other amount



Assumption of Risk.
When you acquire a Cameo NFT, you acknowledge and agree that:


Each Cameo NFT is recorded on the designated blockchain for that Cameo NFT.
Cameo does not own, operate, or maintain the blockchain, payment system(s), electronic wallets, NFT marketplaces, or any other third party systems involved in transferring, purchasing, selling, maintaining, or owning Cameo NFTs.
We cannot guarantee and have no responsibility for the operation of any of those systems or any other third party platform.
Digital assets, NFTs (including Cameo NFTs), cryptocurrencies, and blockchains are new and experimental technologies, and the security and regulation of these technologies is continually evolving and accompanied by inherent risks.
Because these technologies are highly experimental, risky, volatile, and may have no inherent value, your purchase of a Cameo NFT, whether through the Cameo platform or through a third party marketplace, may carry substantial financial risk, including the risk of loss in trading NFTs, other digital assets, or cryptocurrency.
When you purchase or otherwise acquire a Cameo NFT, you represent that you have sufficient knowledge, sophistication, and experience with respect to NFTs, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology to make your own evaluation of the risks of the transaction.
Under no circumstances should Cameoâs provision of any product or service, or promotion or statements about any Cameo NFT be construed as providing investment advice.

Cameo NFTs are not, are not based upon, and do not constitute an entitlement to any physical goods or real property, fractionalized ownership of any asset, an investment, security or other financial instrument (including anything governed by securities laws), currency(ies), or virtual currency(ies).
You are solely responsible for: (i) determining whether your transfer, purchase, sale, ownership, or use of a Cameo NFTs requires the payment of any taxes and (ii) the payment of any applicable taxes.
When you acquire or own a Cameo NFT, you are doing so voluntarily and at your own risk.
Cameo issues Cameo NFTs, makes Cameo NFTs available for purchase, licenses certain rights to the owner of a Cameo NFT, and provides Cameo Privileges on an âas isâ basis, and expressly disclaims any warranties or conditions of any kind, whether express or implied, including any warranties or conditions of title, non-infringement, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose, as set forth in Section 17 of the Site Terms.



Ownership of Artwork and Brand.
Each Cameo NFT embodies specific digital content (âArtworkâ) and may contain trademarks, logos, publicity rights, other intellectual property, and brand elements ( collectively, âBrandâ) owned or created by Cameo or its licensors, who may include Talent Users, artists, partners, or other third parties.
Cameo and its licensors own all right, title, and interest in and to the Artwork, Brand, and all intellectual property rights embodied by a Cameo NFT.
No ownership (or license not specifically provided herein) of the Artwork and Brand is transferred with a Cameo NFT.
instead the then-current owner of a Cameo NFT is granted only the limited rights as expressly permitted by the license below.
Cameo and its licensors reserve all rights that are not expressly granted by the license below.




License.


Subject to your compliance with these Additional Terms, as well as our Acceptable Use Policy / Community Guidelines, Cameo grants you a non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid, worldwide, revocable license to use and display the Cameo NFT, including the Artwork and Brand solely as embodied by the specific Cameo NFT, and solely for the following purposes:


 for your own personal, non-commercial, and non-promotional purposes, including display in a virtual gallery, on mobile devices or personal computers, as an online avatar, or in your home;
 for transfer, purchase, or sale through the Cameo platform, or a third-party marketplace, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies ownership to ensure that only the then-current owner may offer the Cameo NFT for transfer, purchase, or sale;
for display or use of your Cameo NFTs on the Cameo platform or a third party website or application, provided that the third party (A) cryptographically verifies ownership to ensure that only the then-current owner may display the Cameo NFT.
and (B) removes the Cameo NFT, Artwork, and Brand from display whenever ownership of the Cameo NFT changes or the then-current owner stops using the website/application.
or

to access Cameo Privileges.


You may sub-license the above rights only as strictly necessary for you to use a Cameo NFT as expressly permitted by this license.
This license:


is automatically transferred with the lawful ownership of the Cameo NFT and is otherwise non-transferrable.
and

 does not include any rights to: (A) edit, change, modify, or create derivative works of the Artwork, or (B) use the Cameo NFT, Artwork, or Brand in connection with the creation of other NFTs or for any purpose other than those expressly permitted by these Additional Terms.


You may not use or attempt to register any asset, including any domain name, social media account or related address, that contains or incorporates the Cameo NFT, Artwork, Brand, or any other trademark, logo, name, intellectual property, or brand element that may be confusingly similar to any of Cameoâs or its licensorsâ intellectual property.




Restrictions.




You must be at least 18 years of age (or the legal age of majority under applicable law) to purchase or own a Cameo NFT.
You may not sell or transfer a Cameo NFT to anyone who is not at least 18 (or the legal age of majority under applicable law).

Access to Cameo Privileges and the license and any other rights granted to the owner of a Cameo NFT under these Additional Terms will immediately and automatically terminate and revert to Cameo without any notice to you, and you will have no further rights in the Cameo NFT, Artwork, or Brand embodied by that Cameo NFT, if:



you transfer, sell, or otherwise dispose of a Cameo NFT for any reason or any new owner is lawfully recorded on the designated blockchain for the Cameo NFT;

your transfer, purchase, sale, ownership, or use of a Cameo NFT is determined to be illegal or in violation of applicable law.
or

your transfer, purchase, sale, ownership, or use of a Cameo NFT may reasonably breach these Site Terms, including Cameoâs Acceptable Use Policy / Community Guidelines, or you use, or cause or permit the use of, the Cameo NFT, Artwork or Brand in any manner that disparages Cameo, its products or services, the Cameo NFT, Cameoâs licensors, including Talent, and/or you associate, or cause or permit the association of, any of the foregoing with any mark, content, other intellectual property, product or service in a manner that Cameo, in its sole discretion, deems objectionable.



If Cameo in its sole discretion questions the ownership or use of a Cameo NFT, Cameo may suspend your access to the rights and license provided by these Additional Terms, including the right to use and display Cameo NFTs, the Artwork, and/or Brand, and/or deny you access to Cameo Privileges, until such time as the ownership of the Cameo NFT has been reasonably established, as determined by Cameo in its sole discretion.

You acknowledge and agree that you will not, and you will not assist or encourage any third party to do or attempt to do any of the following (unless, in each case, you have Cameoâs express prior written approval):



edit, change, or modify the Cameo NFT, Artwork, or Brand, including the shapes, designs, drawings, attributes, or colors;

commercialize or use the Artwork or Brand in any way other than (A) use as your avatar or profile picture on third-party websites and social media platforms.
(B) to accurately describe the Cameo NFT in connection with your offer to transfer or sell it.
or (C) for a Talent User, to promote, commercialize, and sell products or services on the Cameo platform, including CAMEO Videos;

claim, assert, or seek to register any intellectual property rights in the Cameo NFT, the Artwork, or Brand whether or not associated with your Cameo NFT.
or

use the Cameo NFT, Artwork, or Brand in connection with an activity that violates Cameoâs Acceptable User Policy / Community Guidelines.



These restrictions will survive the expiration or termination of the licenses granted hereunder.

Cameo VideosFrom time to time, a user of our Site (âUserâ) may request one or more video recordings (each, a âCAMEO Videoâ) from you through our Site.

While we hope you will fulfill a request within 48 hours of receiving it, you may have up to seven days (at Cameoâs sole discretion) to complete and upload the CAMEO Video.
If you do not either: (i) accept the request and upload the CAMEO Video.
or (ii) decline the request.
the request will expire and can no longer be fulfilled (except that you may fulfill the expired request at no cost to the User and with no payment due from us).
You may decline a request or otherwise refuse, in your discretion, to create or upload a CAMEO Video if a Userâs request is objectionable or otherwise offensive to you.
If you accept a request, you agree to record and upload to our Site one CAMEO Video.
Cameo retains the right, in its sole discretion, to cancel any request from a User.
No payment will be made to you for any declined, cancelled, or unfulfilled CAMEO Video request.
Each CAMEO Video will be approximately :30 in duration and will follow the general directions and requests of the User (for example, birthday message, congratulatory message, or âGood luck!â message).
You will have sole discretion over the script and content of any CAMEO Video, except that you agree: (i) you will use your name (please introduce yourself), the Userâs name, and the name of any third party that the User identifies as a recipient (âRecipientâ) in each CAMEO Video, unless otherwise requested by the User.
and (ii) you will not state in the CAMEO Video that the CAMEO Video is incomplete or cannot be completed.
Your response to the Userâs request is your responsibility and at your discretion, subject to these Terms.
however, Users are usually happiest when at least the majority of their request is followed by a Talent User.
If you complete a CAMEO Video but do not follow the general directions and requests of the User, we will discuss with you an appropriate adjustment of the payment made to you.

Talent Referral Program
We offer Talent Users and others who register on our Site as a talent referral source (âCameo Partnerâ) the opportunity to provide their friends, families, or other personal contacts the unique referral code we provide you (âCodeâ) that a prospective talent user may use to apply to register as a talent user on our Site (âReferral Programâ). To participate in the Referral Program, you must agree to the following Talent Referral Program Terms (âReferral Termsâ), as well as the rest of these Terms:


Cameo reserves the right to suspend or terminate the Referral Program or your participation in the Referral Program at any time for any reason.
Without limiting the foregoing, we reserve the right to disqualify anyone from participating in the Referral Program at any time at our sole discretion.
A violation of the Referral Terms may also result in the forfeiture of all Referral Fees (defined below) you earned through the Referral Program.
We reserve the right to review and investigate activities undertaken in connection with the Referral Program and suspend your Site account, modify the Referral Fee, or take other action in our sole discretion.
Eligibility to participate in this Referral Program is limited to individuals who have registered an account on our Site as a Talent User or Cameo Partner.
The Referral Program cannot be used for affiliate lead generation or other commercial purposes.
Employees, officers, directors, contractors, agents, and representatives of Cameo may not participate in the Referral Program.
For every new user whose application to register as a Talent User on our Site using your Code is accepted in writing by Cameo (âReferred Talentâ), Cameo will pay you, for one year, beginning as of the date that the Referred Talent first created an account as a Talent User on our Site using your Code, 5% of the Booking Fee actually received by Cameo, except that in the case of a Booking Fee paid through the App, it is 5% of the Net App Booking Fee, for each CAMEO Video the Referred Talent creates and delivers to fulfill a Userâs request accepted through our Site during that one-year period (excluding any CAMEO Video for which no revenue was earned, and, at Cameoâs discretion, any CAMEO Video to which a promotion applies or for which a promo code was used) (âReferral Feeâ).
The Referral Fee is based on the Booking Fee or Net App Booking Fee but is paid from Cameoâs share of the revenue (as described in Section 4.b) and will be paid as described in Section 4.d.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in these Terms, you acknowledge and agree that if a new user does not use your Code when applying to register, has previously registered on our Site (with another code, under another name, or otherwise), has previously begun the on-boarding process for our Site, or if anyone else has received or is receiving a Referral Fee from us in connection with that user, no Referral Fee will be due to you.
You further acknowledge and agree that each Referred Talent may have only one referring person or entity, and that we are not obligated to pay a Referral Fee to more than one referring person or entity with respect to any Referred Talent.
This Referral Program may be used only for personal purposes and you may share your Code only with your personal connections.
You may not advertise your Code or share it with anyone other than your friends, family, or other personal contacts (for example, you may not share it on a social media channel).
We reserve the right to revoke or refuse to issue any Referral Fees for Referred Talent that we suspect were generated through improper channels or otherwise in violation of these Referral Terms.
You represent and warrant that any messages you use to share your Code with your personal connections will: (i) be created and distributed in a personal manner.
(ii) not be distributed in a bulk manner.
and (iii) not be an unsolicited commercial email or a âspamâ message under any applicable law or regulation.
Any messages that do not meet these requirements are expressly prohibited and constitute grounds for immediate termination of your Site account and participation in this Referral Program.
Registrations on our Site by a Talent User using a Code that was distributed through an unauthorized channel will not be valid and any Referral Fees issued in connection with such transactions may be revoked.
We reserve the right to deactivate your Site account and any Referred Talentâs Site account, cancel all related Referral Fees, and seek repayment, if we determine, in our sole discretion, that either you or the Referred Talent: (i) has tampered with this Referral Program.
(ii) has used (or attempted to use) this Referral Program in a fraudulent, abusive, unethical, unsportsmanlike, or otherwise questionable or suspicious manner.
(iii) has breached any of these Referral Terms.
or (iv) has violated any law or regulation or infringed or violated the rights of any third party.
We also reserve the right to cancel this Referral Program or change these Referral Terms at any time and for any reason in our sole discretion.
As of the effective date of these Terms and notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Talent User may become an Affiliated Talent to an Organization, subject to Cameoâs prior approval, by: (i) confirming in writing, in the form provided by Cameo, that the Organization is its representative.
and (ii) the Organization registering the Talent User as its Affiliated Talent.
The Organization will be deemed a Cameo Partner and the Affiliated Talent will be deemed a Referred Talent under these Referral Terms.
The Organization (as a Cameo Partner) will be entitled to the Referral Fee set forth in Section 5.c as of the date the Talent User becomes an Affiliated Talent.
By participating in the Referral Program, you agree to release and hold harmless Cameo Parties from and against any and all economic liabilities, claims, damages, loss, harm, costs, or expenses, including property damage, that arise from or relate in any way to the Referral Program.
THIS SECTION 5.h APPLIES ONLY TO ECONOMIC DAMAGES AND DOES NOT APPLY TO CLAIMS OF FRAUD OR PERSONAL INJURY.

Arbitration Agreement and Waiver of Certain Rights
Arbitration: You and Cameo agree to resolve any disputes between you and Cameo through binding and final arbitration instead of through court proceedings.
You and Cameo each hereby waive any right to a jury trial of any controversy, claim, counterclaim, or other dispute arising between you and Cameo relating to these Terms or our Site (each a âClaim,â and collectively, âClaimsâ).
Any Claim will be submitted for binding arbitration in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association (âAAA Rulesâ).
The arbitration will be heard and determined by a single arbitrator.
The arbitratorâs decision will be in writing, will include the arbitratorâs reasons for the decision, will be final and binding upon the parties, and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.
The parties agree that the arbitration will be kept confidential and that the existence of the proceeding and any element of it (including any pleadings, briefs or other documents submitted or exchanged, any testimony or other oral submissions, and awards) will not be disclosed beyond the arbitration proceedings, except as may lawfully be required in judicial proceedings relating to the arbitration or by applicable disclosure rules and regulations of securities regulatory authorities or other governmental agencies.
Costs and Fees: If you demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Cameo will pay as much of the administrative costs and arbitratorâs fees required for the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the cost of the arbitration from being prohibitive.
In the final award, the arbitrator may apportion the costs of arbitration and the compensation of the arbitrator among the parties in such amounts as the arbitrator deems appropriate.
No Preclusions: This arbitration agreement does not preclude you or Cameo from seeking action by federal, state, or local government agencies.
You and Cameo each also have the right to bring any qualifying Claim in small claims court.
In addition, you and Cameo each retain the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for provisional relief, including pre-arbitral attachments or preliminary injunctions, and any such request will not be deemed to be either incompatible with these Terms or a waiver of the right to have disputes submitted to arbitration as provided in these Terms.
No Class Representative or Private Attorney General: Each of you and Cameo agree that with respect to any Claim, neither may: (i) act as a class representative or private attorney general.
or (ii) participate as a member of a class of claimants.
You agree that no Claim may be arbitrated on a class or representative basis.
The arbitrator can decide only individual Claims (whether brought by you or Cameo).
The arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated.
Severability/No Waiver/Survival: If any provision of this Section 19 is found to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be deemed appropriately modified to give effect to the intent of the provision or, if modification is not possible, will be severed and the remainder of this Section 19 will continue in full force and effect.
No waiver of any provision of this Section 19 will be effective or enforceable unless recorded in a writing signed by the party waiving such a right or requirement.
Such a waiver will not waive or affect any other provision of these Terms.
This Section 19 will survive the termination of your relationship with Cameo.

Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.

LIMITATIONS: This 
Section 19
 limits certain rights, including the right to maintain certain court actions, the right to a jury trial, the right to participate in any form of class or representative claim, the right to engage in discovery except as provided in AAA rules, and the right to certain remedies and forms of relief.
In addition, other rights that you or Cameo would have in court may not be available in arbitration.
