Our Legal Bases for processing data
In order to provide our services, Logically collects and stores personal data about its users on the legal basis of consent given when you create an account and agree to the Privacy Policy.
Logically also pursues its legitimate interests by collecting minimal data of logged out users to provide the services, as outlined above.
Where Logically collects and stores personal data about non-users, it does so under performance of contract obligations with users who use the services to publish content on web sites hosted by Logically.
In such cases, users authoring such content containing personal data of third parties are responsible for that content.
Logically will consider related complaints in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulationâs rights of the data subject, as well as rights of expression and access to information.

Logged-in users may choose to interact publicly with the Logically Services through using the site's comment function.
Where such personal data may reveal special category protected data, it is processed on the basis that it is manifestly made public by the user, although it is advised that users do not share such data through commenting.
Additional information on potential consequences of such processing can be found below.
If you don't agree to this public usage, do not create an account or use these features of Logically's Services.
