Copyright Counter-Notice:
If you believe that your content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) pursuant to a Digital Millennium Copyright Act notice we received is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to law, to post and use the content in your content, you may send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Copyright Agent at the address listed above:
Your physical or electronic signature;
Identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled;
A statement that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the content.
and
Your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court in Stanislaus County, California, USA, and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.
If a counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent, Save Mart may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed content or cease disabling it in 10 business days.
Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member or user, the removed content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Save Martâs sole discretion.
Disputes:
Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of the Sites will be resolved by binding arbitration in the federal judicial district in which you reside in California or Nevada, except to the extent that you have, in any way, violated or threatened to violate any Save Mart intellectual property right.
Any Site visitor who intends to seek arbitration must first send to Save Mart by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (âNoticeâ).
The Notice must be mailed to Save Mart Supermarkets, PO Box 4278 Modesto, California 95352&nbsp.
Attn: General Counsel/Arbitration Demand.
The Notice shall describe the nature and basis of the claim or disputes and the specific relief sought.
If we cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may commence arbitration.
All arbitrations required by these Terms will be conducted under the rules then prevailing of the American Arbitration Association.
The arbitratorâs award is binding and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law no arbitration brought under, or with respect to, the Sites (including, without limitation, any Save Mart advertisement or disclosure, any email or text message or other communication  that Save Mart sends to or has with you, or the collection or use of any information about you in connection with the Site), these Terms or your status as a Site visitor is to be joined to an arbitration involving any other party subject to these Terms whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise.
Unless Save Mart and you agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one Site visitorâs claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, private attorney general or class proceeding.
For arbitration claims you assert against Save Mart in accordance with this section (but not for any arbitration claim against you), Save Mart will pay all of your administrative, hearing, and arbitratorâs fees and costs for the arbitration (but not the fees, expenses, and costs of your lawyers, experts, or witnesses) in excess of any filing fee you would have been required to pay to file the claim as a lawsuit in a state or federal court (whichever is greater) in the judicial district in which you reside in California or Nevada.
 Unless unlawful, Save Mart will pay its, and you will pay your, lawyersâ, expertsâ, and witness fees, expenses, and costs with respect to all claims.
The arbitrator may award money or equitable relief in favor of only the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that partyâs individual claim.
Similarly, an arbitration award and any judgment confirming it apply only to that specific case.
it cannot be used in any other case except to enforce the award itself.
To reduce the time and expense of the arbitration, the arbitrator will not provide a statement of reasons for his or her award unless requested to do so by all parties.
To the extent permitted by law, you will not agree to act as a representative or a private attorney general, or in any other representative capacity, or participate as a member of a class of claimants in any lawsuit against Save Mart in any court, or in arbitration, with respect to any claims relating in any way to the Site (including without limitation Save Mart advertisements and disclosures, email and text messages Save Mart sends to you, or relating to the collection or use of any information about you in connection with the Site), these Terms, or your status as a Site visitor.
This section (confidential arbitration) will survive the termination of the relationship between you and Save Mart.
Save Mart or you may seek injunctive relief in any state or federal court in Stanislaus County, California, USA, (or the nearest such California county if such court is not located Stanislaus County, California) and Company and you consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts as described herein for injunctive relief purposes.
If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial.
We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
