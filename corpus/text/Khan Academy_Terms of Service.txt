THE WEBSITE IS NOT AVAILABLE TO (A) ANY USERS PREVIOUSLY SUSPENDED OR REMOVED FROM THE WEBSITE BY KHAN ACADEMY OR (B) ANY PERSONS UNDER THE AGE OF 13 WHOSE REGISTRATION HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED BY A LEGAL PARENT OR GUARDIAN (OR, FOR SCHOOL ACCOUNTS, BY SCHOOL PERSONNEL AS PERMITTED UNDER THE TERMS).
1.1 By clicking the "I Agree" button or by otherwise using or registering an account for the Services, you represent that (i) you are a US resident at least 13 years of age, or (ii) you are not a US resident, and are of legal age of consent to open an account under the laws of your country of residence, or (iii) your use of the Services has been approved by your parent or legal guardian, or by your school or teacher for school use.
You also represent that you have not been previously suspended or removed from the Services by Khan Academy, and that your registration and your use of the Services is in compliance with any and all applicable laws.
1.2 Account.
In order to use certain features of the Services, you must register for an account.
You may be asked to provide a password in connection with your account.
You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password.
You agree that the information you provide to Khan Academy, whether at registration or at any other time, will be true, accurate, current, and complete.
You also agree that you will ensure that this information is kept accurate and up-to-date at all times.
If you have reason to believe that your account is no longer secure (e.g., in the event of a loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure or use of your account ID or password), then you agree to immediately notify Khan Academy at khan.co/KA-support.
You may be liable for the losses incurred by Khan Academy or others due to any unauthorized use of your Services account.
1.3 Integrated Service.
Khan Academy may permit you to register for the Services through, or otherwise associate your Khan Academy account with, certain third party social networking or integrated services, such as Facebook Connect and Google ("Integrated Service").
By registering for the Services using (or otherwise granting access to) an Integrated Service, you agree that Khan Academy may access your Integrated Service's account information, and may store and use certain information already associated with the Integrated Service consistent with our Privacy Policy, and you agree to any and all terms and conditions of the Integrated Service regarding your use of the Services via the Integrated Service.
You may revoke Khan Academy's access to your account on any Integrated Service at any time by updating the appropriate account settings of the respective Integrated Service.
You should check your privacy settings on each Integration Service to understand and change the information sent to us through each Integration Service.
You agree that any Integrated Service is a Reference Site (as defined below) and you are solely responsible for your interactions with the Integrated Service as a result of accessing the Services through the Integrated Service.
Khan Academy does not control the practices of Integrated Services, and you are advised to read the Privacy Policy and terms and conditions of any Integrated Service that you use to understand their practices.
1.4 Child User.
If you are under the age of 13 (a "Child User"), you may not create or register an account for the Services without consent and approval from your legal parent or guardian, or from your school as provided in Section 1.6 ("School Use").
If you are under the age of 18, you represent that your parent or legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to the Terms on your behalf.
Except for accounts created for School Use as provided in Section 1.6, a Child User that begins the registration process for himself or herself without a Parent User (as defined below) may have the registration process restricted until a parent approves or assumes responsibility for the Child User account.
A Child User may use the Services if registered through certain educational organizations or, in certain cases, by School Personnel that have entered into a relationship directly with Khan Academy, so long as the education organization has obtained parent or guardian consent, or has complied with an exemption to parent consent requirements under applicable law.
A Child User will only be permitted to use the Services for so long as Khan Academy reasonably believes that such access has been consented to by the Child User's parent or guardian, or by School Consent (as discussed in Section 1.6, "School Use").
1.5 Parent User.
If you are at least 18 years of age and you are the legal parent or guardian of a child that seeks to register as a Child User of the Services, you may register a parent account on the Services ("Parent User").
Through a Parent User account, you may create, register, manage and approve Child User accounts only for your own child(ren) or child(ren) for whom you are a legal guardian.
IF YOU REGISTER, APPROVE OR CONSENT TO THE REGISTRATION OF, OR OTHERWISE ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY CHILD USER, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU ARE SUCH CHILD USER'S LEGAL PARENT OR GUARDIAN AND YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS ON BEHALF OF SUCH CHILD USER, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION BEING LIABLE FOR ALL USE OF THE WEBSITE BY THE CHILD USER.
You acknowledge that Khan Academy may choose, but is not obligated, to make any inquiries, either directly or through third parties, that Khan Academy deems necessary to validate your registration information, including without limitation engaging third parties to provide verification services.
Khan Academy reserves all rights to take legal actions against anyone who misrepresents personal information or is otherwise untruthful about their identity.
NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT KHAN ACADEMY CANNOT GUARANTEE THE ACCURACY OF ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY ANY USER AND KHAN ACADEMY IS NOT OBLIGATED TO VERIFY THE IDENTITY OF ANY USER, INCLUDING ANY USER'S CLAIM TO BE A PARENT USER, OR TO VERIFY THAT A PARENT IDENTIFIED BY A CHILD USER OR OTHER PARTY DURING REGISTRATION IS SUCH CHILD USER'S ACTUAL PARENT OR GUARDIAN.
A Parent User account, along with all associated Child User accounts, may be terminated by Khan Academy at any time and without warning for any failure to abide by these Terms.
1.6 School Use.
Khan Academy may make available certain features and tools that permit Users registered as teachers, school leaders, aides, or other similar school personnel ("School Personnel") to work with students and other Users through the Services in order to provide such students with tutorial, educational and other education-related services as part of the school's curriculum, and to review and evaluate educational achievement and progress of such students.
If you are School Personnel accessing the Services on behalf of a school, school district, or other similar educational institution (an "Institution"), the following terms apply to you:
(a) Limitations on Use.
The Services and Website are provided to you for educational purposes as part of the school curriculum.
You must use the Services and the Website in compliance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations.
You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or otherwise exploit for any commercial purpose, any portion of the Services, the Website, or access to the Services or Website.
(b) Responsibility for Consent and Notices.
You and/or the Institution assume sole responsibility for obtaining any consents required from parents or guardians, and for providing appropriate disclosures to School Users and their parents regarding the School Users' use of the Services, our Terms, and our Privacy Policy.
You agree to be bound by these Terms on behalf of the School User, for so long as the School User account is not transferred to or assumed by a valid Parent User account or personal account for a Student of eligible age.
IF YOU ARE SCHOOL PERSONNEL AND YOU REGISTER AN ACCOUNT FOR A CHILD USER OR OTHER STUDENT (EITHER, A "SCHOOL USER") OR DIRECT A SCHOOL USER TO CREATE AN ACCOUNT FOR SCHOOL USE, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE EITHER RECEIVED EXPRESS CONSENT FROM SUCH SCHOOL USER'S PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN OR THAT YOU (OR YOUR INSTITUTION) HAVE COMPLIED AND WILL COMPLY WITH ALL APPLICABLE REQUIREMENTS OF AN EXEMPTION FROM OR EXCEPTION TO PARENTAL CONSENT REQUIREMENTS, NECESSARY FOR YOU TO REGISTER THE SCHOOL USER FOR THE WEBSITE AND PROVIDE TO KHAN ACADEMY THE INFORMATION YOU DISCLOSE IN CONNECTION WITH THE REGISTRATION OF SUCH SCHOOL USER.
Specifically you agree, individually and on behalf of the Institution, that:
(i) You are familiar with and agree to be responsible for compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act and the US Department of Education's implementing regulations at 34 CFR Part 99 (collectively, "FERPA"), and all other laws, rules or regulations concerning the collection, use, and disclosure of personally identifiable information about Users in your Institution (collectively, "Applicable Privacy Law").
(ii) You assume sole responsibility (and hereby agree that Khan Academy is not responsible for) for providing appropriate notices and disclosures to students using Khan Academy for classroom use ("Students" or "Student Users") and their parents regarding Student use of the Website, our Terms, and our Privacy Policy, including any notices required by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"), FERPA, or other Applicable Privacy Law.
(iii) You assume sole responsibility (and hereby agree that Khan Academy is not responsible) for obtaining any consents required from parents or guardians, to the extent required under COPPA, FERPA or other Applicable Privacy Law, in connection with the Services, use of the Website for classroom use (including use of Linked Accounts referred to in Section 1.8), and disclosure of personally identifiable information to Khan Academy in connection therewith.
You represent and warrant to Khan Academy that, prior to creation of accounts for School Use, you have either obtained all necessary parent or guardian consents, or have complied and will comply with all applicable requirements of an exemption from or exception to parental consent requirements, including:
under FERPA, you have complied and will comply with the "school official" exception, or the "directory information" exception thereunder.
and
under COPPA, with respect to Students under the age of 13, you are acting as the agent of the parent and consenting on their behalf to the sharing of the Student's personal information.


We refer to this a "School Consent".
If a Parent User does not consent or rescinds such School Consent, School Personnel or the Institution shall immediately notify Khan Academy to discontinue that Student's access to the Services and ensure that such Student's information is no longer accessible through the Services.
Under no circumstances will Khan Academy be liable for the School Personnel's failure to consult their school's authorities and administrators or for failing to obtain School Consent when required.
(c) Identification of School Accounts.
Students and School Personnel may have personal accounts, in addition to accounts established for use in the classroom and associated with the Institution's use of the Services ("School Accounts").
If the Institution has a separate written service agreement with Khan Academy that includes rostering services for your Institution, accounts provided for classroom use will be School Accounts.
In other cases, in order for accounts established for use in the classroom to be designated as "School Accounts," the accounts must be (1) created by School Personnel (for example, when a teacher creates the user name, login and password to establish School Accounts, or when the teacher rosters a class using Google Classroom, Clever, or similar Integrated Service (to the extent we support use of such Integrated Service)), or (2) created by a School User at the direction of a School, in each case, using a School email address and associated with a School's class on the Service.
User accounts created with a personal email address will not be considered School Accounts, and will be administered as personal accounts.
If you have questions about how to create School Accounts that are associated with a School's class on the Service, please contact our customer support team at khan.co/KA-support.
(d) Use of Integrated Services in School Accounts.
If you are School Personnel and you choose to allow your students to log in on the Services using an Integrated Service, such as Google Classroom or Clever (to the extent we support use of such Integrated Service), you are responsible for educating your students on the proper use of Integrated Services and protecting their accounts.
See Section 1.3.


1.7 Coaches.
Khan Academy may make available certain features and tools that allow Users to add "Coaches" to their account.
(a) Coaching features are provided to allow any User to give another User, such as a tutor, friend or family member, the ability to view the activity in their Khan Academy account in order to provide them with tutoring or coaching help on Khan Academy.
In these Terms, we refer to any User that you connect to your Khan Academy account (other than School Personnel and Parent Users, who have different account permissions) as a "Coach".
A Parent User associated with a Child User can disable the coaching feature upon account creation, or in the Child's User's account settings.
(b) If you are a Coach, the following provisions apply to you.
You may use Khan Academy features and tools only for purposes of providing tutoring, coaching or other education-related assistance to a User that has an account established and existing pursuant to these Terms.
COACHES ARE NOT PERMITTED TO CREATE OR REGISTER ACCOUNTS FOR ANY OTHER USER.
In order to begin coaching relationship, the student or other User you wish to coach must either have a pre-existing account on the Services, or must establish an account pursuant to these Terms.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT REGISTRATION OF AN ACCOUNT BY OR FOR A CHILD USER REQUIRES CONSENT FROM SUCH USER'S PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN.
COACHES MAY NOT PROVIDE THIS CONSENT DIRECTLY OR ON BEHALF OF THE PARENT OR GUARDIAN.
You must use the Services and the Website in compliance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations.


1.8 Linked Accounts.
Khan Academy may permit a User to associate a personal account with their School Account, by using the login credentials associated with a personal account to join a class or use the account for school-directed learning.
If a User chooses to associate a personal account with their School Account, the two accounts will be deemed "Linked" Accounts, and the User's learning activity (information regarding use of the Website generated by the User through use of the Website), whether generated during or outside of the school use, may be viewed by any person with access to either account.
"Linked" Accounts are not separately functioning accounts.
they permit access to a singular Khan Academy account using more than one account interface or set of access credentials.
Linked Accounts may benefit Students who want to use the Website for both personal and school purposes, by allowing School Personnel to have a deeper understanding of Student progress, and by allowing Users to keep track of all of their Khan Academy learning activity on an aggregate basis.
The User's election to enable account linking must be made, if at all, in connection with the initial account registration and rostering process for a given school year.
Once accounts are linked, they cannot be separated.
Khan Academy may (but is not required to) enable linking of accounts as described herein.
Upon any termination of the School Account by authorized School Personnel, the User's learning activity (including any learning activity from school use) will be retained in any Linked personal account.
1.9 School Districts.
Khan Academy may enter into supplemental written agreements with school districts with respect to use of the Services on a district-wide basis ("District Agreements").
Pursuant to District Agreements, we may provide additional services to school districts, and/or may provide additional undertakings to school districts with respect to the Services.
Except as otherwise provided in a District Agreement, these Terms remain in effect for all individual Users of the Services in the relevant district.
1.10 Interational Use.
Khan Academy operates the Services in the United States.
If you choose to access our Services from locations outside the United States, you consent to the collection, transmission, use, storage and processing of content and data (including your personal information) in the United States.
You also agree to comply with and are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with all local laws, regulations, and rules in the jurisdiction in which you reside or access the Services, if and to the extent local laws are applicable to use of our Services.
If you are under the age of 18, you confirm that you have received parental consent, if required in your jurisdiction, to open an account for Service and enter into these Terms.
Unless we have entered into a separate, mutually executed written agreement with you that says otherwise, we do not represent that our Services are appropriate or available for use in jurisdictions outside the United States.
The right to access and use the Services is not granted in jurisdictions, if any, where it may be prohibited, or where your use would render Khan Academy in violation of any applicable laws or regulations, including without limitation, Applicable Privacy Laws.

4.2 School Accounts.
The following provisions apply to School Accounts in addition to the provisions set forth in Section 4.1 above.

If Khan Academy is notified as required, then the School Accounts held by that Institution will remain governed by the Terms in effect immediately prior to the change until the end of the end of the then current term of the Institution's written service agreement with Khan Academy, or, in the absence of such an agreement, the end of the current school term.
If the Services are renewed or continued after such time, they will be renewed or continued under Khan Academy's then-current Terms.

7.
Proprietary Materials.
Licenses

7.1 Proprietary Materials.
The Services are owned and operated by Khan Academy.
The visual interfaces, graphics, design, compilation, information, computer code (including source code or object code), software, services, content, educational videos and exercises, and all other elements of the Services (the "Services Materials") are protected by United States and international copyright, patent, and trademark laws, international conventions, and other applicable laws governing intellectual property and proprietary rights.
Except for any User Content provided and owned by Users and except as otherwise set forth in this Section 7, all Services Materials, and all trademarks, service marks, and trade names, contained on or available through the Services are owned by or licensed to Khan Academy, and Khan Academy reserves all rights therein and thereto not expressly granted by these Terms.
7.2 Licensed Educational Content.
Khan Academy may make available on the Services certain educational videos, exercises, and related supplementary materials that are owned by Khan Academy or its third-party licensors (the "Licensed Educational Content").
Khan Academy grants to you a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access and use the Licensed Educational Content as made available on the Services by Khan Academy solely for your personal, non-commercial purposes.
Unless expressly indicated on the Services that a particular item of Licensed Educational Content is made available to Users under alternate license terms, you may not download, distribute, sell, lease, modify, or otherwise provide access to the Licensed Educational Content to any third party.
(a) Alternate Licenses.
In certain cases, Khan Academy or its licensors may make available Licensed Educational Content under alternate license terms, such as a variant of the Creative Commons License (as defined below) (each, an "Alternate License").
Where expressly indicated as such on the Services, and subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms, the applicable Licensed Educational Content is licensed to you under the terms of the Alternate License.
By using, downloading, or otherwise accessing such Licensed Educational Content, you agree to comply fully with all the terms and conditions of such Alternate License.
(b) Creative Commons License.
Unless expressly otherwise identified on the Services with respect to a particular item of Licensed Educational Content, any reference to the "Creative Commons", "CC" or similarly-phrased license shall be deemed to be a reference to the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 United States License (available at creativecommons.org/licenses/) (the "Creative Commons License").


7.3 Licensed Educational Code.
Khan Academy may make available, or allow Users to create and make available, on or through the Services certain educational, user-readable source code in connection with the "Computer Science" modules or exercises available on the Services (the "Licensed Educational Code").
Unless otherwise indicated, all Licensed Educational Code is the property of Khan Academy or third-party licensors and, subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms, is licensed to you under the terms of the MIT License.
By downloading or otherwise accessing such Licensed Educational Code, you agree to comply with all the terms of the MIT License.
7.4 Non-Commercial Use.
The Licensed Educational Content and Licensed Educational Code are intended for personal, non-commercial use only.
Without limiting the foregoing, and notwithstanding the terms of any Alternate License for such Licensed Educational Content, the Licensed Educational Content may not be used, distributed or otherwise exploited for any commercial purpose, commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, unless otherwise previously agreed in writing by Khan Academy.
(a) Impermissible Uses.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following are types of uses that Khan Academy expressly defines as falling outside of "non-commercial" use:
i.
the sale or rental of (1) any part of the Licensed Educational Content, (2) any derivative works based at least in part on the Licensed Educational Content, or (3) any collective work that includes any part of the Licensed Educational Content;
ii.
providing training, support, or editorial services that use or reference the Licensed Educational Content in exchange for a fee.
and
iii.
the sale of advertisements, sponsorships, or promotions placed on the Licensed Educational Content, or any part thereof, or the sale of advertisements, sponsorships, or promotions on any website or blog containing any part of the Licensed Educational Material, including without limitation any "pop-up advertisements".


(b) Use Characterization.
Whether a particular use of the Licensed Educational Content is "non-commercial" depends on the use, not the user.
Thus, a use of the Licensed Educational Content that does not require that users pay fees and that does not provide an entity with a commercial advantage is "non-commercial," even if this use is by a commercial entity.
Conversely, any use that involves charging users in connection with their access to the Licensed Educational Content is not "non-commercial," even if this use is by a non-profit entity.
As an example, a for-profit corporation's use of the Licensed Educational Content for internal professional development or training of employees is permitted, so long as the corporation charges no fees, directly or indirectly, for such use.
Conversely, as another example, a non-profit entity's use of the Licensed Educational Content in connection with an fee-based training or educational program is NOT "non-commercial" and is not permitted.


7.5 Crediting Khan Academy.
If you distribute, publicly perform or display, transmit, publish, or otherwise make available any Licensed Educational Content or any derivative works thereof, you must also provide the following notice prominently along with such Licensed Educational Content or derivative work thereof: "All Khan Academy content is available for free at www.khanacademy.org".

Box 1630, Mountain View, CA 94042 and also via e-mail to notices@khanacademy.org.
15.2 Waiver.

Any waiver of any provision of the Terms will be effective only if in writing and signed by Khan Academy.
15.3 Governing Law.
The Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
15.4 Dispute Resolution and Arbitration.
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.
BY AGREEING TO BINDING ARBITRATION, YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO LITIGATE DISPUTES THROUGH A COURT AND TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE.
(a) Generally.
In order to expedite and control the cost of disputes, Khan Academy and you agree that any legal or equitable claim, dispute, action or proceeding arising from or related to your use of the Services or these Terms ("Dispute") will be resolved as follows to the fullest extent permitted by law:
(b) Notice of Dispute.
In the event of a Dispute, you or Khan Academy must give the other a written statement that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the Dispute, and a proposed solution (a "Notice of Dispute").
You must send any Notice of Dispute by first class U.S.
Mail to Khan Academy at P.O.
Box 1630, Mountain View, CA 94042 and also via e-mail to notices@khanacademy.org.
Khan Academy will send any Notice of Dispute to you by first class U.S.
Mail to your address if Khan Academy has it, or otherwise to your e-mail address.
You and Khan Academy will attempt in good faith to resolve any Dispute through informal negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date the Notice of Dispute is sent.
After sixty (60) days, you or Khan Academy may commence arbitration.
(c) Binding Arbitration.
Any Dispute which has not been resolved by negotiation as provided herein within sixty (60) days or such time period as you and Khan Academy may otherwise agree, shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration as described in this Section 15.4.
You are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in as a party or class member) all Disputes in court before a judge or jury.
Instead, all Disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the Federal Arbitration Act.
The place of arbitration shall be Santa Clara County, California.
Any court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitrator's award.
(d) Class Action Waiver.
Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any Dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis.
Neither you nor Khan Academy will seek to have any Dispute heard as a class action or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity.
No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings.
(e) Arbitration Procedures.
Any arbitration will be conducted by JAMS under the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures ("JAMS Rules") in effect at the time the Dispute is filed.
You may request a telephonic or in-person hearing by following the JAMS Rules.
In a dispute involving $10,000 or less, any hearing will be telephonic unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead.
To the extent the forum provided by JAMS is unavailable, Khan Academy and you agree to select a mutually agreeable alternative dispute resolution service and that such alternative dispute resolution service shall apply the JAMS Rules.
The arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as a court could.
The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief to you only individually, and only to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim.
(f) Arbitration Fees.
Whoever files the arbitration will pay the initial filing fee.
If Khan Academy files, then Khan Academy will pay.
if you file, then you will pay unless you get a fee waiver under the applicable arbitration rules.
Each party will bear the expense of that party's attorneys, experts, and witnesses, and other expenses, regardless of which party prevails, but a party may recover any or all expenses from another party if the arbitrator, applying applicable law, so determines.
(g) Filing Period.
To the extent permitted by law, any Dispute under these Terms must be filed within one (1) year in an arbitration proceeding.
The one-year period begins when the events giving rise to the Dispute first occur.
If a Dispute is not filed within one year, it is permanently barred.
(h) Venue.
In the event that any Dispute cannot be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with this Section 15.4, you agree that such Dispute will be filed only in the state or federal courts in and for Santa Clara County, California, and each of you and Khan Academy hereby consent and submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating any such action.
Notwithstanding this, Khan Academy shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive or other equitable relief to protect or enforce its intellectual property rights in any court of competent jurisdiction.


15.5 Severability.
If any provision of the Terms or any Guidelines is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated from the Terms to the minimum extent necessary and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
15.6 Assignment.
