How to Recover Your Files with Disk Drill:


In order to see if Your file(s) can be recovered properly, You should (1) download CleverFilesâ free Disk Drill Basic to run a scan on Your device.
A scan of Your device with Disk Drill Basic will generate a list of damaged, deleted, or inaccessible files that can be potentially recovered.
Secondly, You should (2) preview the entirety of the file(s) generated by the Disk Drill scan in order to filter which files will be recoverable and which may not be recoverable.
If a file is fully previewable (i.e., You scrolled through the entire preview and it was free of internal errors) it can be successfully recovered.
In order to recover such a successfully-previewed file(s), if You did not enable Disk Drillâs data protection features in the past, You must (3) purchase either Disk Drill PRO (for personal use) or Disk Drill Enterprise (for commercial use), and then follow the easy-to-use steps provided within the Disk Drill application.

After a scan with Disk Drill Basic, if a file(s) is not fully previewable (i.e., You cannot view the entire file or the file contains errors) the particular file(s) still may be recoverable.
however, the failure of the file to properly preview means there is a chance this particular file(s) is damaged and will be unrecoverable.
If You accept this risk, simply purchase either Disk Drill PRO or Disk Drill Enterprise and likewise follow the easy-to-use steps provided to attempt to recover Your file(s)âthough note that by making such purchase You explicitly accept the aforementioned risks and all purchases are final.
However, if You are unwilling to accept the risk or would like to consider Your options before You purchase Disk Drill PRO or Disk Drill Enterprise, please contact CleverFilesâ Help Center who can provide You with assistance and information pertaining to the file(s) You wish to recover.

With the exception of payment obligations, neither You nor 508 Software will be liable for the failure to abide by or to perform an obligation under the Terms of Service, to the extent that such failure is caused by a force majeure event.
A force majeure event includes acts of God, unforeseeable action by a governmental entity, civil disturbances, loss of electricity and/or telecommunications, natural disasters, strike, terrorism, war, or any other such extreme event beyond the reasonable control of either You or 508 Software.


31.3 Severability.
The Terms of Service will be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.
If for any reason any provision of the Terms of Service is held to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, then (i) such provision will be interpreted, construed, or reformed to the extent necessary to render the same outcome as attempted in the original writing (or as close thereto as possible), and (ii) such invalidity or unenforceability will not affect any other provision of the Terms of Service.
However, if any material limitation or restriction is deemed illegal, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable in regards to the Userâs License (as outlined in Section 4, above), the License will immediately terminate.


31.4 Waiver.
Terms of Service Rights.
In the case 508 Software or You waive any breach or rights under the Terms of Service, this waiver will affect only that particular situation and will not waive any other future breach or rights.
Additionally, the failure of 508 Software to enforce the Terms of Service under strict performance will not be construed as a waiver of 508 Softwareâs rights and remedies, herein, nor shall the particular failure to enforce said situation stand as precedent that 508 Software does not enforce the Terms of Service under strict performance.
508 Software fully intends to enforce the Terms of Service in strict performance.
however, 508 Software reserves the right to enforce and waive breaches, remedies, and rights on a case-by-case basis.
Any such waiver, as discussed above, must be made in writing and executed by 508 Software, and when appropriate You, in order for any effect to be given to said waiver.
No waiver will be effective without 508 Softwareâs authorized signature, and when Your signature is required, no waiver also will be effective without Your authorized signature, unless 508 Software can prove reasonable efforts were given or bad faith is at issue.


31.5 Governing Law and Jurisdiction.
The Terms of Service shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia without reference to conflicts of law rules and principles.
