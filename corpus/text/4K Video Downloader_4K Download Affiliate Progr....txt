You should know that certain forms of advertising are always prohibited by 4kdownload.com.
For example, advertising commonly referred to as "spamming" is unacceptable to us and could cause damage to our name.
Other generally prohibited forms of advertising include the use of unsolicited commercial email (UCE), postings to non-commercial newsgroups and cross-posting to multiple newsgroups at once.
In addition, you may not advertise in any way that effectively conceals or misrepresents your identity, your domain name, or your return email address.
You may use mailings to customers to promote 4kdownload.com as long as the recipient is already a customer or subscriber of your services or web site, and recipients have the option to remove themselves from future mailings.
Also, you may post to newsgroups to promote 4kdownload.com as long as the news group specifically welcomes commercial messages.
At all times, you must clearly represent yourself and your web sites as independent from 4kdownload.com.
If it comes to our attention that you are spamming, we will consider that cause for immediate termination of this Agreement and your participation in the 4kdownload.com Affiliate Program.
Any pending balances owed to you will not be paid if your account is terminated due to such unacceptable advertising or solicitation.

However, we reserve the right to expel any trademark violator from our affiliate program without prior notice, and on the first occurrence of such PPC bidding behavior.
