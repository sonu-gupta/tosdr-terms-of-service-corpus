Welcome to Privacy4Cars.
We care about your privacy, so we want to help you understand what modules the Privacy4Cars Mobile Application (âMobile Applicationâ) has access to, why, and how we treat your data, depending on whether you registered as a Business User or Consumer User.
This privacy policy applies only to the information collected through your use of the Mobile Application.

General

We only process your personal information when we have a lawful basis to do so.
For purposes of this privacy policy, âpersonal informationâ is defined as information that identifies, or can be used to identify, an individual.
We collect personal information from individuals using the Mobile Application.

Our legal bases for processing your personal information include your consent, fulfilment of a contractual obligation, and where we have a legitimate interest to process your personal information, provided that our interests do not outweigh your individual rights and freedoms.
Our legitimate interests include:

Investigating, preventing, and protecting against fraud, security risks, threats to you and others, and violations of this policy;
Protecting and defending our rights and properties, including intellectual property;
Complying with laws and regulations that apply to us, as well as responding to requests from law enforcement or government authorities or as otherwise required by law;
Improving your experiences with our products and services;

We may use this information to reach out to businesses near where Consumer Users wiped their systems (e.g., a dealer, a rental car location) in order to raise their awareness and sensitivity to protecting the privacy of their customers and employees (all data will be aggregated, de-identified, and anonymized).
If you are using the Mobile Application as a Business User, we are required to collect your location based on our agreement with our Customer (the business, company, or legal entity to which your Business User Account is tied).
