         Unlimited 2G Data Fair Use Policy About the Unlimited 2G Data Fair Use Policy The Unlimited 2G Data Fair Use Policy has been put in place to ensure we can always offer all of our customers unlimited 2G data at affordable prices.
The Unlimited 2G Data Fair Use Policy is designed such that with normal usage, it will be impossible to come close to violating it.
The Unlimited 2G Data Fair Use Policy is designed to prevent the very small percentage of customers who use an abnormally high amount of data while using unlimited 2G data from affecting the continuity of our affordable unlimited 2G data plans for all customers. Our Unlimited 2G Data Fair Use Policy TextNow Wireless reserves the right to suspend unlimited 2G data service for customers who use an abnormally high amount of unlimited 2G data.
Abnormally high amount of data is defined as:
Using over 170MB of data per day while using unlimited 2G data (after exceeding planâs 3G/4G data allowance), for 3 or more consecutive days OR using more than 1GB of data in a 5 day period while using unlimited 2G data OR using unlimited 2G data as a substitute for home Internet
If you have been suspended under this policy, an email will be sent from a TextNow representative with suggestions to take corrective action such as:

Connecting the phone to home WiFi
Minimizing the streaming of video and audio without WiFi
Restricting background data usage of various apps in your phoneâs Settings menu

Once corrective action is taken, unlimited 2G data service may be unsuspended.
TextNow Wireless reserves the right to update this policy in the future as required.
Example:

Customer used 500MB out of 500MB of the Tall planâs 3G/4G data allowance on day 2 of the Tall plan and the phone is now using data at 2G speed
While at 2G speed, the customer uses over 170MB of data per day
By end of day 5 of the plan, the customer has used over 510MB of data while at 2G speed (over 1GB of data total)
Customer receives an email from a TextNow representative asking to take corrective action
Corrective action has been taken, unlimited 2G data is unsuspended
If corrective action has not been taken, unlimited 2G data remains suspended until the next billing cycle

Cellular voice and talk/text over WiFi will still be functional during this time
