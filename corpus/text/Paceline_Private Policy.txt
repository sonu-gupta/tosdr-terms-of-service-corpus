Paceline Privacy Policy
EFFECTIVE DATE: October 8, 2021
In this Privacy Policy (âPolicyâ), we describe how Tam(squared) Inc., doing business as Paceline (âPaceline,â âwe,â âus,â or âourâ) collects, uses, and discloses information that we obtain about visitors to our website www.paceline.fit (the âSiteâ), users of our mobile Application (the âAppâ) and the services available through our Site and App, or any other services that link to this Policy, (collectively, the âServicesâ).
By using the Services, you agree that your personal information will be handled as described in this Policy.
Your use of the Services is subject to this Policy and our Terms of Use.

Note that we 
never
 sell, rent, or lease your personal information.


Information We Collect

We collect information about you directly from you, from other data sources, and automatically through your use of the Services.

Information You Provide to Us

The information we collect from you depends on how you use our Services.
To create an account, you must provide your name, email address, and link at least one of your financial accounts to your Paceline account.
We may also ask you for your age, gender, workout and wellness activity and spending habits.
Although you may choose not to provide such information to us, some features and functions of our Services may not work without this information.&nbsp.
For example, if you do not link your financial account to the Services, you cannot claim rewards.
You may also upload a profile photo to your account.
If you sign up for early access to Paceline on our Site, we will collect your name, email address, and information about the types of wearable fitness devices and credit cards you use.

Your Wearable Device

With your consent, we will collect your physical activity information from your wearable device provider.
This information includes all data output generated by such device, such as, your energy output, activity levels and time periods, meditation time, cycling distance, exercise minutes, heart rate, step counts, swimming distance, swimming strokes, walking and running distances, and workout period.
We will also collect the following information if you have provided it to your wearable device provider: date of birth, height, sex, and weight.
We will continue to collect information from your wearable device provider until you remove the wearable device from your Paceline account.&nbsp.
Depending on your specific wearable device, you may be able to adjust or opt-out of sharing all or some of your activity information.&nbsp.
Please see your device settings for details.

Your Financial Accounts

With your consent and in order to provide you with more relevant rewards, we will collect information about your financial account transactions from accounts that you link to your Paceline account through Plaid Inc.
(âPlaidâ).&nbsp.
To do so, you will need to enter your online credentials for your financial accounts with Plaid, and by doing so, you acknowledge and agree that the terms of Plaidâs Privacy Policy (currently located at https://plaid.com/legal/#end-user-privacy-policy), not this Policy, will govern Plaidâs use of such information, and you expressly agree to the terms and conditions of Plaidâs Privacy Policy.
Further, you expressly grant Plaid the right, power, and authority to access and transmit your information as reasonably necessary for Plaid to provide the financial account linking services to you.

Please note that Plaid is an independent third party.&nbsp.
Paceline has no control over Plaidâs use of your information.
If you do not agree to Plaidâs use of your information, do not link your financial accounts to the Services through Plaid.



Once your financial account login information is verified by Plaid, we will collect up to 24 months of transaction information from the financial accounts you have linked to Plaid and agreed to provide to us.
 The information we receive from the entities that maintain your accounts varies depending on the information made available by those entities â for example, if you have a checking and credit card account under the online banking login you provide, we will collect transaction information from both the checking and credit card accounts.
Information we collect through this process typically includes the stores and merchants you purchase from, the amounts you spend, your account type, and your spending limit(s).&nbsp.
Please note that, with respect to financial accounts that you choose to link to your Paceline account through Plaid, we never see your full credit card number, your financial account credentials (username and password), or the specific item(s) that you purchase from a store or merchant.
We also cannot make any changes to any accounts that you link to, cannot initiate transactions, or do anything other than view transaction information and account data.
We will continue to collect transaction information from your financial accounts until you unlink your financial accounts from your Paceline account.

Your Credit Card Rewards Program

If you apply and are approved to be a Paceline cardholder, we may receive information about you from our credit card processing and issuing partner or other rewards partners in connection with the administration of the credit card and credit card rewards program.  Information we may receive from those entities may include your name, the transactions you make, and whether your account is in good standing so that we are able to apply the appropriate credit card rewards to your Paceline account.  We will not have access to your full credit card number, account login credentials, or lists of the specific item(s) that you purchase from a store or merchant.

Location Information
 

We and our service providers may collect location information through the Services.
The type of location information we collect depends on your settings in the device you use to access the Services.
If you access the Services on your mobile device or wearable device, we may directly collect precise geographic location information and sensor data via Global Positioning System (GPS), cellular network information, and other location-based features.
You can turn off direct location collection (or, on some operating systems, continuous direct location collection) through your device settings or by deleting the mobile application from your device.
Please note that even if you disable location collection through your device, we still may collect your IP address, which may contain certain limited location information.
