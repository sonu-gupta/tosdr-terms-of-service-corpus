PlayStation Now is an ongoing subscription with a recurring subscription fee which is charged automatically (at the then-current PlayStation Store price) at the frequency you choose at purchase until the subscription is cancelled.

If your wallet doesn't have enough funds when an automatic recurring subscription payment is due, the balance will be automatically funded from the default payment method on record to cover the subscription fee.
 
HOW TO CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION
You can cancel your subscription at any time so that your subscription will expire at the end of your trial period or at the end of the period for which you have already paid, as applicable.
This will stop future payments of subscription fees being taken, but you wonât receive a refund for payments already made.
This is in addition to purchase cancellation rights you may have under your applicable local laws â see our Cancellation Policy at http://playstation.com/store-cancellation-policy.
To cancel on your PS5, go to [Settings] &gt.

For instructions on how to cancel via the PlayStation App, web store, PC, PS4, PS3 or PS Vita, visit the PlayStation Support page on playstation.com at http://playstation.com/cancel-subscription.
 
7-DAY TRIAL
At the end of your 7-day trial period, your PlayStation Now subscription will automatically roll into a paid-for ongoing subscription with a recurring monthly subscription fee which will be taken automatically each month.
If you want to prevent this, you can cancel your subscription prior to the end of the 7-day trial period.
You can continue to use the benefits for the full 7 days even if you cancel before that.
You need a credit/debit card or PayPal account registered to your account for PlayStation Network to access a 7-day trial subscription.
PlayStation customers may experience PlayStation Now benefits at no extra cost by selecting the 7-day trial.
Each person is eligible for one 7-day trial unless otherwise communicated.
 
MONTHLY PAYMENT PLAN
To purchase a recurring monthly subscription, you need a credit/debit card or PayPal account registered to your account for PlayStation Network.
 
PRICE CHANGES
We may change the price of your subscription (up or down) to reflect changes in the subscription product, to reflect our costs in providing the subscription, to ensure that the subscription continues to be a viable service or to respond to market changes, such as changes to exchange rates, local taxes or inflation.
We will notify you by email at least 60 days in advance of any price increase.
You will be able to cancel before the price change takes effect.
