Before third-party services are integrated/linked, you should always check the privacy statement and terms and conditions of the relevant third-party service provider, as the integration may allow the third-party provider access to your personal data.

3.11 The presentation and design of the administration area (e.g.
dashboard or CMS) shall be solely the responsibility of Jimdo.

Domain (Name) Registration, Domain Name Cancellation, and Change of Provider
7.1 Some of the fee-based service packages (hereinafter referred to as "fee-based Packages" or "Premium Packages") include the provision of one or more domain names.
As regards the acquisition and maintenance of domains, Jimdo serves only as an agent between the Jimdo user and the organization responsible for domain name allocation (registrar) concerned.
Top-level domains (e.g.
.COM, .US) are predominantly managed by a large number of different organizations, mostly at the national level.
Each of these organizations has its own terms and conditions pertaining to the registration and management of domain names.
The registration terms and conditions of the relevant domain registrar will therefore apply complementarily to these terms and conditions.
e.g.
in the case of DE domain names the registration terms and conditions of the DENIC e.G.
(Registered Cooperative) shall apply.
Accordingly the applicable registrar's terms and conditions thus form part of this contract.
On request the Service Provider will send a copy of such terms and conditions to the Jimdo user.
Alternatively they may be accessed online from the respective allocating organization.

7.2 The Jimdo user is in particular responsible for providing correct and complete data regarding the domain name holder (registrant) and the administrative contact (admin-C) when registering the domain name.
The technical contact in all cases will be Jimdo GmbH.
Irrespective of the relevant registration terms and conditions, such data must include the name of the domain name holder, and physical mailing address (PO boxes or anonymous addresses are not permissible), a valid email address and telephone number.
If this information changes, the Jimdo user must immediately inform Jimdo of this change via the online (in the admin/menu) Domain Change Ownership form.

7.3 Upon formation of the contract, Jimdo will make the option available to register the desired domain name with the responsible registrar.
Jimdo may defer activation of a domain name until payment of the agreed fees for the registration services has been received.
Jimdo has no influence on the allocation of the domain name by the relevant organization.
Therefore Jimdo assumes no responsibility or liability that the requested domain names shall be allocated to the Jimdo user and/or that allocated domain names are free of third-party rights nor does jimdo guarantee their continued existence.
Any information provided by Jimdo regarding the availability of a domain name is based on the data provided by third parties and only refers to the information available at the time that information is requested.
The domain shall only be deemed as being allocated to the Jimdo user upon successful registration of the domain by the user and its subsequent entry into the database of the registrar.

7.4 Before applying for a domain name, the Jimdo user will check that the domain name does not violate the rights of any third party or contravene existing legislation.

7.5 A free change of the requested domain name after registration with the relevant registrar is excluded.
Independent thereof a further domain (for which a charge is incurred) can be registered and connected to the site.
Should a domain name that has been applied for already have been allocated during the time required for forwarding the domain name request to the registrar, then the Jimdo user shall be entitled to choose a different, available domain name.
Where individual domains are cancelled by the user or are cancelled as a result of binding decisions resulting from domain name disputes, the Jimdo user shall not be entitled to a free of charge, substitute domain name.

7.6 Subject to these terms and conditions and those of the relevant registrar, the Jimdo user may transfer all domain names registered through Jimdo to another provider, provided that the new provider offers the corresponding top-level domain name (e.g.
.COM, .DE) and supports the change given the required circumstances and technical requirements.
If the user is a consumer then the transfer is only possible outside of the legal revocation period for such âdistance sales contractsâ.
The fee-based package e.g.
JimdoPro- / JimdoBusiness- contract with Jimdo will remain unaffected by a change in provider.
In order to end this contractual relationship with Jimdo a specific cancellation is required.
All such declarations, in particular domain cancellation, domain deletion and change of provider must be submitted in text form or insofar as it is technically possible in the jimdo userâs administration area (menu), the declaration can be executed electronically.
If Jimdo is unable to grant the provider change (domain transfer) on time due to tardiness in the initiation of the change of provider by the new provider or the Jimdo user, or where the necessary requirements in order to grant the change are not fulfilled, then Jimdo i.e.
the provider for the domain is expressly entitled to have the cancelled domain deleted to the cancellation date at the corresponding registrar ( âCLOSEâ).

7.7 The Jimdo user is obligated to notify the Service Provider (Jimdo) immediately should he lose the rights to a domain name registered to him.

7.8 In the event of third parties credibly asserting rights to a domain name, Jimdo reserves the right to block the corresponding domain name until the dispute/issue has been resolved.
In the event of such a domain name blocking, the Jimdo user is still obligated to perform their side of the associated contract (i.e.
to render payment).
The Jimdo user shall agree to all measures that have to be taken by jimdo in order to comply with court rulings and decisions.
The Jimdo user shall indemnify Jimdo from any third party claims, all resulting costs and negative consequences.8.
Blocking Access to your Account
8.1 Jimdo reserves the right to block access to our services either temporarily or permanently if there are concrete indications that the Jimdo user has violated or shall violate these terms and conditions and/or the law, or if Jimdo has a legitimate interest in blocking access.

8.2 Furthermore a blocking of the Jimdo access can occur if the user is more than 30 days in default on their payment.
In that case Jimdo is also entitled to apply for the deletion of the user'sâ domain name(s) at the respective registrar.

8.3 In deciding as to whether access shall be blocked, the legitimate interests of all parties shall be considered as appropriate.

8.4 In the event that the Jimdo user fails to log into their free of charge JimdoPage within 180 days, the Service Provider may delete the JimdoPage and its contents permanently and suspend all access to the Jimdo account by the User.9.
Service Disruption
9.1 Jimdo endeavors to ensure the best possible availability of the Jimdo services.
The Jimdo user acknowledges however, that for technical reasons as well as due to the Service Provider's dependence on external factors, (e.g.
unavailability of telecommunications networks, electricity outages, hardware and/or software failure etc), the uninterrupted availability of individual Jimdo sites cannot be guaranteed.The Jimdo user can therefore not assert a claim for continual access to the Jimdo sites.
Access restrictions of a temporary nature shall not constitute grounds for warranty claims nor a right to extraordinary termination.
The current status of our systems can be be viewed under the following link: https://www.jimdo-status.com/

9.2 In as far as the Jimdo services are provided free of charge, the user only has a claim to the use of the services within the framework of the actual availability provided.

9.3 As regards the fee based services provided by Jimdo, Jimdo guarantees within the sphere of our responsibility an availability of 98% throughout the year.
Regular maintenance, which can amount to up to 4 hours per week is not included in the aforementioned, calculated availability.
We aim to keep the maintenance times as short as possible.

9.4 In order to ensure the proper operability of the Jimdo sites, a number of system requirements must be fulfilled.
A list of these current requirements is available here.
The Service Provider is not liable for disruptions caused by the use of system configurations that vary from the list provided.10.
Terms of Payment

10.4 The respective invoiced amount is due in full to Jimdo 14 days after the invoice has been deemed to have been received, unless otherwise agreed in text form.

10.5 The relevant day to determine the timeliness of payment is the day at which the amount is received by, or credited and completely available to Jimdo.

10.6 Jimdo processes all payments via external payment processors, including (but not limited to) Ingenico (Globalcollect), Paypal and Stripe.
The Jimdo user agrees that Jimdo payments shall only be accepted via these payment processors and that they correspondingly permit the processor concerned to charge the amount concerned.
Where bank transfers are concerned, this payment must be directed to the stated payment processor.

10.7 If the Jimdo contract includes a payment method for the automatic deduction of contract extension costs, Jimdo shall automatically deduct the invoice sum due on the day of contract extension subject to the corresponding consent of the Jimdo user.
If automatic deduction is not possible, the Jimdo user shall receive a payment link from us on the day of the contract extension.
The payment for the new contract extension must be transacted via this link within 14 days.
By selecting the payment method the Jimdo user consents to automatic deduction.

10.8 Where payment is made via bank transfer the specific purpose âreason for paymentâ supplied by Jimdo must be entered on the bank transfer.
If the Jimdo user sends a bank transfer with another purpose or the wrong purpose then they are obligated to inform Jimdo immediately and send Jimdo evidence of proof of payment.
This proof of payment must include the following details: The bank number concerned (IBAN of the sender), the name of the account holder, the payment date (Timezone), the amount, the purpose/reason for payment as entered on transfer form) as well as the bank number (recipientâs IBAN).
The burden of proof as concerns payment lies solely with the Jimdo user.

10.9 Jimdo, the provider is also entitled to deactivate/block the userâs website(s) and prevent their access where the charges due are not paid.
In this case Jimdo is also entitled to delete the corresponding domain names of the Jimdo user at the relevant registrar (âCLOSEâ).
In accepting these terms of service, the Jimdo user grants Jimdo the explicit right to this type of termination.

10.10 Jimdo does not accept any liability for losses, damages or loss of revenue that may be caused by the blocking of a Jimdo Site due to incomplete or delayed payment, as long as the failure or delay can be attributed to the Jimdo user.

10.11 Payments are due in the respective national currency i.e.
EURO or USD.

10.12 Discounts and other actions can only be applied to the first term of a contract, unless otherwise stipulated.
The current, applicable price shall apply to all contract renewals.
We may change our offer and prices from time to time.
In the event of such a change all existing, fee based contract holders shall be provided with a 6 week notice period and the changes shall take effect from the beginning of the next contractual period.
If the Jimdo user does not object to these changes within 6 weeks of the receipt of this change-notification and continues to use the Jimdo services subsequent to the expiration of the deadline, the changes announced in the notification shall be deemed to be effectively agreed to.
In the notification message we shall inform the user as to their right of objection, as well as the consequences of such an objection.

10.13 All prices include VAT.
The applicable VAT rate shall be shown on the invoice.
If the Jimdo user i.e.
the corresponding company is not based in Germany, but rather in the EU, the Jimdo user shall receive an invoice in which the VAT is not shown.
In that case the Jimdo user shall enter a (valid) VAT identification number with their Jimdo fee-based package order.
In that case the jimdo user is responsible for the taxation (reverse charge procedure).
Jimdo user outside of Europe as well as in Switzerland receive a net amount invoice.11.

Responsibility for Content
13.1 We offer the Jimdo user the possibility to post content on their Jimdo site and to make said content available to others via the Jimdo site.
In order for Jimdo to perform itâs service and allow for the creation of a website with text, pictures and videos, it is necessary that the Jimdo user grants usage rights to Jimdo for the publication, editing and public broadcasting of this content.
