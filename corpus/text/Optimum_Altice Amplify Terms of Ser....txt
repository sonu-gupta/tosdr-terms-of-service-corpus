Personal information does not include "de-identified,â or "aggregate" information that is not linked or reasonably linkable to a specific person.
When You rent or purchase a Device, We will use your Personal Information in order to process the transaction.

and 9) update any programs or other tools that We provide in conjunction with your Device.

DISCLOSURE: Altice does not and will not sell, license, or rent your Personal Information collected as a result of Your purchase, rental or use of the Device without Your consent. We only disclose your Personal Information as described in these Terms.
We may share your Device Specific Information with the following types of parties: 1) third party application providers which You specifically authorize or are otherwise necessary to provide the requested functionality.
2) our employees, agents, and affiliates within our family of affiliated businesses though we seek to limit access to individuals on a need to know basis.

If Altice is required to disclose Information that identifies You to a private third party in response to a civil court order, We will notify You prior to making such disclosure unless legally prohibited from doing so.

Collection, Use and Disclosure of Audio Data: Your Device is not continuously capturing sound in your home.
Your Device only captures sound and other audio recordings when You enable voice control technology on your Device.
Voice control works by your Device âlisteningâ for a key wake-up word.
This âlisteningâ means that your Device buffers and re-records locally, without transmitting or storing any information, until it detects the word or phrase (such as âAlexaâ) that triggers the Device to begin actively recording.
If your Device does not detect the wake-up word, it continues to record over itself in a never-ending loop lasting a few seconds.
This is all done locally on your Device and is not sent to Altice or any third party.
If a wake-up word is detected, your Device begins recording.
It does not record or retain any audio data, or begin to transmit any data until it is âwoken up.â You are notified that it is recording by a visual element, such as a light on the Device, and a specific sound.
Your Device will record until your voice command is finished.
The actual recording of your voice command is then sent to the voice partner You have authorized to receive such recording (for example, Amazon).
Altice does not retain a copy of your voice recording.

SECURITY: We employ physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect Information.
Despite these measures, We do not guarantee the security of information stored in our database or that unauthorized parties will not intercept information you send or receive over the Internet.
As a shared resource, the Internet subjects our services and you to the risk of unauthorized access to files and data, even when security measures are implemented.
We will retain Information for as long as your account is active or as otherwise necessary to fulfill our agreement with you, help us improve our products and services, comply with our legal obligations and/or resolve disputes.
