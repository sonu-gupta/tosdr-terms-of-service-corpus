You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are in contact with us (like when you fill out our contact form or sign up for a newsletter).
You are not required to provide the information we requested, but if you choose not to do so, in many cases this means we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to your inquiries.
Here are examples of the types of personal information that we collect:


When you visit our website, connect to our services, contact us, use our software, create a Taskade account, or subscribe to your newsletter, we collect a variety of information, including your email address, device information, IP address, and a record of your communication.


When using Taskade to update your tasks, documents, comments, chat messages, we collect the content you provided, as well as additional information such as access logs and device identifiers.


When using our software, we collect additional information such as crash reports, information about the operating system, application version, user language, and whether or not you're logged in to Taskade.

How we use your personal informationWe collect and process all your personal data in accordance with the relevant data protection regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
This means that we may process your personal information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy with your consent, if it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract, if it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which Taskade is subject, or when we have assessed it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Taskade or by a third party to whom it may be necessary to disclose information.
The personal information we collect allows us to keep you up to date on our latest product announcements, software updates, and services.
You may at any time opt out of receiving such communications by contacting us.
In particular, we only send you our newsletter with your prior consent, and you can opt out of receiving the newsletter anytime by clicking the unsubscribe link we include in each newsletter, or by contacting us.
We also use the personal information we collect to help us create, develop, deliver, protect, and improve our products, services, content, and customer communications.
We may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about changes to our terms, conditions, and policies.
As this information is important to your interaction with Taskade, you may not opt out of receiving these communications.
We may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve our products, services, and customer communications.
With respect to any documents and files you may choose to upload to Taskade, we take the privacy and confidentiality of such documents and files seriously.
We encrypt all documents and files.
If you choose to make a document public, we recommend you redact any and all references to people and addresses, as we can't protect public data and we are not responsible for any violation of privacy law you may be liable for.
We employ industry standard techniques to protect against unauthorized access of data about you that we store, including personal information.
We do not share personal information you have provided to us without your consent, unless:


doing so is appropriate to carry out your own request;


we believe it's needed to enforce our Terms of Service, or that is legally required;


we believe it's needed to detect, prevent or address fraud, security or technical issues;


otherwise protect our property, legal rights, or that of others.

Collection and Use of Non-Personal InformationNon-personal information is data that cannot, on its own, be used to uniquely identify a specific individual.
We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose.
We may combine personal and non-personal information for certain purposes.
this data will then be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.
Conversely, aggregated information, i.e.
data that might have originated from personal information, but that has been processed in such a way as to not allow personal identification, is treated as non-personal information.Cookies and Other TechnologiesOur website, services, apps, email communications and advertisements may use âcookiesâ and other technologies such as âpixel tagsâ and âclick-through URLsâ.
We use the information we collect in this manner to better understand our usersâ interaction with our website and to optimize the user experience.
You can disable cookies in your browser settings, but please note that certain features on our website may not be available as a result.
In our email communications, we may use other technologies like âpixel tagsâ and âclick-through URLsâ in order to determine if an email has been opened and which links have been clicked.
We use this information to help us determine interest in particular topics and improve the effectiveness of our communications, and to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers.
Pixel tags are small images shown inside an HTML email.
you can disable tracking by disabling HTML in your email client.
A link with a click-through URL, when clicked, first sends the user to a web server which records the click, and then to the linkâs destination.
If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages.
As you access our services, we gather some information automatically on our servers and store it in log files.
This information includes your browser type, version, and language, your operating system, the referring and exit websites, IP address, a date/time stamp of the request, and the requested resource (file name and URL).
We use this information in anonymized form for statistical analysis, to administer our site, and to improve our product and services, without directly associating this data with individual users.

In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets.
Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.
You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.Protection of Personal InformationWe take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data.
These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, including appropriate encryption and physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.

These individuals are bound by confidentiality agreements and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.
Whenever you connect to our service, we use encryption such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) for all information that is being transmitted.
However, no method of transmitting or storing data is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee the security of information you transmit to us.
