Participation in certain Promotions may be subject to specific official rules governing such Promotions, which may be announced in connection therewith.
Regardless of whether or not specific rules are announced separately, all Promotions will be controlled by the Terms.
As a condition to receiving any award or prize in connection with a Promotion, you may be required to provide additional personal information (such as, your social security number) and to sign a release, affidavit or waiver.
Decisions of Crown Media shall be final in all matters relating to the Promotions.

Winner(s) will be selected in a random drawing taking place on or about the date publicized by us from among all eligible entries received during the entry period.
Prize award is subject to verification of eligibility and compliance with the Terms.
Potential winner will be confirmed via email and/or phone and may be required to sign and return, within a specified period of notification, Affidavit of Eligibility, IRS Form W-9, Liability Waiver, and where allowable, a Publicity Release (collectively, âthe Releasesâ).
Failure to return any of the Releases required by us could result in forfeiture of the prize.

Winner will be solely responsible for all expenses associated with using the prize, unless otherwise specified in specific official rules.
Winner must accept the prize as stated and âas-isâ or prize may be forfeited and may be awarded to an alternate prize winner.
Any difference between the stated ARV of a prize (if ARV is required to be specified) and the actual value of a prize will not be awarded to the prize winner.
Prizes are non-transferable in whole or in part except at the discretion of us.
No substitution or cash redemption will be awarded except at the discretion of us.
We reserve the right to substitute a prize (or component thereof) in the event a prize is unavailable for any reason whatsoever.

or misuse of any prize.
Acceptance of prize constitutes granting permission to Crown Media and its designees to use winnerâs name, likeness (and biographical information) for advertising, marketing and other purposes in any and all media, now or hereafter devised, in any manner, worldwide in perpetuity, without further compensation, notification or right of approval, unless prohibited by law.
The Released Parties are not responsible for (1) any incorrect or inaccurate information, whether caused by entrant, printing errors or by any of the equipment or programming associated with or utilized in the Promotions, (2) technical failures of any kind, including, but not limited to, malfunctions, interruptions, or disconnections in phone lines or network hardware or software, (3) unauthorized human intervention in any part of the entry process or the Promotions, (4) technical or human error which may occur in the administration of the Promotions or the processing of entries, (5) late, lost, undeliverable, damaged or stolen mail or (6) any injury or damage to persons or property which may be caused, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, from entrantâs participation in the Promotions or receipt or use

Released Parties are not responsible for any typographical, clerical, logistical or other error in entries, selection announcement or for any liability for damage to any computer system resulting from participation in, accessing or downloading information in connection with a Promotion.
If for any reason an entrant's Promotion entry is confirmed to have been erroneously deleted, lost, or otherwise destroyed or corrupted, entrantâs sole remedy is another entry in such Promotion, provided that, if it is not possible to award another entry due to discontinuance of such Promotion, or any part of it, for any reason, Released Parties, in their sole discretion, may elect to hold a random drawing from among all eligible entries received up to the date of discontinuance for any or all of the prizes offered herein.
No more than the stated number of prizes will be awarded.
In the event that production, technical, seeding, programming or any other reasons cause more than the stated number of prizes to be available and/or claimed, Released Parties reserve the right to award only the stated number of prizes by a random drawing among all legitimate, un-awarded, eligible prize claims.
We reserve the right to cancel, suspend and/or modify a Promotion, or any part of it, if any fraud, technical failures or any other factor beyond our reasonable control impairs the integrity or proper functioning of the Promotion or for any other reason, as determined by us in our sole discretion.
We, in our sole discretion, reserve the right to disqualify any individual it finds to be tampering with the entry process or the operation of the Promotion or to be acting in violation of the Terms or any other promotion or in an unsportsmanlike or disruptive manner.
If disqualified, no prize may be awarded or prizes may be awarded in a random drawing using all non-suspect, eligible entries received as of the date of termination.
We may demand the winner of a Promotion to immediately return any prize (or the value of the prize) which has been or may be awarded if any statement made by such winner to us is false or if such winner is disqualified for any reason.
Any attempt by any person to deliberately undermine the legitimate operation of the Promotion may be a violation of criminal and civil law, and, should such an attempt be made, we reserve the right to seek damages from any such person to the fullest extent permitted by law.
Our failure to enforce any term of the Terms shall not constitute a waiver of that provision.
In the event a dispute arises as to the identity of a potentially winning online entrant, entries made by internet will be declared name on the online entry form.
No Promotion conducted on a social network (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) is in any way sponsored, endorsed or administered by, or associated with such relevant social network.
All applicable federal and state laws apply.
Any federal, state and local taxes resulting from acceptance and use of prize are the responsibility of the winner.
Unless otherwise set forth in specific rules for a particular Promotion, Promotions are only open to persons who are as of the date of entry 21 years of age and legal residents of and physically located within the 48 contiguous United States.
