Updated on April 22, 2022

Chipolo and our third-party partners, such as our advertising and analytics partners, use various technologies to collect information, such as cookies and web beacons as you browse our online services and apps (âthe Servicesâ) listed below:

chipolo.net;
app.chipolo.net.

Cookies are small text files.
They are commonly downloaded to your computer or mobile device by websites that you visit.
They enable the website to tag your device and recognize it as you move around the site (and potentially when you return at a later date) so that, for example, you do not have to re-enter your password each time you move between pages of the website.
Web beacons (also known as tracking pixels, pixel tags, or web bugs) are small image files commonly used for simple analytics and tracking of user actions like opening an email message.
