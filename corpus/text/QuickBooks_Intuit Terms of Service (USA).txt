IPI Provision of Money Movement Services

The Ancillary Payments Services provide functionality to enable you to track, calculate, and initiate payroll and other payments to employees, tax payments to taxing authorities, and other payments to employees or third-party vendors.
Specific conditions and requirements for each of the Ancillary Payments Services is provided below.
This section describes rights, responsibilities, and obligations with respect to the transmission of funds on your behalf in connection with the Money Movement Services.
With respect to the Money Movement Services, you are the "Payor" and the person or entity you are seeking to pay (which may be a vendor, taxing authority, or Employee, as defined below) is a "Payee." As a Payor, an eligible transfer of funds to a Payee that you initiate through any of the Ancillary Payments Services, in accordance with the specific terms set forth below and any instructions provided through the applicable software, constitutes a "Payment." When you make a valid Payment request, IPI receives funds from you and transmits the funds to the Payee in accordance with your instructions.
To use the Money Movement Services and to initiate a Payment, you must have a demand deposit account with an eligible financial institution capable of enabling Automated Clearing House ("ACH") transactions and such account must be identified when you enable the Ancillary Payments Services ("Your Account").
You can change Your Account in accordance with instructions provided through the Ancillary Payments Services settings.
Please note, however, that under certain circumstances IPI reserves the right to use wire drawdown requests or other funding methods (collectively "Debits") to fund your Payments.
You may request that IPI initiate a Payment to a Payee or Payees online ("Payment Transaction(s)").
After you submit your Payment Transaction, IPI will confirm receipt of the Payment request.
Your Payment Transaction will not be processed if you do not receive our confirmation before the Payment Transaction is over.
However, a confirmation does not mean that your Payment Transaction is error-free, and if errors are detected later we may be unable to complete your Payment Transaction.
We will make reasonable efforts to tell you if we cannot complete your Payment Transaction.
Payment Transactions taking place after certain processing deadlines may be considered to occur on the next business day.
Specific information regarding Payment Transactions for applicable Ancillary Payments Services is provided in the below descriptions of the applicable service.
IPI generally processes Payment Transactions using the ACH.
Such transactions are governed by the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association ("NACHA").
NACHA may amend these NACHA Operating Rules at any time.
By initiating a Payment, you authorize IPI to initiate credit and debit entries to Your Account, and to send Payments electronically or by any other commercially accepted method to the Payee or Payees you have designated and pursuant to instructions you provide with your Payment Transaction.
You also authorize and direct the depository financial institution that holds Your Account to charge each debit to Your Account for that amount to be credited to IPI, and to respond to inquiries from IPI regarding your information and Your Account.
This authorization will remain in full force and effect until IPI has received written notification from you of its termination in such time and in such manner as to afford IPI and the depository financial institution that holds Your Account a reasonable opportunity to act on it.
For Payees that will receive disbursements via ACH, you agree to obtain the Payeeâs consent to credit their bank account and initiate a disbursement over the ACH network.
Such consent must be in a form and manner that complies with the NACHA Operating Rules.
You also agree to maintain the security and integrity of all information that you collect and/or provide to IPI that IPI uses to process a Payment Transaction, whether using the ACH or otherwise.
We may refuse to process your Payment Transaction if we reasonably believe that Your Account balance is insufficient to cover the dollar amount of the Payment Transaction or for any other reason we deem reasonable.
If any amount debited against you is dishonored or returned for any reason, such as, but not limited to, non-sufficient funds, account closed, inability to locate account, or reversal by you and/or your bank, we may: (1) reverse any corresponding credit issued to IPI, you, your Payees or any other party without liability to you or any other party.
(2) reverse direct deposit transactions.
(3) refuse to perform further Services.
(4) apply any money currently held by IPI to any amount owed to us by you.
(5) charge you a one-time insufficient funds penalty fee.
and/or (6) report this information to any and all credit agencies and/or financial institutions.
We may assess and collect interest on any amounts due and unpaid 10 days after demand.
If further collection attempts are required, all of our collections costs, including any costs associated with termination of this Agreement and including but not limited to, attorney fees, where permitted by law, will be charged to you.
This Section shall, to the extent applicable, survive the termination of this Agreement.
