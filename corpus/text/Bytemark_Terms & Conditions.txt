Note. Domain names are not case sensitive.
This means that an uppercase and a lowercase letter are considered to be the same (AAA.com., aaa.com and AaA.com are all the same domain name).
This list is not exhaustive.
We make every effort to ensure that our registration systems do not allow you to bypass these registration rules however there are some occasions where this may not be possible, and our checking procedures may fail.
Clients are always advised to seek guidance if they are at all unsure about the domain name they have chosen and its validity.
Due to the variety of possible causes for the failure of the domain name validity checker, we cannot be held responsible if a customer attempts to register an invalid domain and that this request is subsequently accepted by our systems.
Acceptance of the invalid order by our systems does not constitute acceptance of the registration of the domains by the relevant domain registry.

All registrations are subject to entering into a contract with the relevant registry.
For more information please contact our support team.
