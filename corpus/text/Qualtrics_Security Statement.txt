OUR SECURITY, BRIEFLY STATED
Qualtricsâ most important concern is the protection and reliability of customer data.
Our servers are protected by high-end firewall systems and scans are performed regularly to ensure that any vulnerabilities are quickly found and patched.
Application penetration tests are performed annually by an independent third-party.
All services have quick failover points and redundant hardware, with backups performed daily.
Access to systems is restricted to specific individuals who have a need-to-know such information and who are bound by confidentiality obligations.
Access is monitored and audited for compliance.
Qualtrics uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption (also known as HTTPS) for all transmitted data.
Surveys may be protected with passwords.
Our services are hosted by trusted data centers that are independently audited using the industry standard SSAE-18 method.
