Additionally, by enrolling in any Donation Subscriptions, you acknowledge and agree for any and all such Donation Subscriptions, that (a) individual Donation Installments may not be tax deductible, even if previous Donation Installments for the same Donation Subscription were, and the amount of each Donation Installment that is tax deductible may vary, (b) one or more specific Donation Installment may not be provided to or received by the applicable cause, Charity or Campaign if such cause, Charity or Campaign becomes unavailable, unable to accept Donations, or chooses to stop receiving Donations, which may occur for various reasons, such as if the cause, Charity or Campaign becomes subject to an investigation or is suspended or removed from the Services by Do Good Points or (c) the amounts actually received by the applicable Campaign, Charity or cause may differ from one Donation Installment to the next (for example, if the Payment Processor fees associated with the Donation Installment change).
If you have questions about our refund policy, you can email support@dogoodpoints.com.
Your non-termination of a Donation Subscription reaffirms that Do Good Points is authorized to charge your Payment Instrument for the Donation Subscription in accordance with these terms.
This does not waive our right to seek payment directly from you.
Good Points Loyalty Program: While Do Good Points does not provide any offers, promises, rewards or promotions in exchange for Donations, Users on the Do Good Points Platform are eligible to earn âGood Points.â In order to be eligible for the Good Points Loyalty Program (the âProgramâ), Users must have a registered account on the Do Good Points Platform.
Multiple accounts may not be merged or transferred.
By participating in this Program you are agreeing to these Terms of Service.
Good Points may be earned by completing certain eligible actions on the Do Good Points Platform.
Examples of such eligible actions may include creating an account, donating cash or points, sharing cause, content and organization information, subscribing to a newsletter, sharing your donation and more.
Good Points earned for a Donation made may be revoked in the case that the Donation is later refunded or reversed for other reasons.
Good Points may also be revoked where Do Good Points believes in its discretion that Good Points were earned through or in connection with any fraud, abuse of the Platform, or violation of the Do Good Points Terms of Service.
When a minimum of Good Points have been accrued by a User, those Good Points may become convertible to a minimum required donation to a Charity or cause within the Platform.
One Good Point is currently equivalent to approximately $0.002 in donation value and the current valuation is subject to change.
Good Points have no value outside of the Do Good Points Platform.
User actions may be subject to verification before their corresponding Good Points are added to a Userâs account.
Good Points do not expire and are non-transferrable to any other User.
The number of Good Points required to convert to donation value may be modified by Do Good Points at any time.
Once Good Points are converted and redeemed for a Donation, they cannot be returned to your account.
If you believe there is any discrepancy in your Good Points balance, please contact our Customer Support team at support@dogoodpoints.com.
If we find that a correction is due, it may take up to four weeks.
Failure to supply necessary documentation may result in an inability to award your Good Points.
Participation in the Program is a benefit granted to registered Users, and as such can be suspended, revoked, or terminated at any time by us for any reason.
If your account is terminated, all Good Points associated with your account will be forfeited immediately upon termination.
If your account is terminated due to fraudulent activity or noncompliance with these Terms of Service, in addition to forfeiting all Good Points immediately, you cannot participate in or rejoin the Program.
Campaign Organizers, Charities, or Beneficiaries

Account Holds: From time to time, Do Good Points may, in its sole discretion, place a hold on a Campaign account (a "Hold"), restricting Payouts (defined herein), secure reserves, or take similar actions to protect its interests and those of its Users.
Some of the reasons that we may take such actions include, but arenât necessarily limited to, the following: (i) if we have reason to believe (in our sole discretion) that information provided by a Campaign Organizer is false, misleading, or fraudulent, or that funds are being used in a prohibited manner, (ii) if the funds available (as determined by Do Good Points in its sole discretion) should be provided directly to a person other than the Charity (such as a legal beneficiary or person entitled by law to act on behalf of a Charity), (iii) if we have reason to believe that a Campaign or Campaign Organizer has violated these Terms of Service, (iv) if Do Good Points determines that the Campaign Organizer is colluding with donors to engage in fraudulent activity, (v) if we have reason to believe (in our sole discretion) that there may be suspicious or fraudulent donation activity, or (vi) if required in order to comply with a court order, subpoena, writ, injunction, or as otherwise required under applicable laws and regulations.
If you have questions about a Hold we may have placed on your Campaign account, or need information about how to resolve the Hold, please contact your Campaign account manager.

Donation Payouts from a Campaign:While Do Good Points strives to make Payouts available to Charities promptly after the close of each quarter, you acknowledge and agree that Payouts may not be available to you for receive immediately, and Do Good Points expressly disclaims any and all responsibility for any delay or inability to access and use Payouts at any specified time, and any consequences arising from such delay or inability.
You, as a Campaign Organizer, are responsible for ensuring that the information you provide to Do Good Points in order to process a Payout, including your bank account information, is accurate and up to date.
Do Good Points may, at any time, for any reason, without notice, and in its sole discretion, offer or issue a refund of Donation(s) with or without consulting with you, which may comprise the entire amount donated to your campaign.
Do Good Points is not liable to you or to any third party for any claims, damages, costs, losses, or other consequences caused by Do Good Points issuing refunds, including, but not limited to transaction or overdraft fees.

Payment Processors:Do Good Points uses Payment Processors to process Donations for your Campaign.
By setting up a Campaign or accepting the role of Campaign Organizer, you agree to the processing, use, transfer or disclosure of data by the Payment Processors pursuant to any and all applicable terms set forth by the applicable Payment Processors (currently, Stripe, Inc.
and Givinga, Inc.
DBA GivingaFoundation), in addition to these Terms of Service, including Stripeâs terms of service and Givinga Foundationâs terms of service.3.

LEGAL DISPUTESARBITRATION CLAUSE &amp.
CLASS ACTION WAIVER â IMPORTANT â PLEASE REVIEW AS THIS AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS Arbitration.
Class Action Waiver: YOU AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US OR ANY OF OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS OR EMPLOYEES ACTING IN THEIR CAPACITY AS SUCH (WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DISPUTE INVOLVES A THIRD PARTY) WITH REGARD TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH US, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DISPUTES RELATED TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, AND/OR RIGHTS OF PRIVACY AND/OR PUBLICITY, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU AND WE HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY.
DISCOVERY AND RIGHTS TO APPEAL IN ARBITRATION ARE GENERALLY MORE LIMITED THAN IN A LAWSUIT, AND OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU AND WE WOULD HAVE IN COURT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.
YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND WE ARE EACH WAIVING OUR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in these Terms of Service will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either of us to (a) bring an individual action in small claims court.
(b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available.
(c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law.
or (d) file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.


The Process: Any arbitration between you and us will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, âAAA Rulesâ) as modified by these Terms of Service.
The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org.
A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S.
Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (âNotice of Arbitrationâ).
Our current address for Notice is: Do Good, Inc., â Legal Department, PO Box 193446, San Francisco, CA 94119.
The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.
and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (âDemandâ).
We agree to work with you and make a good faith effort to resolve the claim directly, but if we arenât successful within 60 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding.
All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing.
During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by either of us must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.
If the arbitrator awards you an amount which exceeds the last written settlement amount offered by us in settlement of the dispute prior to the award, we will pay to you the higher of: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator.
or (ii) $10,000.00.


Fees: If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms of Service, we will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee unless your claim is for more than $10,000 in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules.
Any arbitration hearing will take place at an agreed upon location in San Francisco, California, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.
(b) through a telephone hearing or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county of your billing address.
If the arbitration finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in the Federal Rule of Civil procedure 11(b), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
In that case, you agree to reimburse us for all monies previously disbursed by us that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.
Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.
The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitratorâs ruling on the merits.
No Class Actions: YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
Further, unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one personâs claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
Modifications to this Arbitration Provision: If we make any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to our address for Notice of Arbitration, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to our address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with us will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.

Enforceability: If this Disputes section is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Disputes section will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in the General section below will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms of Service.




Confidentiality: We each agree to keep the arbitration proceedings, all information exchanged between us, and any settlement offers confidential, unless otherwise required by law or requested by law enforcement or any court or governmental body.
However, we may each disclose these matters, in confidence, to our respective accountants, auditors, and insurance providers.9.
TERMINATIONYou agree that Do Good Points, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your account (or any part thereof) or your access to the Services and remove and discard any User Content or data at any time and for any reason, with or without notice, and without any liability to you or to any third party for any claims, damages, costs or losses resulting therefrom.10.
USER DISPUTESYou agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions with any other user in connection with the Services and Do Good Points will have no liability or responsibility with respect thereto.
Do Good Points reserves the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with disputes between you and any other user of the Services.11.

You also may be subject to additional terms of service that may apply when you use affiliate or third-party services, third-party content or third-party software.
These Terms of Service will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth above, you and Do Good Points agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within San Francisco County, California.
The failure of Do Good Points to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
If any provision of these Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be (or are otherwise) invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the partiesâ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Service remain in full force and effect.
You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Services or these Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.
You may not assign these Terms of Service without the prior written consent of Do Good Points, but Do Good Points may assign or transfer these Terms of Service, in whole or in part, without restriction.
If we fail to enforce any of our rights, that does not result in a waiver of that right.
The section titles in these Terms of Service are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
Notices to you may be made via either email or regular mail.
The Services may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms of Service or other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the Platforms.

Nothing in these Terms shall prevent Do Good Points from complying with the law.
Do Good Points shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, embargos, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, strikes or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials.
The provisions of these Terms of Service are intended to be severable.
If for any reason any provision of these Terms of Service shall be held invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part in any jurisdiction, such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without in any manner affecting the validity or enforceability thereof in any other jurisdiction or the remaining provisions hereof in any jurisdiction.No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and Do Good Points as a result of these Terms of Service.
The failure of Do Good Points to enforce any right or provision in these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by Do Good Points in writing.
If you create or use an account on behalf of a business entity, you represent that you are authorized to act on behalf of such business and bind the business to these Terms of Service.
Such account is owned and controlled by the business entity.
