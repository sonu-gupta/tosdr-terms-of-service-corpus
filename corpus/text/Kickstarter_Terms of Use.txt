Welcome to Kickstarter! 
This page explains our terms of use.
When you use Kickstarter, youâre agreeing to all the rules below.
Some of them need to be expressed in legal language, but weâve done our best to offer you clear and simple explanationsâhence the brief summaries in these blue boxes, which are not part of the official legal terms.


By using this website (the âSiteâ) and services (together with the Site, the âServicesâ) offered by Kickstarter, PBC (together with Drip U.S., LLC, The Creative Independent, LLC, and its and their parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, representatives, consultants, employees, officers, and directorsâcollectively, âKickstarter,â âwe,â or âusâ), youâre agreeing to these legally binding rules (the âTermsâ).
Youâre also agreeing to our Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy, and agreeing to follow any other rules on the Site, like our Community Guidelines and rules for starting projects.


We may change these terms from time to time.
If we do, weâll let you know about any material changes, either by notifying you on the Site or by sending you an email.
Creators based in the European Union will be notified of material changes at least 15 days before they go into effect.
New versions of the terms will never apply retroactivelyâweâll tell you the exact date they go into effect.
If you keep using Kickstarter after a change, that means you accept the new terms.


Kickstarter is for your personal, non-commercial use, except as explained in section 4 and section 5 below.
 2.
About Creating an Account 
You must be 18 or over to sign up for a Kickstarter account.
Youâre responsible for your account and all the activity on it.


You can browse Kickstarter without registering for an account.
But to use some of Kickstarterâs functions, youâll need to register, choose a username, and set a password.
When you do that, the information you give us has to be accurate and complete.
Donât impersonate anyone else or choose names that are offensive or that violate anyoneâs rights.
If you donât follow these rules, we may cancel your account.


Youâre responsible for all the activity on your account, and for keeping your password confidential.
If you find out that someoneâs used your account without your permission, you should report it to support@kickstarter.com.


To sign up for an account, you need to be at least 18 years old, or old enough to form a binding contract where you live.
If necessary, we may ask you for proof of age.
 3.
Things You Definitely Shouldnât Do 
This section is a list of things you probably already know you shouldnât doâlie, break laws, abuse people, steal data, hack other peopleâs computers, and so on.
Please behave yourself.
Donât do this stuff.


Millions of people use Kickstarter.
We expect all of them to behave responsibly and help keep this a nice place.
Donât do any of these things on the Site:



Donât break the law.
Donât take any action that infringes or violates other peopleâs rights, violates the law, or breaches any contract or legal duty you have toward anyone.


Donât lie to people.
Donât post information you know is false, misleading, or inaccurate.
Donât do anything deceptive or fraudulent.


Donât offer prohibited items.
Donât offer any rewards that are illegal, violate any of Kickstarterâs policies, rules, or guidelines, or violate any applicable law, statute, ordinance, or regulation.


Donât victimize anyone.
Donât do anything threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, libelous, tortious, obscene, profane, or invasive of another personâs privacy.


Donât spam.
Donât distribute unsolicited or unauthorized advertising or promotional material, or any junk mail, spam, or chain letters.
Donât run mail lists, listservs, or any kind of auto-responder or spam on or through the Site.


Donât harm anyoneâs computer.
Donât distribute software viruses, or anything else (code, films, programs) designed to interfere with the proper function of any software, hardware, or equipment on the Site (whether it belongs to Kickstarter or another party).


Donât abuse other usersâ personal information.
When you use Kickstarter â and especially if you create a successful project â you may receive information about other users, including things like their names, email addresses, and postal addresses.
This information is provided for the purpose of participating in a Kickstarter project: donât use it for other purposes, and donât abuse it.



We also need to make sure that the Site is secure and our systems function properly.
So donât do any of these thingsâmost of which boil down to âdonât mess with our system.â


Donât try to interfere with the proper workings of the Services.
Donât bypass any measures weâve put in place to secure the Services.
Donât try to damage or get unauthorized access to any system, data, password, or other information, whether it belongs to Kickstarter or another party.
Donât take any action that imposes an unreasonable load on our infrastructure, or on our third-party providers.
(We reserve the right to determine whatâs reasonable.)
Donât use any kind of software or device (whether itâs manual or automated) to âcrawlâ or âspiderâ any part of the Site.
Donât take apart or reverse engineer any aspect of Kickstarter in an effort to access things like source code, underlying ideas, or algorithms.
 4.
How Projects Work 
Most of our Terms of Use explain your relationship with Kickstarter.
This section is differentâit explains the relationship between creators and backers of Kickstarter projects, and whoâs responsible for what.
This is what youâre agreeing to when you create or back a Kickstarter project.


Kickstarter provides a funding platform for creative projects.
When a creator posts a project on Kickstarter, theyâre inviting other people to form a contract with them.
Anyone who backs a project is accepting the creatorâs offer, and forming that contract.


Kickstarter is not a part of this contractâthe contract is a direct legal agreement between creators and their backers.
Here are the terms that govern that agreement:


When a project is successfully funded, the creator must complete the project and fulfill each reward.
Once a creator has done so, theyâve satisfied their obligation to their backers.


Throughout the process, creators owe their backers a high standard of effort, honest communication, and a dedication to bringing the project to life.
At the same time, backers must understand that theyâre not buying something when they back a projectâtheyâre helping to create something new, not ordering something that already exists.
There may be changes or delays, and thereâs a chance something could happen that prevents the creator from being able to finish the project as promised.


If a creator is unable to complete their project and fulfill rewards, theyâve failed to live up to the basic obligations of this agreement.
To right this, they must make every reasonable effort to find another way of bringing the project to the best possible conclusion for backers.
A creator in this position has only remedied the situation and met their obligations to backers if:


they post an update that explains what work has been done, how funds were used, and what prevents them from finishing the project as planned;
they work diligently and in good faith to bring the project to the best possible conclusion in a timeframe thatâs communicated to backers;
theyâre able to demonstrate that theyâve used funds appropriately and made every reasonable effort to complete the project as promised;
theyâve been honest, and have made no material misrepresentations in their communication to backers.
and
they offer to return any remaining funds to backers who have not received their reward (in proportion to the amounts pledged), or else explain how those funds will be used to complete the project in some alternate form.


The creator is solely responsible for fulfilling the promises made in their project.
If theyâre unable to satisfy the terms of this agreement, they may be subject to legal action by backers.
 5.
How Funding Works 
This section goes over the details of backing and creating projectsâthings like how money gets collected, whether pledges can be changed or canceled, and how creators can contact backers to provide rewards.


These are the terms that apply when youâre backing a project:



Youâre only charged if the project reaches its fundraising goal.
Youâll provide your payment information when you pledge, but you wonât be charged.
Your payment will only be collected if, at the time of the projectâs funding deadline, the project has reached its fundraising goal.
The exact amount you pledged is the amount Kickstarter will collect.
If the campaign hasnât reached its fundraising goal, you wonât be charged, no funds will be collected, and no money will change hands.


In some cases weâll reserve the charge on your card.
Kickstarter and its payment partners may authorize or reserve a charge on your credit card (or whatever payment method you use) for any amount up to the full pledge, at any time between the pledge and the collection of funds.


You can change or cancel your pledge at any time before the projectâs funding deadline (with one exception).
You can increase, decrease, or cancel your pledge at any time during the campaign, with one exception.
During the last 24 hours of the campaign, you canât decrease or cancel your pledge without contacting customer support firstâif that action would drop the project below its funding goal.
Once the project has been funded, you can only cancel or change your pledge by making special arrangements directly with the creator.


The estimated delivery is the creatorâs  estimate.

The month and year listed on each reward is the creatorâs estimate of when they will provide the rewardânot a guarantee to fulfill by that time.
The schedule may change as the creator works on the project.
We ask creators to think carefully, set an estimated delivery they feel confident they can work toward, and communicate with backers about any changes.


The creator may need to send you questions about your reward.
To deliver rewards, the creator might need information from you, like your mailing address or t-shirt size.
Theyâll request that information after the campaign has succeeded.
To receive the reward, youâll need to provide the information in a reasonable amount of time.
Creators should not ask for personal information that is not necessary to provide your reward, and should never request sensitive personal information such as your Social Security number or payment information.
Contact us at support@kickstarter.com if you receive a request for information that seems inappropriate or excessive.


Kickstarter doesnât offer refunds.
Responsibility for finishing a project lies entirely with the project creator.
Kickstarter doesnât hold funds on creatorsâ behalf, cannot guarantee creatorsâ work, and does not offer refunds.



These are the terms that apply when youâre creating a project:



You can refund individual pledges if you want.
After your project has been funded, you can cancel and refund a backerâs pledge at any time.
If you do, you have no further obligation to that specific backer, and no agreement exists between you.


Weâll charge our fees before putting funds in your account.
Kickstarter and its payment partners will subtract fees before transmitting the proceeds of a campaign.


Some pledges canât be collected, which might reduce the amount of funding you get.
Because some payments canât be collectedâfor instance, when a backerâs credit card expires before funding ends, and they donât provide updated informationâwe canât guarantee that the amount of funding you receive will be exactly equal to the full amount pledged minus fees.


We'll help resolve payment-card disputes.
If a backer of your project disputes the charge with their card issuer, we'll handle re-presenting the charge to settle the dispute with the card issuer.
Youâll be notified that a dispute has been filed, and youâll be able to provide evidence to help us resolve it in your favor.
If the cardholderâs dispute is found valid, you authorize us to charge the credit card number you provided when you started your project for the amount of the chargeback.


Prepare for potential delays.
Donât assume youâll be able to launch your project when you want.
there could be a reason weâre not able to accept it, or a problem that takes time to resolve.
Donât assume youâll be able to immediately collect your funding.
there may be a delay between the end of a successful campaign and your access to the funds.
And donât take any actions in reliance on collecting any of the money pledged until you actually have the ability to withdraw it from your account and spend it.

 6.
Stuff We Donât Do and Arenât Responsible For 
We donât oversee projectsâ performance, and we donât mediate disputes between users.


Kickstarter isnât liable for any damages or losses related to your use of the Services.
We donât become involved in disputes between users, or between users and any third party relating to the use of the Services.
We donât oversee the performance or punctuality of projects, and we donât endorse any content users submit to the Site.
When you use the Services, you release Kickstarter from claims, damages, and demands of every kindâknown or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosedâarising out of or in any way related to such disputes and the Services.
All content you access through the Services is at your own risk.
Youâre solely responsible for any resulting damage or loss to any party.
 7.
Our Fees 
We only charge our 5% fee on successfully funded projects, in addition to any fees from our payment partners.


Creating an account on Kickstarter is free.
If you create a project that reaches its funding goal, we collect a 5% fee and our payment partners collect fees.
Our partnersâ fees may vary slightly based on your location.


We will not collect any fees without giving you a chance to review and accept them.
If our fees ever change, weâll announce that on our Site.
Some funds pledged by backers are collected by payment providers.
Each payment provider is its own company, and Kickstarter isnât responsible for its performance.


Youâre responsible for paying any additional fees or taxes associated with your use of Kickstarter.
 8.
Other Websites 
If you follow a link to another website, what happens there is between you and themânot us.


Kickstarter may contain links to other websites.
(For instance, project pages, user profiles, and comments may link to other sites.) When you access third-party websites, you do so at your own risk.
We donât control or endorse those sites.


Kickstarter partners with other companies (such as Stripe) for payment processing.
When you back or create a project, youâre also agreeing to the payment processorâs terms of service.
 9.
Your Intellectual Property 
We don't own the content you post on Kickstarter, but we do have your permission to use or copy it however we need.
We generally use it to promote projects and showcase our community.
Ultimately, you're responsible for the content you post, and you're vouching to us that it's ok to use.


Kickstarter doesnât own content you submit to us (your âContentâ).
But we do need certain licenses from you in order to perform our Services.
When you submit a project for review, or launch a project, you agree to these terms:



We can use the Content youâve submitted.
You grant to us, and others acting on our behalf, the worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable right to use, exercise, commercialize, and exploit the copyright, publicity, trademark, and database rights with respect to your Content.
In general, we use this Content to promote projects and showcase our community on the website.
There are many factors that we take into consideration before featuring a project on the homepage or giving it a Project We Love badge.
This includes, but is not limited to, a crisp project image with no logos, badges, or text on top, a clear and detailed description that includes a thorough plan for completing your project, captivating images or videos, an excited community, what we think different users will be interested in, and of course, a lot of creativity.
In addition to giving some projects a Project We Love badge, we also carefully curate the homepage to highlight great examples of Kickstarter projects.
The projects at the very top of the homepage typically are best-of-the-best Projects We Loveâbased on factors such as creative innovation, honesty, and alignment with Kickstarterâs mission and charterâbut we also use algorithms to surface popular projects, projects your friends have backed and launched, and projects recommended just for you.
We may also recommend projects that are gaining traction as a result of their creatorâs own advertising, and/or on the basis of a userâs prior search terms, browsing history, project backings and other interactions, and cookies we have collected during their visits to our website.


When we use the Content, we can make changes, like editing or translating it.
You grant us the right to edit, modify, reformat, excerpt, delete, or translate any of your Content.


You wonât submit stuff you donât hold the copyright for (unless you have permission).
Your Content will not contain third-party copyrighted material, or material that is subject to other third-party proprietary rights, unless you have permission from the rightful owner of the material, or you are otherwise legally entitled to post the material (and to grant Kickstarter all the license rights outlined here).


Any royalties or licensing on your Content are your responsibility.
You will pay all royalties and other amounts owed to any person or entity based on your Content, or on Kickstarterâs hosting of that Content.


You promise that if we use your Content, weâre not violating anyoneâs rights or copyrights.
If Kickstarter or its users exploit or make use of your submission in the ways contemplated in this agreement, you promise that this will not infringe or violate the rights of any third party, including (without limitation) any privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights, or any other intellectual property or proprietary rights.


Youâre responsible for the stuff you post.
All information submitted to the Site, whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, is the sole responsibility of the person from whom that Content originated.


Weâre not responsible for mistakes in your Content.
Kickstarter will not be liable for any errors or omissions in any Content.

 10.
Kickstarterâs Intellectual Property 
The content on Kickstarter is protected in various ways.
You do have the right to use it for certain personal purposes, but you canât use it for anything commercial without getting permission first.


Kickstarterâs Services are legally protected in various ways, including copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patents, trade secrets, and other rights and laws.
You agree to respect all copyright and other legal notices, information, and restrictions contained in any content accessed through the Site.
You also agree not to change, translate, or otherwise create derivative works of the Service.


Kickstarter grants you a license to reproduce content from the Services for personal use only.
This license covers both Kickstarterâs own protected content and user-generated content on the Site.
(This license is worldwide, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, and non-transferable.) If you want to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, or store any of this content for a commercial purpose, you need prior written permission from Kickstarter or the relevant copyright holder.
A âcommercial purposeâ means you intend to use, sell, license, rent, or otherwise exploit content for commercial use, in any way.
 11.
How We Deal with Copyright Issues 
We comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
To learn more about how we deal with claims of copyright infringement, read our Copyright Policy.


The Digital Millennium Copyright Act lays out a system of legal requirements for dealing with allegations of copyright infringement.
Kickstarter complies with the DMCA, and we respond to notices of alleged infringement if they comply with the law and the requirements set forth in our Copyright Policy.
We reserve the right to delete or disable content alleged to be infringing, and to terminate accounts for repeat infringers.
(We do this when appropriate and at our sole discretion.)


If youâd like to submit a claim of copyright infringement, please visit our Copyright Policy.
Our designated agent for notice of alleged copyright infringement is:


Kickstarter, PBC

Attn: Copyright Agent

58 Kent Street

Brooklyn, NY 11222, USA

copyright@kickstarter.com
 12.
Deleting Your Account 
You can delete your account at any time, but doing so wonât automatically remove some content youâve already posted.


You can terminate your account at any time through your account settings.
We may retain certain information as required by law or as necessary for our legitimate business purposes.
All provisions of this agreement survive termination of an account, including our rights regarding any content youâve already submitted to the Site.
(For instance, if youâve launched a project, deleting your account will not automatically remove the project from the Site.) You can contact us at support@kickstarter.com for additional information or to request project page deletion (this is not available in all circumstances).
 13.
Our Rights 
To operate, we need to be able to maintain control over what happens on our website.
So in this section, we reserve the right to make decisions to protect the health and integrity of our system.
We donât take these powers lightly, and we only use them when we absolutely have to.


To protect the health and integrity of our system and to help ensure that creators and backers enjoy a safe and secure environment, Kickstarter reserves these rights:


We can make changes to the Kickstarter Site and Services without notice or liability.
We have the right to decide whoâs eligible to use Kickstarter.
We may in limited circumstances impose restrictions or limitations on accounts, orâfor particularly significant or repeated violations of our Terms or any other rules on the Site, like our Community Guidelines and rules for starting projectsâwe may cancel accounts or decline to offer our Services.
(Especially if youâre abusing them.) We can change our eligibility criteria at any time.
If these things are prohibited by law where you live, then we revoke your right to use Kickstarter in that jurisdiction.
We have the right to cancel any pledge to any project, at any time and for any reason.
We have the right to reject, cancel, interrupt, remove, or suspend any project at any time and for any reason.


Kickstarter is not liable for any damages as a result of any of these actions.


It is our general policy not to comment on the reasons for any such action.
However, if we impose restrictions on or limit a verified account holderâs access to any of our Services or if we intend to cancel a verified account, we will let the account holder know the reasons for this action and how they can remedy any issues (where appropriate), unless weâre prohibited from doing so by law or in the interest of safety.
For account cancelations, we will let the account holder know the reasons for this action at least 30 days in advance, unless weâre canceling for reasons related to illicit or inappropriate content, the safety of a good or service, counterfeiting, fraud, malware, spam, data breaches, other cybersecurity risks, or the suitability of a good or service for minors.
 14.
Warranty Disclaimer 
We work hard to provide you with great services, but we canât guarantee everything will always work perfectly.
This site is presented as-is, without warranties.


You use our Services solely at your own risk.
They are provided to you âas isâ and âas availableâ and without warranty of any kind, express or implied.


KICKSTARTER SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ANY WARRANTIES IMPLIED BY ANY COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, OR USAGE OF TRADE.
NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION (ORAL OR WRITTEN) OBTAINED BY YOU FROM KICKSTARTER SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY.
 15.
Indemnification 
If you do something on Kickstarter that winds up getting us sued, you have to help defend us.


If you do something that gets us sued, or break any of the promises you make in this agreement, you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold us harmless from all liabilities, claims, and expenses (including reasonable attorneysâ fees and other legal costs) that arise from or relate to your use or misuse of Kickstarter.
We reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to this indemnification clause, in which case you agree that youâll cooperate and help us in asserting any defenses.
 16.
Limitation of Liability 
If something bad happens as a result of your using Kickstarter, weâre not liable (beyond a small amount).


To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event will Kickstarter, its directors, employees, partners, suppliers, or content providers be liable for any indirect, incidental, punitive, consequential, special, or exemplary damages of any kind, including but not limited to damages (i) resulting from your access to, use of, or inability to access or use the Services.
(ii) for any lost profits, data loss, or cost of procurement or substitute goods or services.
or (iii) for any conduct of content of any third party on the Site.
In no event shall Kickstarterâs liability for direct damages be in excess of (in the aggregate) one hundred U.S.
dollars ($100.00).
 17.
Dispute Resolution and Governing Law 
Weâre located in New York, and any disputes with us have to be handled in New York under New York State law.


We at Kickstarter encourage you to contact us if youâre having an issue before resorting to the courts.
Our Kickstarter support team is on hand and ready to answer your questions.
You can visit our Help Center to find articles with information that may resolve your issue.
If you still have questions, you can click âContact usâ in the Help Center or email support@kickstarter.com so that one of our support team agents can personally reply to you and attempt to resolve your issue.
These resources are easily accessible and free.


If youâre a creator based in the European Union and, after contacting us through those channels, you still donât feel as if your issue has been resolved, we may agree with you to engage in mediation to resolve any complaints in good faith.
You may address your complaint with one of these two mediation organizations:


The Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (CEDR)
IPOS Mediation


In the unfortunate situation where legal action does arise, these Terms (and all other rules, policies, or guidelines incorporated by reference) will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York and the United States, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law, and without application of the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act or the United Nations Convention of Controls for International Sale of Goods.
You agree that Kickstarter and its Services are deemed a passive website that does not give rise to jurisdiction over Kickstarter or its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, assigns, employees, agents, directors, officers, or shareholders, either specific or general, in any jurisdiction other than the State of New York.
You agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Terms, or your use or non-use of Kickstarter, shall be filed only in the state or federal courts located in New York County in the State of New York, and you hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of these courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.
You hereby irrevocably waive any right you may have to trial by jury in any dispute, action, or proceeding.
 18.
The Rest 
These are our official terms and our rules for how things work.
You can verify any confusing or conflicting information you see elsewhere by referencing what weâve explained on this page.


These Terms and the other material referenced in them are the entire agreement between you and Kickstarter with respect to the Services.
They supersede all other communications and proposals (whether oral, written, or electronic) between you and Kickstarter with respect to the Services and govern our future relationship.
If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid under the law, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms otherwise will remain in full force and effect and enforceable.
The failure of either you or Kickstarter to exercise any right provided for in these Terms in any way wonât be deemed a waiver of any other rights.


These Terms are personal to you.
You canât assign them, transfer them, or sublicense them unless you get Kickstarterâs prior written consent.
Kickstarter has the right to assign, transfer, or delegate any of its rights and obligations under these Terms without your consent.
Kickstarter will provide you notice via email, written notice, or by conspicuously posting the notice on our Site.
