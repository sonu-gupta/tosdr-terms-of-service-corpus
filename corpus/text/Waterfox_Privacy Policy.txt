Generally, we use your information to help us provide and improve our products and services for you.When do we share your information with others?Even though we don't collect any such information, just in-case: 

If our organizational structure or status changes (if we undergo a restructuring, are acquired, or go bankrupt) we may pass your information to a successor.

Things you should know: 

Social Media: If you engage with our social media accounts, such as Twitter and Facebook, we may receive personal information about you.

We may use cookies, third party web analytics, device information, and IP addresses for functionality and to better understand user interaction with our products, services, and communications.


Functionality: We may use cookies and/or device information to enhance functionality of certain products, services, and communications.
For example: 
Cookies are used to remember your Waterfox language preference and Waterfox add-ons.
They also assist with user sign-in and authentication so you can bypass entering your passwords on certain Waterfox websites.


Metrics: We may also use cookies and/or IP addresses, to help us understand in the aggregate how users engage with our products, services, communications, websites, online campaigns and other platforms.
We use: 
Matomo, which is self hosted.
Self-hosting means that no third party (not even Matomo) ever has access to your data.

No IP address storage: Matomo doesnât store any IP address, but rather converts IP to userâs country and then discarding the IP.
GDPR also stipulates that individuals have a right to âblockâ or suppress processing of personal data.
If an individual decides not to be tracked, Matomo has a function to support this.
If it is invoked, then we do not track that user at all.







You can control individual cookie preferences, indicate your cookie preferences to others, and opt-out of web analytics and optimization tools.


Cookie History: You can accept or decline individual cookies in your Waterfox preferences in the Tools/Options/Privacy history section.
Note that certain features of our products and services may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
Do Not Track: Waterfox does not track users across third party websites to provide targeted advertising.
If you have configured your browser to send a âDo Not Trackâ signal when accessing our websites, Waterfox will not utilize any of the tools described in the Metrics section.
Social Media: The social sharing buttons on Waterfox websites are designed not to share data with the social media provider until you specifically click the button.



Some Waterfox websites allow you to make a donation.
These transactions are processed by third parties, and not Waterfox.


Payment Processing: Waterfox does not receive any financial information, which is transmitted from you to our third party vendors for processing.
The name of the third party will be displayed at the time of the transaction.
