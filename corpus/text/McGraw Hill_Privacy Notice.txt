We have implemented policies and procedures to support customers in their compliance with privacy laws, including: GDPR, COPPA, and FERPA.
We've taken a leadership role with Future of Privacy Forum (FPF) and the Software and Information Industry Association (SIIA) in setting the agenda for self-regulatory goals for student privacy in the industry.
We have an internal Privacy Council comprised of senior leaders throughout our company that provides the tone at the top to perpetuate best practices across our business.
We do not support business models that create tolls and taxes on interoperability.
We conduct regular scans of our applications to prevent and detect security breaches.
We recognize that no system is 100% secure, but we take steps to prevent and mitigate the impact of adverse events.

By increasing awareness and transparency, we hope to better understand the concerns and learn how to talk with each other about privacy, security, and confidentiality.
Educational institutions, as data controllers, are ultimately responsible for providing a full understanding of the privacy practices around how their students' personally identifiable information is collected, shared, and used.
To obtain more detailed information about how data is collected, used, and shared by an educational institution, please contact the appropriate representative at that institution.

For further details on our privacy practices around student data, please review the Student Data Privacy Notice.
The Student Data Privacy Notice details practices around how we collect and use student information, whether they are a student at an educational institution or an individual using a product on their own.
If you have purchased an McGraw Hill product for your child please also review the Customer Data Privacy Notice for information on how we handle your personally identifiable information.
