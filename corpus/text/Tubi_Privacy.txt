Cookies.
Cookies are small bits of information that are stored in separate files within your computerâs Internet browser.
Cookies store information about your activities on a website or other platform.
For example, cookies can store your session information for easy sign-in to a website or other platform you have previously visited.
They enable us to make your use of the Tubi Services more enjoyable.

We, along with advertising technology companies and service providers that provide services to us and our business partners, may display targeted advertisements based on your activities and other information collected from or about you, such as your interests and your activities online.
Cookies are one way that this kind of information is stored.
We, along with advertising technology companies and service providers that provide services to us and our business partners, may also use cookies and similar technologies to compile aggregate data about you and to relate your use of the Tubi Services to information obtained from you or from reputable third parties.
For example, if you have asked us to send you information about our upcoming services or promotions, data about your activities on the Tubi Services, collected using cookies, may allow us to limit the materials we send you to items that we believe will be of interest to you.
You can configure your Internet browser to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse cookies completely.
However, if you reject certain cookies, you will not have access to certain features of the Tubi Services.
Some advertisements displayed in connection with the Tubi Services may also access or place cookies on your Internet browser or use other technologies provided by third party Internet advertisers, advertising technology companies, and service providers that perform advertising-related services.
For more information on this topic, please see our discussion of Third Party Advertising on Tubi.


Other local storage.
We, along with advertising technology companies and service providers that provide services to us and our business partners, use other kinds of local storage, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as âFlash cookiesâ) and HTML5 local storage, in connection with the Tubi Services, including the video player.
Sometimes called âbrowser cookies,â these technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your computers and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences, such as your volume/mute settings.
However, these objects are stored in different parts of your computer from ordinary browser cookies.
Many Internet browsers allow you to disable HTML5 local storage or delete information contained in HTML5 local storage using browser controls.
