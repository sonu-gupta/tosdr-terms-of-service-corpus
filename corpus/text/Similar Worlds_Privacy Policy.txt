To protect our community

We use the information we have to help verify accounts and activity, and to promote safety and security on and off of our services, such as by investigating suspicious activity, abuse or violations of our terms or policies.
 How do we protect your information?
We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you access your personal information:


We store your passwords using an encryption algorithm specifically designed for this purpose.
We have no way of knowing what your password is, using the data we store in our database.
We are constantly checking that our applications and servers are secure, doing our best to prevent unwanted individuals from taking control of our systems or gaining access to private data.
We encrypt our server backups and database backups as a way of better protecting your data.
We use HTTPS/SSL (secure connection) on Similar Worlds, which means that your activity is encrypted and private.
We don't use insecure protocols to administrate our server, database or emails.
We also try our best to disable the usage of insecure protocols.
We don't share your personal information without your permission (unless required by law).
We restrict access to personal information only to the Admins of Similar Worlds.
Moderators and Staff (other than the Admins) may have access only to the information that they need to know in order to process it for us (such as dealing with Reports of public posts and replies).
Only Admins and selected Moderators have access to Posts which visibility is set to 'Friends-only' while the user hasn't added the Admin or Moderator as a friend.
Moderators and Staff (other than the Admins) do not have access to your private messages.
Moderators and Staff are subject to strict confidentiality obligations and their role may be terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
We limit the data we keep in places outside the main databases, such as logs, documents, notes, emails and conversations.
If any of these require any personal identifiable information, we only add the data we need for each specific scenario, and we destroy that data when we don't need it anymore.
This helps greatly in preventing against data breaches.

This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential.

When you register on Similar Worlds, you are automatically subscribed to the email notifications of its basic features.
However, you may disable some or all notifications via your Account Settings - Email Preferences.
On that page, you can edit your account preferences.
If you no longer wish to use or have access to that particular account on Similar Worlds, you may cancel your account at any time by accessing your Account Settings, then Leave Similar Worlds and following the instructions there.

Profile Visibility
Profiles on Similar Worlds are set, by default, to be visible by everyone, including people who are not registered on Similar Worlds.
This setting can be changed through your Account Settings.
You can set your profile visibility to Members only.
If your profile visibility is set to Public, everyone will be able to see your public comments, stories, groups, public photos and other contents that are not private.
If you set a photo or image as your Profile Picture, both the thumbnail (small) version of the photo and the full (big) version of the photo will be made public, independently of the privacy setting of the album that the image is in.
Sharing Posts on Similar Worlds
When you share a post (via the submission form at the top of any group or community, or the Post page), your submission will be posted to the group or community and will be made public.
Sharing Photos on Similar Worlds
The visibility of the photos you upload to your profile depends on the Album you post into.
If an Album's visibility is set to Friends, its photos will only be visible to users on your Friends List.
This also means that updates about that image (upload or comments) will not appear in the news feed of users who are not on your Friends List.
Always think before you upload a image.
If someone provides the direct link of the image (URL) to a person that is not on your Friends List, that person will be able to see the image.
The page on your album that contains the image will not be accessible to non-Friends (depending on your privacy setting) and the image will not appear in the Albums list.
If the album visibility is set to Everyone, this setting will change its behavior depending on your profile visibility.
This means that if your profile visibility is set to Friends, then the photos in the album will be visible to users on your Friends List only.
If you set a photo or image as your Profile Picture, both the thumbnail (small) version of the photo and the full (big) version of the photo will be made public, independently of the privacy setting of the album that the image is in.
