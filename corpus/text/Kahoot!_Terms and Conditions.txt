Payments, cancellations, upgrades

Payments and cancellations
If you have signed up for Kahoot! Basic or if you cancel your Paid Subscription during the Trial, Kahoot! will never charge you any fees for your use of the Kahoot! Service.
Paid Subscriptions can be purchased directly from Kahoot! in the App or on our web site, or through a separate agreement with Kahoot!.
If you have signed up for a Paid Subscription for a monthly subscription fee, you will be charged for one monthâs subscription fee in advance upon expiry of any Trial.
The Paid Subscription and the payment to Kahoot! will automatically renew at the end of the monthly subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription through your subscription page before the end of the current monthly subscription period.
If you have signed up for a Paid Subscription which gives you access to the Kahoot! Service for a specific time period (âPre-Paid Periodâ), you will be charged for the Pre-Paid Period in advance upon expiry of any Trial.
The Paid Subscription and the payment to Kahoot! will automatically renew at the end of the Pre-paid Period unless you cancel your Paid Subscription through your subscription page before the end of the Pre-paid Period.
If you cancel your Paid Subscription, the cancellation will take effect on the day after the last day of the current subscription period, after which you will be downgraded to Kahoot! Basic.
We will not refund any subscription fees already paid to us.
Kahoot! may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions from time to time, and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes.
Price changes for Paid Subscriptions will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.
As permitted by local law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Kahoot! Service after the price change takes effect.
If you do not agree with the price changes, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect, in which case you will be downgraded to Kahoot! Basic.
We do not provide any refunds if the price for a Paid Subscription drops, or if we offer subsequent promotional pricing or change the content or features of a Service Plan.
Paid Subscriptions purchased through other platforms are subject to the refund policies of those platforms.
Kahoot! cannot be held responsible for these platformsâ policies.
Please note that in the event you purchase a Kahoot! subscription, you are legally obliged to pay the invoice.
This means that if you have not paid the invoice, but you have used our products/services, you are legally bound to pay the invoice
Your right to withdraw is revoked as soon as your subscription is activated, as activation immediately initiates full access to the features specified in the subscription.
These features constitute our digital content.

You may at any time upgrade or downgrade your Paid Subscription to a different Service Plan:

Paid Subscriptions â monthly:


If you have downgraded your monthly Paid Subscription to a lower Service Plan, such downgrade will take effect on the day after the last day of the current subscription period.
If you have upgraded your monthly Paid Subscription to a higher Service Plan, such upgrade will take effect immediately subject to payment of the upgrade fee.


Paid Subscriptions â Pre-paid Period:


If you have downgraded your Paid Subscription to a lower Service Plan during the Pre-paid Period, such downgrade will take effect on the date of renewal (i.e.
the day after the last day of the Pre-paid Period).
If you have upgraded your Paid Subscription to a higher Service Plan during the Pre-paid Period, such upgrade will take effect immediately subject to payment of the upgrade fee and you will automatically enter into a new Pre-paid Period with the same duration as the preceding Pre-paid Period.

5.3.
