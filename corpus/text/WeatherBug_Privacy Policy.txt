Digital Advertising &amp.
Your Choices

We may partner with GroundTruth and with various third parties that engage in
interest-based advertising ("IBA").
This type of advertising involves
the collection of web viewing, location-related information and mobile
application use data from our Services and other non-affiliated websites and
mobile applications over time and across associated devices.
This data is used
to infer interests and deliver relevant advertising back to a browser or
device, and to browsers and devices that are associated with each other.
Browser Choice: For more information about IBA, and to learn how you can
exercise choice regarding the practice on your browser for companies that
participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") WebChoices
tool, you can visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices or
TrustArc (click
here).

App Choice: You may also download an application on your iOS or Android device
in order to exercise choice regarding the collection of mobile application use
activity for IBA on this device by companies that participate in those choice
tools.
Links to those applications are below:
DAA
AppChoices iOS

AppChoices Android
TRUSTe
mobile app iOS
TRUSTe
mobile app Android

Location Data Choice: The DAA's AppChoices tool can also be used to exercise
choice regarding the collection and use of precise location data by GroundTruth
for IBA purposes.
To limit the collection of precise location data by other
parties through our application for a particular device, you can turn location
services off through your device's settings.

Note that electing to opt out from IBA will not stop advertising from appearing
in your browser or applications.
It may make the ads you see less relevant to
your interests.
In addition, note that if you use a different browser or
device, erase cookies from your browser, or reset your platform ad identifier,
you may need to renew your opt-out choice.
In addition, companies may still
collect data in browsers or apps for non-IBA purposes such as for analytics and
reporting purposes, operations, improving our or their Services, and frequency
capping.
