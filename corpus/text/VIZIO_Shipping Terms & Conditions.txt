About the eRecyle Fee - VIZIO is the nationsâ largest, U.S.
based, manufacturer of High Definition television products.
As VIZIO continues to offer the most advanced and latest technology to consumers, VIZIO is sensitive to the environmental concerns relating to disposal of old television technology and protection of the environment.
As a result, VIZIO supports recycling program efforts adopted by many states, and encourages our customers to participate in âgreenâ environmental practices.
To learn more about VIZIOâs environmental efforts, please visit our website.
For California customers
In 2003, the California Electronic Waste Recycling Act was adopted to help launch environmental âe-wasteâ programs in the State of California.
More information regarding this legislation can be found here:https://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/Electronics/RegInfo/
At the time of a VIZIO television purchase, you will be charged an e-waste recycling fee as mandated by the State of California to help fund recycling efforts.
These fees are collected at the time of purchase and remitted to the state in accordance with regulatory requirements.
Effective January 1, 2017, the covered electronic waste recycling fee paid by a consumer upon the purchase of a new or refurbished covered electronic device shall be the following amounts:

Five dollars ($5) for each covered electronic device with a screen size of less than 15 inches measured diagonally.
Six dollars ($6) for each covered electronic device with a screen size greater than or equal to 15 inches but less than 35 inches measured diagonally.
Seven dollars ($7) for each covered electronic device with a screen size greater than or equal to 35 inches measured diagonally.

For more information pertaining to recycling and e-waste fees in California, please visit https://www.calrecycle.ca.gov or call CalRecycle at 1-916-341-6300. Be the first to receive VIZIO news, promotions, special offers, and more
