         FastestVPN Does Not Store Any
Logs, Period!
We do not store your logs in anyway.
Any information or logs related to your browsing history - the websites you visit, the content you download or stream, your traffic destinations, or your DNS queries - stays with you and you alone.
What Information Do We Keep? Only the email address that you share with us when you sign up for our service.
and that too is kept for billing purposes and account registration.
Once a user deactivates their account, their email address is also removed from our data base.
Other than that, we do not keep any logs nor any credit card info.
FastestVPN also uses Google Analytics, Hotjar and Livechat software to enhance user experience and website performance.
What If Any Authority Wants
To Inquire About A Specific Customer Or An IP? Since we donât log any user activity, we canât connect any activity to a specific user.
The only information that we keep, as mentioned above, is the email address - that too for billing purposes.
We do not log any history or session data, hence cannot provide any data to the authorities.
In Case You Receive Any Legal
Notice, What Will You Do?
As we cannot connect any activity with a particular user, we cannot provide anything that can be presented as evidence in court of law.
Since we are based in Cayman Island, one of the few countries with âNo Mandatory Data retention lawsâ, therefore we are not legally bound to store any user data or share it with anyone.
Is P2P File Sharing Allowed? P2P file sharing is allowed on all of our servers.

How We Secure User
Information
FastestVPN takes several measures to safeguard user-information, both technically and physically in our offices.
Only people designated to perform certain duties are able to access user-information.
But a service can only do so much to protect its users.
You, as a user, must always remain vigilant about sharing your FastestVPN account and user-information on the internet.
Because FastestVPN does not store activity logs, a governmentâs request to share data cannot be tied to any specific user.
