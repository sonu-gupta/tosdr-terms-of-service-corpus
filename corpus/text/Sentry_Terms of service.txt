Fees and Payment Terms.
Plan Upgrade/Downgrade/Cancellation.
Pricing Changes

In exchange for your rights to access the Site and use the Services during the Contract Period, you agree to pay the applicable Subscription Fees to Sentry.
The Subscription Fees do not include taxes.
you will be responsible for, and will promptly pay, all taxes associated with your use of the Site and the Services, other than taxes based on our net income.
Subscription Fees are payable in full, in advance, in accordance with your Plan, and are non-refundable and non-creditable.
This means that: (i) if you have a monthly Contract Period, you will owe us each monthâs payment in advance, before you are allowed to use the Services for that month.
(ii) if you have an annual Contract Period with up-front payment terms, you will owe us the entire yearâs payment in advance, before you are allowed to use the Services for that year.
and (iii) if you have an annual Contract Period with monthly payment terms, you will owe us each monthâs payment in advance throughout the Contract Period, before you are allowed to use the Services during each month of the Contract Period.
You agree to make all payments in U.S.
Dollars.



You can cancel your account(s)/subscription(s) via the process set forth in the âCancel Subscriptionâ section of your Account Settings on the Site.
An email or phone request to cancel your account is not considered cancellation.
No refunds will be issued, unless expressly stated otherwise.
Any cancellation will take effect only at the end of your then-current Contract Period, and you will continue to owe all Subscription Fees for the duration of your then-current Contract Period.
Pro-rata refunds will not be provided.
You understand that if you have an annual Contract Period with monthly payment terms: (i) you will still be obligated to pay us the Subscription Fees for the entire annual Contract Period, irrespective of whether you elect to cancel your subscription prior to the end of your then-current Contract Period.
and (ii) notwithstanding the foregoing, we reserve the right, at our sole and absolute discretion, to permit you to cancel your subscription without further liability by making a lump-sum payment to us that is equal to the upcoming three (3) months of Subscription Fees that you would otherwise have owed us.



All of your Content will be deleted from the Services within a reasonable time period from when you cancel your account/subscription.
Deleted Content cannot be recovered once your account/subscription is cancelled.


If you upgrade from the free Plan to any paid Plan, we will immediately bill you for the applicable Subscription Fees.
There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open account.


Downgrading your account(s) may cause the loss of Content, features, or capacity of your account(s).
We do not accept any liability for such loss.


Each Contract Period will automatically renew (and we may automatically invoice you) for additional Contract Periods of equivalent length, unless and until one party provides written notice to the other at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the then-current Contract Period that it wishes to terminate the subscription at the end of the then-current Contract Period.
We reserve the right to modify the fees for the Services at any time upon thirty (30) daysâ prior notice to you, provided that the modified fees will not apply until the next Contract Period.


Interest on any late payments will accrue at the rate of 1.5% per month, or the highest rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, from the date the amount is due until the date the amount is paid in full.
If you are late in paying us, you also agree that, in addition to our rights to suspend your access to the Services, terminate your account(s), downgrade you to a free Plan, and/or pursue any other rights or remedies available to us at law or in equity, you are responsible to reimburse us for any costs that we incur while attempting to collect such late payments.



Overage EventsThe Subscription Fees you owe for the Plan you select are based on the number of errors and similar events (each, an âEventâ) that you are permitted to send to us each month.
If you exceed the Event limit for your Plan in a given month, you will owe us additional, on-demand fees for each additional Event (collectively, âOverage Eventsâ).
To avoid paying additional on-demand fees for your Overage Events, we encourage customers to use their accountâs administrative console to restrict the number of Events that they are permitted to send to us in a given month (a âRate Limitâ) to match the maximum number of Events permitted by their Plan.
Be aware that if you have a âSmallâ Plan, the lowest possible Rate Limit may not match the maximum number of Events permitted by your Plan.
If you have questions about how to best manage Overage Events while on a âSmallâ Plan, please contact us.
If you have established a Rate Limit, we will not process your Overage Events as part of the Services.
That said, as a practical matter, Sentry has no way to prevent you from sending your Overage Events to us.
If you are on a Rate Limit but are still sending us Overage Events, that costs us money and makes our Services slower for everyone else.
We encourage you to only send us the number of Events each month that you have paid for in your Plan, and, if you are sending Overage Events to us and do not wish to pay additional on-demand fees for the overage, to upgrade to a Plan that allows you to get the full benefit of our Services for all of your Events.
You acknowledge and agree that if you have established a Rate Limit but are still sending us Overage Events in two (2) or more consecutive months, we have the right, upon notice to you (which may be given via email) and at our sole discretion, to either: (i) automatically upgrade you to a higher-tier Plan that reflects the additional Events you are sending us.
or (ii) charge you on-demand fees for all future Overage Events in accordance with our then-current rates.
You agree to pay any upgrade costs or overage charges within ten (10) days of the date we inform you of them.
If you fail to make such payments in a timely fashion, we reserve the right, in addition to any other remedies available to us at law or in equity, to immediately terminate or suspend your access to the Services pursuant to Section 13.2, below.
