The short version


We do basic analytics but nothing on the client end, we do not share anything with third parties other than our providers for access (Basic network info to route connections via CloudFlare for example).
We don't share data with anyone without user permission FIRST!


The long version


We will not sell or disclose your personal information to third parties without your consent except as otherwise provided in this Policy or our Terms of Service and Appropriate Use Policy.
We may use information about who you are, where and when you browse our network, and how you use our network to provide you better service.


We respect your privacy and do not use any analytics services on our website, only basic network usage from our providers.


This Policy applies to customers who purchase and use our services and products in Canada.
Collection, use, disclosure, and protection of personal information may be subject to different regulation outside the Canada.


Hey.CafÃ© will revise and update this Policy as it is deemed appropriate, including, for example, if changes in the law so require.
