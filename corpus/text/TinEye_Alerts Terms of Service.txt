In these terms we call this web site, any successor web sites (together, the âSiteâ) and the software we provide the âApplicationâ.
We refer to the services provided by the Application as the âServicesâ.
The Services are described in detail on the Site.
Please read these Terms carefully before using the Services.
By accessing or using the Services you agree to be legally bound by these Terms and all terms, policies and guidelines incorporated by reference in these Terms.
If you do not agree with these Terms in their entirety, you may not use the Services.
In these Terms users of the Services, whether they are our customers or their representatives, are called âUsersâ.
TinEye reserves the right to change or modify any of the terms and conditions contained in these Terms, or any policy or guideline applicable to the Services, at any time and in its sole discretion.
If we do so, we will notify you at the email address you provide in your registration information, if any, or we will post a notice in the Application visible to you the next time you access the Application.
If you do not agree with the changes, you can cancel your account with us without further obligation, except for the amount due for the balance of the billing period in which you cancel your account (if your billing period is monthly, we will prorate your account to the nearest month-end after cancellation).
Unless otherwise specified, any changes or modifications will be effective immediately upon posting of the revisions on the Site or the date such email is sent, and your continued use of the Services after such time will constitute your acceptance of such changes or modifications.
You should from time to time review the Terms and any policies and documents incorporated in them to understand the terms and conditions that apply to your use of the Services.
The Terms will always show the âlast updatedâ date at the top.
If you do not agree to any amended Terms, you must stop using the Services.
If you have any questions about the Terms, please email us at support[at]tineye.com.
The Services are for your own use only.
You may not resell, lease or provide them in any other way to anyone else, except as expressly permitted through the Application. 1.

Fees.
Charges.
Taxes Fees and any other charges for the use of the Services are described on the Site.
They may change from time to time.
If we change them, we will give you at least 30 daysâ notice.
If they do change, your continued use of the Services, as the case may be, after the change indicates your agreement with the new fees and charges after the effective date of the change.
Any change to fees and other charges will not be applicable to the billing period in which the change occurs.
You are responsible for all taxes applicable to the fees and charges in any applicable jurisdiction. 4.
Ownership, Copyright and Trademarks In these Terms the content available through the Services, including all information, data, logos, marks, designs, graphics, pictures, sound files, other files, and their selection and arrangement, is called âContentâ.
Content provided by Users, whether they are Subscribers, Customers or other Users, is called âUser Contentâ.
For example, images that you upload to the Application (for media monitoring purposes) is your User Content.
User Content is the Userâs property.
TinEye's only right to that User Content is the limited licenses to it granted in these Terms.
Those licenses are described in Section 5 and Section 15 of these Terms.
Other than the User Content, the Services, all Content and all software available on the Services or used to create and operate the Services is the property of TinEye or its licensors, and is protected by Canadian and international copyright laws, and all rights to the Services, such Content and such software are expressly reserved.
Your User Content is your responsibility.
We have no responsibility or liability for it, or for any loss or damage your User Content, or any demands that you make to third parties related to your User Content, may cause to you or other people.
Although we have no obligation to do so, we have the absolute discretion to remove, screen or edit without notice any User Content posted or stored on the Services, and we may do this at any time and for any reason.
You are solely responsible for maintaining copies of and replacing any User Content you post or store on the Services.
If you authorize third parties to access your User Content through the Services, you agree that we are permitted to provide to them the User Content, and also agree that we have no responsibility or liability for their use of such User Content. 5.
Your Limited License of Your User Content to TinEye We do not claim any ownership interest in your User Content, but we do need the right to use your User Content to the extent necessary to operate the Site and provide the Services, now and in the future.
Therefore, by posting or distributing User Content to or through the Services, you (a) grant TinEye and its affiliates and subsidiaries a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable right to use, display, perform, reproduce, distribute, publish, modify, adapt, translate, and create derivative works from such User Content, in the manner in and for the purposes for which the Services from time to time use such User Content.
(b) represent and warrant that (i) you own and control all of the rights to the User Content that you post or otherwise distribute, or you otherwise have the lawful right to post and distribute that User Content, to or through the Services.
and (ii) the use and posting or other transmission of such User Content does not violate these Terms and will not violate any rights of or cause injury to any person or entity.
If your User Content is intended for the use of other Users, you also grant us and our affiliates and subsidiaries a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable right to sublicense such User Content to such Users for their use in connection with their use of the Services, as described in Section 6 of these Terms.
These licenses from you are non-exclusive because you have the right to use your User Content elsewhere.
They are royalty-free because we are not required to pay you for the use of your User Content on the Services.
And they are transferable because we need the right to transfer these licenses to any successor operator of the Services.
Our rights to âmodify, adapt, translate, and create derivative works fromâ are necessary because the normal operation of the Services does this to your User Content when it processes it for use in the Services. 6.
Our Limited License of Content to You TinEye grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable license to access the Services and to view, copy and print the portions of the Content available to you through the Services, and to use the reports provided to you by the Services for any purpose relating to your User Content.
Such license is subject to these Terms, and specifically conditioned upon the following: (i) you may only view, copy and print such portions of the Content for your own use.
(ii) you may not modify or otherwise make derivative works of the Content, or reproduce, distribute or display the Content (except for page cacheing) except as expressly permitted in these Terms.
(iii) you may not remove or modify any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary notices that have been placed in the Content.
(iv) you may not use any data mining, robots or similar data gathering or extraction methods.
and (v) you may not use the Services or the Content other than for their intended purpose.
You represent and warrant that your use of the Services and the Content will be consistent with this license and will not infringe or violate the rights of any other party or breach any contract or legal duty to any other parties, or violate any applicable law.
To request permission for uses of Content not included in this license, you may contact TinEye at the address set out at the bottom of these Terms. 7.
Use of the Services You agree not to post, upload to, transmit, distribute, store, create or otherwise publish through or as a result of using the Services any of the following:
Automated cease and desist letters or demands, or demands for payment or of any other kind, concerning alleged infringement by another person of your or any other personâs intellectual property or other rights (and for clarity, any TinEye Alert provided to you by the Service must be reviewed by you or your representative, but in any event an individual);
Any message, data, information, text, music, sound, photos, graphics, code or other material that is unlawful, libelous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, indecent, lewd, suggestive, harassing, threatening, invasive of privacy or publicity rights, abusive, inflammatory, fraudulent or otherwise objectionable;

Content that may infringe any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other intellectual or proprietary right of any party;
Any use of the Services in violation of the foregoing violates these Terms and may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Services. 8.
Providing a Reliable and Secure Service If you have spent any time reviewing the Services, you will hopefully have noticed that we take reliability and security seriously.
We put a great deal of effort into ensuring that our service operates all the time, and that it is a secure environment for your data.
We use what we believe to be âbest-of-classâ hosting services and security technologies and services that we believe provide you with a secure and safe environment.
More information about these services and technologies is available on the Site.
However, no system is perfectly secure or reliable, the Internet is an inherently insecure medium, and the reliability of hosting services, Internet intermediaries, your Internet service provider, and other service providers cannot be assured.
When you use this Service, you accept these risks, and the responsibility for choosing to use a technology that does not provide perfect security or reliability. 9.
No Responsibility for Third-Party Services, Sites or Content As a service to our users, the Site may contain links to third-party Web sites (âThird-Party Sitesâ) or third-party content (âThird-Party Contentâ) and may provide third-party services (âThird-Party Servicesâ), including payment processors and other payment intermediaries that you may use in connection with your use of the Services.
You use Third-Party Sites, Third-Party Content (together, the âThird Party Materialsâ) or Third-Party Services at your own risk.
TinEye makes no claim or representation regarding Third-Party Materials and Third-Party Services, and provides them or links to them only as a convenience.
Inclusion in the Services of Third-Party Materials does not imply TinEye's endorsement, adoption or sponsorship of, or affiliation with, such Third-Party Materials.
TinEye accepts no responsibility for reviewing changes or updates to, or the quality, content, policies, nature or reliability of Third-Party Materials, or Web sites linking to the Services.
When you leave the Services, our terms and policies no longer govern, and when you use Third-Party Services their terms and policies apply.
You should review applicable terms and policies, including privacy and data gathering practices, of any Third-Party Materials and Third-Party Services, and should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any transaction with any third party. 10.
