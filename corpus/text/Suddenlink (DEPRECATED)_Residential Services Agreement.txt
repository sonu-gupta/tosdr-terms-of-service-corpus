  GENERAL TERMS OF SERVICE APPLICABLE TO SERVICES  
1.
Payment of Charges. The charges for one month of Services, including any deposits, activation, installation and Equipment charges, are due upon installation of the Services or such other date as agreed by Suddenlink and You.
Thereafter, Customer agrees to pay monthly recurring Service charges and Equipment charges (if any) in advance, including all applicable fees (such as restoration or experience fees), taxes, regulatory fees, franchise fees, surcharges (including sports and broadcast tv surcharges) and other government assessments no later than the date indicated on Customer's bill.
Charges for non-recurring Services or Equipment charges will be reflected on Customer's subsequent bill at the then current applicable rates.
For instance, Customer will be billed monthly for Pay Per View, On Demand or other Services ordered where charges are based on actual usage or on orders placed during the previous month.
All rates for Services, Equipment charges and other fees and surcharges are subject to change in accordance with applicable law.
If Customer elects to pay by automatic recurring credit card, debit card or automatic clearing house payments, Customer authorizes Suddenlink to charge such accounts.
If Customer elects to send a check as payment, Customer authorizes Suddenlink either to use information from Customerâs check to make a one-time electronic funds transfer from Customerâs bank account or to process the payment as a check transaction.
Failure to receive a bill does not release Customer from Customer's obligation to pay.
Failure to pay the total balance when due (including checks returned for insufficient funds) shall constitute a breach of this Agreement and may be grounds for termination of Service, removal of Equipment from Customer's premises and/or imposition of a late fee ("Late Fee") in accordance with applicable law.
You can avoid incurring Late Fees by paying your monthly bill promptly.
Any Late Fee imposed on Customer is intended to be a reasonable advance estimate of costs of managing past due accounts.
The Late Fee is not interest, a penalty, a credit service charge or a finance charge.
If the Customer has more than one account (Business and/or Residential) served by Suddenlink, all Suddenlink provided Services at all locations may be subject to discontinuance of Service in the event any one account remains unpaid.
In the event collection activities are required, an additional collection charge may be imposed.

Monthly Subscriptions: Your monthly subscription begins either on or the first day following your installation date and automatically renews thereafter on a monthly basis beginning on the first day of the next billing period assigned to you until cancelled by you.
The monthly service charge(s) will be billed at the beginning of your assigned billing period and each month thereafter unless and until you cancel your Service(s).
PAYMENTS ARE NONREFUNDABLE AND THERE ARE NO REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR PARTIALLY USED SUBSCRIPTION PERIODS.
You may cancel Service(s) up to the last day of the billing period prior to the service period that you wish to cancel, and the cancellation will be effective at the end of the then-current billing period.
Any request for cancellation after the commencement of a service period will be effective at the end of the then-current service period.
Access to the Services will, if possible, continue to be provided at the location ordered or, if you move, to your new location if in a Suddenlink-served area (subject to any installation charges).
2. Additional Fees.
In addition to Customer's monthly recurring charges and any Late Fee, additional fees may be imposed, including fees for returned checks, Payment Assistance Fees for paying by phone, receiving a paper bill, charge card chargeback, early termination, reconnection and service calls.
Additional charges may also be imposed if collection activities are required to recover past due balances, including attorney fees.
A list of applicable fees ("Schedule of Fees") is available at www.suddenlink.com/pricing-packages.
Suddenlink reserves the right to amend or change the Schedule of Fees from time to time.
3.
Third Party Provider Charges.
In connection with Customerâs use of the Services and Equipment, Customer may be able to access, subscribe to, use and/or purchase products, services, software or applications that are provided to Customer by third parties ("Third Party Providers").
Customer acknowledges that Customer may incur charges in connection with the subscription to, purchase or use of these Third Party Provider products, services, software or applications.
All such charges, including any additional fees and applicable taxes, shall be paid by Customer to the Third Party Provider and are not the responsibility of Suddenlink.
Credits or billing adjustments for products, services, software or applications billed by a Third Party Provider shall be subject to the stated billing practices of that Third Party Provider.
Termination of a service or subscription offered for a separate charge billed directly by a Third Party Provider shall be effected in accordance with the Terms of Service or similar agreement between the Customer and the Third Party Provider.
4.
Taxes.
Customer agrees to pay any local, state or federal taxes imposed or levied on or with respect to the Services, the Equipment or installation or service charges incurred with respect to the same.
5.
Early Termination Fees.
If you cancel, terminate or downgrade the Service(s) before the completion of any required promotional term to which You agreed ("Initial Term"), you agree to pay Suddenlink any applicable early cancellation fee plus all outstanding charges for all Services used and Equipment purchased for which you have not paid us prior to termination.
You agree that early cancellation fees or any other fees may automatically be charged to your account and your credit or debit card provided to Suddenlink Communications and you agree to pay such fees.
6.
Right to Make Credit Inquiries. Customer acknowledges and agrees that Suddenlink may (a) verify Customer's credit standing, make inquiries and receive information about your credit experiences, including your credit report, from credit reporting agencies.
(b) enter this information in your file, and disclose this information concerning you to appropriate third parties for reasonable business purposes.
and (c) furnish information about you (including your social security number), your account(s) and your payment history to those credit reporting agencies.
7.
Security Deposits.
Suddenlink may require a deposit or activation fee based on Customer's credit standing or past payment history with Suddenlink.
A deposit and/or activation fee does not relieve the Customer of the responsibility for the prompt payment of bills on presentation.
Any security deposit given by Customer for the Equipment or Suddenlink's Service will be due and payable upon the first monthly billing.
Such security deposits will be returned to Customer within sixty (60) days of termination of Suddenlink's Service so long as payment has been made for all amounts due on Customer's account and Customer has returned the Suddenlink Equipment undamaged.
Security deposits paid by Customer for Equipment or Services may be used, to the extent permitted by law, to offset any unpaid balance or charges after termination of Service.
Customer shall remain liable for any outstanding balances after the security deposit has been applied.
Further terms and conditions of the security deposit may be contained in the deposit receipt given to Customer at the time the security deposit is collected.
8.
Disputed Charges. Customer agrees to pay all undisputed monthly charges and all applicable fees and taxes as itemized on the Suddenlink monthly bill and notify Suddenlink in writing of disputed items or requests for credit within thirty (30) days of Customerâs receipt of the bill for which correction of an error or credit is sought, or longer as provided by applicable law.
The date of the dispute shall be the date Suddenlink receives sufficient documentation to enable Suddenlink to investigate the dispute.
The date of the resolution is the date Suddenlink completes its investigation and notifies the Customer of the disposition of the dispute.
9.
Adjustments or Refunds. Any adjustment or refund, given in each case in Suddenlinkâs sole discretion, will be accomplished by a credit on a subsequent bill for Service, unless otherwise required by applicable law.
Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the liability of Suddenlink, its officers, shareholders, directors, employees, affiliates, vendors, carrier partners, content providers and other persons or entities involved in providing the Services or Equipment (collectively, the "Suddenlink Parties") for damages shall in no event, by reason of any delays, interruptions, omissions, errors, failures or defects in installation or service, exceed an amount equal to the Customer's Service charges and associated Equipment fees for a regular billing period ("Maximum Credit").
No credit allowance will be made for interruptions of Service that are:
a.
due to the negligence of or noncompliance with the provisions of the Agreement by Customer or any person authorized by customer to use the Service;
b.
due to the negligence of any person other than Suddenlink including, but not limited to, the other common carriers connected to the Suddenlink's facilities;
c.
due to the failure or malfunction of Customer-owned equipment or third party equipment;
d.
during any period in which Suddenlink is not given full and free access to its facilities and Equipment for the purpose of investigating and correcting interruptions;
e.
during a period in which Customer continues to use the Service on an impaired basis;
f.
during any period when the interruption is due to implementation of a Customer order for a change in Service arrangements.
or
g.
due to circumstances or causes beyond the control of Suddenlink.

Limitation of Refund. Unless otherwise provided by applicable law, in the event any amounts owed by Suddenlink to Customer are not claimed by Customer within one year of the date on which the amount became payable to Customer, Customer shall forfeit all rights to the refund and all such amounts shall become the property of Suddenlink.
10.
Equipment and Software. Unless Suddenlink expresses otherwise in writing, all equipment, including but not limited to, any cables, wires, amplifiers, cable boxes, access cards, remotes, cable cards, battery backup units, modems, routers, gateways, Altice One and Altice One Mini units distributed to and/or installed for use in the Customerâs service location(s) by or on behalf of Suddenlink ("Equipment"), network facilities, and software installed or provided by Suddenlink remains the property of Suddenlink, except that all wiring on the Customerâs side of the demarcation point at Customerâs service location, whether installed by Suddenlink or by Customer, shall be Customer property and not Suddenlink Equipment, and repair and maintenance for such wiring is the responsibility of Customer unless otherwise agreed by Customer and Suddenlink.
The demarcation point shall mean a point at (or about) twelve (12) inches outside of where the cable wire enters the Customerâs service location.
None of the Equipment shall become a fixture nor shall distribution, installation, and/or use of Equipment, including but not limited to cable boxes and/or set top boxes be deemed a lease of such Equipment.
Customer will acquire no ownership or other interest in the Equipment, network facilities, and software by virtue of payments made pursuant to this Agreement or by the attachment of any portion of the Equipment or network facilities to Customer's residence or premises.
a.
Misuse of Equipment. Suddenlink Equipment is intended to service and reside at the specific service location and is not to be removed from the service location where it was installed or used off premises without Suddenlink authorization.

Customer will not remove any markings or labels from the Equipment.
Customer agrees to safeguard the Equipment from loss or damage of any kind, and (except for any self installation procedures approved by Suddenlink) will not permit anyone other than a Suddenlink authorized representative to perform any work on the Equipment.
Any misuse, alteration, tampering, or removal, or the use of equipment which permits the receipt of Services without authorization or the receipt of Services to an unauthorized number of outlets, or to unauthorized locations constitutes theft of service and is prohibited.
b.
Return of Equipment. If Customer's Service is terminated or cancelled (for whatever reason), unless Suddenlink expresses otherwise in writing, Customer agrees that Customer no longer has the right to keep or use the Equipment and Customer must promptly return the Equipment.
The Equipment must be returned to Suddenlink in the same condition as when received, ordinary wear and tear excepted.
Absent other instructions, if Customer fails to return the Equipment, Customer will pay any expenses Suddenlink incurs in retrieving the Equipment.
Failure of Suddenlink to remove the Equipment does not mean that Suddenlink has abandoned the Equipment.
Suddenlink may impose a charge for unreturned Equipment to be determined in accordance with Suddenlinkâs then current schedule of charges for non-returned Equipment and/or continue to charge Customer a monthly Service fee every month until any remaining Equipment is returned, collected by Suddenlink or fully paid for by Customer.
Any charge for unreturned Equipment shall be due immediately.
c.
Damaged or Lost Equipment. If the Equipment is damaged by Customer, destroyed, lost or stolen while in Customer's possession, Customer is responsible for the cost of repair or replacement of the Equipment.
d.
Operation of Equipment. The Customer agrees to operate any Equipment in accordance with instructions of Suddenlink or Suddenlink's agent.
Failure to do so will relieve the Suddenlink Parties of liability for interruption of Service and may make the Customer responsible for damage to Equipment.
e.
Tests and Inspections. Upon reasonable notification to the Customer, and at a reasonable time, Suddenlink may make such tests and inspections as may be necessary to determine that the Customer is complying with the requirements set forth herein.
f.
Software. Customer agrees to comply with the terms and conditions of any software license agreement applicable to the software provided or installed by Suddenlink ("Software").

If Customer's Service is terminated, Customer will promptly return or destroy all Software provided by Suddenlink and any related written materials.
Suddenlink will have the right to upgrade, modify and enhance the Equipment and Software from time to time.
g.
Repair. Suddenlink will repair and/or replace defective Software or Equipment provided such damage was not caused by misuse, neglect or other fault of Customer.
Suddenlink assumes no responsibility and shall have no responsibility for the operation, maintenance, condition or repair of any Customer-provided equipment and/or software, including, but not limited to, televisions, computer devices, remote controls or other consumer electronics, including any hardware or third party software, that may be connected to the Services ("Customer Equipment"), except that Suddenlink may automatically push required software or firmware updates directly to Customer Equipment when necessary for the provision of Suddenlink Service(s).
Customer is responsible for the repair and maintenance of Customer Equipment.
Customer is also responsible for the repair and maintenance of inside wiring at the service location unless otherwise agreed by Customer and Suddenlink.
Suddenlink is not responsible or liable for any loss or impairment of Suddenlinkâs Service due in whole or in part to a malfunction, defect or otherwise caused by Customer Equipment.

Customer agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Suddenlink Parties from and against any and all claims and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, arising out of or related in any way to the use of the Service and Equipment by Customer or otherwise arising out of the use of Customer's account or any equipment or facilities in connection therewith, or the use of any other products or services provided by Suddenlink to Customer.

Binding Arbitration.
Please read this section carefully.
It affects your rights.


Any and all disputes arising between You and Suddenlink, including its respective parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, predecessors, and successors, shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis in accordance with this arbitration provision.
This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted.
It includes, but is not limited to:
Â· Claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;
Â· Claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement,
Â· Claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either You or Suddenlink may bring claims in small claims court in Your jurisdiction, if that court has jurisdiction over the parties and the action and the claim complies with the prohibitions on class, representative, and private attorney general proceedings and non-individualized relief discussed below.
You may also bring issues to the attention of federal, state, and local executive or administrative agencies.
Resolving Your dispute with Suddenlink through arbitration means You will have a fair hearing before a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court before a judge or jury.
YOU AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND SUDDENLINK EACH WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION.

a.
Opting Out of Arbitration.
 IF YOU HAVE BEEN AN EXISTING CUSTOMER FOR AT LEAST 30 DAYS BEFORE THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS AGREEMENT AND HAVE PREVIOUSLY ENTERED INTO AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WITH SUDDENLINK OR A PREDECESSOR COMPANY, THIS OPT-OUT PROVISION DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU.
IF YOU BECAME A CUSTOMER ON OR WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS AGREEMENT, AND DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION, YOU MUST NOTIFY SUDDENLINK IN WRITING WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS AGREEMENT BY EMAILING US AT NOARBITRATION@ALTICEUSA.COM OR BY MAIL TO ALTICE SHARED SERVICES, 200 JERICHO QUADRANGLE, JERICHO, NY 11753 ATTN.
ARBITRATION.
YOUR WRITTEN NOTIFICATION TO SUDDENLINK MUST INCLUDE YOUR NAME, ADDRESS, AND SUDDENLINK ACCOUNT NUMBER AS WELL AS A CLEAR STATEMENT THAT YOU DO NOT WISH TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH SUDDENLINK THROUGH ARBITRATION.
YOUR DECISION TO OPT OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION WILL HAVE NO ADVERSE EFFECT ON YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH SUDDENLINK OR THE DELIVERY OF SUDDENLINK SERVICES TO YOU.
OPTING OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION HAS NO EFFECT ON ANY OTHER OR FUTURE ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS THAT YOU MAY HAVE WITH SUDDENLINK.

b.
Pre-Arbitration Process.
i.
Notice Of Dispute. Before commencing an action in arbitration, You must first notify us of Your dispute and allow us an opportunity to resolve it without the need for arbitration.
You must write us a letter briefly explaining the dispute and stating the relief that You demand.
Provide as much information as possible, including where applicable dates and specific amounts of money.
Also include the account holder's name, the account number, the service address, and a telephone number at which You may be reached during business hours.
For Your convenience, You may download a Notice of Dispute form from our website at https://www.suddenlink.com/sites/default/files/Notice-Of-Dispute.pdf.
Once you have written the letter or filled out the Notice, send it to us by certified mail at Altice Shared Services, 200 Jericho Quadrangle, Jericho, NY 11753, Attn: Customer Disputes.
ii.
30 Day Wait Period. If Suddenlink has not been able to resolve your dispute to your satisfaction within 30 days from when we received your Notice of Dispute, you may start arbitration proceedings.
c.
Commencing an Arbitration.
To commence an arbitration, you must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), Case Filing Services, 1101 Laurel Oak Road, Suite 100, Voorhees, NJ 08043, with a copy to Suddenlink.
A Demand for Arbitration form can be found on the AAA website at https://www.adr.org/rulesformsfees.
d.
Arbitration Process. The arbitration will be administered by the AAA under the AAAâs Consumer Arbitration Rules, as modified by this arbitration provision.
You may obtain copies of those rules from the AAA at www.adr.org.
If the AAA will not enforce this arbitration provision as written, it cannot serve as the arbitration organization to resolve Your dispute.
If this situation arises, or if the AAA for any reason cannot serve as the arbitration organization, the parties shall agree on a substitute arbitration organization or ad hoc arbitration, which will enforce this arbitration provision as to the dispute.
If the parties are unable to agree, the parties shall mutually petition a court of appropriate jurisdiction to appoint an arbitration organization or ad hoc arbitrator that will administer arbitration under this arbitration provision as written.
If there is a conflict between this arbitration provision and the AAA rules, this arbitration provision shall govern.
A single arbitrator will resolve the dispute between You and Suddenlink.
Participation in arbitration may result in limited discovery.
The arbitrator will honor claims of privilege recognized by law and will take reasonable steps to protect confidential or proprietary information, including Customer personally identifiable information.
All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this arbitration provision, or the interpretation of its prohibitions of class, representative, and private attorney general proceedings and non-individualized relief shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide.
The Arbitrator is limited and bound by terms of this arbitration provision.
Although the arbitrator shall be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same customer to the extent required by applicable law, the arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in other arbitrations involving different customers.
The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party.
An award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.
Unless the parties agree otherwise, any arbitration hearing will take place in the county (or parish) of Your service address.
If the amount in dispute is less than $50,000, Suddenlink agrees that You may choose whether the arbitration is conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, by a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by AAA rules.
If the amount in dispute exceeds $75,000 or the claim seeks any form of injunctive relief, either party may appeal the award to a three-arbitrator panel administered by AAA by a written notice of appeal within thirty (30) days from the date of entry of the written arbitration award.
An award of injunctive relief shall be stayed during any such appeal.
The members of the three-arbitrator panel will be selected according to AAA rules.
The three-arbitrator panel will issue its decision within one hundred and twenty (120) days of the date of the appealing party's notice of appeal.
The decision of the three-arbitrator panel shall be final and binding, subject to any right of judicial review that exists under the FAA.

Arbitration Fees. Except as otherwise provided in this arbitration provision, Suddenlink will pay all arbitration filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration that Suddenlink commences or that You commence seeking damages of $10,000 or less.
If You commence an arbitration seeking greater than $10,000 in damages, arbitration filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees shall be allocated in accordance with the AAA rules.
If You cannot pay Your share of these fees, You may request a fee waiver from the AAA.
In addition, Suddenlink will consider reimbursing Your share of these fees if You indicate You cannot afford them and, if appropriate, will pay directly all such fees upon Your written request prior to the commencement of the arbitration.
You are responsible for all additional costs and expenses that You incur in the arbitration, including, but not limited to, attorneysâ or expert witness fees and expenses, unless the arbitrator determines that applicable law requires Suddenlink to pay those costs and expenses.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the arbitrator concludes that Your claim is frivolous or has been brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the AAA rules shall govern the allocation of arbitration fees, and You agree to reimburse Suddenlink for any amounts Suddenlink may have paid on Your behalf.
f.
Governing Law. Because the Service(s) provided to You involves interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"), not state arbitration law, shall govern the arbitrability of all disputes under this arbitration provision.
Any state statutes pertaining to arbitration shall not be applicable.
g.
Waiver of Class and Representative Actions.
 YOU AGREE TO ARBITRATE YOUR DISPUTE AND TO DO SO ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.
CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, AND PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ARBITRATIONS AND ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. You and Suddenlink agree that each party may bring claims against the other only in Your or its individual capacity and may not participate as a class member or serve as a named plaintiff in any purported class, representative, or private attorney general proceeding.
This arbitration provision does not permit and explicitly prohibits the arbitration of consolidated, class, or representative disputes of any form.
In addition, although the arbitrator may award any relief that a court could award that is individualized to the claimant and would not affect other Suddenlink account holders, neither You nor Suddenlink may seek, nor may the arbitrator award, non-individualized relief that would affect other account holders.
Further, the arbitrator may not consolidate or join more than one person's claims unless all parties affirmatively agree in writing.
If any of the prohibitions in the preceding paragraph is held to be unenforceable as to a particular claim, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and brought in court.
In that instance, or any instance when a claim between You and Suddenlink proceeds to court rather than through arbitration, You and Suddenlink each waive the right to any trial by jury through this Agreement.
h.
Severability and Survival. If any other portion of this arbitration provision is determined to be unenforceable, then the remainder of this arbitration provision shall be given full force and effect.
The terms of the arbitration provision shall survive termination, amendment or expiration of this Agreement.
25.
Governing Law. Subject to Section 24.f above, this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of New York.
26.
Severability. If any term or condition of this Agreement shall be adjudicated or determined as invalid or unenforceable by a court, tribunal or arbitrator with appropriate jurisdiction over the subject matter, the remainder of the Agreement with respect to such claim shall not be affected and shall remain valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.
27.
No Relationship. Nothing in this Agreement will create any joint venture, joint employer, franchisee-franchisor, employer-employee or principal-agent relationship between Suddenlink and any content, backbone, network, circuit and other technology or communications providers, software and other licensors, hardware and equipment suppliers or other third party providers of elements of the High Speed Internet Service, nor impose upon any such companies any obligations for any losses, debts or other obligations incurred by the other.
28.
Survival. All representations, warranties, indemnifications, dispute resolution provisions and limitations of liability contained in this Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement, as well as any other obligations of the parties hereunder which, by their terms, would be expected to survive such termination or which relate to the period prior to termination (including legal conditions, payment, and Suddenlink rights and the rights of others).
29.
Force Majeure. Suddenlink Parties shall not be liable for any delay or failure of performance or Equipment due to causes beyond its control, including but not limited to: acts of God, fire, flood, explosion or other catastrophes.
any law, order, regulation, direction, action or request of the United States government or of any other government including state and local governments having or claiming jurisdiction over Suddenlink, or of any department, agency, commission, bureau, corporation or other instrumentality of any one or more of these federal, state, or local governments or of any military authority.
preemption of existing service in compliance with national emergencies, acts of terrorism, insurrections, riots, wars, unavailability of rights-of-way, material shortages, strikes, lockouts, or work stoppages.
30.
Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including the applicable Additional Terms of Service, Privacy Policy and Acceptable Use Policy ("AUP"), the work/service order presented to You at time of installation ("Service Order") and the Schedule of Fees constitute the entire agreement between Suddenlink and Customer with respect to the Services.
No undertaking, representation or warranty made by an agent or representative of Suddenlink in connection with the sale, installation, maintenance or removal of Suddenlink's Services or Equipment shall be binding on Suddenlink except as expressly included herein.


31.
Amendment.
Notice.
Suddenlink may, in its sole discretion, change, modify, add or remove portions of this Agreement at any time.
Suddenlink may notify Customer of any such changes to this Agreement, or any other required or desired notice hereunder, by posting notice of such changes on Suddenlinkâs website (www.suddenlink.com), or by sending notice via email or postal mail to Customerâs billing address, and/or by contacting the telephone number(s) on Customer's account (including mobile phones) by means such as but not limited to browser bulletins, walled garden (browser interruption), voice, SMS, MMS, and text messages, including by the use of by automatic telephone dialing systems.
Customer agrees that any one of the foregoing will constitute sufficient notice.
Because Suddenlink may from time to time notify Customer about important information regarding the Services, the Privacy Policy and this Agreement by such methods, Customer agrees to regularly check his or her postal mail, e-mail and all postings on the Suddenlink web site (www.suddenlink.com) and Customer bears the risk of failing to do so.
The Customer's continued use of the applicable Service(s) following notice of such change, modification or amendment shall be deemed to be the Customer's acceptance of any such revision.
If Customer does not agree to any revision of this Agreement, Customer must immediately cease use of the all Service(s) and notify Suddenlink that Customer is cancelling this Agreement in accordance with the then-current policy.
Effective: September 19, 2019

17.
Bandwidth, Data Storage and Other Limitations. Customer agrees to comply with Suddenlink's bandwidth, data storage and other limitations of the High Speed Internet Service as established and modified by Suddenlink from time to time.
Suddenlinkâs High Speed Internet Service may include a specific allowance of bandwidth consumption for use during each of your monthly billing cycles at no additional charge.
Consumption of bandwidth in excess of the allowance will be charged an additional amount at the rates stated on your bill.
Unused amounts of the bandwidth allowance expire at the end of your monthly billing cycle and do not carry over to subsequent billing cycles.
It is your responsibility to secure your personal network, and monitor and manage your bandwidth usage, which you may check using the online usage monitor available through your individual account at www.suddenlink.net.
Customer agrees that its bandwidth usage activity will not improperly restrict, inhibit or degrade any other user's use of the High Speed Internet Service, nor represent (in Suddenlink's sole judgment) an unusually large burden on the network.
Customer also agrees that its activity will not restrict, inhibit, disrupt, degrade or impede Suddenlink's ability to deliver and track its High Speed Internet Service, backbone, network nodes and/or other network services.
18.
Sole Risk. Use of the High Speed Internet Services provided by Suddenlink, in addition to third-party products or services provided by or accessed through the High Speed Internet Service or the Internet is at Customer's sole risk and Customer acknowledges that the High Speed Internet Services are provided "AS IS." Accordingly, any information sent through or over the network is sent at Customer's sole risk.
19.
Customer Security. When Customer's computer device is connected to a cable modem, it constitutes a "local" segment of the network.
All of Customer's traffic to or from this local segment will be reflected by the cable modem in an unencrypted format onto the network (unless separate encryption technology is utilized) and will be subject to eavesdropping by third parties.
Further, through the use of file and print sharing features, third parties outside of Customer's premises may be able to access Customer's computer devices across the network and access Customer's software, files and data.
Any Customer who chooses to subscribe to Suddenlink's High Speed Internet Services and enables capabilities such as file sharing, print sharing or other capabilities that allow third party computer access, does so at his/her own sole risk.
Customer is solely responsible for any security devices Customer chooses to connect or install on his/her computer device, in addition to any transmissions to or from Customer or its authorized Users.
Suddenlink Parties shall not be liable or responsible for any unauthorized sharing, access, eavesdropping or any associated risks.
20.
Additional Terms for Suddenlink-provided Wireless Router/Gateway and Wireless Access Point. Suddenlink-provided wireless routers, gateways, managed access points and Altice One devices (with built-in router/gateway) (each, a "Suddenlink Router/Gateway") are available to certain Customers and provide wireless access to the High Speed Internet Service within the Customer's residence ("Home Network").
Suddenlink Router/Gateways come programmed with certain default settings and configurations for the Home Network.
Customers may modify certain of the default settings and configurations on the Suddenlink Router/Gateway although Suddenlink recommends maintaining the default configuration and settings.
Suddenlink does not guarantee the security of the Suddenlink Router/Gateway and Customer's connection to the High Speed Internet Service via the Home Network.
Customer understands and agrees that Customer is solely responsible for the security of his/her Home Network.
Suddenlink Router/Gateways are preconfigured to distribute hotspots for additional Suddenlink wireless networks in addition to the Home Network, including Altice WiFi (each, a âSuddenlink Network Hotspotâ).
Suddenlink Network Hotspots are separate from the Home Network and are accessible by Optimum/Suddenlink internet customers, Altice Mobile customers and certain other authorized users.
The Home Network is encrypted and has separate security settings from the Suddenlink Network Hotspots.
Customer understands that simultaneous connections to both the Home Network and a Suddenlink Network Hotspot may not be available and that after a device is connected to the Home Network, the primary connection for the Customer and any devices using Customer's login credentials, while in the home, will be to the Home Network.
Any use of bandwidth from such wireless access point by third parties, will not be considered to be use by the Customer for any purpose.
The Suddenlink Router/Gateway will collect and maintain certain information regarding access to and use of the Home Network, which information shall include but not be limited to device identifiers, device name, device type, applications and protocols, connections, and traffic flows.
Such information will be used by Suddenlink to provide the High Speed Internet Service and support as well as for Altice's internal business analytics regarding the use of the High Speed Internet Service.
Customer acknowledges and agrees that Suddenlink shall have access to the password associated with the Suddenlink Router/Gateway in order to provide support and diagnostic services.
Suddenlink reserves the right to modify the password for the Suddenlink Router/Gateway in order to safeguard Internet security, the security and privacy of Customer information, where required by law, and/or for other good cause to provide, upgrade and maintain the High Speed Internet Service, and protect the network, other users of the Internet, or our Customers.
Suddenlink shall notify Customer of any such password modifications.
Customer acknowledges that the Suddenlink Router/Gateway is Suddenlink Equipment.

In certain circumstances, a range extender or WiFi extender may be required to be installed and connected to the Suddenlink Router/Gateway in order to connect wirelessly to the High Speed Internet Service throughout Customerâs residence.
A monthly extender equipment fee may apply.
Customer understands and agrees that where the Suddenlink Router/Gateway is a wireless router (as opposed to a gateway or Altice One device), and a range extender is required, the Suddenlink-recommended installation method is through a wired connection directly to the Suddenlink Router/Gateway.
Customer understands and agrees that wireless router range extender installations are not recommended by Suddenlink and such wireless installations may not successfully resolve any or all wireless signal strength and/or wireless signal range-related issues (issue list not exhaustive).
Suddenlink continues to recommend a wired installation to best resolve wireless connectivity issues within your service location.
21.
Enforcement of Policy and AUP. Customer authorizes Suddenlink and its affiliates to cooperate with law enforcement authorities in the investigation or prosecution of criminal violations, and with system administrators at other Internet service providers or other network computing facilities to enforce this Agreement, the AUP and other applicable terms and conditions of the High Speed Internet Service.
Such cooperation may include providing certain Customer identifying information to these parties.
22.
Tracking Devices and Viruses. Customer acknowledges that accessing certain websites through the High Speed Internet Service may result in "cookies" and other tracking devices to be entered in Customer's computer equipment and stored on Customer's browser.
It is Customer's responsibility to disable the entry of "cookies" or other tracking devices following procedures, if available, on Customer's browser.
Customer further acknowledges that using the High Speed Internet Service may result in harmful viruses being downloaded and stored on Customer's computer.
It is Customer's responsibility to protect Customer's computer and data from harmful viruses by installing firewall and other anti-virus software on Customer's computer.


Effective: June 19, 2020
 

ADDITIONAL TERMS OF SERVICE FOR PHONE SERVICE. Customer understands and agrees that use of the Phone Service is subject to the following additional terms of service ("Additional Phone Terms"), which are incorporated into the Agreement:
1.
Limitations of Phone Service.

a.
Power/Network Outages. Customer acknowledges and understands that the Phone Service will not work if any of the necessary Equipment is unplugged or otherwise disconnected from necessary power sources.
Customer further acknowledges and understands that the Phone Service may not function in the event of power failure or if Customer's broadband cable connection is disrupted or not working properly.
Should there be an interruption to the power supply to Customer's home, the Phone Service may be powered by backup battery supply, but the inclusion of a battery backup does not ensure that the Phone Service will work in all circumstances.
In the event that there is a loss of power or other problem that disrupts Suddenlink's network, Phone Service will not be available until the network is restored.
Cordless telephones powered by electricity will not function during a power outage, even if the Phone Service is functioning properly.
CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES AND UNDERSTANDS THAT SUDDENLINK DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT E911 OR 911 DIALING WILL BE AVAILABLE IN THE EVENT OF A POWER FAILURE OR FAILURE OF THE SUDDENLINK NETWORK.
