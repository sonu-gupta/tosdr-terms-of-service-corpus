Back to PolicyWhat we do

Our systems never access your full credit card number, and we encrypt the most sensitive information like tax information using transport layer security (TLS).
We also offer advanced security measures, such as two-factor authentication for signing in, and CAPTCHA verification in cases when a bot is detected, when a user attempts to login from a suspicious IP address or after rapid succession login attempts.
We only serve traffic over HTTPS, which encrypts all data between you and us.

What you should do

As a creator or patron, you can help prevent unauthorized access to your account and information by choosing a strong and unique password which is stored in a password manager.
If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, you can contact us at security@patreon.com.
If you are a security expert or researcher and you believe that you have discovered a security-related issue with Patreon, we appreciate your help in disclosing the issue to us responsibly.
You can sign up for our bug bounty program and submit bug reports to us at security@patreon.com.
Please include a detailed description of the issue and the steps required to reproduce what you have observed when you submit bug reports.
For sensitive issues, you can use our PGP key: https://www.patreon.com/security_pgp_key.asc
