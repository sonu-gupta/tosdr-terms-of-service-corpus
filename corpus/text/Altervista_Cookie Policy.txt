What are Cookies? Cookies are text strings made up of chunks of code sent by a web server (for example, a site) to an Internet browser and installed on it.
In particular, they are small text files that the websites visited by users send to their terminals, where they are stored and then sent back to the same sites on the occasion of a subsequent visit.
Almost all browsers are set up to allow the automatic storage of Cookies on the User terminal.
Cookies are used for various purposes, they have different peculiarities and can be used both by the Processing Owner, by the Processing Co-owners, as identified and defined in the following, as well as by third parties who use or can use on the Website, even in combination between them, the following cookies categories, divided in accordance with the classification proposed in Opinion 04/2012 relative to exemption from consent for the use of cookies published by the Working Party article 29 within the EU (available here): Session or permanent Cookies Cookies can expire at the end of the browser session (the period of time between the user opening of a browser window and its closing) or can be stored for a longer period.
Session Cookies are those who allow websites to link the user actions during a browser session.
Session Cookies expire when the browser session ends.
Permanent Cookies are stored on the user device between browser sessions, for variable periods of time, and facilitate the storage of Users preferences or actions in relation to a website. Technical or profiling Cookies Technical Cookies are those used by the Owner of a website for the sole purpose of transmitting a message via a electronic communication network, or as is strictly necessary for a service provider of the information society to provide the service the subscriber or user has explicitly requested.
For the installation of this Cookies the prior consent of the Users is not required, wherever used directly by the site manager.
Profiling Cookies are designed to create user-related profiles and are used to send advertising messages in line with the preferences expressed by the User while navigating.
Given the considerable invasive nature that this Cookies can have in regard to the Users privacy, the European and Italian Legislation foresees that the User should be adequately informed on their use through a short policy (banner) and a extended one on the site, and that he must express his consent the first time he visits the site.
Such consent can be expressed in general, by interacting with the short policy banner on the landing page of the site, in the manner indicated on that banner, or it can be provided or denied in a selective manner, following the procedures described below.

However, the User has always the option to withdraw all or part of the consent already expressed. First or third party Cookies A Cookie is âof first partyâ (so-called first party cookie) or âof third partyâ (third party cookie) depending on the website or the domain it comes from. First party Cookies are, basically, those set and/or managed by the site owner.
For these Cookies the obligation to provide information, obtain the consent and/or allow the possible blocking of Cookies shall rest with the owner of the site.
Third party Cookies are those set by a domain other than the one being visited by the User.

The pixel tags can be used for different purposes, such as, including but not limited to, analyzing the use of websites and/or mobile apps, controlling and reporting on advertisement, and personalizing ads and contents.

Mobile device identifiers and SDK

A SDK mobile is a pixel tag or web beacon version (aforementioned) only for mobile applications.
A SDK is a chunk of code that developers can include in mobile apps to allow displaying ads, collecting data and implementing related services.
This technology is used to provide you, through mobile apps and browsers, with specific ads and features based on insights associated to your device or tablet.
Some of the services listed below in accordance with the feature offered to the Users, focused on the use of third party SDK, could require no User consent.
Besides, those third parties could â in addition to what is specified in this Cookie Policy and also unbeknownst to the Processing Owner and/or the Co-owners â make further tracking activities on the User.
For detailed information on the matter, please consult the respective privacy policies of the listed services, where you may receive all information regarding data processing and consent withdrawal.
