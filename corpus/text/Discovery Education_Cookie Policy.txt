         Cookie Policy What is a cookie?
A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers downloaded on to your computer when you access certain websites.
Like virtual door keys, cookies unlock a computerâs memory and allow a website to recognize users when they return to a site by opening doors to different content or services.
Like a key, a cookie itself does not contain information, but when it is read by a browser it can help a website improve the service delivered.
Cookie files are automatically lodged into the cookie file â the memory of your browser â and each one typically contains:
â¢	The name of the server the cookie was sent from
â¢	The lifetime of the cookie
â¢	A value â usually a randomly generated unique number
The website server which sent the cookie uses this number to recognize you when you return to a site or browse from page to page.
Only the server that sent a cookie can read, and therefore use, that cookie.
We use cookies to help you navigate our website efficiently and to perform certain functions, including website traffic analysis.
Cookies may also recognize you on your next login and offer you content tailored to your preferences and interests.
Some cookies can collect personal information, including information you disclose like your username, or where cookies track you to deliver more relevant content.
For further details on how we use your personal information, please see our Privacy Policy.

How long do cookies last?
Our website uses several types of cookies including:




Session cookies: Session cookies are created temporarily in your browserâs subfolder while you are visiting a website and are automatically deleted when you leave the website.

Persistent cookies: In contrast to session cookies, persistent cookies are re-activated when you return to the same website and remain in your browserâs subfolder until they expire (usually after 12 months).

Secure cookies: Secure cookies are a type of cookie which is transmitted over encrypted HTTP connection.
When setting the cookie, the Secure attribute instructs the browser that the cookie should only be returned to the application over encrypted connections.

Third party cookies: A third party cookie is one that is placed on your hard drive by a website from a domain other than the one you are visiting (e.g.
when the website features content, such as ads, from a third party domain).
Third party cookies are set so that a site can remember something about you at a later time.
These cookies are set by third parties and we do not control how they are set.



The types of cookies that may be used on our site fall into one of four categories as follows:




âStrictly Necessaryâ cookies: These cookies are essential for the operation of our site and enable you to access certain features.
Without these cookies, we would be unable to provide you with the online services you request.
These cookies do not track where you have been on the internet and do not gather information about you that could be used for marketing purposes.

Functional cookies: Functional cookies are used to recognize you when you return to our site.
