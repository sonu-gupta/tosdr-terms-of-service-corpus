This service is operated out of the Republic of Ireland.
It is your responsibility to ensure that all local laws regarding data collection are followed (e.g.
GDPR). Commercial use
The service is free for personal use, but all commercial users must purchase
a plan after the initial 14-day trial or stop using the service until a plan is
purchased.
A website is considered âcommercialâ if the primary goal is to sell
or advertise paid products or services.
There is a large amount of grey area between strictly âpersonalâ and
âcommercialâ.
for example selling a service as a side-project which provides
just a little bit of pocket money is âcommercialâ, but also âpersonalâ.
As a
rule, things like âpocket-money side-projectsâ are considered personal,
especially if theyâre open source.
Just get in touch if youâre unsure and Iâll tell you if itâs considered
personal.
Also see the note on charities. Payments
