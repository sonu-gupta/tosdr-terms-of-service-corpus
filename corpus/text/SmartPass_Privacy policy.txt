PricingPrivacy is usWe take student privacy very seriously, continuously working with schools to make sure student data is kept safe and secure.
These days, understanding you and your studentsâ privacy rights can be incredibly confusing with legal terms and clauses, so we tried to simplify things.Privacy PolicyYour AgreementThese Terms of Use are a binding contract between you, and SmartPass LLC.
By using our Services and accessing our Site you are acknowledging that you have read and understood these Terms, agree to be legally bound by them and consent to the collection and use of your information as described in our Privacy Policy.Information We CollectWhen a School registers for our Services, they provide information regarding the School, students, and faculty.
This includes data from Googleâs G Suite for Education platform including email addresses, student names, student IDs, organizational units, and groups.

Users of the Site may submit information in accordance with our described Services, including pass creation, administrator room set-up, and other information that is inputted by users.
Student DataWe have access to Student Data only for the purposes of performing Services on the Schoolâs behalf.

Our collection, use, and disclosure of Student Data is governed by our Terms of Use, the provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), the Childrenâs Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), and all applicable laws which relate to the collection of Student Data.
We support access for review of user data by school administrators and by students and teachers themselves.
Students and their parents, in compliance with FERPA, may access their own or his or her child's entire âPersonal Student Informationâ by requesting a school administrator to export their entire data set that carries all information associated with his or her user on SmartPass.
Corrections, such as data manipulation and deletion, may be done by the school administrator.

We ensure that third parties used are consistent with principles listed in this policy, including security and data retention principles.

Student and School personal information will not be retained for longer than necessary to deliver services or for school purposes.
This means that personal information cannot be kept in backups or not be deleted because of data commingling.
Children's PrivacyIn accordance with the Childrenâs Online Privacy and Protection Act (âCOPPAâ), SmartPass does not and will not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13.

Data Protection &amp.
Safeguarding PracticesSmartPass maintains a comprehensive security program that is reasonably designed to protect the security, privacy, confidentiality, and integrity of student personal information against risks â such as unauthorized access or use, or unintended or inappropriate disclosure â through the use of administrative, technological, and physical safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information.

Data in-transit uses standard SSL encryption with a digital certificate.
Data at rest is securely hosted by Google Cloud and is encrypted when it is stored on disk.
User roles are clearly defined to manage the access level, restricted to administrators directly managing a customerâs registration for the use of Services and accessing the Site.

While SmartPass believes and intends that its information security practices reflect good practice, there is no such thing as perfect information security.
As such, users assume the risk of security breaches and all consequences resulting from them.
In furtherance of the foregoing, users must safeguard their credentials.
Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time.
