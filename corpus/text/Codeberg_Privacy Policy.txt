membership data
Law requires us to maintain up-to-date records of our membership data.
This is the data you enter in the join.codeberg.org form if you wish to join the CodebergÂ e.V., name, address, contact address and bank connection.
This record is encrypted with public-key encryption immediately after form submission.
In addition to the data record entered by the user, the join form adds the registration timestamp and client IP, to detect and block abuse.
Records from testing service and pre-announcement subscription list
The pre-announcement subscription list was intended for single use only and has been deleted after announcement of the Codeberg.org launch.
Accounts on pre-announcement testing services have been migrated to Codeberg.org, where possible.
These accounts and the connected data can be deleted using the "Delete Account" button on your personal account page.
All unused data from testing servers has been deleted after launch.
