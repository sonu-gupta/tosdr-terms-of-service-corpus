Also, in any situation, there will be no employer-employee relationship or a partnership between the Provider and the expert.
It is known to the expert that any website he will design and create will be used solely in the Providerâs system and that the expert will have no claims of it.
The expert confirms that with the purpose of building a website, he will not make use of any image and/or photo and/or a graphics file and/or text and/or computer code and/or any other work, that violates the intellectual property rights of any third party.
Using storage images and files made available to him by the Provider is not exclusive and those can be used by other parties as well.
The expert will compensate the Provider for any damages and/or costs incurred by it (including costs and attorney's fees) in connection with any action brought against the Provider related with style, substance, content and intellectual property information that the expert provides.
The Provider may delete an expert website according to the providerâs sole discretion.
Any website that an expert creates for their own personal use cannot be considered an expert website or be categorized and treated as such.
Payments and Fees
For each user who purchases a website, the expert will receive a fixed price commission as it appears in the expert program and can be found in the expert program panel.
The expert user must remain active for at least 1 full month.
The expert shall be entitled to request the money from the moment the expert accumulated more than $300 in his account.
If after the withdrawal, the amount remaining in his expert account is lower than $300, the expert will only be entitled to request the money after the accrued amount in his account exceeds $300.
Requesting money will be done only through the experts program panel by clicking the "Request payment" button.
The money will be paid only via PayPal directly to the experts PayPal account.
Therefore, a Paypal account is required to complete the transfer of funds.
If the expert did not accumulate over $300 into his account and/or the expert is not able to issue an invoice for the Provider, the Provider is entitled not to pay the amount of commissions earned until all of these conditions are met.
Payment to the expert will be carried out only after providing an invoice that will be sent to the Provider, as subject to all national and international laws.
In the following cases, the expert will not be entitled to receive a commission: if the client canceled his order after a few days and/or if the transaction is not approved for billing by the credit card company or any other means of payment, and/or the content of the transaction was incorrect and in fact no order was made for a website.
