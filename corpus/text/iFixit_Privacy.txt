Creditworthiness and Scoring
We perform a credit assessment (automated decision-making) of customers to check creditworthiness and minimize payment defaults.
This is done if purchase order, money order, credit card or direct debit is selected as the payment method.
For this purpose, the customerâs name, address, IP, and partial credit card will be transmitted to: Signifyd, Inc., 2540 N.
First Street, Suite 300, San Jose, CA 95131.
The credit assessment involves the use of probability values (score values), whose calculation includes address data.
The calculation of these scoring values is based on a scientifically recognized mathematical-statistical procedure.
Additional information on how Signifyd handles your personal data can be found in the Signifyd Privacy Policy.
In case of insufficient creditworthiness, purchase order, money order, credit card or direct debit will not be accepted as a payment method.
If you do not agree to the data transfer, please use another method of payment.


Payment Services

When paying via PayPal, credit card via PayPal, direct debit via PayPal or, if offered, purchase on account via PayPal, your name, email address, purchased products, invoice amount, as well as your invoice and delivery address will be transferred to PayPal as part of payment processing.
When using the following payment methods: credit card via PayPal, direct debit via PayPal or, if offered, purchase on account via PayPal, PayPal may conduct a credit check in order to check your creditworthiness and to minimize payment defaults before deciding to approve the payment process.
The credit assessment involves the use of probability values (score values), whose calculation includes address data.

In case of insufficient creditworthiness PayPal can refuse the chosen payment method.
If you do not agree with the data transmission, or if you believe that your creditworthiness is not suitable for the chosen method of payment, please use another method of payment.
Additional information on how PayPal handles your personal information can be found in PayPalâs Privacy Statement.

We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.

California Do Not Track Disclosure
California Business &amp.
Professions Code Section 22575(b) (as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how a website operator responds to âDo Not Trackâ (DNT) browser settings.
DNT is a feature offered by some browsers which, when enabled, sends a signal to websites to request that your browsing is not tracked, such as by third party ad networks, social networks and analytic companies.
We do not currently take actions to respond to DNT signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed.
We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a DNT standard once one is created.
For information about DNT, visit All About DNT.
