Weâre in this thing together.

Thatâs why all Mailchimp Members must follow this Acceptable Use Policy in their use of Mailchimp and any other Mailchimp Add-ons or products we may offer, like Websites, Ads, Mandrill and TinyLetter.
If you violate this policy, we may suspend or terminate your account.
We may also suspend or terminate accounts according to our Standard Terms of Use where we see behavior, content, or other factors that pose a threat to our platform.
If a term is capitalized in this Acceptable Use Policy but isnât defined, it has the meaning given to it in our Standard Terms of Use. Prohibited Content Please donât use Mailchimp to distribute anything offensive, to promote anything illegal, or to harass anyone.
You may not use Mailchimp to create, send, or display:

Campaigns offering to sell illegal goods or services
Emails that violate the CAN-SPAM or other anti-spam laws

 Best Practices As a marketing platform with millions of customers all over the world, we feel itâs our responsibility to be extra vigilant in preventing abuse of our services to protect both our customers and their contacts.
Itâs also in our best interest to keep the platform clean because our reputation and deliverability depend on it.
For that reason, we provide, and may update from time to time, articles outlining best practices in our knowledge base.
For example, we offer guidelines about audience permission and best practices.
You may only use Mailchimp in accordance with these best practices, and we may suspend or terminate your account if you violate them.
