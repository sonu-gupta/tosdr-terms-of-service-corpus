Technical Data also includes "Cookie and Similar Data" described below.
Other Data You Provide: We collect additional data if you choose to engage with the Site or certain sites owned by our Media Partners.
We refer to the information you choose to provide as "Provided Attributes." This includes contact information that you choose to provide to us or our Media Partners (e.g., name, address, email address, telephone number) about yourself or others.

The CCPA defines "Personal Information" as "information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household." This section describes (i) the categories and sources of Personal Information that QuinStreet collects, sells or shares.
(ii) the purpose for collection.
(iii) the types of third parties to whom QuinStreet discloses that information.

QuinStreet receives each of those categories of data only as self-reported data from the consumer.
Sources of Data QuinStreet Collects.

Partners and Third Parties: Consumers who visit websites our Media Partners own may be redirected to our Sites.
In some cases, we may gather data directly from Media Partner websites, or Media Partners or other third parties may post data to our Sites or otherwise transfer data to us.
This may occur via display ads, click listings, inquiry forms or telephonic transfers from Media Partner call centers.
Our Advertising Partners may also provide us with data.

Service Providers: QuinStreet engages service providers to perform a variety of functions (e.g., verifying consumer consent, validating email addresses or phone numbers).

Authorization: We require all parties from whom we receive Personal Information, whether they are Partners, service providers or other third parties, to represent and warrant to us that they have appropriately obtained the Personal Information provided to us and have the authority to share the Personal Information with us.
Purpose for Personal Information Collection.
As described above in "Data Use", QuinStreet primarily uses the Personal Information it collects to connect consumers with Advertising Partners who can provide information about the products and services those consumers are seeking.
Categories of Third Parties with Whom QuinStreet Has Disclosed Personal Information in the Preceding 12 Months.
In addition to sharing data for the primary use described in "Data Sharing", we may share identifiers and internet activity (e.g., name, email address, telephone number, browsing history) with other QuinStreet businesses, service providers, and third party websites.
QuinStreet may also disclose or sell Technical Data, Provided Attributes and Third Party Data to other QuinStreet businesses or with a third party in the event of a sale or transfer of all or part of our business.
Additionally, QuinStreet may disclose or sell Technical Data, Provided Attributes, and Third Party Data (e.g., identifiers, personal identifiers, protected classification information, geolocation data, and inferences) with service providers who assist us in compliance and verification activities (e.g., credit agencies), or provide services such as payment processing, IT, and data analysis information.

Request to Delete
Request to Opt-Out ("Do Not Sell My Personal Info")
You may also submit a Request to Know or Request to Delete by calling our toll-free number (844)-872-7854.
Upon submission of a request, you will be asked to validate your email address and create an account with QuinStreet's privacy vendor.
QuinStreet will respond within 45 days of your submission (or such additional time period as the law allows).
Verifying Your Identity.
Because of the nature of our Sites, QuinStreet is not able to definitely verify your identity prior to responding to your Request to Know or Delete.
Consumers who interact with our Sites are not required to set up an account, to register, or to validate their Personal Information and QuinStreet does not maintain an ongoing relationship with consumers who provide their Personal Information.
Because of these factors, QuinStreet is not able to reasonably verify the identity of any consumer based on the information provided through our Sites and through a submitted request.
Therefore, QuinStreet cannot honor Requests to Know.
Instead, QuinStreet can provide in response to such requests a description of QuinStreet's business practices regarding its handling of Personal Information, including a description of the categories of Personal Information collected, maintained, and sold.
As a California consumer, you have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by QuinStreet for the exercise of your privacy rights under the CCPA.
If you provide authority to another person to submit a request on your behalf, or are a person submitting a request on behalf of another person, please select "on behalf of another person" on the form linked above.
QuinStreet will review the request and may contact you for additional information to validate your identity, to show proper authorization to make a request on behalf of another, and/or to confirm that the authorized agent is properly registered with the Secretary of State to do business in California.Changes to this Privacy NoticeWe may amend this Privacy Notice from time to time.
