The privacy protections and the rights of authorities to access your information in these countries may not be the same as in your home country.

Cookies

A "cookie" is a small text file that an Internet Service can place on your computer's hard drive for record-keeping purposes.
Cookies make using this Service easier by, among other things, saving your passwords and preferences for you, keeping track of your shopping cart when you visit an online store or other similar purposes, and to help identify you whenever you return to our Service, so you do not need to reenter your identification information.
Most Internet browsers are initially set up to accept cookies.
However, you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to alert you when a cookie is being sent (note: you may need to consult your browser's "Help" area for instructions on how to do that).
If you choose to disable your cookies setting or refuse to accept a cookie, some parts of this Service will not function properly or may perform considerably slower.
For example, without cookies, you will not be able to set personalized preferences or you may have difficulty downloading tablatures, watching videos or utilizing the Community Forums.
Some of our web pages may contain electronic images (called "Clear GIFs", "Single-Pixel GIFs", or "Web Beacons") that allow us to count page views or to access cookies.
In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page, including an ad banner, can act as a Clear GIF.
Typically, though, Clear GIFs are very small (1-by-1 pixel size) files.
They are often invisible on a web page, but their presence can be detected within many Internet browsers by setting your browser to view web page "sources".
Clear GIFs are so small in order not to use valuable space on the computer screen that is better used to display helpful content.
We may also include Clear GIFs in our email products in order to determine information about the opening and reading of such emails.
In addition, some advertising networks that serve ads on our web Service may occasionally use Clear GIFs within banner advertisements.
Clear GIFs set by Ultimate Guitar generally are not used to collect, gather, monitor, or share personal information about our users, though they can be used in conjunction with cookies to record particular actions.
We use Clear GIFs primarily to compile aggregated, anonymous statistics about web Service or email product usage.

Some of the advertisements and other services that appear on our web Service(s) are delivered to you by Internet advertising companies.
These companies utilize certain technologies including cookies to deliver advertisements and marketing messages and to collect anonymous information about your visit to our sites and other web sites.
If you would like more information about this practice or to opt out of having this information used by companies that are part of the Network Advertising Initiative to provide targeted ads, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org

Data security: We use appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the Personal Data that we collect and process about you.
The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your Personal Data.
Specific measures we use include to-date secure network architectures that contain firewalls and intrusion detection devices and backups.









Data storage, retention and deletion



We retain Personal Data we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).



When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Data, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your Personal Data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your Personal Data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.





Data storage and transfers of data



All your personal data is stored on our servers in the European Economic Area (EEA).
However, we use third party service providers and business partners who may be operating from outside the EEA, specifically in Russia and the USA, and therefore, your data may be transferred to, or accessed from those countries.



We have put in place appropriate safeguards (which includes the European Commissionâs Standard Contractual Clauses) to ensure that whenever your Personal Data is transferred outside the EEA to countries that are not deemed adequate by the European Commission, your Personal Data receives an adequate level of protection in accordance with the GDPR.





Profiling 



In some instances, we carry out profiling to better understand our users and their potential interests.
However, profiling does not result in automated decisions being taken that legally affect you or similarly significantly affect you.





Your data protection rights



You have the following data protection rights:



If you wish to access, correct, update or request deletion of your Personal Data, you can do so at any time by contacting via privacy@Ultimate-Guitar.com.

If we have collected and process your Personal Data with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time.
Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your Personal Data conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

For more information, please contact your local data protection authority.
