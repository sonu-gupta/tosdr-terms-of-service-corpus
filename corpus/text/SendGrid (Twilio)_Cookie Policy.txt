At this time, there is no general agreement on how companies like Twilio should interpret Do Not Track signals.
Therefore, Twilio does not currently commit to respond to DNT signals, whether that signal is received on a computer or on a mobile device.
Twilio does, however provide meaningful choices to you about the information that is collected through cookies and web beacons through the various opt-out options set forth above.
We will continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.How you contact usYou may contact via email at privacy@twilio.com.
