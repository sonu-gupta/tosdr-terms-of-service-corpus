Content Rating Levels You must ensure that your posts are tagged properly.
Similar Worlds is a very diverse social network, of varying opinions, ideologies and standards.
In order to help protect users and provide the most relevant and appropriate content per each user's preferences, it is important that all users act responsibly, correctly labeling/categorizing their own content, especially when it falls into more adult themed categories.
Users can select through their account settings, various "Content Rating Levels", which algorithmically determines what content may be most suitable and interesting for that user.
Below is a description of each rating level: 

Family Safe - This category is for content that is considered to be completely safe, free of any Adult/Mature, Inappropriate, Abusive, Offensive or Sensitive content.
This is typically content that is safe for viewing in the presence of family, co-workers, public audiences or in any other setting.
Similar Worlds makes an extra effort to thoroughly screen (algorithmically) content entering this category, so that it is likely safe for even the youngest users of our website.

Non-Adult - This category is for content that is considered to be safe, free of Adult/Mature, Inappropriate, Abusive, Offensive or Sensitive content.
This is typically content that is safe for viewing in most settings.
Content falling in this category must not be obviously Mature or Inappropriate in nature.
As Similar Worlds allows for freedom of speech, opinion and expression, we attempt to strike some balance as to not over-aggressively filter everything appearing in this category.
