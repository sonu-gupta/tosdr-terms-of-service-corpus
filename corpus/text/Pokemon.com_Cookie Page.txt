Blocking or Removing Cookies

As previously stated in the Privacy Notice, you can choose
to block and/or remove all cookies and local storage.
You can do this through your browser (such as Mozilla
Firefox or Internet Explorer) settings.
If you remove or block cookies and
local storage, you won't have access to many features that make your experience
smoother and more personalized, and some of our Services may not function
properly.
Since certain opt-out preferences are also stored in a cookie in your
browser (such as opt-outs from advertising companies), please note that if you
remove all cookies, you will need to renew your opt-out choices.
Some internet
browsers may transmit âDo Not Trackâ signals.
Because uniform standards for âDo
Not Trackâ signals have not been adopted, our websites may not be aware of or
process âDo Not Trackâ signals.
