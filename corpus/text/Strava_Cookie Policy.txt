Learn how to manage your Google ads personalization setting, your Google Analytics setting, and your Branch cookies setting. Do Not Track (DNT)
We may not recognize Do-Not-Track (âDNTâ) signals from your web browsers or device.
This is because there is not yet a universally accepted standard on how to interpret and respond to DNT signals, which often conflict with other settings.
If and when a standard is established, we will re-examine how we can appropriately respond to DNT signals. Changes to this policy
This policy may change from time to time, so it should be reviewed frequently for the most up to date cookie information.
We will notify you of any changes by updates to this page.
