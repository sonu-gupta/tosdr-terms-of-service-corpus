When we use your Personal Data, we take care to ensure that it is used in an appropriate way.

We will use your Personal Data and share that Personal Data where:
â&nbsp.
Its use is necessary for a contract you have entered into or because you have asked for something to be done so you can enter into a contract with us.
â&nbsp.
Its use is necessary because of a legal obligation that applies to us (except an obligation imposed by a contract).
This may include responding to subpoenas, warrants or other requests served on New Relic anywhere in the world or to protect or defend the rights or property of New Relic or its users.
â&nbsp.
You have consented to its use in a specific way.
For example where you have consented to receiving marketing materials.
You may withdraw your consent at any time as further described in Section 8 (Your Choices and Data Protection Rights).
â&nbsp.
Its use is in accordance with our legitimate interests e.g.
to manage our business, subject to those interests not overriding your fundamental rights and freedoms.

We may also need to transfer some or all of your Personal Data to a third party or their advisors in connection with a sale, merger or reorganisation of our business.

This may also include situations where litigation is pending or ongoing and such information is subject to a legal hold.
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Data, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your Personal Data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your Personal Data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
If you have questions about or need further information concerning the retention of your Personal Data, please see Section 15 (How to Contact Us).

Your Personal Data may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are located.

Specifically, if you are located in the EEA or the United Kingdom, you should note that your Personal Data will be accessed by New Relic staff or suppliers, transferred, and/or stored outside the EEA and the United Kingdom, including to the U.S.
and other countries which have different data protection laws.
However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your Personal Data will remain protected in accordance with this General Privacy Notice and as required by applicable data protection law, including (i) requiring that our third-party service providers and partners employ an adequate method of transfer, such as the European Commissionâs Standard Contractual Clauses, for transfers of Personal Data (further details of which can be provided upon request), and (ii) participating and complying with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks.

9.
Do Not Track

Currently, various browsers - including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - offer a âdo not trackâ or âDNTâ option that relies on technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to the websites visited by the user about the userâs browsers DNT preference setting.&nbsp.
New Relic does not currently commit to responding to browserâs DNT preference across its Sites and Services, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent.&nbsp.
New Relic takes privacy and choices regarding privacy seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor the development around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard for DNT.

10.

We may partner with third party ad networks to either display advertising on our Sites or to manage our advertising on other sites.&nbsp.
