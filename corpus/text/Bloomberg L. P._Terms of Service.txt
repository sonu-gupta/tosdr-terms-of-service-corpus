No Sponsored Content will imply endorsement of any product or service by Bloomberg, nor will it feature any recognizable Bloomberg names or logos.

Where Sponsor Content allows user participation, the moderation and functionality of this element will be determined and implemented solely by Bloomberg and will be subject to the general Terms of Service for the applicable Bloomberg medium.
In the case of Sponsored events, sponsors will be clearly identified to all on-site participants and in marketing materials tied to the relevant conference or event in language that indicates their role as underwriters.
Bloomberg does not guarantee speaking roles or other on-stage participation for paying sponsors and maintains editorial control and veto power.

Governing Law.
The TOS shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States and the State of New York, without giving effect to conflicts-of-law principles thereof.
With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in New York County in the State of New York with respect to any legal proceedings that may arise in connection with the Service or from a dispute as to the interpretation or breach of the TOS.
14.
Arbitration.
By using this site in any way, you unconditionally consent and agree that: (1) any claim, dispute, or controversy (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) you may have against Bloomberg and/or its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates and each of their respective current or former members, officers, directors and employees (all such individuals and entities collectively referred to herein as the âBloomberg Entitiesâ) arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with the website or the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by JAMS and conducted before a sole arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS.
(2) this arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (âFAAâ), 9 U.S.C.
Â§Â§ 1-16.
(3) the arbitration shall be held in New York City, New York.
(4) the arbitratorâs decision shall be controlled by the terms and conditions of these TOS and any of the other agreements referenced herein that the applicable user may have entered into in connection with the website.
(5) the arbitrator shall apply New York law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law.
(6) there shall be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class or representative basis, arbitration can decide only your and/or the applicable Bloomberg Entityâs individual claims, and the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated.
(7) the arbitrator shall not have the power to award punitive damages against you or any Bloomberg Entity.
(8) in the event that the administrative fees and deposits that must be paid to initiate arbitration against any Bloomberg Entity exceed $125 USD, and you are unable (or not required under the rules of JAMS) to pay any fees and deposits that exceed this amount, Bloomberg agrees to pay them and/or forward them on your behalf, subject to ultimate allocation by the arbitrator.
In addition, if you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Bloomberg will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.
and (9) with the exception of subpart (6) above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the rules of JAMS, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein.
If, however, subpart (6) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor Bloomberg shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute.
