RESPECTING COPYRIGHT


Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement.
Mushroom respects the intellectual property rights of others and follows the requirements set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (âDMCAâ) and other applicable laws.
It is Mushroomâs policy to terminate membership privileges of any Registered User who repeatedly infringes copyright upon prompt notification to Mushroom by the copyright owner or the copyright ownerâs legal agent.
Without limiting the foregoing, if you believe that your work has been copied and posted on the Services in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide our Copyright Agent with the following information: (a) an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest.
(b) a description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed.
(c) a description of the location on the Services of the material that you claim is infringing, such as a URL.
(d) your address, telephone number and email address.
(e) a written statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law.
and (f) a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright ownerâs behalf.

Mushroomâs Actions Upon Receipt of Notifications of Claimed Infringement.
If Mushroom receives a complete notification from a rights holder or someone acting on their behalf claiming that content on a channel infringes the rights holderâs copyright, Mushroom generally notifies the applicable Registered User.
At the same time, we will generally remove or disable access to recorded or other content containing the claimed infringing material.
We may suspend an Account if the claimed infringement is continuing at the time we receive the rights holderâs notification.
Mushroomâs Actions Upon Receipt of Counter-Notifications.
If Mushroom receives a complete counter-notification from the applicable Registered User, Mushroom generally notifies the claimant who submitted the original notification.
At the same time, we may restore recorded content containing the claimed infringing material.
Disputed notifications generally will not qualify for a strike under our Repeat Infringer Policy (discussed in more detail below), unless and until the dispute has been resolved by the applicable Registered User and the rights holder.
Please note that Mushroom may not be able to reinstate certain material or access to it due to factors such as the passage of time or the format in which the material was broadcast or stored.
Mushroomâs Actions Upon Receipt of Retractions.
If Mushroom receives a retraction from a rights holder or someone acting on their behalf, we may restore recorded content containing the claimed infringing material and the disputed notification will not qualify for a strike under our Repeat Infringer Policy (as provided by Section 11.7 (Repeat Infringer Policy)).
Please note that Mushroom may not be able to reinstate certain material or access to it due to factors such as the passage of time or the format in which the material was broadcast or stored.
How to Submit a Counter-Notification.
If you are a Registered User and a notification of claimed infringement has been submitted against Your Content, we encourage you to review the details we have provided and consider your options.
If you believe that the notification, and any action Mushroom has taken as a result, was sent due to a mistake (for example, you believe your actions qualify as fair use under U.S.
law) or misidentification, then you may send us a counter-notification.
To send a counter-notification, please provide all of the following information: (a) URL(s) where the material that was the subject of the notification of claimed infringement appeared before it was identified, removed, or access to it was disabled.
(b) name of the claimant who submitted the notification.
(c) your Mushroom username, if any.
(d) your full legal name.
(e) your email address.
(f) your full postal address.
(g) your phone number.
and (h) a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and that you have a good faith belief that the material identified in the notification was identified, removed, and/or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification.
You also have the option to explain why you believe there was a mistake or misidentification.
Counter-notifications that include all of the information above should be sent to Mushroomâs Copyright Agent as identified in Section 11.1 (Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement).
Keep in mind that failure to provide this information could result in Mushroom being unable to take action in response to your counter-notification.
How to Submit a Retraction.
If you are a Registered User who has received a notification of claimed infringement, you can seek a retraction by reaching out to the rights holder or agent who sent the notification directly.
Mushroom will honor retractions of notifications from the party that originally submitted the notifications.
If you are a rights holder or agent who submitted a notification that you wish to retract, please contact Mushroomâs Copyright Agent as identified in Section 11.1 (Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement) with the following information: (a) the date of your original notification.
(b) the copyrighted work(s) allegedly infringed.
(c) the URL(s) where the allegedly infringing material could be found.
and (d) a signature.
Repeat Infringer Policy.
Mushroom will terminate a Registered Userâs access to the Services if such Registered User is determined by Mushroom to be a ârepeat infringerâ of copyrighted works on the Services.
Under our policy, a Registered User will be considered a repeat infringer if they accrue three copyright strikes.
Furthermore, we may in appropriate cases and at our sole discretion, limit access to the Services and/or terminate the Accounts of any Registered User who blatantly and egregiously infringes the intellectual property rights of others, whether or not repeat infringement has occurred.
Registered Users generally earn a strike when Mushroom receives a complete notification of infringement and does not receive a complete counter-notification regarding the alleged infringement or a retraction of the notification.
Strikes are not permanent, but rather are associated with an Account for enough time for Mushroom to determine whether the Registered User is engaging in repeated infringement such that termination is necessary under this policy.
When determining whether Registered Users are repeat infringers under this policy, we take into consideration complete notifications of claimed infringement from rights holders, complete counter-notifications from Registered Users, retractions from rights holders, and other relevant factors and circumstances.
Mushroom may also ask the complainant and/or Registered User for more information where we think itâs necessary to fairly apply our Repeat Infringer Policy.
If a relevant court rules that a Registered User is an âinfringerâ or ârepeat infringerâ on Mushroom, we will take that ruling as conclusive under our Repeat Infringer Policy.
To provide judicial determinations showing that a Registered User is an infringer, or a repeat infringer, on the Services, please forward it to our Mushroomâs Copyright Agent as identified in Section 11.1 (Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement) with âcourt ruling regarding infringer/repeat infringerâ in the subject line.
Mushroom personnel will review the submission and may contact the complainant and/or Registered User to verify the court ruling and understand its scope.


MONITORING AND ENFORCEMENT.
Mushroom reserves the right to: (a) remove or refuse to post any of Your Content for any or no reason in our sole discretion.
(b) take any action with respect to any of your Content that we deem necessary or appropriate in our sole discretion, including if we believe that such Content violates the Agreement, infringes any intellectual property right or other right of any person or entity, threatens the personal safety of users of the Services or the public, or could create liability for Mushroom.

Mushroom makes no representations that the Services are appropriate or available for use in other locations.
Those who access or use the Services from other countries do so at their own volition and are responsible for compliance with local law.
DISPUTE RESOLUTION.
Please read the following arbitration agreement in this Section (âArbitration Agreementâ) carefully.
It requires U.S.
users to arbitrate disputes with Mushroom and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.


Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. You agree that any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Services, to any products sold or distributed through the Services, or to any aspect of your relationship with Mushroom, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (a) you may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if your claims qualify, and (b) you or Mushroom may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all disputes or claims and requests for relief that arose or were asserted before the effective date of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement.

Arbitration Rules and Forum.
The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.
To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your dispute or claim or request for relief to our registered agent, Corporation Service Company, 251 Little Falls Drive, Wilmington, DE 19808.
The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider.
Disputes involving claims, counterclaims, or request for relief under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneysâ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMSâs most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/.
all other disputes shall be subject to JAMSâs most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/.
JAMSâs rules are also available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267.
If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.
If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMSâs filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, Mushroom will pay them for you.
In addition, Mushroom will reimburse all such JAMSâs filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for disputes, claims, or requests for relief totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.


You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location.
Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.


Authority of Arbitrator.
The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement and (b) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any assertion that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.
The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Mushroom.
The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.
The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim.
The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forumâs rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement).
The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.
The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.
The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.

Waiver of Jury Trial.
YOU AND MUSHROOM HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.
You and Mushroom are instead electing that all disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 15.1 (Applicability of Arbitration Agreement) above.
An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would.
However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.

Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief.
ALL DISPUTES, CLAIMS, AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.
If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this Sectionâs limitations as to a given dispute, claim, or request for relief, then such aspect must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the State or Federal Courts located in the State of California.
All other disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be arbitrated.

30-Day Right to Opt Out.
You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: playon@mushroom.gg, within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement.
Your notice must include your name and address, your Mushroom username (if any), the email address you used to set up your Mushroom Account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement.
If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you.
Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.
Severability.
Except as provided in Section 15.5 (Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief), if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
Survival of Agreement.
This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Mushroom.
Modification. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Mushroom makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, you may reject that change within thirty (30) days of such change becoming effective by writing Mushroom at the address provided in Section 16.8 (Notice).
