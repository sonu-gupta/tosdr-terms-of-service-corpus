International Transfer of Personal Information
We do not share your personal information with third parties, unless it is necessary to carry out your request, for our professional or legitimate business needs, or as required or permitted by law.
Where we do transfer your personal information to third parties or service providers, appropriate arrangements will be made in order to ensure correct and secure data processing in compliance with applicable data protection law.
We store personal information about Website Visitors and Subscribers within the EEA, the United States and in other countries and territories.
To facilitate our global operations, we may transfer and access such personal information from around the world, including from other countries in which the Zendesk Group has operations.
Therefore, your personal information may be processed outside of the EEA and in countries which are not subject to an adequacy decision by the European Commission and which may not provide for the same level of data protection as the EEA.
In this event, we will ensure that the recipient of your personal information offers an adequate level of protection, for instance by entering into standard contractual clauses for the transfer of data as approved by the European Commission (Art.
46 GDPR), or we will ask you for your prior consent to such international data transfers.
We have implemented safeguards to ensure an adequate level of data protection where your personal information is transferred to countries outside the EEA, such as:
(a) the recipient country has an adequacy decision from the European Commission;
(b) the European Commissionâs Standard Contractual Clauses for the transfer of personal information;
(c) Zendesk has Binding Corporate Rules in place which guarantee an adequate level of data protection wherever your data is physically kept.
or
(d) Zendesk participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework.
however, we do not rely on the Privacy Shield as a lawful mechanism to transfer personal information from the EU, United Kingdom, or Switzerland.
Where the recipient is located in the United States, it may be a certified participant of the EU-US Privacy Shield or Swiss Privacy Shield Framework.
You can obtain more details of the protection given to your personal information when it is transferred outside Europe (including a sample copy of the model contractual clauses) by contacting us using the details set out at Clause 15 below.

Binding Corporate Rules:

We have adopted Binding Corporate Rules that have been authorised by the EU data protection authorities, and which enable us to transfer personal information lawfully from EEA member states to other Zendesk Group companies around the world.
More information on (including a copy of) our Binding Corporate Rules is available here, and evidence of our Binding Corporate Rules approval is available on the European Commissionâs website here.

Privacy Shield Frameworks:

Zendesk abides by and has certified adherence to the principles of the EU-U.S.
and Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield frameworks as set forth by the U.S.
Department of Commerce.
however, we do not rely on the Privacy Shield as a lawful mechanism to transfer personal information from the EU, United Kingdom, or Switzerland.
For more information on the Privacy Shield frameworks, and to view the scope of Zendeskâs certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/list.
Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website, you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.
For residual Privacy Shield disputes that cannot be resolved by the methods above, you may be able to invoke a binding arbitration process under certain conditions.
To find out more about the Privacy Shieldâs binding arbitration scheme, please see: https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction  The Federal Trade Commission has investigation and enforcement authority over our compliance with the Privacy Shield. If we have received your personal information under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfer it to a third party service provider for processing, we will remain responsible if they process your personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or aggregate it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

We offer those who provide personal contact information a means to choose how we use the information provided.
You may manage your receipt of marketing and non-transactional communications by clicking on the âunsubscribeâ link located on the bottom of our marketing emails or you may send a request to privacy@zendesk.com.
