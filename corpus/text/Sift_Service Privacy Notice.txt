PART I.
GENERAL INFORMATION AND KEY TERMSWho we areSift is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) company based in San Francisco, California.
We help our Customers detect and address fraud and other illegal or malicious behavior on their Customer Sites and in other contexts using our proprietary real-time machine learning technology.
In doing so, we need to collect and process information about our Customersâ End Users.
Our cloud-based machine learning platform uses this information to predict and prevent fraudulent and other illegal or malicious activity in real time.
We have four core product offerings for our Customers: Payment Protection (reduces fraudulent payments), Account Defense (reduces fake account creation and prevents bad actors from accessing trust-worthy accounts), Content Integrity (protects Customer Sites from malicious content) and Dispute Management (helps Customers manage chargebacks).
You can find out more about these offerings here.
find out more about Sift's core product offeringsHow the Sift Services workCustomers provide us with data and information about End Users and their interactions with the applicable Customer Sites through our Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), and other integrations.
We may receive this information directly from our Customers or from their service providers and partners.
In addition, we collect data directly from End Users through standard tracking technologies (like our JavaScript code or SDK), which our Customers can embed on their Customer Sites.
We refer to all of this data as "Customer Data" - as described in Part II below.
We then process the Customer Data through our cloud-based machine learning platform to return a relative fraud score which is a numerical indicator of the likelihood of fraud or illegal activity for a particular event on the Customer Site (e.g., a purchase transaction, the posting of content, creation of a profile) and supporting information about potential illegal acts or security threats.
For our Dispute Management product, we process the Customer Data to create a win rate which (similar to the fraud score) is a numerical indicator of the likelihood of winning a particular chargeback.
In addition to the score and win rate, we provide our Customers with supporting evidence, aggregated reporting, insights and records.
The data we provide to Customers, including supporting fraud scores and supporting evidence and insights, are used by Customers to assist them in identifying and preventing fraudulent activity on their Customer Sites and managing chargeback disputes.
Any of this information may also be used by certain Customers to support their legal or regulatory reporting obligations and risk management procedures (e.g., in relation to their anti-money laundering or know your customer (KYC) requirements).
It is up to our Customers to decide what action to take or not to take using the information we provide.
For example, depending on the rules set by our Customers, transactions with certain scores may be presented with further authentication challenges, flagged for the Customerâs review, or blocked.
Typically, however, the transaction or activity will proceed with no issues.
More information about what to do if a transaction is blocked is provided in the âAutomated Decision-Makingâ section below.
Customers also provide us with ongoing feedback on the accuracy of the scores by reviewing the activity on their Customer Sites, which in turn improves our proprietary modeling and algorithms.
We also may provide security notification and verification features (including two-factor authentication) as part of our Account Defense product.
To provide these features, we use certain Customer Data provided by our Customers to notify End Users of login attempts and account activity, and to send verification codes to End Users (such as via text messages or emails), which they can enter on the Customer Sites to confirm their identity when they login to use a Customer Site or create a new account.PART II.
WHAT WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT(A) END USERSInformation We Collect About End Users
Information provided by our Customers: Our Customers decide the type of Customer Data they wish to send to Sift for analysis within the Sift Services.
Our solutions and support teams work closely with Customers to assess the utility of the specific Customer Data they send to us.
For example, Sift guides Customers as to whether a particular data type (e.g., billing method) may be relevant in assessing the particular activity (e.g., likelihood of stolen payment credentials).
While it will depend on the specific product offering and Customer relationship, the Customer Data that Customers typically send to us through our integrations include:


Contact details (such as your email address, postal address, phone number, and user login);

Information about your device (such as your IP address, session ID, mobile/desktop device properties, and metadata);

Account activity information (such as account login attempts and failures, when you've reset your password, and other information about your behavior on a Customer Site);

Transaction information (such as information about items you've purchased, currency codes, billing method, invoice details, and partial credit card information);

Customer Site communication information (such as feedback, messaging, Customer support communications, reviews or images you may have provided on or within Customer Sites);

KYC-related information (such as information about whether a KYC check was initiated by the Customer and the result of the check).
and

Dispute-related information (such as dispute case number, dispute ID, dispute stage and status, merchant ID, and whether a chargeback was issued or an order was cancelled)


Information we automatically collect when you visit Customer Sites: As further explained below, we use certain standard tracking technologies to automatically collect certain information about your device when you interact with and use Customer Sites.
Some of this information (including, for example, your IP address and certain unique identifiers), may identify a particular computer or device and may be "personal data" in some jurisdictions, including the EU.
Depending on whether you visit a Customer Site via an app or a webpage, the information we collect includes:


Browser and device information, such as the device type and model, manufacturer, operating system type and version (e.g.
iOS or Android), web browser type and version (e.g., Chrome or Safari), user-agent, carrier name/code and country code, time zone, the network connection type, IP address, hardware-based identifiers (e.g.
MAC address), host name, device identifiers (such as iOS Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA), Android/Google Advertising ID (AAID or GAID)), canvas fingerprint, characteristics related to emulation or rooted (such as if your device is "jailbroken"), and app name and version.
We also collect character set, host name, language, page title and URL, referrer URL, number of fonts, fonts hash, number of plugins, plugins hash, screen height and width, color depth, platform, cookie footprint, maximum touch points, JavaEnabled, session storage, local storage, whether the resolution has been tampered, language or OS, whether ad blocking is enabled, whether do not track is enabled, flash socket IP and flash identifier.
The SDK will also collect phone-related metadata (battery level, device properties, carrier name).
and

Information about an End Userâs behavior on Customer's Sites, such as information about the activities on those Customer Sites, session ID, session start/stop time, timezone offset, and location information which may be general location information inferred from your IP address or, in some circumstances, more precise geolocation information based on latitude and longitude coordinates.
You may be able to control the collection of location information through particular Customer Sites by changing the preferences on your mobile device.



Information we collect from third party sources: 
 We may receive some of the information above from our Customer's service providers or partners (such as, their payment processors, customer support providers or KYC providers), as directed by our Customer.
We also combine or enhance the information we collect about you with limited information we receive from third parties.
For example, we receive information such as whether an IP address is commercial or private, whether a phone number is a landline, whether an email domain is free, or the issuing bank associated with a transaction.
We also work with a small number of providers that match information from social media with End Users' email addresses provided to us, or provide us with a human-readable, mapped location based on a physical address or latitude/longitude.How We Use End Users Information and the Legal Bases
Sift only uses Customer Data to provide, maintain, improve, and develop the Sift Services and to comply with its legal obligations.

For example, we process Customer Data through our cloud-based machine learning platform to return fraud scores to our Customers for particular events or activities on the Customer Site and/or to return win rates for particular chargeback disputes.
We may also use Customer Data to optimize and improve the Sift Services (for example, to train our proprietary models and algorithms so that we can more effectively detect fraudulent behaviors) and to validate the identity of End Users seeking to exercise their privacy rights.
In addition, when our Customers use the Sift security notification and two-factor authentication features, we process Customer Data, such as their End Users' telephone number or email address, to notify End Users of login attempts and account activity and send a verification code to End Users via text message or email.
This allows our Customers who use these features to identify suspicious logins and validate their End Users' identities when they log into the Customer Sites or create a new account.
We base our processing of your personal information on: (i) our legitimate interests in operating the Sift Services, including to better detecting and preventing fraud, security threats, and other illegal or malicious behavior on Customer Sites.
and (ii) our (and our Customers) legitimate interest in combating fraud, maintaining safe online experiences for our Customers and their End Users and reducing the costs associated with invalid or fraudulent chargebacks.
In some cases, we may also need to process Customer Data to comply with our legal obligations.
If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, including any legitimate interests relied upon, please contact us as provided under the How to contact us section at the end of this Notice.How We Use Tracking Technologies to Collect Information about End UsersWe use standard tracking technologies to automatically collect certain information (as described in the Information We Collect About End Users section) from your device and/or browser when you visit or interact with Customer Sites.
We use the following tracking technologies: 


JS Snippet: A JavaScript code (âJS Snippetâ), also called a tag or pixel, is a tiny snippet of code inserted into the content of the Customer Site.
You can disable JavaScript by changing the settings on your browser.
Information about the procedure to follow to change the settings can usually be found on your internet browser providerâs website via your help screen.
Because Sift does not control these settings, we encourage you to check the information provided about them on a regular basis to ensure you are aware of any relevant changes.

Mobile "SDKs" or "Software Development Kits": These are blocks of code that are embedded into a Customer Site that allow Sift to collect certain information as further described above.
You can control the use of certain information Sift collects through the SDK by following the instructions applicable to your mobile device operating system, which are usually available in your mobile device settings.
This typically means that you will no longer be associated with your old device ID or the information collected about you when the old device ID was assigned to you.
However, if the Customer Site you visit requires you to login (e.g., via an email address), Sift will associate a new device ID with your login and your new and old device IDs will be associated.
You may also be able to control the collection of location information by particular Customer Sites by changing the preferences on your mobile device.
Because Sift does not control these settings, we encourage you to check the information provided about them on a regular basis to ensure you are aware of any relevant changes.

Canvas Fingerprinting: We use canvas fingerprinting, which is a tracking technique that allows us to render graphic images from built-in features of HTML5 Canvas in your browser.
The canvas image is often rendered differently on different devices because of a number of factors (such as, your web browser version, operating system and its settings, and installed graphics hardware), and this will allow us to distinguish you from other End Users.
If you would like to disable canvas fingerprinting, you may choose to disable JavaScript or download a browser extension that blocks canvas fingerprinting techniques.
however doing so may impair the functionality of the Sift Services.
Because Sift does not control these settings or extensions, we encourage you to check the information provided about them on a regular basis to ensure you are aware of any relevant changes.

When an End User views or uses a Customer Site, Sift servers are notified, and we are able to collect information from the browser or application as described above.Automated Decision-MakingAutomated decision-making means that a decision is made automatically on the basis of a computer determination (using software algorithms), without human review or intervention.
The services we provide to our Customers may result in an automated decision being made by our Customers about an action you have made on a Customer Site.
For example, in certain limited circumstances, the Customer may use the analysis we provide them to automatically pause the completion of an activity or transaction based on rules the Customer has set.
Similarly, the Customer may use the analysis we provide them to challenge a particular chargeback.
In such instances, you may be required to take further steps (e.g., two factor authentication), you may potentially be unable to complete a transaction, or your chargeback may be disputed by the Customer.
Please contact the relevant Customer directly for more information.(B) AUTHORIZED USERS Information We Collect About Authorized Users
