CALIFORNIA AND CCPA PRIVACY RIGHTS AND DISCLOSURES

This California Privacy Rights and Disclosure section addresses the legal obligations and rights laid out in the California Consumer Privacy Act (the âCCPAâ) in order to comply with the requirements set forth in the CCPA for those businesses doing business in California and/or offer their services to California residents, including with respect to information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with California consumers or households (collectively, "California Information").

California Information We Collected and/or Shared

This section of the Policy provides the information California residents need to exercise their rights over their California Information.
Here is information about the California Information we may have collected from and shared about consumers over the twelve months prior to the Effective Date of this Policy.
In the year before the date this Policy was updated, on or through some of our Services we may have collected and/or shared (for operational purposes with providers who provide services for or to us in connection with developing, improving, providing and/or offering our Services) the following categories of California Information:

Address and other identifiers -- such as email address, device type, web-browser, operating system or other similar identifiers;
Unique and online identifiers -- such as IP address, device IDs derived from device type, or other similar identifiers;
Characteristics of protected classifications -- such as race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation;
Certain commercial information -- such as products or services purchased, obtained, or considered through our Services, or other purchasing or consuming histories or tendencies;
Internet, gaming or other electronic network activity information -- such as browsing history, search history and information regarding an individual's interaction with an internet website, application, or advertisement;
Location information â geo-location information about where you are accessing our Services (e.g.
if you access our Services on your mobile or tablet device we may collect information about your device's precise location to the extent feasible);
Online viewing activities and habits (e.g., videos viewed, pages viewed).
and
Inferences drawn from California Information, such as individual profiles, preferences, characteristics and behaviors.

We may have collected these categories of California Information for the following purposes:

Performing services on behalf of our various businesses, such as user retention, providing content recommendations and/or processing information;
Fraud and crime prevention;
Debugging errors in systems;
Marketing and advertising;
Internal research, analytics and development -- e.g., user-preference analytics.
and
Developing, maintaining, provisioning or upgrading networks, products, services, or devices.

We may have obtained California Information from a variety of sources, including:

Directly from you, including technical and usage information when you use our Services;
Linked sites, such as social media sites, and other third-party platforms;

Information suppliers;
Distributors, service providers and other vendors;
Marketing mailing lists;
Other users submitting California Information about you, such as to invite you to participate in an offering, make recommendations, or share content.
and
Publicly available sources.

While the CCPA defines 'sale' very broadly, there is no industry-wide consensus whether enabling third parties to collect personal data via cookies and other similar tracking technologies for the purposes of delivering interest or location-based advertising and/or similar targeting activities constitutes a âsaleâ under the CCPA.
However, a âsaleâ under the CCPA may be considered to include the sharing of California Information in exchange for anything of value.
According to this broad definition, in the year before the date this Policy was updated, on or through some of our Services we may be deemed to have sold the following categories of California Information:

Address and other identifiers -- such as email address, device type, web-browser, operating system or other similar identifiers;
Unique and online identifiers -- such as IP address, device IDs derived from device type, or other similar identifiers;
Characteristics of protected classifications -- such as race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation;
Certain commercial information -- such as products or services purchased, obtained, or considered through our Services, or other purchasing or consuming histories or tendencies.

Internet, gaming or other electronic network activity information -- such as browsing history, search history and information regarding an individual's interaction with an internet website, application, or advertisement;
Location information â geo-location information about where you are accessing our Services (e.g.
if you access our Services on your mobile or tablet device we may collect information about your device's precise location to the extent feasible);
Online viewing activities and habits (e.g., videos viewed, pages viewed).
and
Inferences drawn from California Information, such as individual profiles, preferences, characteristics and behaviors.
