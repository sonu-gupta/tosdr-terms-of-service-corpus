Social Media presence: 

Are data processed on social media platforms and who is responsible in such cases?


General: Bitpanda maintains social media presence on different platforms (see below) in order to communicate with its active Clients, prospective Clients and interested social media users about Bitpandaâs services, products and other news.
When you access such social media platforms, the general terms and conditions, as well as the privacy policies of these operators, additionally apply.
We would like to point out that user data may also be processed outside the European Union.
This can result in risks for users due to different legal frameworks (e.g.
it could make it more difficult to enforce data subject rights).

As part of the technical process of different social media platforms (e.g.
Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc.), these platforms will know when you click on content or a website you are visiting, if you are logged in to your social media account at the same time.
Such information is collected by social media platforms and assigned to your social media accounts, regardless of whether you click on content of this platform or not.
By logging out from your accounts, you can prevent such companies from associating the information collected with your accounts.
The activities of those companies are not controlled by Bitpanda and therefore, we do not assume any liability for damages that you may incur through the use of your data by these companies.
For more information regarding tracking, cookies and similar technologies as well as opt-out possibilities, have a look at our Cookie Policy.


Controller: Bitpanda can only process personal data of social media users if they communicate directly with Bitpanda via such platforms (e.g.
number of visitors, posted articles, likes, direct messages, Client inquiries, comments, etc.).
In such cases, Bitpanda is also responsible for the processing of personal data gathered thereby.
In addition to the data processing by us, other providers, in particular operators of social networks and platforms, also process personal user data.
We have no influence on this data processing and are not responsible for it - the data processing takes place exclusively in the area of responsibility of the other providers.

For a detailed explanation of the respective processing and the possibilities of objection (opt-out) by providers of social media networks, we refer to the respective privacy policies of the providers (see below).
In the case of requests for information and the assertion of data subject rights regarding data processing by other providers, we point out that these can be asserted with the below-mentioned providers.
Only the providers have access to the data of the users and can directly take appropriate measures and give information.
