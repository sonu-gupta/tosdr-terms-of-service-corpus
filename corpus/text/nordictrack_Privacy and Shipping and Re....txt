 5.
DISCLOSURE AND SHARING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA We may disclose or share your personal data to entities other than ICON for a business purpose.
We may and during the last 12 months have disclosed or shared the categories of personal data listed above.

We may disclose for a business purpose and have in the last 12 months disclosed the above-listed categories of personal data to the following categories of third parties or service providers:  Internal third parties Other companies in the ICON group act as joint controllers or processors, provide IT and system administration services, and undertake leadership reporting.
 External third parties âService providers acting as processors based inside or outside the EU who provide IT and system administration services.
We require all service providers to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law.
We do not allow our service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes, and we only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.

âProfessional advisers acting as processors or joint controllers, including lawyers, bankers, auditors, and insurers based inside or outside the EU who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance, and accounting services.

âRegulators and other authorities acting as processors or joint controllers based inside or outside the EU who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances.

âAny other entity when required by law.

âThird parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets.
Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them.
If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy notice.

California residents please click here for additional information about how we may sell your personal information and how you may opt out of the sale of your personal information.
 6.
INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS We share your personal data within the ICON group.
We store the information we collectâincluding your personal dataâin the United States, so if you are accessing an ICON site from another country, your information is being transferred to and from the United States and specifically outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) or Brazil.

We ensure that your personal data is protected by requiring all of ICON's companies to follow the same rules when processing your personal data.
These rules are called binding corporate rules.
For further details, see European Commission: binding corporate rules.
Moreover, sensitive and private data exchanged between an ICON site and you happens over an SSL secured communication channel and is encrypted and protected with digital signatures.

We want you to feel confident using the ICON sites.
However, no system can be completely secure.
Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure.
Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email.
Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.

Many of our external third parties are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA), so their processing of your personal data may involve a transfer of data outside of the EEA.

Whenever we transfer your personal data, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring that at least one of the following safeguards is implemented: 
âWhen we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission, which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.
For further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries.

âWhen we use providers based in the U.S., we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the European Union and the U.S.
For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield.

Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism we use when transferring your personal data in or out of the EEA.
 7.
DATA RETENTION We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data, whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

Details of retention periods for different aspects of your personal data are set out in the table in paragraph four above.

By law, we must keep basic information about our customers (including contact, identity, financial, and transaction data) for seven years after they cease being customers, for tax purposes.

In some circumstances, you may ask us to delete your data.
If we delete your account, your user profile will no longer be visible, and all of the information associated with your account will be permanently deleted.
In some circumstances, we may anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposesâin which case, we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
You may still receive promotional e-mails from us regarding new ICON products or services.
 8.

This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

 Advertising disclaimer ICON shares no affiliation with any political party or its views.
ICON ads visible on political websites are there as a result of remarketingânot a partnership, affiliation, or endorsement.

Remarketing allows ICON to display ads to people who have visited ICON sites.
When people leave an ICON site without buying anything, remarketing helps us reconnect with them by showing relevant ads across their different devices and websites.
The ads simply follow the user to the sites they visit.
 9.
GLOSSARY LAWFUL BASIS Legitimate interest means that we conduct and manage our business to enable us to give you the best services and products and the most secure experience.
We consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests.
We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required to or permitted by law).
You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us.

 YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS Individuals that are not residents of California have the rights described below.
If you are a resident of California, information about your consumer rights can be found here.

Request access to your personal data, commonly known as a data subject access request.
This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we lawfully process it.

Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you.
This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, although we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide us.

Request erasure of your personal data.
This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.
You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data when you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), when we may have processed your information unlawfully, or when we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law.
Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons, which we will inform you, if applicable, at the time of your request.

Object to processing of your personal data when we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party), and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground, as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.
You also have the right to object when we process your personal data for direct marketing purposes.
In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling, legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.

Request restriction of processing of your personal data.
This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy.
(b) when our use of the data is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase it.
(c) when you need us to hold the data, even if we no longer require it, if you need it to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.
or (d) you have objected to our use of your data, but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.

Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party.
We will provide to you, or a third party that you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.
Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use, or when we used the information to perform a contract with you.

Withdraw consent at any time when we are relying on consent to process your personal data.
However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.
If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you.
We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

After three attempts have been made the shipping company will make arrangements to return your machine to our warehouse.
Return shipping and a 10% restocking fee may apply.


We cannot ship to P.O.
or APO Boxes with internet orders.

One is that many of our items are large and ship in boxes bigger than the post office will accept for postal boxes.
Our on-line order system canât determine what size of box your order will ship in.
Another reason is that we ship items, like treadmill lubricant, that cannot be shipped through the US postal service.
