a.
Cookies and How We Use Them


Epsilon and its business partners use certain industry-standard technologies, including cookies and similarly functional technologies, which we describe below.
(We use these technologies on our Website, for instance, and our partners may use these technologies in their own marketing services.)
We may work with third parties to provide or enhance our Services (e.g.
for purposes of tailoring ads, or placing browser cookies), or to offer marketers ways to access or use our Information, often in de-identified form.
These partners may set and access their own cookies, pixel tags and similar technologies on your device, which may have cookies with varying expiration periods.
Those partners may, likewise, collect various types of information about your browser, device, or browsing activities through use of these cookies.
Cookies, in turn, are small data files that contain a string of characters, such as a unique browser identifier.
Cookies are stored on your computer or other device and act as tags that identify your device.
Our (or other companiesâ) servers send your device a cookie when you visit a website.
A pixel tag (also commonly known as a web beacon or clear GIF) is an invisible 1 x 1 pixel that is placed on certain web pages.
When you access web pages (such as the website of a marketer), pixel tags may permit our partners (or sometimes, us) to read the cookies that a respective company or server has deployed.
Pixel tags are used in combination with cookies to track the activity on a site by a particular device.
We or our service providers, and other online marketing platforms that we or they work with, may use cookies to, among other things, ârememberâ you, determine visitor patterns and trends, collect information about your activities on our clientsâ sites, or interact with the advertising you see.
Cookies are used in this way to provide relevant content to you and replace non-relevant communications with ads that better match your interests.


b.
Disabling Cookies


Most web browsers are set up to accept cookies.
You may be able to set your browser to warn you before accepting certain cookies or to refuse certain cookies.
However, if you disable the use of cookies in your web browser, some features of our Website and other services may be difficult to use or become inoperable.


c.
Types of Cookies used by Epsilon on our Sites



Performance cookies: These cookies collect information about how visitors use our Sites for web analytics purposes.
For instance, we may use cookies to analyze which pages visitors go to most often and if they receive any error messages.
These cookies are used to help improve our Sites and your experience on our Sites.
By using our Sites, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your browser.

Functionality cookies: These cookies allow our Sites to remember choices you make (such as remembering your username and password, language preference or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personalized features.
These cookies may also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other personalizations.
They may also be used to provide services you have requested, such as keeping you logged in to your account as you browse the internet.
These cookies do not collect information about your browsing activity on other websites.
By using our Sites, or by signing up for an account with us, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your browser.

Interest-Based Advertising cookies: For information on cookies that are used for interest-based advertising, please see below under Interest-Based Advertising.

We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an aggregated basis.
We may partner with third parties who provide certain features on our Sites, or to display advertising, based upon your web browsing activity using local storage objects (LSOs) such as Flash to collect and store information.
Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing Flash LSOs.

5.
Data Collected Through Our Websites

We will sometimes give you the opportunity to provide information directly to us through our corporate Websites â such as if you are a business interested in a relationship with us or an individual completing one of our surveys.
Additionally, as you interact with our Websites, we may use (or engage with business partners and vendors that use) automatic data collection technologies such as cookies (described above) to collect certain information about your equipment, browsing actions, and patterns.
As you browse the internet or go across mobile apps, you may see advertisements on the web pages or the apps you visit.
Some of these ads may be more relevant to you based on a variety of factors, such as the previous websites or apps you have visited, your perceived interests and your demographic information.
This practice is called Interest-Based Advertising or Cross-App Advertising.
To learn more about this practice, please visit the Network Advertising Initiativeâs website.
We may work with our advertising partners to enable the delivery of relevant messages to the right consumers while protecting consumer privacy and offering choices about participating in such activities.
Our third-party partners may use technologies, such as cookies, to gather information about your activities on this Site and other sites in order to provide you with relevant advertising.
Relevant advertising does not result in more ads, but rather the relevancy of the ads you see.
To learn about how to opt out of receiving relevant advertisements on the web or mobile apps, visit the Relevant Advertising Opt-Out section below.

7.
Information We Receive from Clients, and our âAgencyâ Services

Epsilon, as a service provider, provides its Clients with agency services as well as an email platform and loyalty service platform.
For instance, Clients leverage Epsilon to schedule and manage their email campaigns and manage their loyalty and incentive programs.
When our Clients provide us with information relating to their customer, prospective customers or other individuals, we handle it on behalf of our Clients as a service provider.
Our Clients determine how to engage with their customers and thus act as the business that determines the purposes and means of handling customer or âCRMâ data.
Under these circumstances, Consumers are ultimately subject to the privacy policy(ies) of the Clients controlling their data, and they should read those policy(ies) carefully.
We are not responsible for the privacy practices of our Clients.
Accordingly, this Privacy Policy and the rights acknowledged herein do not apply to data that Epsilon handles on behalf of its Clients.
As a service provider, Epsilon may only process its Clientsâ data upon instruction from the respective Client.
(Accordingly, Epsilon shares or discloses its Clientsâ data to service providers, Clients, and Clientsâ service providers per our Clientâs instructions.) Epsilon may also share Client data (1) to comply with applicable laws and regulations or to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information received by us, whether or not a response is required by applicable law.
(2) to enforce our terms of use and other agreements or to protect our rights.
and (3) to protect the safety of members of the public and users of the service.
While Epsilon strongly encourages its Clients to adopt responsible approaches to its marketing practices, Epsilon is not responsible for the information practices of such Clients.

Relevant Advertising Opt-Out


You can opt out of relevant advertising through the following means:


U.S.
Visitors:


You may opt out of our marketing databases.
If we market to you by email, in our corporate capacity â such as if you are a Customer or prospective customer and we send information about our Services â you may âunsubscribeâ from our marketing emails through a link placed in your emails.
You also may request that Epsilon not sell your information by filling out and submitting the online request form.
Once weâve received your form, we will confirm your identity with a series of test questions.
Then we will either email your consumer access report to the email address you provide on the form, delete your information, or opt you out of sales.
The information you provide will be used solely to process your request and shared only with a service provider that assists Epsilon with identity verification.
You can also opt out of online targeted ads (sometimes referred to as âinterest-basedâ or âpersonalizedâ advertising), by visiting the opt-out portals operated the industry groups the National Advertising Initiative (NAI) or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), and you can learn more about how those opt-outs work on those linked web pages.
Please note that these online opt-outs are cookie-based (unlike Epsilonâs direct opt-out).
Thus, if you browse the web from multiple browsers or devices, you will need to opt out from each browser and/or device, and for the same reason, if you change browsers or clear your browser cookie cache, you will need to perform this opt-out function again.
Opting-out in this way will not prevent you from seeing all types of online ads.
it generally will prevent targeted ads customized to what advertisers think may be most likely to be relevant and of interest to you.

You are also permitted to designate an authorized agent to submit certain requests on your behalf.
In order for an authorized agent to be verified, you must provide the authorized agent with signed, written permission to make such requests (which we may ask to review) or a power of attorney.
