Upon the conclusion of each calendar month that the Campaign is running on the Taboola Network (each a âCampaign Monthâ), the Analytics Dashboard will provide Advertiser with details regarding the amount of Clicks on Advertiserâs Content and the amount of the Prepayment, if applicable, spent by Advertiser (based on the cost per click set by Advertiser in the Analytics Dashboard during the Campaign Month).

1000 Impressions * 8MB * $.00005).
Data Fees: Advertiser may be given the ability to target its Advertiser Content to certain audiences on the Taboola Network by using Taboola-provided audience data segments based on inferred Visitor interests or demographics (âData Segmentsâ).

For purposes of clarity, the Campaign Budget shall be in the currency designated by Taboola, unless otherwise agreed to in a separate writing between the parties.
Reporting: Taboolaâs measurements regarding Clicks are the definitive measurements under this Agreement and will be used to calculate the amounts due to Taboola hereunder.

(ii) maintenance and update procedures or repairs.
or (iii) causes beyond the control of Taboola or its affiliates, including, without limitation, interruption or failure of telecommunication or digital transmission links, the unavailability, operation, or inaccessibility of websites or interfaces, network congestion, or other failures, and that Taboola shall not be liable for any unavailability caused by any of the foregoing.
In addition, Advertiser acknowledges and agrees that Taboola and its affiliates have no responsibility or liability with respect to the operation of the Taboola Properties.

Termination/Suspension: Advertiser or Taboola may terminate this Agreement (a) for convenience on seven (7) daysâ written notice at any time or (b) immediately in the event that the other party fails to remedy a material breach of this Agreement within forty-eight (48) hours of its receipt of written notice thereof.
In addition, Taboola may terminate this Agreement immediately, without notice, in the event that Advertiser fails to comply with Taboolaâs Advertising Policies.
Advertiser may terminate any Campaign on twenty-four (24) hoursâ written notice.
Taboola may terminate or suspend Advertiserâs access to or use of the Service or terminate this Agreement at any time if: (a) in the sole discretion of Taboola, such action is necessary to prevent errors or harm to any system or network, or to limit Taboolaâs or its affiliatesâ liability.
or (b) Advertiser attempts to access or use the Service in an unauthorized manner, including, without limitation, any attempt to gain access to the accounts of other Taboola customers or use the Service in a way that infringes upon Taboolaâs, its affiliatesâ or a third partyâs Intellectual Property Rights, or the use of automated systems or software to extract data from the Sites for commercial purposes (also known as screen scraping), unless where Advertiser has a written agreement with Taboola particularly to this extent.
In the event that Advertiser has made a Campaign Prepayment and Taboola discovers that Advertiser has violated Taboolaâs Advertising Policies by using non-standard URL redirects to surreptitiously redirect Visitors to landing page content that (1) does not match the landing page content originally submitted for distribution through the Wizard or the Analytics Dashboard or (2) is not otherwise in compliance with Taboolaâs Advertising Policies as a result of âcloakingâ or other techniques that hide the true destination landing page that a Visitor is directed to from Advertiserâs URLs, Taboola shall be entitled to either charge the remaining amount of Advertiserâs spend to the credit card maintained on file or retain any campaign Prepayments made, in which case, Taboola will not refund any such funds.
For clarity, Taboola shall be entitled to retain the Prepayment and will not refund any such funds in the event of such breach by Advertiser.

Choice of Law: This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York excluding its conflicts of law principles.
Any legal action or proceeding arising under this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts located in the County of New York, New York and the parties hereby irrevocably consent to personal jurisdiction and venue therein and waive any right to object to venue in, or to seek a transfer from, such court.
The parties hereto each expressly agree not to commence or maintain any action in any other court or forum in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of Advertiserâs default of its obligations in Paragraph 4 above, Taboola shall have the right, if it so chooses, to commence an action against Advertiser for such default in the appropriate court in the venue and jurisdiction in which Advertiser resides or maintains assets.

Successors and Assigns: This Agreement, including the rights and obligations of each party hereunder, shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, acquirers, successors, and assigns.
This Agreement and any rights or obligations hereunder shall not be assigned or delegated without the prior written consent of the other party and shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, except that: (a) either party may assign this Agreement to an acquirer of all or substantially all of such partyâs assets, whether by merger, operation of law or otherwise, without the other partyâs prior written consent, so long as the acquirer agrees in writing to pay in full any outstanding balance Advertiser owes to Taboola under this Agreement .
and (b) Taboola may assign this Agreement, without Advertiserâs consent, to its parent company or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries.

Force Majeure: Neither Advertiser nor Taboola will be liable for delay or default in the performance of its respective obligations under this Agreement if such delay or default is caused by conditions beyond its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, fire, flood, accident, earthquakes, telecommunications line failures, electrical outages, network failures, acts of God, or labor disputes.
If Advertiserâs ability to transfer funds to third parties has been materially adversely affected by an event beyond Advertiserâs reasonable control, including, but not limited to, failure of banking clearing systems or a state of emergency, then Advertiser will make every reasonable effort to make payments on a timely basis to Taboola, but any delays caused by such condition will be excused for the duration of such condition.
Subject to the foregoing, such excuse for delay will not in any way relieve Advertiser from any of its obligations as to the amount of money that would have been due and paid without such condition.

Miscellaneous: This Agreement constitutes the complete and exclusive understanding and agreement between the parties regarding the subject matter herein and supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous agreements or understandings, written or oral, relating to its subject matter.
The failure of either party to enforce strict performance by the other party of any provision in this Agreement or to exercise any right under this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of that partyâs right to do so at any later point.
Taboola may modify these at any time.
No click-through, online, purchase order or other terms, entered into before or after the execution of this Agreement, will inform the interpretation of this Agreement, or be or remain binding on the parties, and they shall be void. Preprinted terms in Advertiser purchase orders or other customer-generated ordering documents, or terms referenced or linked within them, will have no effect on this Agreement and are hereby rejected, regardless of whether they are signed by Taboola and/or purport to take precedence over this Agreement. In the event that any provision in this Agreement, including its Terms, as applied to any party or to any circumstance, shall be adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction to be void, unenforceable or inoperative as a matter of law, then the same shall in no way affect any other provision in this Insertion Order, including its Terms, the application of such provision in any other circumstance or with respect to any other party, or the validity or enforceability of this Agreement as a whole.
Paragraphs 6, 8-10, 3-4, and 16 of these Terms shall survive termination of this Agreement.
Electronic signatures on this Agreement shall be as effective and enforceable as originals.
This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.
