 Terms of Use  We could give you a ten page long Terms of Use.
Like you'd read that.

 As far as we're concerned, it's simple: 

Use Freegle to pass on unwanted items direct to others.
No sales, no swaps, just simple gifts.
Everything must be free and legal.
Be nice to other freeglers, and they'll be nice to you.
 We don't see or check items offered - see our disclaimer.

 Freegle communities may have additional rules.
If you have questions, scroll down and use the Contact community volunteers button.

 Please keep yourself safe and watch out for scams.

Objectionable content or behaviour will not be tolerated.
 If you see anything inappropriate, suspicious or just dodgy then please report it .

You must be aged 13 or over, as there is user-generated content.
 We wonât sell your email address or personal data to anyone else - see privacy page.

 We will email you posts, replies, events, newsletters, etc.
- control these in Settings.

 We will make your post public to publicise Freegle, but not your email address - see privacy page.
