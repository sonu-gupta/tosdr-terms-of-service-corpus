We monitor all traffic to and from our web servers for indications of spamming.
Customers suspected to be using our products and services for the purpose of sending spam are fully investigated.
If we determine there is a problem with spam, we will take the appropriate action to resolve the situation.
We define spam as the sending of Unsolicited Commercial Email (UCE), Unsolicited Bulk Email (UBE) or Unsolicited Facsimiles (Fax), which is email or facsimile sent to recipients as an advertisement or otherwise, without first obtaining prior confirmed consent to receive these communications.
This can include, but is not limited to, the following:

Windows system messages 

Pop-up messages (aka "adware" or "spyware" messages)

We will not allow our servers and services to be used for the purposes described above.

Commercial advertising and/or bulk emails or faxes may only be sent to recipients who have "opted-in" to receive messages.
They must include a legitimate return address and reply-to address, the sender's physical address, and an opt-out method in the footer of the email or fax.
Upon request by us, conclusive proof of opt-in may be required for an email address or fax number.
If we determine the services in question are being used in association with spam, we will re-direct, suspend, or cancel any website hosting, domain registration, email boxes or other applicable services until customer responds.
The registrant or customer will be required to respond by email to us stating that they will cease to send spam and/or have spam sent on their behalf.
In the event we determine the abuse has not stopped after services have been restored the first time, we may terminate the hosting and email boxes associated with the domain name in question.
We encourage all customers and recipients of email generated from our products and services to report suspected spam.
Suspected abuse can be reported by email abuse@isodme.com. 9.
LIQUIDATED DAMAGES You agree that we may immediately terminate any Account which we believe, in our sole and absolute discretion, is transmitting or is otherwise connected with any spam or other unsolicited bulk emails 10.
OUR USE OF USER CONTENT The provisions of this Section apply specifically to ISODMEâs use of User Content posted to ISODMEâs corporate websites (i.e., those sites which ISODME directly controls or maintains).
The applicable provisions are not intended to and do not have the effect of transferring any ownership or licensed rights (including intellectual property rights) you may have in content posted to your hosted websites.
Generally:

You shall be solely responsible for any and all of your User Content or User Content that is submitted through your Account, and the consequences of, and requirements for, distributing it.

With Respect to User Submissions.
You acknowledge and agree that:

 Your User Submissions are entirely voluntary.


Your User Submissions do not establish a confidential relationship or obligate ISODME to treat your User Submissions as confidential or secret.


ISODME has no obligation, either express or implied, to develop or use your User Submissions, and no compensation is due to you or to anyone else for any intentional or unintentional use of your User Submissions.


ISODME may be working on the same or similar content, it may already know of such content from other sources, it may simply wish to develop this (or similar) content on its own, or it may have taken / will take some other action.


ISODME shall own exclusive rights (including all intellectual property and other proprietary rights) to any User Submissions posted to this Site, and shall be entitled to the unrestricted use and dissemination of any User Submissions posted to this Site for any purpose, commercial or otherwise, without acknowledgment or compensation to you or to anyone else.


With Respect to User Content (Other Than User Submissions).


 If you have a website or other content hosted by ISODME, you shall retain all of your ownership or licensed rights in User Content. By posting or publishing User Content to this Site or through the Services, you authorize ISODME to use the intellectual property and other proprietary rights in and to your User Content to enable inclusion and use of the User Content in the manner contemplated by this Site and this Agreement.
You hereby grant ISODME a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable (through multiple tiers), and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, combine with other works, display, and perform your User Content in connection with this Site, the Services and ISODMEâs (and ISODMEâs affiliatesâ) business(es), including without limitation for promoting and redistributing all or part of this Site in any media formats and through any media channels without restrictions of any kind and without payment or other consideration of any kind, or permission or notification, to you or any third party.
You also hereby grant each User of this Site a non-exclusive license to access your User Content (with the exception of User Content that you designate âprivateâ or âpassword protectedâ) through this Site, and to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, combine with other works, display, and perform your User Content as permitted through the functionality of this Site and under this Agreement.

You understand and agree, however, that ISODME may retain (but not distribute, display, or perform) server copies of your User Content that have been removed or deleted.
The above licenses granted by you in your User Content are perpetual and irrevocable.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, ISODME shall not use any User Content that has been designated âprivateâ or âpassword protectedâ by you for the purpose of promoting this Site or ISODMEâs (or ISODMEâs affiliatesâ) business(es).

 11.
BACKUPS While we do have weekly backups, these are solely for acts of god.
For instance, if our server goes down, we still have a backup from the week before.
Being a user, you cannot access these.
We do not warrant that we conduct these, as sometimes there are higher priorities and if our servers are in operational state, the backups will not be taken.
Thus, it is extremely important that you conduct weekly backups of your own data as well for your own use.
 12.
MONITORING OF CONTENT AND ACCOUNT TERMINATION ISODME generally does not pre-screen User Content (whether posted to a website hosted by ISODME or posted to this Site).
However, ISODME reserves the right (but undertakes no duty) to do so and decide whether any item of User Content is appropriate and/or complies with this Agreement.
ISODME may remove any item of User Content (whether posted to a website hosted by ISODME or posted to this Site) and/or terminate a Userâs access to this Site or the Services found at this Site for posting or publishing any material in violation of this Agreement, or for otherwise violating this Agreement (as determined by ISODME in its sole and absolute discretion), at any time and without prior notice.
ISODME may also terminate a Userâs access to this Site or the Services found at this Site if ISODME has reason to believe the User is a repeat offender.
If ISODME terminates your access to this Site or the Services found at this Site, ISODME may, in its sole and absolute discretion, remove and destroy any data and files stored by you on its servers. 13.
