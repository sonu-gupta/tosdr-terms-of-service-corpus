Players who depart on GOOD TERMS (utilizing the conduits which the group administration has set up for retirement) may make a REQUEST that their CHARACTERS not be utilized full-time in future gameplay.
The request will be considered and granted if said characters are A) not pivotal to current gameplay, and B) not regularly utilized by other players already.
Any ships or other creations of a player will NOT be considered eligible for retirement after the player who has created them has left.

From time-to-time, the group may choose to utilize playerâs works in distributed volumes of media (including, but not limited to, bound books) for the purposes of raising funds which will be only dedicated towards the support of the groupâs website or related activities.
It is understood that none of the funds collected will be used for the commercial gain of any entity involved with the group.
In a case in which the group chooses to distribute such a volume, a notice will be sent via email to the creators of media being used.
It is the responsibility of anyone who has created media within the group to utilize the groupâs database to keep their contact information available and up-to-date.
If, at which time, the group attempts contact but is not able to make contact after due consideration and effort, the group is assumed to have completed their due diligence.
