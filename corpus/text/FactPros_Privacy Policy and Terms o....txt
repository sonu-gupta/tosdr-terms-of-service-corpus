Website Visitors
Like most website operators, FactPros collects non-personally-identifying information of the
sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference,
referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.
FactPros' purpose in
collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand
how FactPros' visitors use its website.
From time to
time, FactPros may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
FactPros also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol

FactPros only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that
commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site
where the comment was left.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to FactPros' websites choose to interact

personally-identifying information to anyone.
