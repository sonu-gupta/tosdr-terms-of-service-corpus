Speaking of Photos: No Pictures, Videos, or Images of Anyone Other Than You and Your Friends and Family.

All of your Service activities must be venue appropriate, as determined by us.

Your UGC should not reveal another personâs address, phone number, email address, social security number, credit card number, medical information, financial information, or any other information that may be used to track, contact, or impersonate that individual, unless, and in the form and by the method, specifically requested by White Mountain Online Solutions B.V.

Donât Damage the Service or Anyoneâs Computers or Other Devices.
Your UGC must not submit viruses, Trojan horses, spyware, or any other technologies or malicious code that could impact the operation of the Service or any computer or other Device.
