 We at Guilded know you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously.
Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy.
By using or accessing the Services in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways.&nbsp.
&nbsp.
Remember that your use of Guildedâs Services is at all times subject to the Terms of Use, which incorporates this Privacy Policy.
Any terms we use in this Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the Terms of Use.
 &nbsp.
What does this Privacy Policy cover? This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information (âPersonal Informationâ) that we gather when you are accessing or using our Services, but not to the practices of companies we donât own or control, or people that we donât manage.
We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained in more detail below, and we use this Personal Information internally in connection with our Services, including to personalize, provide, and improve our services, to allow you to set up a user account and profile, to contact you and allow other users to contact you, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to analyze how you use the Services.
In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties, but only as described below.
&nbsp.
As noted in the Terms of Use, we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13.
If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us.
If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.
If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at support@guilded.gg.
&nbsp.
Will Guilded ever change this Privacy Policy? Weâre constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but we will alert you to changes by placing a notice on the Services, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means.
Please note that if youâve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you havenât provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them.
If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes.
&nbsp.
What information does Guilded collect?
Information You Provide to Us: We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us.
For example, through the registration process and/or through your account settings, we may collect Personal Information such as your email address and third-party account credentials (for example, your log-in credentials for Facebook, Discord or other third party sites).
If you provide your third-party account credentials to us or otherwise sign in to the Services through or from a third party site or service, you understand some content and/or information in those accounts (âThird Party Account Informationâ) may be transmitted into your account with us if you authorize such transmissions, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy.
for example, your Discord account username and profile picture may be transferred over to Guilded.
Certain information may be required to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.
&nbsp.
We may communicate with you if youâve provided us the means to do so.
For example, if youâve given us your email address, we may send you promotional email offers on behalf of other businesses, or email you about your use of the Services.
If you do not want to receive communications from us, please indicate your preference by contacting us at support@guilded.gg.
&nbsp.
Information Collected Automatically Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, geolocation data, device identification, âcookieâ information, the type of browser and/or device youâre using to access our Services, and the page or feature you requested.
âCookiesâ are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people.
You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your deviceâs acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features.
If you click on a link to a third party website or service, such third party may also transmit cookies to you.
Again, this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we arenât responsible for their privacy policies and practices.
Please be aware that cookies placed by third parties may continue to track your activities online even after you have left our Services, and those third parties may not honor âDo Not Trackâ requests you have set using your browser or device.
&nbsp.
We may use this data to customize content for you that we think you might like, based on your usage patterns.
We may also use it to improve the Services - for example, this data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services interesting to as many users as possible.
&nbsp.
Information Collected From Other Websites and Do Not Track Policy Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services.
Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy.
Your browser may offer you a âDo Not Trackâ option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites.
When you turn on the Do Not Track function in your browser, we stop collecting the information from your browser that allows us to tailor advertisements and other content specifically to you that is based on your visits to our advertising partnersâ websites.
Specifically, we stop collecting information from the unique browser cookie that links your browser to visits to third party sites.
Do Not Track signals are set on a browser-by-browser basis, so you must set them on every browser you use if you do not wish to be tracked.
Remember that this is just our Do Not Track policy, and we canât and donât make any promises about how third parties react when you set this signal on your browser.
&nbsp.
Will Guilded share any of the Personal Information it receives? We do not rent or sell your Personal Information in personally identifiable form to anyone, except as expressly provided below.
We may share your Personal Information with third parties as described below: &nbsp.
Information Thatâs Been De-Identified: We may de-identify your Personal Information so that you are not identified as an individual, and provide that information to our partners.
We may also provide aggregate usage information to our partners (or allow partners to collect that information from you), who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience.
However, we never disclose aggregate usage or de-identified information to a partner (or allow a partner to collect such information) in a manner that would identify you as an individual.

One such service may include the ability for you to automatically transmit Third Party Account Information to your Services profile or to automatically transmit information in your Services profile to your third party account.
