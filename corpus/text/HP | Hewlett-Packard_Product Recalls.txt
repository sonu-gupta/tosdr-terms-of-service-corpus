HP urges customers to recheck all potentially affected products

These batteries have the potential to overheat, posing a fire and burn hazard to customers.

It is essential that customers recheck their batteries, even if they did so previously and were informed they were not affected. Note: customers who have already received a replacement battery through the recall program are NOT affected by this expansion.
Customers should cease use of affected batteries immediately.

HP customers affected by this program will be eligible to receive replacement battery services for each verified, affected battery at no cost.
