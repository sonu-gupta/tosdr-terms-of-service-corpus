However, the service provider does not use the data of our newsletter recipients to address them themselves or to pass the data on to third parties.
 NEWSLETTER - SUCCESS MEASUREMENT

The newsletters contain a so-called "web beacon", ie a pixel-sized file that is retrieved from the server when the newsletter is opened by our server or, if we use a shipping service provider.
This call will initially collect technical information, such as information about the browser and your system, as well as your IP address and time of retrieval.
This information is used to improve the technical performance of services based on their specifications or audience and their reading habits, based on their locations (which can be determined using the IP address) or access times.
Statistical surveys also include determining if the newsletters will be opened, when they will be opened and which links will be clicked.
For technical reasons, this information can be assigned to the individual newsletter recipients.
However, it is neither our goal nor, if used, that of the shipping service provider to observe individual users.
The evaluations serve us much more to recognize the reading habits of our users and to adapt our content to them or to send different content according to the interests of our users.
A separate revocation of the success measurement is unfortunately not possible, in this case, the entire newsletter subscription must be terminated.

Google is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement, which provides a guarantee to comply with European privacy legislation (https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active).
Google will use this information on our behalf to evaluate the use of our online offer by users, to compile reports on the activities within this online offer and to provide us with further services related to the use of this online offer and the internet usage.
In this case, pseudonymous usage profiles of the users can be created from the processed data.
We only use Google Analytics with activated IP anonymization.

 GOOGLE ADWORDS AND CONVERSION MEASUREMENT

We use the services of Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 on the basis of our legitimate interests (ie interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online service within the meaning of Art.
6 (1) lit.
DSGVO) , USA, ("Google").
Google is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement, which provides a guarantee to comply with European privacy legislation (https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active).
We use Google's online AdWords marketing tool "AdWords" to place ads on the Google advertising network (eg in search results, in videos, on websites, etc.) so that they are displayed to users who have a suspected interest in the ads.
This allows us to more specifically display ads for and within our online offering so that we only present ads to users that potentially match their interests.
For example, if a user sees ads for products he's been looking for on other online offerings, that's called remarketing.
For these purposes, upon access to our and other websites where the Google Advertising Network is active, Google will immediately execute a Google code and become so-called (re) marketing tags (invisible graphics or code, also known as "web beacons") incorporated into the website.
With their help, the user can store an individual cookie, ie a small file (instead of cookies, comparable technologies can also be used).
In this file is noted which websites the user visited, for what content he is interested and what offers the user has clicked, as well as technical information about the browser and operating system, referring websites, visit time and other information on the use of the online offer.
Furthermore, we receive an individual "conversion cookie".
The information obtained through the cookie is used by Google to generate conversion statistics for us.
However, we only hear the anonymous total number of users who clicked on our ad and were redirected to a conversion tracking tag page.
However, we do not receive any information that personally identifies users.
The data of the users are pseudonym processed within the Google advertising network.
For example, Google does not store and process users' names or e-mail addresses, but processes the relevant data in a cookie-related manner within pseudonymous user profiles.
That is, from the perspective of Google, the ads are not managed and displayed to a specifically identified person, but to the cookie owner, regardless of who that cookie owner is.
This does not apply if a user has explicitly allowed Google to process the data without this pseudonymization.
The information collected about users is transmitted to Google and stored on Google's servers in the United States.
For more information about Google's data usage, hiring and disparaging options, please read Google's Privacy Policy (https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads) and Google's Ads Ads Settings (https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated).
 BING ADS

Based on our legitimate interests (ie interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art.
6 (1) lit.
DSGVO), we base our online offer on the conversion and tracking tool "Bing Ads" Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399, USA.
Microsoft stores cookies on the users' devices in order to allow users to analyze the use of our online offer as long as users have accessed our online offer via a Microsoft Bing ad (so-called "conversion measurement").
Microsoft and we can thus recognize that someone clicked on an ad, was redirected to our online offer, and reached a previously determined landing page (called the "conversion page").
We only hear the total number of users who clicked on a Bing ad and were then redirected to the conversion page.
No IP addresses are stored.
No personal information on the identity of the users is given.
Microsoft is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement, which provides a guarantee to comply with European privacy legislation (https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000KzNaAAK&status=Active).
If users do not want to participate in the Bing Ads tracking process, you may opt out of setting a cookie by browser setting or using the Microsoft opt-out page: http://choice.microsoft.com/en-us/opt-out.
For more information about privacy and cookies on Microsoft Bing Ads, please refer to the Microsoft Privacy Policy: https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement.
 ONLINE PRESENCES IN SOCIAL MEDIA

We maintain online presence within social networks and platforms in order to communicate with customers, prospects and users active there and to inform them about our services.
We point out that data of the users outside the area of the European Union can be processed.
This may result in risks for the users because e.g.
enforcement of user rights could be made more difficult.
With respect to US providers certified under the Privacy Shield, we point out that they are committed to respecting EU privacy standards.
Furthermore, the data of the users are usually processed for market research and advertising purposes.
Thus, e.g.
user profiles are created from the user behavior and the resulting interests of the users.
The usage profiles can in turn be used to e.g.
Place advertisements inside and outside the platforms that are allegedly in line with users' interests.
For these purposes, cookies are usually stored on the computers of the users, in which the user behavior and the interests of the users are stored.
Furthermore, in the usage profiles, data can also be stored independently of the devices used by the users (in particular if the users are members of the respective platforms and logged in to them).
The processing of the personal data of users is based on our legitimate interests in an effective information of users and communication with users in accordance with.
Art.
6 para.
1 lit.
f.
DSGVO.

For a detailed description of the respective processing and the possibilities of contradiction (opt-out), we refer to the following linked information of the provider.
Also in the case of requests for information and the assertion of user rights, we point out that these can be claimed most effectively from the providers.
Only the providers have access to the data of the users and can directly take appropriate measures and provide information.
