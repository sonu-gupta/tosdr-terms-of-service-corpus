NVIDIA Kids Privacy Policy 
Last Updated: May 21, 2018


NVIDIA takes special care to protect the privacy of children, and our products and services are not targeted for use by children under the age of 13.
We donât collect data from children under the age of 13.
We also donât collect data if the collection would require parental consent in the relevant jurisdiction.
We employ reasonable technological safeguards to comply with local laws, and to prevent underage children from accessing areas of our services where personal information may be collected.
For example, underage children are not allowed to participate in our user-to-user forums, subscribe to an email newsletter, or enter any of our sweepstakes or contests.
Please contact us if you become aware that your child has provided us with personal data without your consent.
 

Contact Us

If you have any questions about NVIDIA's Privacy Policy or Kids Privacy Policy, please send an email to our Data Privacy Officer at privacy@nvidia.com.
You can also write to us at:
ATTN: Data Privacy Officer NVIDIA Corporation 2788 San Tomas Expressway Santa Clara, CA 95051.
Updates to this policy will be posted at privacy.nvidia.com.
Our general-audience Privacy Policy can be viewed here.
