COOKIES, WEB BEACONS AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES Our Sites use Cookies.

Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognize a userâs device.
Cookies help with a variety of website functions including allowing users to âlog inâ to websites (making your navigation of websites more efficient), remembering your preferences (such as language), and generally improving your experience on our Sites.
Cookies can also help ensure that the advertisements and content you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.
We may also include web beacons in marketing e-mail messages or our newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and links contained within clicked on.
 Some of our business partners set web beacons and Cookies on our site.

Please note that when you unsubscribe from our marketing email there may be a delay in the discontinuation of our ads directed to you on third party sites.
13.
DO NOT TRACK Newell does not track its customers over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals.
However, some third party sites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you.
If you are visiting such sites, you may be able to set the DNT signal on your browser so that third parties (particularly advertisers) know you do not want to be tracked.

In order to customize these ads or content, we, or third parties, may collect Personal Data, e.g., your email address, or data passively collected from you such as your device identifier, location, or IP address.
Most mobile devices allow you to turn off location services.
By adjusting the privacy and security settings on your device, you can manage how your mobile device and mobile browser share information, as well as how your mobile browser handles Cookies and other tracking identifiers.
Please refer to instructions provided by your mobile service provider or the manufacturer of your device to learn how to adjust your settings.

 Once one of these methods is completed, we will honor your request and update your profile to ensure that you donât receive further marketing messages.

We will process opt-out/unsubscribe requests as quickly as possible, and in most cases, within 10 days.
However, Newell Brands is made up of a complex web of many inter-connecting companies and service providers so it may take time for all our systems to reflect these updates.
We ask for your understanding that during this period you may still get messages from us while your request is being processed.

Please note that the discontinuation of marketing messages will not stop any service communications such as order updates.
