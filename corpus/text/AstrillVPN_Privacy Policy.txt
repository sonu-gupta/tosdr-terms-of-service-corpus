 Our Policy 
Astrill is committed to protecting your digital privacy.
Our privacy policy can be divided in two major parts - privacy policy when using our services (connecting to our VPN servers) and privacy policy when using our website.
Both of these are explained in full extent and detail below, please read this page to understand what data is collected and how your personal information is treated.


 Strict no-logs policy 
We try to keep as little personal information as possible.
Some information is however necessary for technical functioning of the services.
What we keep and how long we store it is explained in details below:
Our system keeps track of active sessions - connection time, IP address, device type and Astrill VPN application version during the duration of your VPN session.
Once you disconnect from VPN this information is removed permanently from our system.
This information is solely used to limit the number of devices connecting from single account simultaneously.
You can check all active sessions from member zone and you can erase them at any time.
Astrill also counts amount of traffic used by clients in order to plan network expansions.
No personally identifiable information is kept - only the total number of transferred bytes.
The very design of our VPN server software does not allow us to see which clients accessed what websites even if we wanted to.
No logs whatsoever are stored on VPN servers after connection is terminated.
Additionally to this, we keep last 20 connection records which include: connection time, connection duration, country, device type and Astrill client application version number.
This information is only used by our customer support to identify potential issues with VPN connection and provide adequate support.
This information contains no personally identifiable information (for example we don't keep IP addresses or your physical location).
This information is automatically removed in case of no activity in past 30 days.
You can also request manual deletion of all data by contacting our support at support@astrill.com anytime.
