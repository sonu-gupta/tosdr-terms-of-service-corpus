 the partial or total inability to enforcement or fulfil of its own Laws, Regulations, promises, stipulations, expectations, etc.
in Liberland or abroad.

Liberland or affiliated persons and entities shall be instituted exclusively in Arbitration and the forum for this arbitration shall be Liberland and its judiciary system.

 Â§2  No waiver by the Provider of any term or condition outlined in these terms and conditions shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition.
Any failure of the Provider to assert a right or provision under these terms and conditions shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
 Â§3  If any provision of these terms and conditions is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the terms and conditions will continue in full force and effect.
 Art.
17: Entire agreement 
 These Terms and Conditions constitute, along with our Privacy policy, the sole and entire agreement between you and the Foundation concerning the Services and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations and warranties, both written and oral, concerning the Residency Services.
