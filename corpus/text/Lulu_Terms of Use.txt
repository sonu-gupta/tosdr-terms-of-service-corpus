Lulu is a community for creators of remarkable works.
We provide the tools for you to publish your work for personal use and/or for sale and distribution to others, a marketplace for the purchase of goods and services, and a site where you can participate in forums and discussion groups with like-minded creators.
The following terms and conditions have been developed to not only protect your work and your privacy, but also to describe our commitment to you as a community member as well as your responsibilities as a content creator.

We help people distribute information and art spanning a wide range of subject matter while providing a safe, friendly, respectful, and serious site for all content creators.

If terminated for reasons of infringement, Lulu has no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid to Lulu or owed to the user.

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (âDMCAâ) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S.
copyright law.
If you believe in good faith that any material used or displayed on or through the Site infringes your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked.
The notice must include the following information: (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
(b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works).

(d) the name, address, telephone number and email address (if available) of the complaining party.
(e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law.
and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send us a counter-notice.
Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA.

ATTN: Questionable Content
Email: questionablecontent@Lulu.com7.
Publishing through Lulu.comIf you wish to publish Content through Lulu.com, you will generally be provided the opportunity to direct how the Content should be published and conditions for distribution and sale.
The publishing process converts your Content into print-ready files.
You may use these converted files to distribute and/or sell your Content, as you choose, through Lulu and/or distribution channel partners.
Lulu shall have the right to distribute samples of the Work in any form of media, including printed media, in order to promote (a) the author or authorâs Work and/or (b) the Lulu service.
These samples will be licensed for free, non-commercial use, duplication and sharing, and will comply with the sample percentage authorized by the Author.
Lulu's distribution service feeds to third party selected online and trade retailers.
Should an Author choose Global Distribution for their titles, author titles will be presented for sale and included in all distribution feeds to these selected retailers.
Lulu shall not be liable for failure by the third-party retailer to list those titles for sale.
Similarly, Authors can choose to opt out of channels at any time and at their discretion.
Lulu sends the Author request for removal in a periodic feed, however Lulu cannot dictate the speed at which the third party removes the titles for sale.
Lastly, where Lulu operates a direct to consumer online retail platform it will be Lulu's discretion if titles are listed.8.
Lulu.com Creator RevenueAs used herein and for the sale of Content through Lulu.com:



Creator Revenue - means the percentage of Net Revenue due to you as author-publisher for Content which was sold and paid for in full.
Subject to specific arrangements with distribution channel partners, the following Creator Revenue percentage generally applies:



Electronic - for sales of electronic material, 90% of Net Revenue.



Print - for sales of printed material, 80% of Net Revenue.







Gross Selling Price - means the Sales List Price after any discount that you as author-publisher would like to include in order to promote your Work, if applicable.





Net Revenue - means the remaining monies after subtracting Luluâs manufacturing costs and markups or fees for sales with distribution partners, from the monies actually received for customer purchases of Content (based on Gross Selling Price).





Returns and Refunds - when we process returns or refunds of purchased Content, this may result in an offset of the amount of Net Revenue owed to you.





Royalty - this is the Creator Revenue that is reported to the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service (IRS), if applicable.





Sales List Price - means the price determined by you as author-publisher for the Content, subject to variances in international manufacturing costs.
The Sales List Price will be the price listed in any distribution channel.





Taxes.
Shipping and Handling - sales taxes, VAT and other similar taxes, and shipping and handling are separate and apart, and not subject to revenue calculations.


If you have published and sold Content on the Site, the amount of Creator Revenue you are owed will be visible in your account under the âMy Revenueâ box that appears on the âMy Projectsâ information tab of the Site.
You may choose to receive Creator Revenues you are due via PayPal or via paper check.
PayPal payments may be made in Euros, GBP, CHF, AUD, CAD or USD.
All paper check payments are made in USD.
If you choose to receive your Creator Revenue via paper check, you will be paid on a quarterly basis.
Specifically, no later than 45 days following the end of the calendar quarter, Lulu will make a good faith effort to pay you the Creator Revenue that accrued during that quarter, using the contact information in our records.
If Lulu owes you less than $20 for Content sales within a given quarter, we reserve the right, at our discretion, to roll your Creator Revenue forward to the following quarter(s) until $20 is reached.
If you choose to receive your Creator Revenue via PayPal, you will be paid on a monthly basis.
Specifically, no later than 31 days after the end of a calendar month Lulu will make a good faith effort to pay you the Creator Revenue that accrued during that month, using the contact information in our records.
If Lulu owes you less than $5 for Content sales within a given month, we reserve the right, at our discretion, to roll your Creator Revenue forward to the following month(s) until $5 is reached.
All minimum Creator Revenue in non-USD shall be calculated in USD using current exchange rates for the purpose of the minimum thresholds for transmission of payments to you by Lulu.
It is your responsibility to update your contact information.
If we are unable to contact you using the contact information provided, we may, at our sole discretion, charge a termination fee equal to the amount of unpaid Creator Revenue to cover administrative costs.
In order to use the basic Lulu services you are not required to provide any taxpayer information.
However, based on withholding that may be required by the IRS, the payment you receive may be less than the Creator Revenue.
You are also responsible for any taxes, fees and penalties associated with your receipt of Creator Revenue or sale of your Content, and indemnify Lulu for any such tax, fee or penalty.
You are responsible to any third party for payment of royalties, commissions, etc.
that may be owed to them based upon agreements you have made with a third party and/or liabilities you have incurred to third parties.
Lulu reserves the right to place a hold on any payment based upon suspicious activity, including but not limited to, potential fraud, copyright infringement or other violations of these Terms, claims by third parties and/or questions regarding rightful ownership of the account.9.
Term and TerminationThese Terms shall remain effective until terminated as set forth herein.
