Controlling Law and Jurisdiction
These Terms of Use and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of New Zealand without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.
Any dispute, claim, disagreement or controversy arising out of or relating to this Terms of Use or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate (âDisputeâ), shall be determined in accordance with this Section.
You agree that, by accepting these Terms of Use, you and we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.
In the event of a Dispute, You agree that such Dispute shall be resolved in the following manner:
1.
First, by direct negotiation between you and our representative with authority to settle the Dispute. The party claiming that there is a Dispute must notify the other party in writing, giving full details of the claim and the specific relief sought (the âDispute Noticeâ).
Following receipt of the Dispute Notice, our representative shall attempt to contact you by e-mail or telephone to try to resolve the Dispute in good faith within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Dispute Notice.
All offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether oral or written, made in the course of the negotiation by any of the parties, their agents, employees, experts and attorneys are confidential, privileged and inadmissible for any purpose, including impeachment, in arbitration or other proceeding involving the parties, provided that evidence that is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as a result of its use in the negotiation.
2.
If the Dispute is not resolved by the foregoing negotiations within thirty (30) days, then the Dispute shall be submitted to binding arbitration as follows: (i) if you are a resident of the United States, Canada or Mexico, in Los Angeles, California, under the auspices of JAMS Endispute and in accordance with the rules of JAMSâ Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the expedited procedures set forth in the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures as those Rules exist on the effective date of these Conditions, including Rules 16.1 and 16.2 of those Rules.
or (ii) if you are a resident of a Member State of the European Union, in London, England, under the auspices of JAMS International, in accordance with the rules of JAMSâ Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the expedited procedures set forth in the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures as those Rules exist on the effective date of these Conditions, including Rules 16.1 and 16.2 of those Rules.
or (iii) if you are a resident elsewhere, in Wellington, New Zealand, under the auspices of New Zealand Dispute Resolution Centre.
Judgment on the Award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.
If your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the rules of JAMS.
3.
The arbitrator shall be appointed by JAMS or by New Zealand Dispute Resolution Centre , as applicable, in accordance with its rules.
The arbitrator shall serve as neutral, independent and impartial arbitrator.
The arbitrator shall be a retired judge or attorney with at least ten (10) years practice advising clients in the internet or e-commerce industry.
The arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
Except for the initial filing fee if you file a Dispute, we will pay all other filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above.
If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Dispute Notice is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in U.S.
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b) or corollary statute under the laws of the European Union and New Zealand, as applicable), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the JAMS or New Zealand Dispute Resolution Centre Rules, as applicable.
In such case, you agree to reimburse us for all monies previously disbursed by us that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the applicable Rules.
In any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms of Use, the arbitrator is not empowered to award punitive or exemplary damages, except where permitted by statute, and the parties waive any right to recover any such damages.
In any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms of Use, the arbitrator(s) may not award any incidental, indirect or consequential damages, including damages for lost profits.
4.
The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that partyâs individual claim.
YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
Further, unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one personâs claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.
