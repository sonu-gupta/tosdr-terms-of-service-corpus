In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those other countries may be entitled to access your Personal Information.

Please note that doing so may negatively impact your experience using the Site or Service, as some features may not work properly.
How We Secure Information.We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the information we collect and store.
Unfortunately, no security measures are 100% foolproof, and as such no network or system (including ours) can be guaranteed to be 100% secure against destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to information we collect and store.

You may access, correct, amend or delete information by accessing it within your account.
If you are unable to do so, or if youâre a Visitor who would like to exercise your right to access Personal Information we may have about you, or if you have any other questions about Personal Information we have collected about you, please contact us at contact@repl.it.
If you would prefer not to accept cookies or otherwise wish to disable our use of tracking technologies, most browsers and mobile devices allow you to change your settings so as to notify you when you receive cookies or other tracking technologies are being used, and to choose whether or not to accept/allow it.
Most browsers also allow you to disable or delete existing cookies or to automatically reject future cookies.
