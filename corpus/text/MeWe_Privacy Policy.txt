Archive of Previous Privacy PoliciesMessage DisappearanceYou have the ability to send certain types of messages through our services that automatically disappear.
If you send such disappearing messages through our services they will be automatically deleted once they have been viewed or have expired.
But â and this is important â you should understand that users who see your messages can always save them, either by taking a screenshot or by using some other image-capture technology (whether that be software or even something as old-fashioned as a camera to take a photo of your deviceâs screen).
The same common sense that applies to the Internet at large applies to MeWe as well: Donât send messages that you wouldnât want someone to save or share.In most cases, once we detect that all recipients have viewed a message, we automatically delete it from our servers.
And again in most cases, the services are programmed to delete the message from the recipientsâ device as well.
There are, however, exceptions to this general rule:
We canât guarantee that messages will be deleted within a specific timeframe.
And even after weâve deleted message data from our servers, that same data may remain in backup for a limited period of time.
We may receive requests from law enforcement requiring us by law to suspend our ordinary server-deletion practices for specific information.
As with any digital information, there may be ways to access messages while still in temporary storage on recipientsâ devices or, forensically, even after they are deleted.
Your Identity: We Protect It To The Extent The Law AllowsWe do our best to protect your identity at all times and we are respectful of the law.
MeWe will disclose personally-identifying information when required to do so by law.Linking to Third Party Sites: These Are Your Decisions And ResponsibilitiesAs an optional convenience for you, MeWe offers you the opportunity to link to and/or connect to third party websites, advertisers, vendor products, services, etc., including and not limited to social network sites like Twitter.
When you click-through, connect or link to these third party sites, products, services, etc., you are no longer protected by MeWe's Privacy Policy.
If you share to any third party social site from MeWe, they will not be able to see back into your MeWe account.
We encourage you to read the privacy policies of these third parties, as they differ from MeWe's privacy practices as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
MeWe is not liable for wrongful use, loss, or disclosure of your personally-identifying information related to your use of any third party.Security: HTTPS and EncryptionWe maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of your personal user data and other information transmitted to us.
For example, we encrypt your personally identifiable information, and most, if not all requests from you to the server are created over a secure connection (HTTPS).
However, no data transmission over the Internet or other network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.Children's PrivacyWe do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 16.
If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personal information from a child under the age of 16, we will delete such information from our records.Notifications: Weâd Like To Keep You Up To DateIf you are a registered user of MeWe you may receive notifications and updates while using our service.
