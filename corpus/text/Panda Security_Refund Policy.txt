        
TERMINATION OF THE AGREEMENT
The User will have a period of thirty (30) days, as of the date of receipt of the product, within which time he or she may terminate the contract subscribed with Panda Security without specifying the reason and without any penalty whatsoever.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of support and/or technical assistance products, no refund will be made once the service has been used regardless of the time passed.
Additionally, no refunds will be made, under any circumstances, of the Money-Back Guarantee service should the User have purchased it.
In the case of subscription services, the User may cancel his/her subscription at any time, which will become effective at the end of his/her current billing period (monthly or annual, depending on the subscription plan selected).

To exercise the aforementioned right, the User must inform Panda Security in writing, either by fax, registered postal mail or by email sent to the Customer Service email address at customer.service@pandasecurity.com, within the appropriate time period.

In this event, Panda Security will reimburse the User the amount paid within fourteen (14) days of the receipt of the written notification from the User.
Such reimbursement will be made using the same means of payment as used by the User for the initial transaction, unless the User has expressly agreed otherwise.
in any event the User shall not incur any costs as a result of such reimbursement.
