        Privacy Notice locked and loaded.
Letâs go!We want to make sure that YOU the end-user maintains their privacy.
Thatâs right! We want you to use script-blockers, ad-blockers, TOR services, and ideally a VPN client and virus checkers! Although we have our suggestion for a VPN service in our support page we donât care who you go with as long as you get secured! Protect your hardware from dangerous websites.
Trust no one! Some day we may all die here and the domain could get hijacked by a bunch of terrible people.
Or just end up being cyber-squatted until the end of time.
Even after our death, we want you to be safe out there!
Onward to the P.S.A.Government requests and privacy.The reason why this page exists is that as of 05/25/2018 entire countries need their governments to behave as net nannies! Instead of downloading ad-blocker and joining a VPN like the rest of the world is doing right now.
Those very governments want to spy on their people because theyâre getting a little jealous that Newsweek is spying on citizens better! The GDPR is a goose-step into a darker Orwellian future that the European government will pay for dearly later.
Allow us to place everything into perspective.


Fuck the GDPR AND the EU Government! â S


We also donât do Government requests if they ask at all.Existence.But why even have this page then? For those who have read my previous article âYou think this site is hacking you?â We of all people know firsthand how word of mouth alone could destroy a website.
We were looking for a method or structure to define to you the end user what it is that we do here for you.
So here we are with a privacy notice!
Letâs dive in and answer the questions of how we handle data here at www.s-config.com.Site identification.We are a blogger organization hell-bent at running an isolated server on the internet to the best of our abilities.
That if all of the data we as bloggers make is in one location you will know exactly where to go.
Simple and elegant that way.
Our content is what you read.
Our revenue stream is none of your concern.
Our identities are that weâre a 5 foot 8 inch or 1.72 Meter Anthropomorphic Asian Bear Cats known as âBinturongâ and really thatâs the best answer you will get out of us.
We totally dig grapes.

Why?

Grapes are delicious.

NO! Why this site?!?

Respect is a two-way street and respect cannot be demanded.
We try our hardest to respect privacy for the end-users and readers and in return, those people respect the privacy of the site-admin writing this.
To our readers and users around the world, we thank you for understanding this.Lack of terms agreement user checkbox.On many sites, you will find this infamous pop-up that will appear.

I have read and agree to the terms â BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH GIVE ME YOUR DATA! â Evil corp website of the week.

To be blunt.
No one reads them.
In most cases they are unenforceable.
Any website that wants to throw that in your face clearly is doing something nefarious where they want you the end-user to legally agree to something that they are doing such as collecting information upon you.
We would be willing to bet that the upper 90 percent of my readers donât even visit this page.
So why force anyone to agree to a ToS that is beholden to no one?
Pop-ups are the disease of the internet and a waste of screen space.
Moving on.General Privacy Policy updates â Changes in Terms.S-Config at the time didnât think it was that important to keep people notified on the changes of policies that occur on a blog.
So, as of 01/23/2021, Weâll try to at least have a blog article explaining the changes/additions/removals of anything within our privacy agreement as a separate blog article.
Weâre trying to learn as much as everyone else on the net here.Childrenâs privacy.Probably shouldnât have dropped all of those F-Bombs at the beginning huh?
It all comes down to the children, doesnât it? The ultimate clutch of societal abandonment.
Pass your child onto the internet to entertain and raise huh? Weâre here to inform you that it is not our job to babysit your children because we shift that responsibility back onto the parent.
S-Config believes in the privacy of ALL who visit here.
Not just children! Therefore, to the parents reading this.
If your child visited a site like this without parental or legal guardian supervision.
You are a bad parent.
What the hell are you doing? We do not collect information on your fragile little child you let play recklessly on the information super-highway you irresponsible monster of a legal guardian! If your child does contact us and gives us information explicitly stating that they are under age it will be instantly deleted.

This website is designed for mature audiences.
â S

Like other corporate shills online we could state that this website is only accessible for humans above the age of 13 to give an example.
As we have no capacity to enforce such measures it would be flat out lying to say that this website is restricted for audiences above/below a certain age group.
With absolute privacy comes absolute control.
Be careful on your journey.COPPA compliance.In the event that you are a government official who is incredibly dense and failed to read the first paragraph about childrenâs privacy.

A fuck you sandwich will be waiting for you here as well California! â S

To those the readers who must know what the hell is up with this paragraph.
California is a special state in America that feels they have to one-up every other state by inventing new laws out of thin air.
One of them demanding websites to declare that they do not sell the data of their users to third party marketing groups or providers.
To which no.
The data is not sold in any manner.
This makes our website cleaner than your own government who taxes you into obliteration and probably sells your data to third party marketing firms because the American government is a group of super hypocrites.Information a visitor provides on this site.We collect information only when the user provides said information to this site.
