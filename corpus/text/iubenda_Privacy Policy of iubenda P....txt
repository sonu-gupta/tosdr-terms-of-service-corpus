 Further information about the processing of Personal Data 
 Description of the service The iubenda Privacy Controls and Cookie Solution provided by iubenda allows websites and apps to request and manage consent for the use of cookies and similar technologies.
Upon the final userâs first visit, the solution displays a banner through which the notice is served and the consent options are made available.
In particular, the final user can accept or refuse the installation of cookies and personalize the consentâs preferences.
If the Cookie Preference Log (âCPLâ) is enabled, the consent preferences for the installation of cookies expressed by final users are stored in the CPL and can be retrieved at any time.
When the final user navigates on a website/application where our Cookie Solution is installed, a technical cookie is injected which contains the following information:
* Cookie Policy id number;* consent date and time;* consent content (accept/reject);* how the consent has been given (banner dismissal, button click etc.).
Depending on the configuration chosen, such technical cookie can be stored either on the iubenda.com domain (if the option enableRemoteConsent is active), or on the clientâs domain (default setting).
From the above information, iubenda retrieves aggregate counters per day which indicate the number of consents given vs.
the totality of the consents requested, including the indication of how the consent is given.
Furthermore, iubenda as data controller, processes the following access data which is strictly necessary for the technical provision of the service:
* IP address;* Web browser info (User Agent/type of device);* Referrer (page viewed by the User) and all the information possibly available on the http header.
The information outlined above, is sent to Bunny CDN which, in turn, forwards it to Akamai CDN.
This forwarding is done, in the case of users in the European Union, without transmitting their IP address.
Further information about Akamai CDN and Bunny CDN can be found in the section "Detailed information on the processing of Personal Data" in the present document.
The Cookie Solution is also designed to apply the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) standards, if the CCPA option is activated.
