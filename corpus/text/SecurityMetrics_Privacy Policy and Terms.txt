Introduction
SecurityMetrics, Inc.
is aware of the privacy concerns of its customers.
Our policy for collecting and using personal information is detailed below.
EU-US Privacy Shield &amp.
Swiss-US Privacy Shield
This Privacy Policy describes how SecurityMetrics collects, uses, and discloses certain personally identifiable information that we receive in the US from the European Economic Area (âEEA Personal Dataâ).
SecurityMetrics recognizes that the EEA has established strict protections regarding the handling of EEA Personal Data, including requirements to provide adequate protection for EEA Personal Data transferred outside of the EEA.
To provide adequate protection for certain EEA Personal Data about Customers received in the US, SecurityMetrics has elected to self-certify to the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework administered by the US Department of Commerce (âPrivacy Shieldâ).
SecurityMetrics adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement, and Liability.
SecurityMetrics also complies with the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from Switzerland.
For purposes of enforcing compliance with the Privacy Shield, SecurityMetrics is subject to the investigatory and enforcement authority of the US Federal Trade Commission.
For more information about the Privacy Shield, see the US Department of Commerceâs Privacy Shield website located at: https://www.privacyshield.gov.

Information Collected
SecurityMetrics collects information about its Customers from third parties such as acquiring banks, merchant service providers, and independent sales organizations (collectively âMSPsâ), with whom the Customer has a contractual relationship and through its website and related eCommerce services at several points.
SecurityMetricsâ website is maintained in the United States of America.
By using SecurityMetricsâ website, you freely and specifically give us your consent to export your personally identifiable information to the USA and store and use it in the USA as specified by this Privacy Policy.
All information collected by SecurityMetrics is provided by the user, which in this case is the Customer.

SecurityMetrics may collect information related to user information of Customer contacts as part of the services performed for a Customer including name, email address, phone number, address, fax numbers, and other contact information related to the user.
Credit card data of the Customer may be collected and stored by SecurityMetrics.
This data is stored in accordance with the PCI DSS.
SecurityMetrics also collects data related to a Customerâs data security as requested by the Customer when purchasing the services.
This data includes answers to self-assessment questionnaires, vulnerability scan data, and which security services the Customer purchases.
SecurityMetrics allows Customers to add additional users to a Customerâs account.
Customer agrees that SecurityMetrics may allow an MSP from whom it received Customerâs information to be added as an additional user on a userâs account with rights to make changes to the account.
SecurityMetrics collects information that is not personally identifiable to the user, such as referring URL addresses, time spent in certain areas of SecurityMetricsâ website, actions taken while on SecurityMetricsâ website, and origination of the user.
Certain information such as your IP address, browser type, domain names, and access times may also be collected.
To receive products and services sold or provided by SecurityMetrics, contact information is required for billing, communicating about the services, and to perform the services.

Information Usage

Part of SecurityMetrics services is to report certain Customer compliance with data security standards, and this reporting requires contact information of the Customer.
SecurityMetrics must be certified as an Approved Scanning Vendor in order to provide certain scanning services.
Part of the agreement with the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (âPCI SSCâ), the body that certifies Approved Scanning Vendors, requires SecurityMetrics to provide information requested by the PCI SSC.
SecurityMetrics may use the information collected to provide notifications regarding the Customerâs services, accounts, fulfillment of transactions, information about SecurityMetricsâ websites, service changes, special offers, legal notices, and newsletters.
Customers who provide information may receive email announcements regarding SecurityMetricsâ services from time to time.
SecurityMetrics may use the information and data submitted by users and customers for any other purposes related to SecurityMetricsâ business that are compatible with the purposes for which your information was collected by SecurityMetrics, including, but not limited to, conducting market research, improving its products and services, sending surveys, and notifying customers of product upgrades and updates, new products, special offers, seminars and conventions and any other changes within SecurityMetrics that may affect customers and users.

We process EEA Personal Data for the purposes stated above.
SecurityMetrics will only process EEA Personal Data in ways that are compatible with the purpose that SecurityMetrics collected it for, or for purposes the individual later authorizes.
Before we use your EEA Personal Data for a purpose that is materially different than the purpose we collected it for or that you later authorized, we will notify you and provide you with the opportunity to opt out.
Third parties with whom SecurityMetrics Shares Information
SecurityMetricsâ policy in relation to information collected through registration, testing, and/or any other means is to respect and protect the privacy and confidentiality of our users.
SecurityMetrics does not disclose, rent, or sell email addresses, security test results, or any other information that we may receive to any third party, unless:

Under certain circumstances, we may remain liable for the acts of our third-party agents or service providers who perform services on our behalf for their handling of EEA Personal Data that we transfer to them.

The Warranty.

SecurityMetrics will provide a PSW to merchants or entities in the health industry (collectively "Merchants") that have purchased service packages that include a premium service warranty.
This PSW provision modifies the Limited Warranty provision set forth above for those Merchants that are enrolled in and have purchased a service package that includes a PSW.
SecurityMetrics represents and warrants that SecurityMetrics PCI DSS and HIPAA compliance Services will be performed in accordance and comply with the PCI DSS as amended or HIPAA as amended from time to time.
SecurityMetrics provides a PSW to a Merchant only for Services actually purchased by the Merchants.
Exclusions.
This PSW excludes incorrect data, information, or policies provided by the Merchant, zero-day vulnerabilities, customer labeled false positives identified by SecurityMetrics' scanning engine.
The PSW does not apply to SecurityMetrics Managed Firewall Services, any security and privacy trainings sold by SecurityMetrics, and any services performed by a Qualified Security Assessor, Payment Application Qualified Security Assessor, Point-to-Point Encryption Qualified Security Assessor, Payment Card Industry Forensic Investigator, penetration tester, or an employee supervised by one of the above-mentioned specialists.
A Merchant that is enrolled in SecurityMetrics' PCI or HIPAA compliance services that includes a PSW, and suffers a data breach as a result of a failure of such SecurityMetrics' Services, will be reimbursed by SecurityMetrics for certain expenses described in Section 2 below and subject to all other terms and conditions in this Terms of Use Agreement.
The foregoing sets forth SecurityMetrics' sole liability and a Merchant's sole remedy for any data breach while enrolled with a PSW Service.
A Merchant's credit card processor, acquiring bank, independent sales organization, or merchant services provider (collectively "Acquirer") may contract and/or pay SecurityMetrics for the PCI compliance Services, for which SecurityMetrics provides the PSW.


Reimbursement Limitations.
The PSW is not available to level 1 Merchants, as level 1 Merchants are defined by the card brands.
The PSW is only available to Merchants located in the United States and Canada and that have enrolled in and paid (or whose Acquirer has paid) SecurityMetrics for the Services described in this Terms of Use Agreement or an applicable Statement of Work.
The PSW reimburses a Merchant up to $100,000 (the "PSW Limit") per Merchant identification number (or other mutually agreed upon form of identification,) subject to the terms and limitations described more fully below.
SecurityMetrics will reimburse Merchants only for the following costs and expenses actually incurred as a result of a failure of SecurityMetrics' Services to comply with PCI DSS and HIPAA, and that are timely reported according to Section 5 below by Merchants in connection with a properly reported data breach:

Penalties or fines charged to Merchant by Visa, MasterCard, Discover, American Express, or JCB directly or through an Acquirer.
A fine or penalty by a card brand must not exceed the maximum monetary assessment, fine, fee, or penalty permitted by applicable rules or agreements in effect as of the inception date of this Terms of Use Agreement.
Costs of a forensic investigation conducted by a PCI Forensic Investigator approved by the PCI Security Standards Council.
The costs associated with replacing credit cards that were compromised in a breach.
Any GLBA or HIPAA regulatory penalty or fine charged to a Merchant by a governmental regulatory agency or body.
The cost of an audit to determine the cause or extent of a GLBA or HIPAA violation.
If approved in writing by SecurityMetrics, notification costs, victim cost reimbursement, or identity theft monitoring and services.


The Program is Not Insurance.
The PSW is not insurance.
Neither Merchants nor any other entity with which the Merchant has a relationship receives insurance as a result of the PSW or this Terms of Use Agreement.
Neither the Merchant nor any other entity with which the Merchant has a relationship is an "insured" or beneficiary under any insurance policy.
Nothing in PSW or this Terms of Use Agreement creates an insurance relationship between Acquirer or the merchant and AIG (or any other AIG affiliate).
SecurityMetrics is not providing Merchants or any entity with which Merchants have a relationship with insurance pursuant to a contractual agreement.

The Program Limit.
The PSW Limit is the most any Merchant can recover for each merchant identification number (or other mutually agreed upon form of identification) during a twelve (12) month period for any or all such costs or expenses, combined, and regardless of the number of data security events discovered or regulatory actions taken.

Notification.
Merchants are required to provide SecurityMetrics notice within thirty (30) days of discovery or suspicious of a breach or compromise.
A Merchant is required to provide SecurityMetrics with any documentation, invoice, or other evidence required by SecurityMetrics within thirty (30) days after receipt of this documentation, invoice, or other evidence.

Reporting.
