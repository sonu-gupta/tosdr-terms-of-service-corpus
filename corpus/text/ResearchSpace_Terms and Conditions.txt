Letâs Try To Sort Things Out First.
We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case.
Before filing a claim against ResearchSpace, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting info@researchspace.com.
Weâll try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you via email.
If a dispute is not resolved within 15 days of submission, you or ResearchSpace may bring a formal proceeding.

We Both Agree To Arbitrate.
You and ResearchSpace agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms or the Services through final and binding arbitration, except as set forth under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below.

Arbitration Procedures.
The Scottish Arbitration Centre (SAC) will administer the arbitration under the Scottish Arbitration Rules.
The arbitration will be held in Scotland, or any other location we agree to.

Arbitration Fees.
The SAC rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees.

Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate.
 Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above.

No Class Actions.
You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action.
Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations arenât allowed.

Judicial forum for disputes.
In the event that the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you and ResearchSpace agree that any judicial proceeding will be brought in the courts of Scotland.
 Both you and ResearchSpace consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there. Controlling Law These Terms will be governed by Scottish law except for its conflicts of laws principles. Entire Agreement These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and ResearchSpace with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace any other prior or contemporaneous agreements, or terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter of these Terms.
These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights. Waiver, Severability &amp.
Assignment ResearchSpaceâs failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later.
If a provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible.
You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any such attempt will be void.
ResearchSpace may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services. Modifications We may revise these Terms from time to time, and will always post the most current version on our website.
If a revision meaningfully reduces your rights, we will notify you (by, for example, sending a message to the email address associated with your account, posting on our blog or on this page).
By continuing to use or access the Services after the revisions come into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms. RSpace Acceptable Use Policy We trust you to use our services responsibly.
