In the event of termination, the provisions of section 7 of these Terms shall apply and the Publisher shall not be entitled to any remuneration, Commission or other payment under the Agreement.


Commission 
Commission is only payable if: 
an Event has occurred.
the Event is approved by ALZ.
you have not breached these Terms.


The amount of Commission payable to the Publisher for placement of the Code and the way that it accrues in each particular case will depend on the Tariff selected by the Advertiser.
The following Tariffs are available to Advertisers: 
Standard "Pay-Per-Click" Tariff, under which the Publisher is paid for "clicks" made by internet users on the Advertisement.
Standard "Pay-Per-View" Tariff, under which the Publisher is paid for displaying the Advertisement in their Advertising Space.


The Publisher hereby agrees that the actual amount of Commission to be received by the Publisher under each Tariff shall depend upon, inter alia, the model for placement selected by the Advertiser.
The Publisher agrees that they will be notified in each case about the applicable Tariff and the amount of Commission to be received by the Publisher via the Publisher's Personal Account.
Within 5 Business Days of starting its participation in the Network or upon request by ALZ, the Publisher shall notify ALZ of the Publisherâs preferred payment terms of either Net 30 or Net 60, provided that:

should the Publisher select Net 30 payment terms, the Publisher agrees and acknowledges that its participation in the Network shall be limited to the Net 30 Demand Partners.
and
should the Publisher select Net 60 payment terms, the Publisherâs participation in the Network shall include all available Demand Partners.

The Publisher hereby expressly agrees that ALZ will be paying Commission in the following manner: 
Payment of Commission accrued each month is made automatically in accordance with the payment terms selected by the Publisher pursuant to section 5.4.
If Net 30 payment terms are selected, payment is made within 30 days after the end of the month.
If Net 60 payment terms are selected, payment is made within 60 days after the end of the month.
Payment is subject to:

the Event being approved by ALZ and there having been no breach of these Terms.
and
ALZ having the right to delay payment of Commission, for such period as ALZ decides, to the Publisher where ALZâs receipt of the Commission from the Demand Partner is delayed for whatever reason.
In the event that ALZ has failed to collect any Commission due and payable by a Demand Partner to ALZ (âUncollected Commissionâ), ALZ shall be entitled to adjust the Commission due and payable to Publisher by either: (i) withholding from any payment of Commission to Publisher an amount equal to the amount of Uncollected Commission, until such time that ALZ collects such Uncollected Commission from such Demand Partner.
or (ii) electing not to exercise its rights under paragraph (i) above to withhold such Uncollected Commission by paying Publisher in full, but reserving the right to set off such Uncollected Commission against any Commission, or other amounts, due and payable by ALZ to Publisher hereunder for any future period.
If at any time after payment of Commission, ALZ reasonably concludes that any or all of the Commission is attributable to an Event that occurred in breach of these Terms, ALZ shall be entitled to recalculate the Commission that should have been paid and the Publisher shall, without prejudice to ALZâs other remedies, repay on demand the difference between the recalculated Commission and the Commission actually paid to the Publisher.
ALZ may, at any time, set off any amount of Commission owed to it by the Publisher under this section against any present or future payment of Commission payable by ALZ to the Publisher.
Commission payments will be made by the method and in the currency selected by the Publisher in the Publisherâs Personal Account.
ALZ may set a minimum amount of commission payable which is dependent on the method of payment selected by the Publisher.
The minimum amounts imposed by ALZ are listed in the Publisherâs Personal Account.
ALZ will only make payments where the minimum amount is met.
When the minimum amount that may be paid to the Publisher is not met, the Commission will remain in the Publisherâs remuneration account on the Clickio Platform.



ALZ is not responsible for any Commission that may be withheld by banks, payment systems, payment services providers and other third parties.
No interest will be paid on the Commission in the Publisher's Personal Account.
If there are any bank charges in making the Commission payment, such charge will be deducted from the Commission payable to the Publisher.

Such costs include, in particular, the compensation or damages payable to third parties and reimbursement of further expenses including but not limited to legal costs.


 Liability and Limitation of Liability 
ALZ shall not be held liable for the content of websites of third-parties, nor shall it be liable for any damages or other failures resulting from any defects of the Publisher's software or hardware or their incompatibility with the Network.

The Publisher assumes full responsibility for any damages, losses, costs, or harm arising from the Publisher's access and/or use of, or inability to access and/or use, the Clickio Platform and/or the Network.
Nothing in this section, or the entirety of the Terms, seeks to exclude ALZ's liability for death or personal injury as a result of ALZ's actions or fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.

 Jurisdiction 
The Agreement shall be governed exclusively by the laws of England.
The place of jurisdiction is London, England.


 Change of ownership 
The rights and duties under the Terms may only be transferred with the prior written consent of ALZ.

This provision shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any termination of the Publisher's use of the Clickio Platform or participation in the Network.


 Final provisions

Should any individual provision of these Terms be of no effect, as a whole or in part, this shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions.
The invalid provision will be deemed replaced by that provision that is legally effective and comes closest, in the usual understanding, to the economic intent and purpose of the invalid provision.
The same applies to any unintentional omission.
The utilisation of the Network and its applications requires the use of special technical systems such as end user devices, software programs, transmission networks, telecommunications and other services provided by third parties, all of which may entail further costs.
ALZ does not provide such end user devices, software programs, communication channels, telecommunications services or other services and therefore will not assume any liability for such services provided by third parties.
The Agreement does not establish a company or a partnership between the parties, it does not authorise either of the parties to make any legally binding declarations on behalf of both parties together, or on behalf of the respective other party, nor does it authorize them to place the respective other party under any obligation or to represent it in any other way.
