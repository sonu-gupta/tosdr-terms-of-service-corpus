14.&nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
 Arbitration Agreement.
 Except as provided herein, you and StoryFire agree that we will resolve any disputes between us through binding and final arbitration instead of through court proceedings.
 All controversies, claims, counterclaims, or other disputes arising between you and StoryFire relating to the Services or this Agreement (each a "Claim") shall be submitted for binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of Jams, Inc.
("JAMS").
 If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an available alternative dispute resolution provider (âADR Providerâ) and the rules of such provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration.
The arbitration will be heard and determined by a single arbitrator.
 The arbitrator's decision in any such arbitration will be final and binding upon the parties and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.



For any claim where the total amount of the award sought is $10,000 or less, JAMS, you and StoryFire must abide by the following rules:  (a) the arbitration will be conducted solely based on written submissions.
and (b) the arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties.
 If the claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by JAMS rules, and the hearing (if any) will take place within one hundred miles of your residence.


If you demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, StoryFire will pay as much of the administrative costs and arbitrator's fees required for the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the cost of the arbitration from being prohibitive.
 In the final award, the arbitrator may apportion the costs of arbitration and the compensation of the arbitrator among the parties in such amounts as the arbitrator deems appropriate.


This arbitration agreement does not preclude you from seeking action by federal, state, or local government agencies.
 You and StoryFire also have the right to bring qualifying claims in small claims court.
 In addition, you and StoryFire retain the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for provisional relief, including pre-arbitral attachments or preliminary injunctions, and any such request shall not be deemed incompatible with this Agreement, nor a waiver of the right to have disputes submitted to arbitration as provided in this Agreement.


NEITHER YOU NOR STORYFIRE MAY ACT AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, NOR PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS OF CLAIMANTS, WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM.
 CLAIMS MAY NOT BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS.
 THE ARBITRATOR CAN DECIDE ONLY YOUR AND/OR STORYFIRE'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS.
 THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN THE CLAIMS OF OTHER PERSONS OR PARTIES WHO MAY BE SIMILARLY SITUATED.


If any provision of this Section 14 is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then that specific provision shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed, but the remainder of this Section 14 shall continue in full force and effect.
 No waiver of any provision of this Section 14 will be effective or enforceable unless recorded in a writing signed by the party waiving such a right or requirement.
 Such a waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Agreement.
 This Section 14 will survive the termination of your relationship with StoryFire.


THIS SECTION LIMITS CERTAIN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT ACTION OR TO HAVE A TRIAL BY JURY, THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY FORM OF CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIM AND THE RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN AAA RULES OR THE RULES OF AN ADR PROVIDER.

 When you download our Apps, you may do so through a third partyâs App Store.
You acknowledge that the terms of this Agreement are between you and us and not with the owner or operator of the App Store (âApp Store Ownerâ).
 As between the App Store Owner and us, we, and not the App Store Owner, are solely responsible for the Services, including the App, the content, maintenance, support services, and warranty, and addressing any claims relating thereto (e.g., product liability, legal compliance or intellectual property infringement).
 In order to use the App, you must have access to a wireless network, and you agree to pay all fees associated with such access.
 You also agree to pay all fees (if any) charged by the App Store Owner in connection with the Services, including the App.
The following applies to any App Store Sourced Application (as such term is defined in Section 3):

(c) &nbsp.
         In the event of any failure of the App Store Sourced Application to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify the App Store Owner, and the App Store Owner will refund the purchase price for the App Store Sourced Application to you (if any) and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the App Store Owner will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the App Store Sourced Application.
As between StoryFire and the App Store Owner, any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be the sole responsibility of StoryFire.


(d) &nbsp.
         You and we acknowledge that, as between StoryFire and the App Store Owner, the App Store Owner is not responsible for addressing any claims you have or any claims of any third party relating to the App Store Sourced Application or your possession and use of the App Store Sourced Application, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims.
(ii) any claim that the App Store Sourced Application fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement.
and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.


(e) &nbsp.
         You and we acknowledge that, in the event of any third-party claim that the App Store Sourced Application or your possession and use of that App Store Sourced Application infringes that third partyâs intellectual property rights, as between StoryFire and the App Store Owner, StoryFire, not the App Store Owner, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim to the extent required by this Agreement.


(f) &nbsp.
&nbsp.
        You and we acknowledge and agree that the App Store Owner, and the App Store Ownerâs subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement as related to your license of the App Store Sourced Application, and that, upon your acceptance of this Agreement, the App Store Owner will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce the terms of this Agreement as related to your license of the App Store Sourced Application against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof.


(g) &nbsp.
         Without limiting any other terms in this Agreement, you must comply with all applicable third-party terms of agreement when using the App Store Sourced Application.
