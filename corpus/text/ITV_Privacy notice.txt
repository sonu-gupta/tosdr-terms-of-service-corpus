How will we use your information?We and our authorised third parties will only process your personal information where we have legal grounds to do so.
The legal grounds for processing differ depending on which of our products and services you use.
Generally, weâll only process your data on the following grounds:

When we rely on consent to process your personal information, you always have the right to withdraw this consent


the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party (including the terms &amp.

the processing is necessary in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract


the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation placed on ITV (for example our obligation to ensure that the data we hold is accurate)


the processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by ITV or by a third party.
For example, we have a legitimate interest in understanding how people are using our products and services, both to improve them, to sell adverts more effectively and to promote our services.

Processing Based on Legitimate InterestsWhere any of the activities set out below involve the use of cookies or similar technologies, additional information (including about how you can disable them) is displayed to you before such cookies are installed and can also be found in our Cookie Policy at www.itv.com/cookies.Legitimate Interests
Understanding our audience and use of our products and services:




We have a legitimate interest in analysing and understanding how people are using and responding to our products and services at an individual and household or broader level.
For example, we collect and analyse data about how you are using our products and services and we (or our authorised third parties) may contact you from time to time to ask you to participate in surveys or research projects to help us understand use of and improve our services.

If you use a product or service we may combine information we collect from that product and service with information we collect from our other products and services, with information from surveys and research and with information which is available publicly or from other reputable sources (which include other broadcasters or trusted providers (such as Konica Minolta Marketing Services Limited and the advertising technology provider The Addressable Platform Limited)).
We work with trusted third parties (including advertising clients and research providers) to understand the effectiveness of advertising (for example, what actions result from viewing advertising).
We apply modelling techniques to the information we hold to model our audiences based on certain attributes, understand our viewers better and to analyse use across all of our products and services.

We also collect information and insights information from use and interactions with pages or accounts we operate on third party platforms (for example, Facebook Fan Pages) for this purpose and also to administer those pages or accounts.
In relation to such insights data, both we and the third party platform are controllers of any insights data relating to that page or account.
For Facebook fan pages we are required to enter into a contract with Facebook to reflect joint controllership.
You can download this contract here: https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/page_controller_addendum.
It contains further details and explanations on the joint controllership with Facebook in the context of fan page insights.



Making your user experience more relevant to you including recommendations &amp.
editorial content personalisation:



We have a legitimate interest in tailoring your user experience to you and making it easier for you to find the shows and content that you enjoy.
We therefore use information we hold about you in order to recognise you across our different services, recommend content to you or personalise your experience.
For example, we may use this information to help make your sign-in experience quicker and easier and if you watch a lot of drama then we might recommend the next big new drama series to you.

If you have adjusted the âPersonalisationâ settings in the âManage Accountâ section of our website, your user experience wonât be personalised.
We may still recommend content to you but our recommendations wonât be as relevant for you.


Advertising on our products and services:



Some of our products and services are funded by the sale of advertising and are free for viewers to use.
We and our advertisers have a legitimate interest in serving and measuring our advertising efficiently.
This is to ensure that our viewers have a good user experience, (for example donât see the same advertising over and over again) and to allow our advertisers to reach more viewers and know when ads have been served.

If you download any of our apps on a mobile device with a Google Android or Apple iOS operating system then you will be given an advertising identifier by that operating system.
We use and pass this identifier to permitted third parties for frequency capping to limit repetitive advertising, for analytics purposes, or to enable us to serve you advertisements of particular relevance to you.
You can reset your advertising ID at any time using the settings on your mobile device.


Making advertising on our products and services more relevant to you:



Some of our products and services are funded by the sale of advertising and are free for viewers to use.
We therefore have a legitimate interest in using information we hold about you to help us sell our advertising on a more personalised basis and to show you adverts that we think youâll be interested in or which are more relevant to you.
For example, if you live in Leeds then we would be more likely to show an ad for an event in Yorkshire - and less likely to see an ad for an event in London.

We also pass an identifier relating to you and data about you to The Addressable Platform Limited (an advertising technology provider which is part of the ITV group) and to our trusted third party partners (such as Amobee Inc and GroupM UK Limited (who also work with Finecast Limited)) to enable them to match against other data they may legally hold and use that combined information to serve ads of particular relevance to you.
You can choose not to receive adverts on our products and services that are tailored using information about you by adjusting the âPersonalisationâ settings in the âManage Accountâ section of the ITV Hub website.
Youâll still see adverts, but they will be generic (which includes advertising served against content being watched) and less relevant to you.



Making advertising and marketing on other services more relevant to you:



Our advertising clients run campaigns across more than one service.
We and our advertisers have a legitimate interest in making sure that you donât see repetitive or less relevant advertising across both our platforms and those run by third parties.
We therefore share limited data with third parties to enable a match where you have also already shared your data with that party in the course of using their service.
and (where there is a match) additional data to enable the third party and us to make advertising more relevant to you.

We also work with third party advertisers and platforms (such as Facebook and Google) to advertise our products and services to the most relevant audiences.
This can involve the provision of protected ID data (for example, an email address which is converted into a stream of numbers or letters (aka hashed) to help make it more secure) to match the data we hold about you with the data they hold on their platform and provide you with relevant advertising (subject to your ad permissions on the relevant platform).

If you have adjusted the âPersonalisationâ settings in the âManage Accountâ section of the ITV Hub website, you may still see adverts and marketing from us on other services, but it wonât use this data.
Advertising on other services may still be based on cookie data however unless you have chosen to disable your cookies on the relevant device.


Geo-blocking:



Some of our content is only available in certain parts of the world.
This is due to a range of legal and regulatory issues, and we have a legitimate interest in complying with these restrictions.
To ensure we only show you content when youâre in the appropriate territories we detect the IP address of your device to work out your location.


Main channel region:



We have a legitimate interest in complying with our obligations to Ofcom and STV with respect to certain ITV main channel programming in STVâs broadcast regions.
We therefore use your postcode or other location data to ensure that we only play out content for you in accordance with those obligations.

Storing payment details for repeat purchases:



If you purchase or subscribe to an event or service online then we have a legitimate interest to store your payment details to enable you to make repeat purchases without having to re-enter your details again.
For example ITV Box Office stores payment details to enable Sky customers to make repeat purchases via their remote control.


Direct Marketing:



Subject to your direct marketing preferences, we have a legitimate interest in sending you marketing communications that we think will be the most relevant to you (and which will include our own or third party data).
We also have a legitimate interest to analyse the performance of our communications.
For more details on direct marketing, see below.

If you have adjusted the âPersonalisationâ settings in the âManage Accountâ section of our website, we will still send you direct marketing communications (subject to your preferences) but they wonât be as relevant for you.


Queries and complaints handling:



When you contact us with queries and questions about our programmes or services we have a legitimate interest to try to resolve your issue and to keep track of our progress in resolving your issue.
In some cases, we may need to verify your details before we can resolve your issue e.g.
to find your ITV Hub account.
When you contact us with feedback, we have a legitimate interest to pass your feedback on to the relevant team within ITV if appropriate, or to the production company if your feedback relates to a programme that is not produced by ITV and if it is appropriate.
We have a legitimate interest in monitoring our communications to improve our customer services.

Direct MarketingWe use your data to promote or market our or third party products or services to you via direct marketing in the following circumstances.

Why we send you marketing: At your request

If you have asked us to send you marketing messages about ITV and/or selected third party products, services and special offers or you agree to receive marketing messages from selected third parties (e.g.
by ticking a box when you register for a product/service or allowing push notifications when you download one of our apps).




How to control the marketing we send to you:



You can stop receiving email, SMS or MMS marketing communications from us, by using the 'unsubscribe', 'stop' or similar facility contained in any such communication.
Please note that texting STOP in response to our SMS marketing will cost one standard network rate message.
Alternatively, you can email us at the email address set out in âContact usâ below stating that you do not wish to receive further communications from us.



You can stop receiving push notifications from one of our apps by turning these off at any time by adjusting the settings on your device or deleting the app from your device.


If you agree that we can pass data to third party for their marketing purposes, youâll need to contact the applicable third party to opt-out of receiving communications from that third party.
Please note that we are not responsible for the communications you receive from any such third party.






Why we send you marketing: You have participated in one of our paid-for services

If you participated in one of our paid for services such as competitions, prize draws, votes, polls or other interactivity by SMS text message, or have signed up for an ITV Box Office event, and have not opted out of receiving marketing then we will send you marketing messages in relation to similar products or services to those you interacted with (for example, if you enter a competition relating to Iâm a Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here!, we may send you marketing messages in relation to the competition in the following year of Iâm a Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here!).




How to control the marketing we send to you:



If you are participating in our interactivity you can avoid receiving these communications entirely by adding NO INFO at the end of your SMS text entry, vote, poll or other message.



If you are currently receiving these communications and would prefer not to, you can use the 'unsubscribe', 'stop' or similar facility described in any such communication.
Please note that texting STOP in response to our SMS marketing will cost one standard network rate message.
Alternatively, you can email us at the email address set out in âContact usâ below stating that you do not wish to receive further communications from us




Do we use cookies?We, and our authorised third parties, use cookies and/or other similar technologies or tools (collectively referred to as âcookiesâ) to store and sometimes track information about you.
We also access certain information stored on the devices you use to access our products and services.
For more details about what cookies are, the cookies we use and how to disable them, please see our Cookie Policy at www.itv.com/cookies and service-specific privacy notices (where applicable).How long do we keep your information?We keep your personal information for only as long as necessary, which is longer in some cases than in others.
The length of this retention period depends on the purpose for which the data was obtained and its nature.
For example:


we need to keep some personal information about you so we can deal with any complaints you might make about the products and services we provide to you;


if you ask us to stop processing your personal information for direct marketing, we need to retain enough information about you to enable us to ensure we stop including you in those direct marketing activities;


we need to keep personal information so we can defend possible future legal claims.
Unless thereâs some other reason for keeping it, personal information will be deleted when such a claim could no longer arise or it is no longer required in order to defend legal claims that have arisen;


we have a legal or regulatory duty to retain particular personal information for a certain minimum period (for example under Ofcom rules, or under HMRC tax rules).

In what circumstances do we share your information?We do need to share your personal data with third parties in some circumstances.
We pass information about you to other parties as follows:


to third parties authorised by us and acting on our behalf, such as our employees, contractors, partners, suppliers, auditors and/or agents, to administer the products and services provided to you and/or to help us review and improve these products and services (including reviewing the accuracy of our data and checking how effective we are at making content relevant to you).
These third parties are only allowed access to your information as needed to perform functions of the products and services or to provide services to us.
Theyâre not allowed to use it for any other purpose


to reputable third parties such as broadcasters to enable you to have a better cross-platform advertising experience (see "Making advertising and marketing on other services more relevant to you" above)


where ITV Box Office stores details to enable repeat purchases via the Sky remote control.
If you want to opt-out of this processing please send an email from your registered email address to itvboxofficesupport@itv.com;


for marketing communications, where we have your consent to do so (see section above on "Direct Marketing")


to conduct analytics in relation to our products and services.
including with regard to our user base, sales patterns, traffic volumes and related matters.
This could include comparing the information we hold about you against third party datasets;


so that our products and services can be marketed to you on third party platforms (for example, Facebook or our Facebook Fan Pages)


for the purpose of industry measurement (for example by the Broadcasters Audience ResearchBoard)


to the police, regulatory bodies or legal advisers in connection with any alleged criminal offence, unlawful activity or suspected breach of the Terms of Use and/or the breach of other terms and conditions or otherwise where required by law or where we suspect harm or potential harm to others.
We will cooperate with any law enforcement authorities or court order requesting or directing us to disclose the identity or location of or any other information about anyone breaching any relevant terms and conditions or otherwise for the prevention or detection of crime or the apprehension or prosecution of offenders


where relevant, the user name and some profile information you voluntarily provide may be published on areas of the products and services such as forums, leaderboards, chat rooms or pages where user submissions are displayed, and this will be the identity by which you are known on those areas


if there are changes to our business (see section below on "Changes to our business")


to any other third party where you have provided your consent.


We also share your personal information with other parts of the ITV group of companies.
We do this to:


provide a more personalised experience across our different products and services


provide and/or manage cross or intergroup products and services.
and/or


provide other services and products you request or to promote those which might be of interest to you.


For privacy notices of other ITV group companies (including for The Addressable Platform Limited and Britbox), please see www.itv.com/groupprivacy.What about third parties?We work with third parties to provide our products and services, and our products and services may contain links to other websites owned by third parties.

Sometimes when we include a link in our products and services, we use an affiliate link to earn income from purchases made by users who click on the link and go on to buy the product.
These links do not affect our editorial content or decisions to recommend products, nor do they affect the price of any products.
We will make clear to you which links are affiliate links.

We work with a company called Skimlinks to provide these links.
When you click on one of the Skimlinksâ affiliate links, they may collect information about you.
For more information, please see Skimlinksâ privacy policy at https://skimlinks.com/privacy-policies/ and cookies policy at https://skimlinks.com/user-cookies/.
What are your rights?Any personal information you supply will be treated in accordance with applicable data protection laws including the Data Protection Act 2018 and the General DataProtection Regulation (the âGDPRâ) and any other applicable or superseding legislation.
We are committed to delivering the rights that individuals are entitled to under data protection laws in the UK.
These are:


the right to request a copy of the personal information we hold about you.
To do this, please contact us at myprivacy@itv.com making clear that you are requesting a copy of your personal information and including full details of what you require.
You may also be required to submit a proof of your identity.


the right to object to your personal information being used for direct marketing.
Where required we will ensure we obtain your consent before undertaking marketing and you will have the ability to opt out (see the section on "Direct Marketing" above).


the right to object to your personal information being processed where the legal basis for the processing is our own legitimate interests as a business (see "How will we use your information" section above).
In some circumstances (for example, where we are using cookies or in respect of personalising editorial content or advertising or marketing) we have specific mechanisms to enable this objection.
In all cases, we will comply with such a request unless there is a lawful reason for not doing so, such as when we need to continue to process your information to defend a legal claim or if this information is necessary for the ongoing provision of our products and services.


the right to rectification.
You may request that we correct any inaccurate and/or complete any incomplete personal information.


the right to withdraw consent.
Where we are processing your personal information on the basis that you have given us your consent to do so, you may withdraw your consent at any time.


the right of erasure.
You may request that we erase your personal information and we will comply, unless there is a lawful reason for not doing so.
For example, there may be an overriding legitimate ground for retaining your personal information, such as keeping your payment information for several years to comply with HMRC rules.


the right to data portability.
In certain circumstances, you may request that we provide your personal information to you in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format and have it transferred to another provider of the same or similar services to us.
Where this right is applicable, we will comply with such transfer as far as it is technically feasible.


the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority.
We suggest that you contact us about any questions or if you have a complaint in relation to how we process your personal information.
However, you do have the right to contact the relevant supervisory authority directly.

other appropriate safeguards have been put in place, as described in the privacy notice for the applicable product/service.

Changes to our businessIf we decide to change or restructure our business we may need to pass your personal information to one of our group companies so we can continue to effectively deliver the products and services to you.
Also, if we become involved in a merger, acquisition, restructuring, reorganisation or other transaction involving the sale of some or all of our group companiesâ assets, then your information may be included in the assets that are transferred to the new owner and may be provided to the entities and advisors involved.Such a transaction could involve us: (i) retaining the right to continue to use transferred personal information in addition to the right of the new owner to use such information.

If there are changes to our business (such as a re-organisation or restructuring), your personal information will remain subject to this privacy notice (as amended from time to time).
