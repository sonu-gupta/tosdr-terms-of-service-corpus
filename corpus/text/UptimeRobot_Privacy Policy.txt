Our website uptimerobot.com;
Our mobile applications (including the UptimeRobot mobile app for Android and iOS);

Throughout this Privacy Policy, weâll refer to our website, mobile applications and other products and services collectively as âServices.â
Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that information.Information We CollectWe only collect information about you if we have a reason to do soâfor example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better.

Letâs go over the information that we collect.Information You Provide to UsItâs probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us.
The amount and type of information depends on the context and how we use the information.
Here are some examples:

For example, we require individuals who sign up for an uptimerobot.com account to provide name-surname, email address , password and thatâs it.

Transaction and Billing Information: If you buy something from usâa subscription to a uptimerobot.com plan, SMS messages, etc., for exampleâyou will provide additional personal and payment information that is required to process the transaction and your payment, such as your name, credit card information, and contact information.

Credentials: Depending on the Services you use, you may provide us with credentials for your website (like SSH, FTP, and SFTP username and password).

Communications With Us (Hi There!): You may also provide us information when you respond to surveys or communicate with our team about a support question.
Information We Collect AutomaticallyWe also collect some information automatically:


Log Information: Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information.
We collect log information when you use our Servicesâfor example, when you create or make changes to your account.

Usage Information: We collect information about your usage of our Services.

We use this information to, for example, provide our Services to you, as well as get insights on how people use our Services, so we can make our Services better.

We collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions.

We share information about you in the limited circumstances spelled out below and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy:


Subsidiaries, Employees, and Independent Contractors: We may disclose information about you to our subsidiaries, our employees, and individuals who are our independent contractors that need to know the information in order to help us provide our Services or to process the information on our behalf.
We require our subsidiaries, employees, and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for personal information that we share with them.

Third Party Vendors: We may share information about you with third party vendors who need to know information about you in order to provide their services to us, or to provide their services to you.
This group includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you (like payment providers that process your credit and debit card information, fraud prevention services that allow us to analyze fraudulent payment transactions, SMS and email delivery services that help us stay in touch with you), those that assist us with our marketing efforts (e.g.
by providing tools for identifying a specific marketing target group or improving our marketing campaigns), those that help us understand and enhance our Services (like analytics providers) who may need information about you in order to, for example, provide technical or other support services to you.
We require vendors to agree to privacy commitments in order to share information with them.
These vendors are listed in the "List of data sub-processors" section below.

Legal Requests: We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request.

To Protect Rights, Property, and Others: We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of UptimeRobot, third parties, or the public at large.
For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information related to the emergency without delay.

Business Transfers: In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that UptimeRobot goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.
If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.

With Your Consent: We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction.
For example, we may share your information with third parties with which you authorize us to do so, such as the social media services that you connect to our site.

Aggregated or De-Identified Information: We may share information that has been aggregated or reasonably de-identified, so that the information could not reasonably be used to identify you.
For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services.
SecurityWhile no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so, such as monitoring our Services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks.
To enhance the security of your account, we encourage you to enable our advanced security settings, like Two Step Authentication.ChoicesYou have several choices available when it comes to information about you:

Please keep in mind that we may continue to retain your information after closing your account, as described in Information We Collect aboveâfor example, when that information is reasonably needed to comply with (or demonstrate our compliance with) legal obligations such as law enforcement requests, or reasonably needed for our legitimate business interests.
