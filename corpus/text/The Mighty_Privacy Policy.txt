Personal Data Rights Request Form

Email: privacy@themighty.com

Mail: PO Box 12539, Glendale, CA 91224, United States

 
Information for California residents
 

Scope.&nbsp.
This section describes how we collect, use, and share the Personal Information of California residents as a âbusinessâ under the California Consumer Privacy Act (âCCPAâ) and their rights with respect to their Personal Information.&nbsp.
For purposes of this section, âPersonal Informationâ has the meaning given in the CCPA but does not include information exempted from the scope of the CCPA.&nbsp.
Additionally, this section does not apply to information we collect from you in the course of communicating with you in your capacity as an employee, controlling owner, director, officer or contractor of an organization (i.e., company, partnership, sole proprietorship, non-profit or government agency) in the context of performing due diligence on, or providing or receiving products or services to or from, that organization.&nbsp.
In some cases we may provide a different privacy notice to certain categories of California residents, such as job applicants, in which case that notice will apply instead of this section.

Your California privacy rights.
As a California resident, you have the rights listed below.
However, these rights are not absolute, and in certain cases we may decline your request as permitted by law.

You can request the following information about how we have collected and used your Personal Information during the past 12 months:

The categories of Personal Information that we have collected.
The categories of sources from which we collected the Personal Information.
The categories of third parties with whom we share the Personal Information.
The categories of Personal Information that we sold or disclosed for a business purpose.
The categories of third parties to whom the Personal Information was sold or disclosed for a business purpose.
The business or commercial purpose for collecting and/or selling Personal Information.



Access.&nbsp.
You can request a copy of the Personal Information that we have collected about you during the past 12 months. 

Deletion.&nbsp.
You can ask us to delete the Personal Information that we have collected from you.

Right to information, access and deletion.
You may submit requests to exercise your right to information, access or deletion by completing our Personal Data Rights Request Form or calling us toll-free at (844) 218-8395

Right to opt-out of the âsaleâ of your Personal Information.&nbsp.
Like many companies, we use services that help deliver interest-based ads to you, and have done so during the past 12 months.&nbsp.
Our use of these services may constitute a âsaleâ of your Personal Information for purposes of the CCPA because the advertising partners that provide the services collect information from our users (e.g., the device data and online activity data described above) to help them serve ads more likely to interest you.&nbsp.
See the Do Not Sell My Personal Information section of our Cookie Notice to opt-out.  


We will need to verify your identity to process your information, access and deletion requests and reserve the right to confirm your California residency.&nbsp.
Authentication into your The Mighty account (if applicable), government identification or other information may be required.&nbsp.
Your authorized agent may make a request on your behalf upon our verification of the agentâs identity and our receipt of a copy of valid power of attorney given to your authorized agent pursuant to California Probate Code Sections 4000-4465.&nbsp.
If you have not provided your agent with such a power of attorney, you must provide your agent with written and signed permission to exercise your CCPA rights on your behalf, provide the information we request to verify your identity, and provide us with written confirmation that you have given the authorized agent permission to submit the request.
We cannot process your request if you do not provide us with sufficient detail to allow us to understand and respond to it.
