        Privacy Policy
One of the goals of LibreWolf is to remove the data collection and telemetry
from Firefox, and thus we don't collect any data from the user in the LibreWolf
browser or on the LibreWolf website.
Additionally, we wouldn't even have the
infrastructure to collect and store data, making it impossible from a technical
standpoint.
We can't always assure that no data is sent from the browser to Mozilla or other
third parties, but we try our best to achieve that.
For that case, also check
out the
Firefox Privacy Notice.
