PERSONAL DATA DEFINITIONS AND TERMS
Data Privacy terms and definitions may vary from state to state.

âAggregated informationâ means that data that could directly or indirectly identify an individual student has been removed (de-identified) and the remaining data has been combined with multiple records to use for statistical information and summaries.
 For example, information about the graduation rate for a graduating class or school is combined with graduation rates for other schools and districts across Florida for statewide statistical reporting.
 Statistics on the percentages of students by outcomes and student subgroups is publicly posted to demonstrate school, school district and state educational performance and accountability, but cannot identify an individual student, either directly or indirectly.
