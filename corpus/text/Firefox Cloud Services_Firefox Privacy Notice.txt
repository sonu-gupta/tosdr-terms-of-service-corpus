         Firefox Privacy Notice Effective May 28, 2021 At Mozilla, we believe that privacy is fundamental to a healthy internet.
Thatâs why we build Firefox, and all our products, to give you greater control over the information you share online and the information you share with us.
We strive to collect only what we need to improve Firefox for everyone.
In this Privacy Notice, we explain what data Firefox shares and point you to settings to share even less.
We also adhere to the practices outlined in the Mozilla privacy policy for how we receive, handle and share information we collect from Firefox. Firefox by default shares data to:
Improve performance and stability for users everywhere


Interaction data: Firefox sends data about your interactions with Firefox to us (such as number of open tabs and windows.
number of webpages visited.

Technical data: Firefox sends data about your Firefox version and language.
device operating system and hardware configuration.
memory, basic information about crashes and errors.
outcome of automated processes like updates, safebrowsing, and activation to us.

Webpage, Language, and Location data for Pocket Recommendations: We recommend content to you based on your browsing history, language, and country location.
The process of deciding which stories you should see based on your browsing history happens locally in your copy of Firefox, and neither Mozilla nor Pocket receives a copy of your browsing history.
To help you see relevant Pocket Recommendations based on your location, Firefox shares your language and country location with Pocket.
Mozilla and Pocket receive aggregated data about the recommendations you see and click.
We also share aggregated data about the sponsored content you see and click with our third-party ad platform Adzerk so advertisers can see how many people click on their articles.
This aggregated data does not identify you personally.



Location data and Interaction data for Top Sites: When you click the Amazon.com Top Site tile on New Tab, we share your country and the time you clicked with Amazon and AdMarketplace (a third-party referral platform) to verify you navigated to Amazon.
Firefox does not share your IP address or any other information that could be used to identify you with either Amazon or AdMarketplace.



Add-on and Feature Recommendations: We recommend Add-ons in two places: the Manage Your Extensions Page (about:addons) and the Awesome Bar, where you search or type in URLs.
We may also recommend Firefox Features in the Awesome Bar.
We base the recommendations in about:addons on a cookie.
We base the recommendations in the Awesome Bar on your interaction with Firefox.
Mozilla does not receive your browser history.
The process happens locally in your own computerâs copy of Firefox.
Learn More about Awesome Bar recommendations or Extensions Page recommendations.
