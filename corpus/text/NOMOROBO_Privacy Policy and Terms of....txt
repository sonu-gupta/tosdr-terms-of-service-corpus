California Online Privacy Protection Act

CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy.
The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.
Get more information here.

According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:

Users can visit our site anonymously.
Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum on the first significant page after entering our website.
Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can be easily be found on the page specified above.
Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page.
Users are able to change their personal information by logging in to their account


COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)

When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control.
The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.
We do not specifically market to children under 13.

Fair Information Practices

The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe.
Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.

In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices should a data breach occur, we will notify the users via email within 7 business days

We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law.
This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.

CAN-SPAM Act

The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.

Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.
Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders.
We may also send you additional information related to your product and/or service.

You also understand and agree that the Company may anonymously track and report your activity on the Nomorobo Website and while you are using the Nomorobo Service.
By installing or otherwise enabling the Nomorobo Service to work on any given phone line you represent and warrant that you are the owner of that phone line or that you have the express consent of the owner of that phone line to install the Nomorobo Service on that phone line through your user account (in which case the owner of the phone line must separately agree to these Terms and the Privacy Policy and will also be considered a User as contemplated by these Terms).

Unless otherwise prohibited by law, you accept the new pricing by continuing to use the Nomorobo Service and the Protected Data after the price change has taken effect.

4.4 Automatic Renewals.
If you are the Primary Account Holder, the Company may offer you automatic payment or automatic renewal options for paid subscriptions.
If you sign up for automatic renewal or automatic payment, the subscription you purchased for any paid service will automatically renew at the end of its term for another comparable subscription term based on the prices and subscription options available at the time of renewal.
The Company has the sole and exclusive discretion to determine which renewal subscription is comparable to your prior subscription.
however, in the event that you are dissatisfied with the renewal option selected by the Company, you may alter the subscription during the cooling off period as discussed in Subsection 4.7.
If you have signed up for automatic renewal but the payment information you have provided to the Company is no longer current at the time of your subscription renewal, your subscription will not automatically renew, but instead will expire at the end of its term as if you had not selected automatic renewal or automatic payment.

4.5 Credit Card Authorization.
By providing your credit card information, you authorize the Company to charge your credit card and you agree to pay all initial and recurring subscription fees.

4.6 Cancellation.
Regardless of whether you are the Primary Account Holder, you may stop using the Nomorobo Service at any time by either: (1) uninstalling the Nomorobo Service on any or all of your phone line(s) and by stopping your use of the Nomorobo Service and the Protected Data.
or (2) by terminating the Agreements as discussed Paragraph 5.2(i).
However, if you stop using a paid service or terminate the Agreements during a subscription period, neither you nor the Primary Account Holder shall be entitled to a refund of any portion of the fees which were already paid for that subscription period.
To the fullest extent permissible by law, all subscription fees are earned upon receipt and are completely non-refundable.
Except as otherwise specifically provided for in the Agreements the Company will not refund any subscription fees that have already been paid.

4.7 Cooling Off Period.
All automatic renewals of paid service subscriptions are subject to a cooling off period as described in this Subsection.



Term of Cooling Off Period. The cooling off period begins when the Primary Account Holder tenders payment for a renewing subscription period and ends 72 (seventy-two) hours thereafter.




Your Rights During Cooling Off Period. During the cooling off period, if you are the Primary Account Holder, you may (1) cancel your purchase of the paid subscription and receive a full refund of the amount tendered at the start of the cooling off period.
or (2) modify your subscription and receive a price adjustment for your subscription based on the modifications that you choose.
In order to cancel or modify your subscription during the cooling off period, please contact Customer Support following the procedures listed at Subsection 3.7.
If you are not the Primary Account Holder, you do not have any additional rights during the cooling off period.



4.8 Expiration of Paid Services.
If the Primary Account Holder for the account through which your phone line is subscribed does not provide current payment information and renew the subscription to any paid services for that account (either automatically as discussed in Subsection 4.4 or manually following the instructions on the Nomorobo Website) your access to any paid services will cease upon expiration of the subscription term.
Upon expiration of your subscription to any paid service, the Agreements remain in full force and effect and you may continue to use any free services that are available to you despite the expiration of your subscription to the paid services. Section 5.

General 
6.1 Choice of Law and Forum.
The Agreements, including all claims relating to or arising out of the Agreements, are governed by the laws of New York, without regard to New York's conflict or choice of law provisions.
If the Class Action Waiver set forth in Subsection 6.2 is not enforceable in arbitration, or if the Dispute Resolution procedure laid out in Subsection 6.3 is unenforceable or does not apply, the parties agree that Subsection 6.3 shall be null and void in its entirety and the federal and state courts of the State of New York shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any action arising out of or related to the Agreements and personal jurisdiction over each and every party.

6.2 Class Action Waiver.
WHERE PERMITTED UNDER THE APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT YOU SHALL NOT BRING ANY CLAIM AGAINST THE OTHER AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.
INSTEAD, YOU AND THE COMPANY MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY.
FURTHERMORE, UNLESS BOTH YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE, NO ARBITRATOR OR JUDGE MAY CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIM OR OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.

6.3 Dispute Resolution.
All controversies and claims that arise out of or relate to the Agreements shall be resolved in accordance with the following:



Applicability and Exceptions. The dispute resolution process set below (informal resolution followed by binding arbitration) applies to all controversies and claims that arise out of or relate to the Agreements, subject only to the exceptions listed below.




Infringement of Intellectual Property. If the claim relates to theft, infringement, or other misuse of a party's intellectual property, including infringement of a trademark or servicemark or copying or distributing the Protected Data, the claiming party need not rely on binding arbitration and need not attempt informal resolution, but instead may immediately seek relief in a court of competent jurisdiction.
For such actions, the parties consent to jurisdiction in the State of New York.




Small Claims. The claimant may seek resolution of any dispute in small claims court in Suffolk County, New York, provided that all claims between the parties fall within the jurisdiction of the small claims court and were not able to be resolved by the informal resolution procedure described in Paragraph 6.3(ii) below.




Enforcement Actions. The claimant may pursue enforcement actions through applicable U.S.
federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available.





Informal Resolution. In the event of any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Agreements, the parties hereto shall use their best efforts to settle the dispute, claim, question or disagreement.
To this effect, the claiming party shall provide a brief, written description of the dispute to the responding party and give the responding party sixty (60 days) to resolve the dispute to the complaining party's satisfaction.



Binding Arbitration. If the parties to the Agreements do not reach a solution through the informal resolution process described in Paragraph 6.3(ii), then any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Agreements, shall be settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA") in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof or having jurisdiction over the relevant party or its assets.
The parties agree that the Agreements affect interstate commerce, so the U.S.
Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply and govern the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (notwithstanding the choice of law provision at Subsection 6.1).
Notwithstanding and in addition to the foregoing, the following rules shall apply to any binding arbitration brought under the Agreements:




Location and Language. The place of the arbitration shall be Suffolk County, New York and the language shall be English.



Number and Selection of Arbitrators. For any dispute in which the amount in controversy is less than $100,000, there shall be one arbitrator who shall be selected and appointed in accordance with the AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules.
In all other cases there shall be a panel three arbitrators, one selected by the initiating party in the request for arbitration, the second selected by the other party within 30 days of receipt of the request for arbitration, and the third, who shall act as chairperson, selected by the two party-appointed arbitrators within 30 days of the selection of the second arbitrator.
Any arbitrators not selected within the specified timeframes shall be selected by the AAA.



Confidentiality.&nbsp.
The existence of the arbitral proceedings and any rulings or awards shall be kept confidential except: (1) if the disclosure is required of a party to fulfill a legal duty, protect or pursue a legal right, or enforce or challenge an award in bona fide legal proceedings before a state court or other judicial authority.
(2) if the disclosure is made to the party's accountants, attorneys, and other fiduciaries.
(3) to an arbitrator or third party for use as persuasive authority in other proceedings brought pursuant to this Subsection.
or (4) with the written consent of all parties.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, either party may disclose matters relating to the arbitration or the arbitral proceedings where necessary for the preparation of a claim or defense in such arbitration.



Modifications.&nbsp.
If the Company makes any changes to this Dispute Resolution provision, you may reject any such change by sending the Company written notice within 30 days of the change to the Company's address for Notice, in which case your account and any rights granted to you under the Agreements shall be immediately terminated, without liability to you, and this Dispute Resolution Subsection as in effect immediately prior to the amendment(s) you reject, shall survive.




6.4 Time Limitations.
Any claim under the Agreements shall be time-barred unless the claiming party commences arbitration (or litigation if one of the exceptions set forth in Paragraph 6.3(i) applies) with respect to such claim within one year after the basis for such claim became known or should have become known to the claiming party.
If applicable law prohibits a one-year limitation period for commencing claims, any claim must be asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law.
Any applicable statutes of limitations and defenses based upon the passage of time shall be tolled upon the filing of a request for arbitration until 60 days after the issuance of the final award.

6.5 Anti-Assignment.
You may not assign your rights or delegate your obligations under the Agreements to any third party.
The Company may freely assign its rights and delegate its duties under the Agreements to any third party.

6.6 Amendments.
The Company may amend the Agreements from time to time by posting updated Agreements to the Nomorobo Website and/or within the Nomorobo Service.
Your continued use of the Nomorobo Service after the changes have been made will act as your acceptance of the revised Agreements.
If you do not wish to continue to use the Nomorobo Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate the Agreements by following the procedures discussed in Subsections 4.6 or 5.2.

You acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to review the Agreements periodically to maintain awareness of the most current terms of the Agreements.
The Company is never required to alert you as to changes to the Agreements, but the Company may choose to do so by any means reasonable under the circumstances (e.g.
by sending an e-mail or displaying a notice within the Nomorobo Service or on the Nomorobo Website).


6.7 Severability.
If any provision or term of the Agreements is deemed invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the remainder of the Agreements shall remain in full force and effect, except where the construction of the Agreements without the severed provision would materially alter the economic or legal substance of the Agreements in a manner that is materially adverse to the Company, in which case the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify the Agreements so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible.
 To the extent any express or implied restrictions are not permitted by applicable laws, these express or implied restrictions shall remain in force and effect to the maximum extent permitted by such applicable laws.

6.8 Merger.
Other than as stated in this Subsection or as explicitly agreed upon in writing between you and the Company, the Agreements constitute the final and exclusive agreement between you and the Company.
The Agreements supersede all prior negotiations and agreements between you and the Company and there are no other terms or conditions other than those set forth in the Agreements.
However, certain aspects of your use of the Nomorobo Service may be governed by additional agreements (for example, use of a gift card, coupon, or trial account).
In those instances, you may be presented with additional terms that you must agree in order to use those aspects.
If there is any irreconcilable conflict between those additional terms and the Agreements, the additional terms shall prevail.

6.9 Force Majeure.
Any delay in the performance of any duties or obligations of either party will not be considered a breach of the Agreements if such delay is caused by labor dispute, shortage of materials, earthquake, flood, intervening illegality, or other event beyond the control of such party, provided that such party uses reasonable efforts under the circumstances to notify the other party of the circumstances causing the delay and to resume performance as soon as possible.

6.10 Waiver.
All waivers must be in writing and the Company's failure to enforce any provision of the Agreements on one or more occasions will not be deemed a waiver.

6.11 Notice.
You and the Company shall provide only written notices under the Agreements and must use only the acceptable methods and contact information for notice as further discussed below, unless a different method is expressly stated in any Subsection of the Agreements (in which case, that method of delivery is acceptable only for the notice contemplated by the Subsection allowing for that type of notice).




Notice to You. You agree that the Company may provide notice to you in any of the following ways: (1) a notification within the Nomorobo Service or on the Nomorobo Website.
(2) an e-mail sent to an address you provided.
or (3) through other means including text message, phone call, or mail.
Such notice is effective upon dispatch.




 If you are the Primary Account Holder, it is your responsibility to ensure that your e-mail address and other contact information is current and to advise the other users subscribed through your account of all relevant notices.
You shall defend, indemnify, and hold the Company harmless against any claim that notice was not properly received by you or any individual having a phone line subscribed through your account if the notice was not received because you failed to keep your contact information current or because you failed to disclose notice to other users subscribed through your account.



 If you are not the Primary Account Holder, you understand and agree that you shall be deemed to have received notice of any communication sent to the Primary Account Holder in the same manner and effect as if it were sent directly to you.





Notice to the Company. If you need to provide notice to the Company, you shall provide notice by certified mail, return receipt requested.
Any such notice should be sent to the Companyâs contact information as it is listed on the Nomorobo Website at the time you send the notice and such notice is effective upon receipt by the Company.
