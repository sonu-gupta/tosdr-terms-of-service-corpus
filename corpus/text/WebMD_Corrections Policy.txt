 WebMD's Corrections Policy  En espaÃ±ol 
WebMD is committed to making corrections or clarifications to original content when it deems necessary.
We take prompt action to edit even minor errors like spelling, grammar, or stylistic changes.
Because style changes do not change the meaning of the content, those kinds of "style" changes will be updated on our site without notice.
If we identify errors that are material to the content, we will update the content and note those corrections on this page for sixty (60) days after the correction by linking to the corrected version of the original article and note the correction here for your reference.
This corrections policy only applies to WebMD original content, including, but not limited to, news, feature articles, or original medical reference material.
Any corrections to licensed or third party content are the responsibility of the publisher.
If you believe you have found an error in any of our content, let us know by sending an email to our Customer Service team using the "Contact Us" links in the footer section of our Site. Last updated on February 24, 2014 Â© 2014 WebMD, LLC.
