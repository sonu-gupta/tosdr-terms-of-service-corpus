This Statement explains how Huawei processes your personal data, but does not cover all processing scenarios as you will be informed in specific processing activity.
Therefore, before using a specific product or service, it is recommended that you read the privacy notice or supplementary statement released by Huawei for that product or service to understand how it processes your personal data, how you can exercise your data subject rights, and how to contact the data controller.

Huawei may provide you with cloud storage services where you can sync and back up some of your files, pictures and data.

Some Huawei products allow you to communicate and share information with others.
When you use a Huawei product to share things with your family and friends, you may need to create a HUAWEI ID that includes certain information which will be made public, including a nickname and avatar.
Huawei may collect information related to those people, such as their names, email addresses, and phone numbers.
