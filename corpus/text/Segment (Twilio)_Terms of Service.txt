SEGMENT SERVICES.

Segment offers a suite of Services for data integration, data governance and audience management, as further described below and in the Documentation.

1.1.
 Overview.  Segmentâs âConnectionsâ Service acts as a central hub for Customer Data, allowing Customer to collect Customer Data from its selected sources (âSourcesâ), such as its own or third-party websites or properties, and send the Customer Data to Customerâs chosen destinations (âDestinationsâ), such as Customerâs databases or its accounts with third-party applications or services, for Customerâs further use.
The supported Sources and Destinations are identified in the Documentation.
For Sources owned or controlled by Customers (âCustomer Propertiesâ), Customer enables the collection of Customer Data by implementing Segmentâs JavaScript, SDK or other code (âSegment Codeâ) on such Customer Properties.
 As further described below and in the Documentation, Customer maintains control over which Sources and Destinations it uses with the Services, as well as the types and content of Customer Data it shares between its Sources and Destinations.

1.2.
 Additional Services.
If included on an Order Form, Customer may also receive access to additional Segment services that may be used with Connections (e.g.
Personas or Protocols).
The features of any additional services are further described in the applicable Order Form.

&nbsp.
&nbsp.
 Role and Scope of the Processing

By entering into the Agreement, Customer instructs Segment to Process Customer Data to provide the Services and pursuant to any other written instructions given by Customer and acknowledged in writing by Segment as constituting instructions for purposes of this Addendum.
Customer acknowledges and agrees that such instruction authorizes Segment to Process Customer Data (a) to perform its obligations and exercise its rights under the Agreement.

b.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
 For clarity, nothing in this Addendum limits Segment from transmitting Customer Data to and among Sources and Destinations as directed by Customer through the Services.
The parties agree that neither Sources nor Destinations are Subprocessors of Segment and that, between the parties, Customer is solely responsible for the Processing of Customer Personal Data by, and other acts and omissions of, Sources and Destinations or parties associated therewith.
6.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
 Subprocessing

a.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
 Customer specifically authorizes Segment to use its Affiliates as Subprocessors, and generally authorizes Segment to engage Third Party Subprocessors to Process Customer Personal Data.
Segment:
(i) &nbsp.
&nbsp.
 shall enter into a written agreement with each Subprocessor, imposing data protection obligations substantially similar to those set out in this Addendum.
and
(ii) &nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
 remains liable for compliance with the obligations of this Addendum and for any acts or omissions of the Subprocessor that cause Segment to breach any of its obligations under this Addendum. 
b.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
 A list of Segmentâs Subprocessors, including their functions and locations, is available at https://segment.com/docs/legal/subprocessors/ or such other website as Segment may designate (âSubprocessor Pageâ), and may be updated by Segment from time to time in accordance with this Addendum.
c.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
 When any new Third Party Subprocessor is engaged, Segment will notify Customer of the engagement, which notice may be given by updating the Subprocessor Page and via a message through Customerâs Segment Workspace.
Segment will give such notice at least ten (10) calendar days before the new Subprocessor Processes any Customer Personal Data, except that if Segment reasonably believes engaging a new Subprocessor on an expedited basis is necessary to protect the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the Customer Personal Data or avoid material disruption to the Services, Segment will give such notice as soon as reasonably practicable.
If, within five (5) calendar days after such notice, Customer notifies Segment in writing that Customer objects to Segmentâs appointment of a new Third Party Subprocessor based on reasonable data protection concerns, the parties will discuss such concerns in good faith and whether they can be resolved.
If the parties are not able to mutually agree to a resolution of such concerns, Customer, as its sole and exclusive remedy, may terminate the Agreement for convenience.

c.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
 Upon becoming aware of a confirmed Security Incident, Segment shall notify Customer without undue delay unless prohibited by applicable law.
A delay in giving such notice requested by law enforcement and/or in light of Segmentâs legitimate needs to investigate or remediate the matter before providing notice shall not constitute an undue delay.
Such notices will describe, to the extent possible, details of the Security Incident, including steps taken to mitigate the potential risks and steps Segment recommends Customer take to address the Security Incident.
Without prejudice to Segmentâs obligations under this Section 7.c., Customer is solely responsible for complying with Security Incident notification laws applicable to Customer and fulfilling any third party notification obligations related to any Security Incidents.
Segmentâs notification of or response to a Security Incident under this Section 7.c.
will not be construed as an acknowledgement by Segment of any fault or liability with respect to the Security Incident.

&nbsp.
&nbsp.

&nbsp.
the audits described in Clause 5(f) and Clause 12(2) of the Standard Contractual Clauses shall be performed in accordance with Section 2.b.
of this Annex A;

(vii) &nbsp.
&nbsp.
 certification of deletion of Customer Personal Data as described in Clause 12(1) of the Standard Contractual Clauses shall be provided only upon Customerâs request.
