About this document
This document has been originally written in English and is the only version for which Stichting Disroot.org can be held accountable.

Any translation of this Terms of Services is a community effort to make the information accessible in other languages and should be taken as such, with no other value than merely informative.


Accepting these Terms
By using any of the services provided by Disroot.org you agree to be bound by our Terms of Services.
So, you should start reading these terms before first using our platform.
Community Notice

Disroot is a community and our platform a part of the Free Software and Open Source ecosystem.
We all share servers resources, collaborate and use Disroot.org services together.
It is very important that each and everyone of us understands it and feels equally responsible for it.
So, please keep to the following guidelines so we all get along.
Terms of Services




1.
Who can use our services?
Any person who is at least 16 years of age can use the Services.







2.
Space limits on disk

Resources are scarce.
Have in mind that keeping unnecessary files and emails might limit server space, which can lead to less accounts served to others.
Don't litter!








3.
Account expiration
For safety reasons, Disroot.org does not expire unused accounts.
This might be a subject to change if we are forced to save up disk space for other users.
Such changes in our terms will be announced via all communication channels well in advance.We would rather appreciate people taking responsibility for their account and its impact on Disroot resources, and rather delete their account when they decide not to use our services any longer, or purge unused files.







4.
Password
We never keep track of anybody who requests the activation of a Disroot account.
When creating your account, you may either choose security questions and/or adding a secondary email, both of which will allow you to recover your password in case you lose/forget it.


If you don't set a secondary email or forget the question or the answers to the questions, we won't be able to re-send you the data to access your account again.
Remember as well to periodically change your password: you can do it by login into the User Self-Service and clicking the 'Change password' button.



! WARNING ! Lost passwords will lead to un-recoverable cloud file loss.
To protect yourself from it, you can enable password recovery feature in your personal Cloud settings.







5.
SPAM and Viruses
To avoid having our servers included in blacklists:


We do not allow the use of Disroot email accounts to send spam.
Any account caught doing so will be disabled without further notice.

If you happen to receive great amount of SPAM or any suspicious emails please let us know at support@disroot.org so we can investigate it further.








6.
Copyright material
One of the main aims of Disroot is to promote Free Libre and Open Source software and all kind of copyleft content.
Embrace it and support artists and projects that release their work under those licences.

Uploading and (most of all) publicly sharing copyrighted material on Disroot could put other users and Disroot.org in serious legal troubles as well as endanger the whole project and the existence of our servers (and all services connected to it) so just don't do it.

Contributing to the abuse of others by distributing material where the production process created violence or sexual assault against persons or animals.

Impersonating or portraying another person in a confusing or deceptive manner unless the account is clearly classified as a parody.

Doxing: the publication of other people's personal data is not allowed because: (I) we cannot assess either the purposes or what consequences it will have for the exposed people, and (II), it implies too big a legal risk for Disroot.org.Â
