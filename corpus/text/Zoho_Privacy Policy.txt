Global policy
California policy
Summary of our Privacy PolicyThis is a summary of our new privacy policy which takes effect on May 25th, 2018.
It covers every Zoho website that links here, and all of the products and services contained on those websites.
The detailed policy follows the same structure as this summary and constitutes the actual legal document.
Our privacy commitment: Zoho has never sold your information to someone else for advertising, or made money by showing you other people's ads, and we never will.
This has been our approach for almost 20 years, and we remain committed to it.
This policy tells you what information we do collect from you, what we do with it, who can access it, and what you can do about it.Part I â Information Zoho collects and controlsWe only collect the information that we actually need.
Some of that is information that you actively give us when you sign up for an account, register for an event, ask for customer support, or buy something from us.
We store your name and contact information, but we don't store credit card numbers (except with your permission and in one of our secured payment gateways).
When you visit one of our websites or use our software, we automatically log some basic information like how you got to the site, where you navigated within it, and what features and settings you use.
We use this information to improve our websites and services and to drive new product development.
Sometimes we receive information indirectly.
If you ask about our products through one of our referral programs or reselling partners, or sign in to one of our products through an authentication service provider like LinkedIn or Google, they'll pass on your contact information to us.
We'll use that information to complete the request that you made.
If you engage with our brand on social media (for instance, liking, commenting, retweeting, mentioning, or following us), we'll have access to your interactions and profile information.
We'll still have that information even if you later remove it from the social media site.What we do with your informationWe use your information to provide the services you've requested, create and maintain your accounts, and keep an eye out for unauthorized activity on your accounts.
We also use it to communicate with you about the products you're currently using, your customer support requests, new products you may like, chances for you to give us feedback, and policy updates.
We analyze the information we collect to understand user needs and to improve our websites and services.
We're required to have a legal basis for collecting and processing your information.
In most cases, we either have your consent or need the information to provide the service you've requested from us.
When that's not the case, we must demonstrate that we have another legal basis, such as our legitimate business interests.
You can decline certain kinds of information use either by not providing the information in the first place or by opting out later.
You can also disable cookies to prevent your browser from giving us information, but if you do so, certain website features may not work properly.
We completely disable third-party cookies from all Zoho websites and products.
We limit access to your personal information to our employees and contractors who have a legitimate need to use it.
If we share your information with other parties (like developers, service providers, domain registrars, and reselling partners), they must have appropriate security measures and a valid reason for using your information, typically to serve you.
The European Economic Area (EEA) provides certain rights to data subjects (including access, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing, data portability, and the right to object and to complain).
Zoho undertakes to provide you the same rights no matter where you choose to live.
We keep your personal information for as long as it is required for the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy.
When we no longer have a legitimate need to process your information, we will delete, anonymize, or isolate your information, whichever is appropriate.Part II â Information that Zoho processes on your behalfIf you handle other people's data using Zoho apps, such as information about your customers or employees, you are entrusting that data to us for processing.
If you use a Zoho mobile app and give the app access to your contacts and photo library, you are entrusting data to us.
The data you entrust to us for processing is called service data.
You own your service data.
We protect it, limit access to it, and only process it according to your instructions.
You may access it, share it through third-party integrations, and request that we export or delete it.
We hold the data in your account as long as you choose to use Zoho Services.
After you terminate your account, your data will be automatically deleted from our active database within 6 months and from our backups within 3 months after that.
If you are in the European Economic Area and you believe that someone has entrusted your information to us for processing (for instance, your employer or a company whose services you use), you can request certain actions from us regarding your data.
To exercise those data rights, please contact the person or company that entrusted the data to us and we will work with them on your request.Part III â GeneralThere are some limitations to the privacy we can promise you.
We will disclose personal information if it's necessary to comply with a legal obligation, prevent fraud, enforce an agreement, or protect our users' safety.
We do not currently honor Do Not Track signals from internet browsers.
when a universal standard for processing them emerges, we will follow it.
Third-party websites and social media widgets have their own separate privacy policies.
Always check the relevant privacy policy before sharing personal information with third parties.
You can always contact us to: ask questions about our privacy practices, request a GDPR-compliant Data Processing Addendum, alert us if you believe we have collected personal data from a minor, or ask to have your personal information removed from our blogs or forums.
You can also check our Security Policy and Privacy Policy 
We will contact you to let you know if we make any major changes to our privacy policy, or in the highly unlikely event that we ever decide to sell our business.Privacy PolicyThis Privacy Policy statement is made by the Zoho Group consisting of all the entities listed here (collectively, "Zoho", "we", "us" or "our") and is effective as of 25th May 2018.
It applies to all our divisions: Zoho, ManageEngine, Site24x7, and WebNMS.Zohoâs Privacy CommitmentZoho has worried about customer and user privacy for almost 20 years, long before it became fashionable, politically correct, or legally binding to take such a position.
We ask for only the least amount of information necessary, gathering only what we believe is essential for doing business, or for the specific transaction at hand.
We let customers know the information we have on them and allow them to opt out of specific engagements.
But, by far, our biggest commitment is that we do not make a single dollar from advertising revenueânever have, never willâeven from the free editions of our products.
This means we avoid the fundamental conflict of interest between gathering customer information and fueling advertising revenue, and the unavoidable compromises in customer privacy that it brings.
The goal of this policy is to make explicit the information we gather on our customers and users, how we will use it, and how we will not.
This policy is unfortunately longer than we would like, but we must unambiguously address all the relevant cases.
We will try and keep the language simple and direct as much as possible.Scope of this Privacy PolicyThis Privacy Policy applies to all Zoho websites that link to it.
It also applies to the products and services provided by Zoho through these websites, our mobile applications, and applications posted by Zoho on Zohoâs online marketplace and in other third-party online marketplaces.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to any of our websites, products or services that have a separate privacy policy.
This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:Part I â Information Zoho collects and controlsThis part deals with how Zoho collects and uses information about website visitors, potential customers, users of Zoho's products and services, and others who contact Zoho through forms or email addresses published on or linked to our websites.Part II â Information that Zoho processes on your behalfThis part deals with how Zoho handles data that you entrust to Zoho when you use our products and services, or when you share any personal or confidential information with us while requesting customer support.Part III â GeneralThis part deals with topics that are relevant to both Parts I and II, and other general topics such as Zoho's security commitments and how we will inform you when we change this Privacy Policy.Part I â Information Zoho collects and controlsWhat information Zoho collectsWe collect information about you only if we need the information for some legitimate purpose.
Zoho will have information about you only if (a) you have provided the information yourself, (b) Zoho has automatically collected the information, or (c) Zoho has obtained the information from a third party.
Below we describe the various scenarios that fall under each of those three categories and the information collected in each one.

You may also provide us with more information such as your photo, time zone and language, but we donât require that information to sign up for an account.

Information entrusted to Zoho and purpose


Information provided in connection with services : You may entrust information that you or your organization (âyouâ) control, to Zoho in connection with use of our services or for requesting technical support for our products.
This includes information regarding your customers and your employees (if you are a controller) or data that you hold and use on behalf of another person for a specific purpose, such as a customer to whom you provide services (if you are a processor).
The data may either be stored on our servers when you use our services, or transferred or shared to us as part of a request for technical support or other services.

Information from mobile devices : When you elect to allow it, some of our mobile applications have access to the camera, call history, contact information, photo library, and other information stored on your mobile device.
Our applications require such access to provide their services.
Similarly, when you elect to provide access, location-based information is also collected for purposes including, but not limited to, locating nearby contacts or setting location-based reminders.
This information will be exclusively shared with our mapping providers and will be used only for mapping user locations.
You may disable the mobile applications' access to this information at any time by editing the settings on your mobile device.
The data stored on your mobile device and their location information to which the mobile applications have access will be used in the context of the mobile application, and transferred to and associated with your account in the corresponding services (in which case the data will be stored on our servers) or products (in which case the data will remain with you unless you share it with us).
(All the information entrusted to Zoho is collectively termed âservice dataâ)

Ownership and control of your service data

We recognize that you own your service data.
We provide you complete control of your service data by providing you the ability to (i) access your service data, (ii) share your service data through supported third-party integrations, and (iii) request export or deletion of your service data.

How we use service data 

We process your service data when you provide us instructions through the various modules of our services.
For example, when you generate an invoice, information such as the name and address of your customer will be used to generate the invoice.
and when you use our campaign management service for email marketing, the email addresses of the persons on your mailing list will be used for sending the emails.

Push notifications 

If you have enabled notification on our desktop and mobile applications, we will push notifications through a push notification provider such as Apple Push Notification Service, Google Cloud Messaging or Windows Push Notification Services.
You can manage your push notification preferences or deactivate these notifications by turning off notifications in the application or device settings.

Who we share service data with 


Zoho group and third party sub-processors : In order to provide services and technical support for our products, the contracting entity within the Zoho group engages other group entities and third parties .

Employees and independent contractors : We may provide access to your service data to our employees and individuals who are independent contractors of the Zoho group entities involved in providing the services (collectively our âemployeesâ) so that they can (i) identify, analyze and resolve errors, (ii) manually verify emails reported as spam to improve spam detection, or (iii) manually verify scanned images that you submit to us to verify the accuracy of optical character recognition.
We ensure that access by our employees to your service data is restricted to specific individuals, and is logged and audited.
Our employees will also have access to data that you knowingly share with us for technical support or to import data into our products or services.
We communicate our privacy and security guidelines to our employees and strictly enforce privacy safeguards within the Zoho group.

Collaborators and other users : Some of our products or services allow you to collaborate with other users or third parties.
Initiating collaboration may enable other collaborators to view some or all of your profile information.
For example, when you edit a document that you have shared with other persons for collaboration, your name and profile picture will be displayed next to your edits to allow your collaborators to know that you made those edits.

Third-party integrations you have enabled : Most of our products and services support integrations with third-party products and services.
If you choose to enable any third-party integrations, you may be allowing the third party to access your service information and personal information about you.
We encourage you to review the privacy practices of the third-party services and products before you enable integrations with them.

Other cases : Other scenarios in which we may share information that are common to information covered under Parts I and II are described in Part III.

Retention of information 

We hold the data in your account as long as you choose to use Zoho Services.
Once you terminate your Zoho user account, your data will eventually get deleted from active database during the next clean-up that occurs once in 6 months.
The data deleted from active database will be deleted from backups after 3 months.

Data subject requests

If you are from the European Economic Area and you believe that we store, use or process your information on behalf of one of our customers, please contact the customer if you would like to access, rectify, erase, restrict or object to processing, or export your personal data.
We will extend our support to our customer in responding to your request within a reasonable timeframe.Part III â GeneralChildrenâs personal informationOur products and services are not directed to individuals under 16.
Zoho does not knowingly collect personal information from children who are under 16 years of age.
If we become aware that a child under 16 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information.
If you believe that a child under 16 years has provided personal information to us, please write to privacy@zohocorp.com with the details, and we will take the necessary steps to delete the information we hold about that child.How secure is your informationAt Zoho, we take data security very seriously.
That's why we have gotten certified for industry standards such as ISO27001:2013 and SOC 2 Type II.
