Information We Collect and How We Use It
Legal basis for processing personal data
Our legal basis for collecting and using personal data will depend on the personal data in question and the specific context in which we collect it.
We will generally collect personal data from you only in order to perform a contract with you.
We may collect and process your personal data if it is in our legitimate interests to do so, except where such interests are overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms which require protection of personal data.
If we process your personal data in connection with our (or third partiesâ) legitimate interests other than as described in this Privacy Policy, we will disclose to you such legitimate reasons.
Where the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no legal basis for such processing, we will generally obtain your consent.
In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal data from you or may otherwise need the personal data to protect your vital interests or those of third parties.
PLEASE NOTE -&nbsp.
Cyren will not sell, rent, loan or otherwise share any of the personal data that we collect from you with third parties for commercial gain without your express prior consent.
Moreover, if in the future we decide to change our policies and carry out any of the foregoing, we will be sure to comply with all applicable laws and regulations governing such activities (e.g., the California Consumer Privacy Act, the General Data Protection Regulations, etc.).
At that point, you will have the right to request that your personal information not be sold, rented or loaned to third parties.
Information You Provide to Us
When you use our Websites or Services, or you otherwise communicate with us, we may ask you to provide certain personal data voluntarily, including but not limited to your name or company name, company position, postal address, phone numbers, email address, etc.
Although you may generally use our Websites without providing us with any personal information, there are certain applications and features available on our Websites which you may desire to use and gain access to and which will require you to voluntarily share with us your personal information.
Such applications and features may include (but are not limited to): (i) registering to receive marketing materials, white papers and newsletters.
(ii) registering to participate in online web seminars or other sponsored events.
(iii) using interactive features or online tools.
(iv) entering into trials for use of our Services, and/or (v) submitting enquiries to us.
We use this personal information to create and administer your account, send you the requested marketing materials and/or regular marketing communications (subject to applicable consent requirements), provide you with the products and services you request and/or to respond to your enquiries.
The information you submit to Cyrenâs Websites is stored in one or more databases which enable you to return without re-registering as well as for sales and marketing purposes.
Your âlogged-inâ status may be saved in your browser via a cookie (please see below for further explanations).
Either way, the personal information that you submit will be saved by Cyren in order to enable your use of such features.
We also receive certain human resources information from our employees worldwide for the purpose of managing the employment relationship.
We handle this information in accordance with our internal corporate policies which are consistent with this Privacy Policy.
Information we receive from potential candidates (such as CVs) will be used to assess such candidateâs application and may be kept by us (unless requested otherwise by a candidate).
Information We Collect through Automatic Tracking Technologies
When you use our Websites or Services, we may collect certain data automatically from your computers or devices.
The information we collect automatically may include your IP address, device type, operating system details, unique device identification numbers, browser type, browser language and other technical information.
We may also collect data about how your device has interacted with our Websites or Services including data about the pages you view and the links you click.
Like many websites, Cyren uses automatic data collection tools, such as cookies, embedded web links, and web beacons.
âCookiesâ are small data files that are written to and stored on your hard drive when you visit a website.
they do not read files on your hard drive.
We use data and information received from our cookies to improve and customize a userâs experience of our Websites and Services (for example, we may provide features or advertisements that match your interests and preferences).
We also use such data for marketing research purposes, to improve the Websiteâs content and structure, to potentially revise or restructure our sites for easier and more intuitive movement throughout.
We may also use the information to evaluate our Websiteâs technical capacity in order to improve it.
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can modify your browser setting to decline cookies by visiting the Help portion of your browser's toolbar.
Our Websites allow the user to be notified upon the proposed installation of cookies and the user can then disable the cookies.
If you disable cookies, you may continue to use our Website, however, some features may not be available (such as offers regarding Services).
Currently, the data and information we collect with cookies is reviewed in an aggregated form, which is not personally identifiable.
We may also correlate the data and information received from cookies with personally identifiable information, to identify specific users and track their website usage.
In such a case, we would treat the combined information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
For more details about the used cookies, please visit our Cookie Policy
We and our service providers may employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a.
Web Beacons/Web Bugs/Pixel Tags), that help better manage content on our site by informing us and our service providers what content is effective.
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a userâs computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
We and our service providers tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customersâ personally identifiable information.
When corresponding with you via HTML capable e-mail (for example by sending you marketing emails), we may use "format sensing" technology, which allows pixel tags to let us know whether you received and opened our e-mail.
This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
If you would like to opt-out and unsubscribe to these emails, please see âChoice and Opt-outâ.

We use the information in order to monitor the performance and effectiveness of the Services, monitor compliance with our terms and conditions and enable compatibility with third party operating systems/products/services.

Cyren also come into contact with end user personal data when such data is collected and received by Cyrenâs enterprise clients and then made available to us through our products and services.
In some cases Cyren may simply be processing this data on behalf of its customers, and in other cases we may need to interact with such data in order to provide management and support in connection with such products and services.
When Cyren receives end user data in this capacity (i.e., as a data processor), Cyren will carry out the instructions of its clients (i.e., the data controllers) in regards to its usage and processing of such data, and will not use such data outside the scope of its processing activities unless required by applicable law.
