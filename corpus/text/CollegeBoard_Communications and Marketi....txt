 Communications and Marketing - Notice of Your California Privacy Rights We send you two types of emails: transactional emails and optional commercial marketing emails.

Transactional emails relate directly to your participation in a College Board product or service, or an action you took on our site, for example, confirmation of an online store purchase, an SAT admission ticket, and username and password reminders.
Optional commercial marketing emails and texts tell users about College Board products, services, newsletters, alerts, events, and surveys.
When you create a College Board account, youâre given the option to receive marketing communications from us.
Users can opt in to get these emails or texts and can change their communication preferences at any time.
Your contact information and high school location are used to communicate with you.
