The indemnified party may participate in a claim with its own counsel at its own expense.

15.4.    Mitigation and Exceptions.

Each party may seek appropriate equitable relief, in addition to other available remedies, for breach or threatened breach of this Section 16.

17.  Required Disclosures.
Nothing in this Agreement prohibits either party from making disclosures, including of Customer Data and other Confidential Information, if required by Law, subpoena or court order, provided (if permitted by Law) it notifies the other party in advance and cooperates in any effort to obtain confidential treatment.
18. Trials and Betas.
If Customer receives access to the Service or Service features on a free or trial basis or as an alpha, beta or early access offering (âTrials and Betasâ), use is permitted only for Customerâs internal evaluation during the period designated by Moovweb (or if not designated, 30 days).

20.  Modifications to Agreement.
Moovweb may modify this Agreement (which may include changes to Service pricing and plans) from time to time by giving notice to Customer by email or through the Service.
Unless a shorter period is specified by Moovweb (e.g., due to changes in the law or exigent circumstances), modifications become effective upon renewal of Customerâs current Subscription Term or entry into a new Order.
If Moovweb specifies that the modifications to this Agreement will take effect prior to Customerâs next renewal or Order and Customer notifies Moovweb of its objection to the modifications within 30 days after the date of such notice, Moovweb (at its option and as Customerâs exclusive remedy) will either: (a) permit Customer to continue under the existing version of this Agreement until expiration of the then-current Subscription Term (after which time the modified Agreement will go into effect) or (b) allow Customer to terminate this Agreement and receive a refund of any pre-paid fees allocable to the terminated portion of the applicable Subscription Term.
Customer may be required to click to accept or otherwise agree to the modified Agreement in order to continue using the Service, and, in any event, continued use of the Service after the updated version of this Agreement goes into effect will constitute Customerâs acceptance of such updated version.
