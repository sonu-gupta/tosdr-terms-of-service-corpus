 User rightsRight of withdrawal
Unless exceptions apply, the User may be eligible to withdraw from the contract within the period specified below (generally 14 days), for any reason and without justification.
Users can learn more about the withdrawal conditions within this section.
Who the right of withdrawal applies to
The right of withdrawal is a right designed for European Consumers in the case of distance contracts (because the User is not able to see or try the Products before closing the contract).
Withdrawal from the contract terminates the obligation of the contracting parties to perform the contract.
On AdTranquility the right of withdrawal applies to all Users.
Unless any exception mentioned below applies, if any, Users have a right to withdraw from the contract within the specified period applicable to their case, for any reason and without justification.
Exercising the right of withdrawal
To exercise their right of withdrawal, Users must send to the Owner an unequivocal statement of their intention to withdraw from the contract.
To this end, Users may use the model withdrawal form available from within the âdefinitionsâ section of this document.
Users are, however, free to express their intention to withdraw from the contract by making an unequivocal statement in any other suitable way.
In order to meet the deadline within which they can exercise such right, Users must send the withdrawal notice before the withdrawal period expires.
When does the withdrawal period expire?


Regarding the purchase of a service, the withdrawal period expires 14 days after the day that the contract is entered into, unless the User has waived the withdrawal right.
 Effects of withdrawal
Users who correctly withdraw from a contract will be reimbursed by the Owner for all payments made to the Owner, including, if any, those covering the costs of delivery.
However, any additional costs resulting from the choice of a particular delivery method other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by the Owner, will not be reimbursed.
Such reimbursement shall be made without undue delay and, in any event, no later than 14 days from the day on which the Owner is informed of the Userâs decision to withdraw from the contract.
Unless otherwise agreed with the User, reimbursements will be made using the same means of payment as used to process the initial transaction.
In any event, the User shall not incur any costs or fees as a result of such reimbursement.
â¦on the purchase of services
Where a User exercises the right of withdrawal after having requested that the service be performed before the withdrawal period expires, the User shall pay to the Owner an amount which is in proportion to the part of service provided.
Such payment shall be calculated based on the fee contractually agreed upon, and be proportional to the part of service provided until the time the User withdraws, compared with the full coverage of the contract. GuaranteesMoney-back-guarantee
Without prejudice to any applicable statutory rights, the Owner grants Users the right to cancel a purchase they are unsatisfied with and obtain a refund.
The terms and conditions applicable to such offer can be found in the dedicated section of AdTranquility. Liability and indemnificationUS UsersDisclaimer of Warranties
