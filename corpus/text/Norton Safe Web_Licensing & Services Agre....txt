Our Liability. If we fail to provide the Services (or perform any other obligation) as set out in this LSA or as required by the law, we are responsible for loss or damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of our failure or negligence.
Loss or damage is foreseeable if you and us were both aware at the time we entered into this LSA that the losses or damages would be a likely result of us failing to perform our obligations.

We are not responsible for:
losses or damages that are not foreseeable, beyond our control and which we cannot avoid through appropriate actions;
losses or damages that are not caused by breach of our obligations set out in this LSA or at law;
losses or damages that are caused by your breach of this LSA.
or
economic or intangible losses resulting from the performance of this LSA.

Nothing in this LSA limits or excludes our liability for: (a) death or personal injury caused by our negligence.
(b) fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.
(c) wilful misconduct or gross negligence.
or (d) any matter in respect of which it would be unlawful for us to limit or exclude our liability.



Proprietary Rights. As between NortonLifeLock and you, NortonLifeLock owns and retains all right, title and interest in and to the Services (including the Software), including all Intellectual Property Rights.

Export Restrictions. You acknowledge the Services and related technical data (collectively "Controlled Technology") may be subject to the import and export laws of the United States, specifically the U.S.
Export Administration Regulations (EAR), and the laws of any country where Controlled Technology is imported or re-exported.
You agree to comply with all relevant export control laws, including U.S.
trade embargoes and sanctions and security requirements, and applicable country or local laws to the extent compatible with U.S.
laws and will not export, re-export, import or otherwise make available any Controlled Technology in contravention to U.S.
law nor to any prohibited country, entity, or person for which an export license or other governmental approval is required, directly or indirectly.
Use or facilitation of NortonLifeLock Software in connection with any activity including, but not limited to, the design, development, fabrication, training, or testing of chemical, biological, or nuclear materials, or missiles, drones, or space launch vehicles capable of delivering of massive destruction is prohibited, in accordance with U.S.
law.

Privacy. Your privacy is important to us.
The NortonLifeLock Global Privacy Statement describes how we collect, use and process the data from you and your devices when you are using and accessing our Services.

Termination. We may terminate your access to and use of the Services if you breach any of the material terms of this LSA.
Upon termination, you must stop using the Services and destroy all copies of the Software and Documentation.
Your and our statutory right to terminate for cause remains unaffected.

Suspension. Without limiting the foregoing, we may suspend your account or your access to and use of the Services if we reasonably suspect that you have not complied with any of the provisions of this LSA, with notice as reasonably required.

Governing Law.
Competent Jurisdiction. The LSA is governed by the laws of the country you live in, and you can file legal disputes in the courts of that country.

Disputes. Most disagreements can be resolved informally and efficiently by contacting NortonLifeLock Member Services and Support.
If you live in the European Union (which excludes the United Kingdom), Iceland, Liechtenstein or Norway, and would like an independent body to resolve our dispute without you having to go to court or to consumer arbitration board, you can lodge the dispute with the European Commission Online Dispute Resolution website http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/.
Please note that if you do lodge a dispute with the European Commission Online Dispute Resolution website (or any other consumer arbitration service), we may decline to participate in the arbitration as we are not required by law, the rules of any trade association or by these terms to participate in a consumer arbitration.

Changes to the LSA.
We may change the terms of this LSA, or any term of your contract with us, for one or more of the following reasons:

a.
to reflect changes in technology;
b.
to reflect changes in the nature of cyberthreats;
c.
to comply with the law and reflect changes in the law;
d.
to comply with requirements imposed by a regulatory body;
e.
to add additional functionality;
f.
to correct any error;
g.
to harmonize the services or terms across multiple jurisdictions;
h.
to make the terms clearer.
and
i.
for any other valid reason.

If we make material changes to the LSA which may be significantly detrimental to you, we will give you fourteen (14) days notice and provide you with the right to terminate your contract and receive a pro rate refund for the remainder of your Service term.
To exercise this right you must inform us of your wish to terminate the contract within fourteen (14) days of us notifying you of the change and your right to terminate.
If you exercise this right, the LSA will terminate.

We may make changes which are immaterial or to your advantage immediately and without notice.

Severability. If a court of competent jurisdiction decides than any part of this LSA is invalid or unenforceable, the rest of the LSA shall still apply and remain fully enforceable.

General. Our failure to enforce any terms of the LSA is not a waiver of such term or right.
Any waiver of our rights must be in writing, signed by NortonLifeLock, and any such waiver shall not operate as a waiver of any future breach.
Except as expressly set forth in this LSA, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under this LSA shall not affect its other remedies under this LSA or otherwise.
Any notices or other communications provided by NortonLifeLock under this LSA will be given: (i) via email.
or (ii) by posting online.
or (iii) by posting to the Services.
This LSA is solely and exclusively between you and NortonLifeLock and you acknowledge and agree that (i) no third party, including a third-party channel partner of NortonLifeLock or any of its affiliates is a party to this LSA, and (ii) no third party, including any third-party channel partner of NortonLifeLock or any of its affiliates has any obligations or duties to you under this LSA.
Nothing in this LSA will diminish any rights you may have under existing consumer protection legislation or other applicable laws in your jurisdiction that may not be waived by contract.
