Introduction
HEAnet is Irelandâs National Education and Research Network.
We connect education and research organisations throughout Ireland and provide a number of ICT related services.

Your privacy is important to us and we will always treat your personal data with care.
This policy aims to inform you of the personal information that we collect what we use it for and what your rights are in relation to the information.
Information that we collect

This enables features that are required for our services to operate, such as registration and verification.
Where you provide us with your phone number, you agree to receive contact such as calls or text messages.
We may use your number to provide you with notifications and information relating to our services.
You may unsubscribe from receipt of notifications by following the instructions contained in the notification itself or sending an email to noc@heanet.ie.

Additional Information: You may choose to provide us with information while accessing our services.

Cookies: A cookie is a small data file that we can transfer to your device.
We use cookies to collect website usage data, to improve and understand how you interact with our services and to monitor traffic across our services.
For example, when you use HEAnet Store, cookies help us to improve our service by reducing the number of times the same message is displayed to you.
