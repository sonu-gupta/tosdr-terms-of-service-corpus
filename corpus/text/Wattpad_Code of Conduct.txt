Code of ConductLast Revised: November 15th, 2019At Wattpad, we set stories free with the goal of creating a safe and comfortable space for everyone to discover and create.
In order to create an inclusive and respectful space, we want to ensure our Wattpadders know what type of content they will discover as well as content they can or cannot post!
Before you take off on your writing journey, please take a peek at the following:


When you create your username, make sure it's not hateful or explicit in nature.


Itâs important to respect and protect fellow Wattpadderâs feelings, property, and personal information.


You shouldnât post anything you might regret in the future or that your peers, family, or mentors might not want to see online.


You should read our Content Guidelines, Code of Conduct, Terms of Service, and our Privacy Policy so you have all the information you need to enjoy Wattpad and help others enjoy it too!


If you come across any content that violates our guidelines, let us know by reporting it.
See here for how to do that.
For more information on staying safe on Wattpad, check out the Wattpad Safety Portal.

Feedback (Don't hate- communicate!)Constructive comments are welcomed, as long as they are given in a respectful manner.
You may read content that you don't like or agree with, but we are a platform that celebrates diversity, encourages expression, and fosters a safe and creative environment.Back to topBack to topRespecting Others (We are the world)Wattpad is a global community with different opinions and values.
That means that everybody needs to be respectful and polite to other users on the platform.
It's important to be patient and try to imagine things from others' points of view.
We also recommend apologizing if you've made a mistake.
If you're unable to resolve an issue yourself, or with the help of the Mute function, please report any abusive or inappropriate behaviour here.
For more information on respecting others, please see here.Back to topBack to topSharing Personal Information (Privacy Matters)Behaviour that puts a user at personal risk, or revealing personal identifying information about someone else, such as sharing an image without consent, their name, address, email address, phone number or private Wattpad messages is not allowed.
For more information on sharing personal information, please see here.Back to topBack to topRatings &amp.
Tags (What's the deal with Ratings and Tags?)Wattpad encourages writers to rate and tag their own stories appropriately according to our Content Guidelines.
Appropriately rated and tagged stories will allow the correct audience to discover your story.
If your story is not rated Mature but should be, Wattpad may make this change to reflect our Content Guidelines.Back to topBack to topCopyright Infringement (Don't Copy...write)Our writers invest a lot of time and energy into creating their own original stories for our community to enjoy.
Please respect your fellow writers and don't post content that you haven't lovingly crafted yourself.

Vote trading consists of exchanging votes or using votes as a prize for mutual gain.

Please do not pose as Wattpad Staff, Ambassadors, Stars or others.
Wattpad staff and Ambassador have verified badges on their profile.
For more information on badges and what they mean, please see Badges and Profile Symbols.Back to topBack to topPositive Language (Hold hands, not grudges)Users have the right to determine their level of engagement, as long as they arenât abusing, harassing, or discriminating against an individual.
Say what you really love doing, rather than what you don't accept.
For example: I love making Romance Covers rather than I won't make FanFic covers. Everyone should feel comfortable interacting with each other on Wattpad, so please remember to treat and talk to people the way youâd like to be treated and talked to.
Remember that even if you don't intend it, your words can be hurtful, discriminatory, or even hateful and a breach our Code of Conduct.
