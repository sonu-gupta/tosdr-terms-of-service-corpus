Welcome to Dare Drop!This page explains our terms of service.
When you use Dare Drop, youâre agreeing to all the rules on this page.
Weâve done our best to offer you clear and simple explanations of what everything means with brief summaries before each Section.
The summaries are not part of the official legal terms.
Welcome to Dare Drop.
By using this website (the âSiteâ) and services (together with the Site, the âServicesâ) offered by Dare Drop (together with its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, representatives, consultants, employees, officers, and directors â collectively, âDare Drop,â âwe,â or âusâ), and used by companies marketing their products and services (âBrandsâ), youâre agreeing to these legally binding rules (the âTermsâ).
Youâre also agreeing to our Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, and Copyright Policy.
and agreeing to follow any other rules on the Site, like our Rules of Use.
We may change these terms from time to time.
If we do, weâll let you know about any material changes, either by notifying you on the Site or by sending you an email.
New versions of the terms will never apply retroactively and weâll tell you the exact date they go into effect.
If you keep using Dare Drop after a change, that means you accept the new terms.
Dare Drop is for your personal, non-commercial use, except as explained in Section 4 and Section 5 below.2.

If youâre between 13 and 18 (or the legal age of majority for your jurisdiction), you may only use Dare Drop under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to these Terms.
Youâre responsible for your account and all the activity on it.
You can browse Dare Drop without registering for an account.
But to use some of Dare Dropâs functions, youâll need to register.
When you do that, the information you give us has to be accurate and complete.
Donât choose names that are offensive or that violate anyoneâs rights, and donât impersonate anyone.
If you donât follow these rules, we may cancel your account.
Youâre responsible for all the activity on your account, and for keeping your password confidential.
If you find out that someone has used your account without your permission, report it to support@DareDrop.com.

If necessary, we may ask you for proof of your age.3.
Donât Do These ThingsThis Section is a List of things you know you shouldnât do: lie, break laws, abuse people, steal data, hack other peopleâs computers, and so on.
Please behave yourself.
Many people use Dare Drop.
We expect all of them to help keep this a nice place.
Donât do any of these things on the Site:


Donât break the law. Donât take any action that infringes or violates other peopleâs rights, violates the law, or breaches any contract or legal duty you have toward anyone

Donât spam. Donât distribute unsolicited or unauthorized advertising or promotional material, or any junk mail, spam, or chain letters.
Donât run mail TermLists, TermListservs, or any kind of auto-responder or spam on or through the Site.

Donât lie to people. Donât post information you know is false, misleading, or inaccurate.
Donât do anything deceptive or fraudulent.

Donât solicit use of prohibited items of activities.

 Donât harm anyoneâs computer.
Donât distribute software viruses, or anything else (code, films, programs) designed to interfere with the proper function of any software, hardware, or equipment on the Site (whether it belongs to Dare Drop or another party).

We also need to make sure that the Site is secure and functions properly.

How Dares WorkMost of our Terms of Service explain your relationship with Dare Drop.
This section is different â it explains the relationship between creators and backers of Dare Drop Dares, and whoâs responsible for what.
This is what youâre agreeing to when you create, fund, or deliver results for a Dare Drop Dare.
Dare Drop provides a funding platform for creative Dares.
When a creator fulfills a Dare on Dare Drop or a funder backs a Dare on Dare Drop, theyâre inviting other people to form a contract with them.
Anyone who delivers the result for a Dare is accepting the creatorâs and funderâs offer, and forming that contract
Dare Drop is not a part of this contract â the contract is a direct legal agreement between creators and backers.
Here are the terms that govern that agreement:
When a Dare is successfully completed, the funders must pay their pledged amounts to the deliverer.
Once a funder has done so, theyâve satisfied their obligation to the other funders and the deliverer.
Throughout the process, deliverers owe their funders a high standard of effort, honest communication, and a dedication to bringing the Dare to life.
At the same time, funders must understand that when they fund a Dare, theyâre helping to create something.
There may be changes or delays, and thereâs a chance something could happen that prevents a deliverer from being able to finish the Dare as requested.
The deliverers are each solely responsible for fulfilling the promises made in their claimed Dare.
If theyâre unable to satisfy the terms of this agreement, they may be subject to legal action by the funders.5.
How Funding WorksThis section goes over the details of funding and creating Dares.
This is how money gets collected, and the details on how and when pledges can be changed or canceled.
These are the terms that apply when youâre funding or creating a Dare:

Youâre only charged if the Dare is completed.
Youâll provide your payment information when you pledge, but you wonât be charged.
Your payment will only be collected if, at the time of the Dareâs funding deadline, the Dare has been completed.
The exact amount you pledged is the amount Dare Drop will collect.
If the Dare hasnât been completed, you wonât be charged, and no money will change hands.
In some cases weâll reserve the charge on your card.
Dare Drop and its payment partners may authorize or reserve a charge on your credit card (or whatever payment method you use) for any amount up to the full pledge, at any time between the pledge and the collection of funds.
You can increase, decrease, or cancel your pledge at any time during the Dare, with one exception.
During the last 24 hours before the Dare is completed, you canât decrease or cancel your pledge without contacting customer support first â if the deliverer has already created the video or is in the process of streaming the video which will be used to deliver on the Dare, then you may not cancel or decrease your pledge.
Dare Drop doesnât offer refunds.
Responsibility for finishing a Dare lies entirely with the Dare deliverer.
Dare Drop doesnât hold funds on deliverersâ behalf, cannot guarantee deliverersâ work, and does not offer refunds.

These are the terms that apply when youâre delivering a Dare:


Weâll charge our fees before putting funds in your account.
Dare Drop and its payment partners will subtract fees before transmitting the proceeds of a Dare.

Some pledges canât be collected, which might reduce the amount of funding you get.
Because some payments canât be collected â for instance, when a backerâs credit card expires before funding ends, and they donât provide updated information â we canât guarantee that the amount of funding you receive will be exactly equal to the full amount pledged minus fees.

Weâll help resolve payment-card disputes.
If a backer of your Dare disputes the charge with their card issuer, weâll handle re-presenting the charge to settle the dispute with the card issuer.
Youâll be notified that a dispute has been filed, and youâll be able to provide evidence to help us resolve it in your favor.
If the cardholderâs dispute is found valid, you authorize us to charge the credit card number you provided when you completed the Dare for the amount of the chargeback.

Donât count your chickens before they hatch.
Donât assume youâll be able to deliver on a Dare when you want.
there could be a reason weâre not able to accept it, or a problem that takes time to resolve.
Donât assume youâll be able to immediately collect your funding.
there may be a delay between the end of a successful Dare and your access to the funds.
And donât take any actions in reliance on collecting any of the money pledged until you actually have the ability to withdraw it from your account and spend it.
