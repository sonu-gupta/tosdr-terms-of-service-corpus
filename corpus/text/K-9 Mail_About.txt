Â© 2021 K9-Mail About History K-9 Mail is an open source email client for Android with many advanced features.
K-9 Mail was born when Jesse Vincent created a simple patch to the Email app included in Android 1.0.
Back then the creators of the Android OS hadnât yet figured out how to handle community contributions.
So he built his own version of the Email app and shared it with the world.
In some incarnations, Doctor Who had a robotic dog named âK-9â.
The dog was, in effect, an android mutt.
When Jesse first created K-9, his goal was to create an Android mail client as good as the UNIX mail client mutt.
The name was a natural fit. License K-9 Mail is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
