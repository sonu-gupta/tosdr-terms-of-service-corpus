 Privacy Policy 
 Privacy Policy 
Updated September 2021

 
Feeding America strongly believes in protecting the integrity and privacy of personal information gathered from our supporters and others through all our communication channels and from visitors to our website.
The protection of your privacy is of great importance to us.
We have created this privacy policy to communicate our practices regarding the collection and dissemination of personal information that is provided to us and that can be linked to a specific individual, such as a name, postal address, telephone number(s), email address, among other information (hereinafter âPersonal Informationâ), as well as certain non-personally identifiable information collected when you visit many of our web pages such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Internet Explorer or Firefox), the type of operating system you are using (e.g., Windows XP or Mac OS), the domain name of your internet service provider (e.g., AT&T or Verizon), aggregate data about the number of visits to the site and/or aggregate data about the pages visited (hereinafter âAggregate Dataâ).
This policy also applies when you use social media that overlaps Feeding Americaâs social media and/or website, as well as to personal information we collect offline.
 This policy does not apply to information or data Feeding America purchases from other sources.
 Feeding America uses its best efforts to not share information it collects from those persons it provides services to (commonly referred to as âclientsâ).
