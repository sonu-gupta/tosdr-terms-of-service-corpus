AN EXPLANATION OF THE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES WE USE ON THE SERVICES


Like many companies, we use tracking technologies on our Services.&nbsp.
Below are some examples of the types of tracking technologies that may be used, depending on how you access and interact with the Services.

Web browser cookies

A cookie is a data file placed on a computer when it is used to visit the Services.&nbsp.
Cookies generally contain information that is associated with your web browser, information such as website preferences, login information, or a user ID.
 This information enables online services to recognize you as you interact with or revisit the service.

âFirst party cookiesâ are cookies that are set by the domain that you are visiting.
When you visit websites in the Discovery network of sites, we serve cookies set in the domains of the sites you are visiting and in Discovery domains.
âThird party cookiesâ are cookies served by our advertising partners, advertising networks, and analytics providers when you interact with the sites.
âSession cookiesâ are stored for the duration of your visit.
âPersistent cookiesâ continue to be stored after you leave the Services, and may be kept for weeks, or even years.
Some of the cookies we use may be âflashâ cookies.&nbsp.
A flash cookie is a data file placed on a computer via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your computer.&nbsp.
These cookies may not be deleted when your cookies are deleted or disabled through standard browser settings.&nbsp.
Please see the âChoicesâ section below for information about deleting or disabling flash cookies.

Tracking technologies




 

The Services may contain web beacons/GIFs, pixels, page tags, embedded scripts and other tracking technologies.&nbsp.
These technologies consist of small transparent image files or other web programming code that record how you interact with the Services. &nbsp.
They are often used in conjunction with web browser cookies or other identifiers associated with your device.

Device Identifiers

We may collect your IP address or another unique identifier for the particular device you use to access the Internet or the Service.

Mobile Advertising Identifiers 

 We and our third-party service providers may receive an advertising identifier that is assigned to your device if you access the Services through a mobile app.

Cross Device Tracking

If you use different devices (such as your home computer, laptop, mobile device, connected television and/or other smart device) to access our Services, we may be able to associate you with each of your devices through deterministic (such as logging in to an account or service on multiple devices) or probabilistic (such as making reasonable inferences based on the collection of non-personal information about the devices you use) fingerprinting technologies.

Precise Location Information

If you access one of our mobile apps, you may be given the option to share information about your precise location with us.
If you agree, we may collect location information that is provided through the GPS functionality on your mobile device.
We use this information to present information and advertising that is of relevance to you based on where you are.

HOW OUR ADVERTISING PARTNERS USE TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES


We permit third parties such as advertising technology companies to serve advertisements for third party products and services.&nbsp.
These companies use cookies and similar technologies to collect information about your interactions with the Services and other websites, mobile applications, and other connected services and use that information to display ads that are more likely to be relevant to you and to understand how users respond to those ads.


YOUR CHOICES (MANAGING COOKIES AND HOW TO OPT-OUT)


In many instances, you have choices about the information you provide and how we use your information.&nbsp.
These choices, and any related consequences, are described in detail below.

Cookies

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but, if you prefer, you can usually modify your browser setting to disable or reject cookies.
If you delete your cookies or if you set your browser to decline cookies, some features of the Services may not work or may not work as designed.&nbsp.
You can also manage the use of Flash technologies, including flash cookies and local storage objects with the Flash management tools available at Adobeâs website.

Targeted Ads on the Services

Many of the third-party advertisers that place tracking tools on our Services and other services are members of programs that offer you the ability to opt out of the use of information about your web browsing behavior for purposes of showing ads that are targeted to your interests.&nbsp.
You can learn more about the choices offered by these companies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative(âNIAâ) and the Digital Advertising Alliance(âDAAâ).
We are committed to complying with the DAAâs self-regulatory compliance principles for online and mobile behavioral advertising.
You can learn more about the choices for mobile behavioral tracking under âMobile Device Trackingâ below.

Please note that opting-out of interest-based advertising by companies that participate in these programs does not mean that you will not receive advertising while using our Services or on other websites or online services, nor will it prevent the receipt of interest-based advertising from third parties that do not participate in these programs.&nbsp.
In addition, opting out may still allow the collection of usage data for certain purposes (e.g., research, analytics and for internal online services operation purposes).
If your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your opt out choices may not, or may no longer, be effective.

NOTICE CONCERNING DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS


Your browser or device may include âDo Not Trackâ functionality.&nbsp.
How browsers communicate the Do Not Track signal is not yet uniform, so a standard technological response has not yet been developed by the policy and technological communities.&nbsp.
For this reason, we do not respond to Do Not Track signals currently.&nbsp.
Our information collection and disclosure practices, and the choices that we provide, will continue to operate as described in this Tracking Technologies Notice and in our Privacy Notice , whether or not a Do Not Track signal is received.
