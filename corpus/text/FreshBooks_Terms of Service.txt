4.
Ownership, Copyright and Trademarks
In these Terms the content available through the Services, including all information, data, logos, marks, designs, graphics, pictures, sound files, other files, and their selection and arrangement, is called âContentâ.
Content provided by Users, whether they are Subscribers, Customers or other Users, is called âUser Contentâ.
For example, data about its Customers and about its timesheet entries that a Subscriber provides to the Services is User Content of that Subscriber, data about its payments that a Customer provides to the Services is User Content of that Customer, and Content that a User enters into the FreshBooks forum or enters as a comment on the FreshBooks blog is User Content of the User.
User Content is that Userâs property.
FreshBooksâ only right to that User Content is the limited licenses to it granted in these Terms.
Those licenses are described in Section 5 and Section 17 of these Terms.
Other than the User Content, the Services, all Content and all software available on or in respect of the Services or used to create and operate the Services (including, without limitation, the Application and the FreshBooks API) is the property of FreshBooks or its licensors, and is protected by Canadian and international copyright laws, and all rights to the Services, such Content and such software are expressly reserved.
All trademarks, registered trademarks, product names and company names or logos mentioned in the Services are the property of their respective owners.
Reference to any products, services, processes or other information, by trade name, trademark, manufacturer, supplier or otherwise does not constitute or imply endorsement, sponsorship or recommendation thereof by FreshBooks.
Your User Content is your responsibility.
We have no responsibility or liability for it, or for any loss or damage your User Content may cause to you or other people.
Although we have no obligation to do so, we have the sole discretion to remove, screen or edit without notice any User Content posted or stored on the Services, and we may do this at any time and for any reason.
You are solely responsible for maintaining copies of and replacing any User Content you post or store on the Services.
If you authorize third parties to access your User Content through the Services, including through the FreshBooks API, you agree that we are permitted to provide to them the User Content, and also agree that we have no responsibility or liability for their use of such User Content.
5.
Your Limited License of Your User Content to FreshBooks
We do not claim any ownership interest in your User Content, but we do need the right to use your User Content to the extent necessary to operate the Site and provide the Services, now and in the future.
For example, if you leave comments on the FreshBooks blog or posts on the FreshBooks forum, we need your license to display that User Content on the Services, and we need the right to sublicense that User Content to our other Users so that they can view that User Content.
If you are a Subscriber and enter timesheet data in relation to a Customer and configure your account to display timesheet data to your Customers, we need your license to that User Content to use it in the operation of the Services, and we need the right to sublicense that User Content to your Customers for that purpose.
Therefore, by posting or distributing User Content to or through the Services, you (a) grant FreshBooks and its affiliates and subsidiaries a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable right to use, display, perform, reproduce, distribute, publish, modify, adapt, translate, and create derivative works from such User Content, in the manner in and for the purposes for which the Services from time to time use such User Content.
(b) represent and warrant that (i) you own and control all of the rights to the User Content that you post or otherwise distribute, or you otherwise have the lawful right to post and distribute that User Content, to or through the Services.
and (ii) the use and posting or other transmission of such User Content does not violate these Terms and will not violate any rights of or cause injury to any person or entity.
If your User Content is intended for the use of other Users (for example, if you issue invoices to Customers or authorize third parties to access your User Content through the FreshBooks API), you also grant us and our affiliates and subsidiaries a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable right to sublicense such User Content to such Users for their use in connection with their use of the Services, as described in these Terms.
These licenses from you are non-exclusive because you have the right to use your User Content elsewhere.
They are royalty-free because we are not required to pay you for the use of your User Content on the Services.
And they are transferable because we need the right to transfer these licenses to any successor operator of the Services.
Our rights to âmodify, adapt, translate, and create derivative works fromâ are necessary because the normal operation of the Services does this to your User Content when it processes it for use in the Services.

FreshBooks may use any technical means to overcome such interference.
FreshBooks may suspend access to the API by you or your API client without notice if FreshBooks reasonably believe that you are in violation of the Terms.

FreshBooks does not warranty anything relating to third party applications which you choose to integrate with your use of the FreshBooks Application and Services.
FreshBooks does not guarantee that integration between your use of the FreshBooks Application and a third party application will be error free or functionally possible.

In some circumstances, we indicate that a third party application is a âTop Pickâ which may mean that the application is one of the more popular applications with Freshbooks Users.
You are responsible for satisfying yourself with the function and security of a third party application you seek to integrate with your use of the FreshBooks Application.
Further, you are responsible for making yourself aware of the terms of service and privacy policy of the third parties whose platforms you seek to integrate with your use of the FreshBooks Application and Services.

Use of Interactive Areas and the Services
The Services may include discussion forums, bulletin boards, review services or other forums in which you or third parties may post reviews or other content, messages, materials or other items on the Services (âInteractive Areasâ).
If FreshBooks provides such Interactive Areas, you are solely responsible for your use of such Interactive Areas and use them at your own risk.
User Content submitted to any public area of the Services will be considered non-confidential.
You agree not to post, upload to, transmit, distribute, store, create or otherwise publish through the Services any of the following:

any message, data, information, text, music, sound, photos, graphics, code or other material that is unlawful, libelous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, indecent, lewd, suggestive, harassing, threatening, invasive of privacy or publicity rights, abusive, inflammatory, fraudulent or otherwise objectionable;
content that would constitute, encourage or provide instructions for a criminal offense, violate the rights of any party, or that would otherwise create liability or violate any local, state, national or international law;
content that may infringe any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other intellectual or proprietary right of any party;
content that impersonates any person or entity or otherwise misrepresents your affiliation with a person or entity;
unsolicited promotions, political campaigning, advertising or solicitations;

9.
Providing a Reliable and Secure Service
We take reliability and security seriously, and put a great deal of effort into ensuring that our service operates all the time, and that it is a secure environment for your data.
We use what we believe to be âbest-of-classâ hosting services and security technologies and services that we believe provide you with a secure and safe environment.
More information about these services and technologies is available on the Site.
For example, to safeguard credit card information, FreshBooks handles all cardholder data (credit card number, cardholder name, expiration date, service code) in a secure manner that is consistent with the PCI DSS requirement.
We use restrictive firewalls to protect stored data and uses 256 bit SSL certificates to encrypt data transferred between you and the Services.
However, no system is perfectly secure or reliable, the Internet is an inherently insecure medium, and the reliability of hosting services, Internet intermediaries, your Internet service provider, and other service providers cannot be assured.
When you use FreshBooks, you accept these risks, and the responsibility for choosing to use a technology that does not provide perfect security or reliability.
In particular, Subscribers who enable auto-billing and choose to store the credit card information of their Customers accept these risks to the security of that credit card information.
When storing credit card information using the FreshBooks recurring profiles module Subscribers acknowledge that they are aware of, and accept as satisfactory, FreshBooksâ credit card protection procedure.
Credit card data is provided by Subscribers and their Customers, and they are responsible for its protection.
Finally, FreshBooks provides the FreshBooks API to facilitate the use of the Services with other services on the Internet.
If a third party is authorized through your FreshBooks account to have access to your User Content through the FreshBooks API, we cannot control and are not responsible or liable for the third partyâs use of your User Content.
10.
No Responsibility for Third-Party Services, Sites or Content
As a service to our users, the Site may contain links to third-party Web sites (âThird-Party Sitesâ) or third-party content (âThird-Party Contentâ) and may provide third-party services (âThird-Party Servicesâ), including payment processors and other payment intermediaries that you may use in connection with your use of the Services.
You use Third-Party Sites, Third-Party Content (together, the âThird Party Materialsâ) or Third-Party Services at your own risk.
FreshBooks makes no claim or representation regarding Third-Party Materials and Third-Party Services, and provides them or links to them only as a convenience.
Inclusion in the Services of Third-Party Materials does not imply FreshBooksâ endorsement, adoption or sponsorship of, or affiliation with, such Third-Party Materials.
FreshBooks accepts no responsibility for reviewing changes or updates to, or the quality, content, policies, nature or reliability of Third-Party Materials, or Web sites linking to the Services.
When you leave the Services, our terms and policies no longer govern, and when you use Third-Party Services their terms and policies apply.
You should review applicable terms and policies, including privacy and data gathering practices, of any Third-Party Materials and Third-Party Services, and should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any transaction with any third party.
Examples of such third providers are given in the Schedule to these Terms entitled âThird Party Providersâ.
The provider of Third-Party Materials and Third-Party Services is solely responsible for such Third-Party Materials and Third-Party Services, the content therein, any warranties to the extent that such warranties have not been disclaimed, any training, support or maintenance for the Third-Party Materials and Third-Party Services, and any claims that you or any other party may have relating to that Third-Party Materials and Third-Party Services or your use of them.
You acknowledge that you are purchasing the license to Third-Party Materials and Third-Party Services from the provider of those Third-Party Materials and Third-Party Services.

FreshBooks is not a party to the license between you and the provider with respect to such Third-Party Materials and Third-Party Services.
and FreshBooks is not responsible for such Third-Party Materials and Third-Party Services, the content therein, or any warranties or claims that you or any other party may have relating to such Third-Party Materials and Third-Party Services or your use of them.
You acknowledge and agree that FreshBooks and its affiliates are third party beneficiaries of the End User License Agreement for such Third-Party Materials and Third-Party Services, and that, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of the license to any such Third-Party Materials and Third-Party Services FreshBooks will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce such license against you as a third party beneficiary thereof.
