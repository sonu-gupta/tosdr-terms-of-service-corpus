         Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) Policy Policy Summary and Scope
This policy addresses the legal and compliance obligations set forth in the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).
The FCPA prohibits bribes to Non-US Public Officials (directly or indirectly) and mandates maintenance of accurate financial records.
While this policy addresses the FCPA specifically, TransUnion and TransUnion employees must comply with all laws, including all anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, of countries or nations in which TransUnion operates.
This policy applies to TransUnion LLC, its domestic and international business units, and its direct and indirect majority-owned domestic and international subsidiaries (each a âTransUnion Companyâ), as well as any officer, director or employee of such TransUnion Company (a âTransUnion Employeeâ).
Prohibited Practices- Anti-Bribery Provisions
TransUnion Employees may not use the mail, telephone, or any other means or instrumentality, such as electronic mail or wire transfer, or do any other act to offer, pay, give, promise to pay, or authorize the payment or giving of Anything of Value to or receive Anything of Value from:

a Non-US Public Official, or a Closely Related Individual of the Non-US Public Official.
or
any person, with knowledge or belief that all or a portion of Anything of Value will be offered or promised, directly or indirectly, to any Non-US Public Official, or a Closely Related Individual of the Non-US Public Official, 

for purposes of:

improperly influencing any act or decision of such Non-US Public Official in his/her official capacity;
inducing such Non-US Public Official to do, or omit to do, any act in violation of his/her lawful duty.
or
improperly inducing such Non-US Public Official to use his/her influence with the government or department, agency or its instrumentality to affect or influence any act of decision of such government or instrumentality, in order to secure an improper advantage to which the company is not entitled (including but not limited to improper influence on a (1) decision to purchase TransUnion products or services at a government institution or commercial business, (2) contract award or (3) grant of operating permits or business licenses).



Facilitation Payments

In some countries, it may be the local business practice to make small payments to low-level Non-US Public Officials to facilitate or expedite a Routine Governmental Action (âFacilitation Paymentsâ).
Because it can be difficult to distinguish between a Facilitation Payment and a bribe, Facilitation Payments are allowed only in extremely limited circumstances and must be reported to and approved in advance by the Chief Executive Officer of the involved TransUnion Company.
The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for consulting with the Chief Legal Officer or the Chief Compliance Officer prior to granting approval.

Exception: If there is an imminent threat to the health or safety of a TransUnion Employee, a Facilitation Payment may be made without prior approval.
Some examples include, but are not limited to:

Being stopped by police, military, or paramilitary personnel, who demand payment as a condition of passage;
Being threatened with imprisonment for a routine traffic or visa violation unless a payment is made.
or
Being asked by security personnel, immigration control, or health inspectors to pay for (or to avoid) an allegedly required inoculation or similar procedure.


All Facilitation Payments must be accurately documented and reported to the Corporate Law Department as soon as possible.
The report should include the amount, recipient, and a specific explanation of the reason for the payment.

Record-Keeping, Accounting and Payment Practices

TransUnion is required to keep books, records and accounts that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect all transactions and dispositions of assets.
TransUnion may not mischaracterize or omit any transaction on its companyâs books or fail to maintain proper accounting controls.
An example of mischaracterization would be categorizing a Facilitation Payment as a consulting fee.
TransUnion is required to keep detailed, accurate descriptions of all payments and expenses that support that the only monies paid to Non-US Public Officials are for Routine Governmental Actions or for approved Facilitation Payments.



Note â Personal funds of a TransUnion Employee may not be used to accomplish what is otherwise prohibited by the FCPA.
