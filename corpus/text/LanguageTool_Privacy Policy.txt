 Legal bases of the processing The processing of personal data requires a legal basis, which we would like to present to you below.
For processing of personal data for which we obtain the consent of the data subject, Article 6(1)(a) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) serves as the legal basis.
When processing personal data that is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, Article 6(1)(b) GDPR serves as the legal basis.
This also includes processing operations that are necessary for the performance of pre-contractual measures.
Insofar as the processing of personal data is necessary for the fulfillment of a legal obligation to which our company is subject, Article 6 (1) lit.
c GDPR serves as the legal basis.
If the processing is necessary to protect a legitimate interest of our company or a third party and the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not override the former interest, Article 6 (1) lit.
f GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing.
The legitimate interest of our company lies in the performance of our business activities as well as in the analysis, optimization and maintenance of the security of our online offer.



 Log files, hosting In the server statistics, data is automatically stored that the browser transmits to us as part of our legitimate interest in analysis and for security reasons (so-called "log files").
In detail, these are the following data:

Language and version of the browser software
Operating system used and its interface
Referrer URL (the previously visited page)
Host name of the accessing computer (IP address)
Date and time of the server request
Time zone difference from Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)	
Content of the request (concrete page)
Data volume transferred
Access status/ HTTP status code.

As a rule, we cannot assign this data to specific persons.
A combination of this data with other data sources is not made.
The data is also deleted within 14 days after a statistical evaluation.
Data whose further retention is required for evidentiary purposes is exempt from deletion until the respective incident has been finally clarified.
We make use of hosting services.
These serve to provide infrastructure and platform services, computing capacity, storage space and database services, security services and technical maintenance services to maintain the operation of this online offer.
In doing so, we or our hosting provider process inventory data, contact data, content data, contract data, usage data, meta data and communication data of customers, interested parties and visitors of this online offer on the basis of our legitimate interests in an efficient and secure provision of this online offer.

 Contractual processing, use of our software

 Software LanguageTool 
 Special privacy policy for the LanguageTool homepage and our add-ons Your texts sent for review via our add-ons are not saved, with the following exceptions:

If you use our online editor at https://languagetool.org/editor or our desktop apps, see section b.)
If you use our "Rephrasing" feature, see section c.)
If you explicitly ignore correction suggestions, we anonymously store the internal ID of this error rule and the text fragment underlined as incorrect and 15 characters to the right and left of it.
This allows us to detect false alarms from our system and avoid them in the future.
If you accept correction suggestions, we anonymously store the internal ID of this error rule (e.g.
EN_A_VS_AN for the rule that finds a/an confusions).
In the very rare case of an internal software error (so-called "exception"), we anonymously store the record that triggered the error so that we can find the cause and correct the error.
These records are stored anonymously for up to 14 days.
To improve the speed of our software, we store checked records and the errors found in them for up to 15 minutes on our servers in the main memory (not on a permanent storage medium).
The storage is done without IP address or other information that would allow the records to be assigned to a person.

To improve the quality and availability of our system, we also store the following information:

Date and time, length of the text, language of the text (but not the checked text itself), duration of processing, number and type of errors detected (e.g.
"capitalization at the beginning of a sentence", "confusion of 'this is an Example' and 'This is an Example'"),
The page from which the request was sent (e.g.
languagetool.org),
Add-on version.
date of installation.
random ID of the text field whose text is checked.
Password fields are ignored by the add-on and are not transmitted to our servers.
Only in the case of a browser add-on uninstallation, the following is transmitted: the number of times the add-on was used and the URL of the page where the add-on was last used.
This allows us to determine which pages do not work correctly with our add-on.
Only if you have an account on languagetool.org and if you are logged into the add-on with that account: The add-on contacts our servers periodically (about once a day) to let us know that you are an active user.
This includes your browser (e.g.
Firefox) and your email address (which we already know because you already have an account on our system).
This allows us to track user activity and improve our software.


 Special data protection information for the LanguageTool editor For our editor at languagetool.org/editor/ and our desktop applications for Windows and Mac, the following applies in addition to the other notices in this privacy statement:
When you use our editor, the texts you edit there are saved so you can access them in the future.
To protect you from accidentally deleting your documents, documents are first moved to the Recycle Bin when they are deleted.
They are not permanently removed from our system until they are also deleted from the Recycle Bin.
The storage takes place on servers in Germany at Amazon Web Services EMEA SARL, Niederlassung Deutschland, Marcel-Breuer-Str.
12, 80807 Munich, Germany.
The legal basis is your consent (Art.
6 para.
1 a) GDPR).
The data will be deleted as soon as you delete your user account.
A user account is required to use the editor so that your texts can be assigned to you.

 Special privacy notices for the "Rephrasing" feature For some languages, our synonym function offers the possibility to generate wording suggestions for your sentence.
Some of these suggestions come from our service provider OpenAI (OpenAI L.L.C., 3180 18th Street, San Francisco, CA 94110, USA).
In order to generate the suggestions, we must send the particular set to OpenAI for processing.
OpenAI reserves the right to store this data.
For details, please see the Terms of Use at: https://openai.com/api/policies/terms/ and the Privacy Policy at: https://openai.com/api/policies/privacy/ of OpenAI.
The legal basis is your consent.

We also anonymously store the set for which you create variations and your selection of our variation.
The legal basis is your consent.

This allows Instagram to associate the visit to our pages with your user account and save it.
If you want to prevent this, you must log out of your Instagram account before clicking on the button.

The Facebook pixel is directly integrated by Facebook when you call up our websites and can save a so-called cookie, i.e.
a small file, on your device.
If you subsequently log in to Facebook or visit Facebook while logged in, your visit to our online offering will be noted in your profile.
The data collected about you is anonymous for us, so it does not offer us any conclusions about the identity of the user.
However, the data is stored and processed by Facebook, so that a connection to the respective user profile is possible and can be used by Facebook and for its own market research and advertising purposes.
If we should transmit data to Facebook for matching purposes, this data is encrypted locally in on the browser and only then sent to Facebook via a secure https connection.
This is done solely for the purpose of creating a comparison with the data encrypted in the same way by Facebook.
Furthermore, when using the Facebook Pixel, we use the additional function "extended matching" (in this case, data such as telephone numbers, email addresses or Facebook IDs of the users) to create target groups ("Custom Audiences" or "Look Alike Audiences") are transmitted to Facebook (encrypted).
Further information on "advanced matching": https://www.facebook.com/business/help/611774685654668.
For more information on the purpose and scope of data collection and the further processing and use of data by Facebook, as well as your rights in this regard and settings options for protecting your privacy, please refer to Facebook's privacy policy at https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/, and specifically for Facebook Custom Audiences at https://www.facebook.com/ads/website_custom_audiences/.

 Data storage outside the EU/EEA As can be seen from the individual tool descriptions above, we use tools from US third-party providers.
Insofar as this is necessary for the notified purposes, it may happen that your IP address is processed in this course outside the European Economic Area, where a level of data protection corresponding to the European standard is not consistently ensured and confirmed (for example, by appropriate guarantee within the meaning of Art.
46 DS-GVO or an adequacy decision of the European Commission).
Therefore, it cannot be ruled out in particular that security authorities in a third country may gain access to your IP address without you being able to take legally effective action against them.
The transfer of the IP address to these third-party providers takes place in accordance with Art.
49 (1) lit.
a GDPR on the basis of your consent expressly given for this purpose in the consent banner.
This consent is voluntary.
You can revoke it at any time with effect for the future.
You will not suffer any disadvantages as a result.
In the opinion of some US third-party providers, a level of protection corresponding to the European standard is already guaranteed due to the conclusion of so-called standard contractual clauses as well as additional measures taken in the sense of the Schrems II case law.
However, since the suitability of such measures to ensure a sufficient level of data protection is disputed, we have decided to transfer your IP address only with your consent.

 Rights of the data subject You have a right to information about the personal data stored by us about you.
According to the legal provisions, you also have the right to correct incorrect data, blocking, data portability and deletion of your personal data.
To do this, send us an e-mail with the subject "Data protection".
You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority if you believe that processing of personal data relating to you is in breach of the law.
If you have given your consent, you have the right to revoke your consent at any time.
This does not affect the lawfulness of the processing carried out on the basis of the consent until the revocation.
You may object to the future processing of your personal data in accordance with the legal requirements at any time.
The objection can be made in particular against the processing for purposes of direct advertising.

 Storage period of the personal data If we have not provided storage information on the specific points, the following applies: We store personal data for the duration of the respective statutory retention period or as long as the purpose of the collection exists.
After expiry of the retention period, the data is routinely deleted, unless it is necessary for the initiation or performance of a contract.
If user data is not deleted because it is required for other and legally permissible purposes, its processing will be restricted as far as possible.
Accordingly, the data will be blocked if possible and not processed for other purposes.
This applies, for example, to user data that must be retained for reasons of commercial or tax law.

 Safety information We make every effort to process your personal data by taking all technical and organizational possibilities to comply with the provisions of data protection laws and thus to protect this data.
Our website or the communication via our website with us is encrypted via HTTPS.
