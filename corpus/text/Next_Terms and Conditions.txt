A contract is not formed at the point in time that payment has been taken from you by Next, nor at the point in time that you receive an email from Next acknowledging receipt of your order.
Until the goods are despatched the order may not be accepted by Next, or may be cancelled by you.
Exceptions apply to orders for personalised items and goods made to your order which cannot be cancelled by you once you have received an email confirmation that your order has been received, as such items and goods may already be in production as a result of your order.

For security reasons, until you have placed an order for goods, received your first statement and a payment has been received for those goods, you will be unable to order gift cards.
For security reasons we may restrict the volumes of certain items to be sold in any one transaction.
Following formation of the contract, Next shall continue to own any goods ordered until it has received payment in full from you, even though the goods may have already been delivered to you.

Damaged or Defective Plants

If you receive a plant that is in bad condition when you take it out of the box, contact us immediately.
We will then ask you to send us a photograph so that there is no doubt as to it's condition on arrival with you, as opposed to what it looks like by the time you return it to us.
Bear in mind that plants look different depending on what time of year it is.
If you choose a nice leafy-looking deciduous shrub in the winter, remember it's going to turn up looking pretty bare.
It doesn't mean there's anything wrong with it, just that it's out of season and will perk up when the weather does.
Perennial plants won't even show above the soil level in a pot during the winter, but that doesn't mean you've been fobbed off with a bunch of soil.
However, provided that you have contacted us within 7 days of receiving the defective plant we will be happy to arrange for a refund or replacement once we have received the pictures and determined the cause of the problem.



One year Guarantee on Plants, shrubs, trees and perennials

Our plants (all fully hardy shrubs, trees and perennials, excluding bulbs, annuals, biennials and short-lived perennials) are all guaranteed for one year after you've bought them.
If the plant fails in the first 12 months, send us a picture of the plant along with your order reference number to plants@next.co.uk.
Once we have determined the cause of the problem we will endeavour to replace it or refund you.
This guarantee does not include any plants damaged due to lack of watering or lack of proper horticultural care.
In particular, plants will not be replaced if the plant care guidelines, sent out with the order, have not been followed.
You will not be charged for delivery on replacement of faulty items.

Registered no 3319862. Recycling We take our role as a responsible retailer very seriously, that is why we are supporting the WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment) Directive from the government and doing our bit to help care for the environment.


What is the WEEE Directive?

The Directive states that as a retailer we are responsible for increasing the amount of WEEE that is recycled in the UK by assisting in the development of dedicated WEEE collection facilities.
The Directive came into effect on 1st July 2007.

What are we doing?

We have contributed to a national fund which will help to develop specific WEEE collection centres to ensure that more WEEE gets recycled.
We offer a collection service on a like for like basis, for example if you buy a microwave we can take away your old one.
All the appliances we collect are then sent to be recycled.

What do you have to do?

If you require this service then we ask that you request this at the point of ordering.
Please ensure that the appliance is disconnected from all electricity, gas or water supply before it is collected.
In addition to this please ensure that any refrigeration products are emptied of all food and fully de-frosted prior to collection.

National Support

The national fund we have contributed to will help local councils develop their WEEE collection facilities further, so you can still recycle your appliances even if you do not opt for our service.

Not all council sites are able to collect all types of WEEE, to find your nearest participating site and for advice on all aspects of recycling at home visit: recycle-more.co.uk
Products which are covered by the WEEE Regulations have a crossed out wheelie bin symbol on either the product itself or its packaging.
This symbol aims to encourage you to identify and dispose of WEEE product separately from other household waste when it reaches the end of its life.
To ensure you donât contribute to damaging the environment, please ask at the time of order for us to take away your old appliance or use recycle-more.co.uk to locate your nearest recycle facility.
Recycle more helpline 08450 682572.
