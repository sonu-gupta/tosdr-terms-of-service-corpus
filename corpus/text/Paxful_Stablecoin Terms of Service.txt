 About Paxful Stablecoin 

 The Paxful Stablecoin service is a referral mechanism that allows you, a qualifying Paxful user, to enter into a peer-to-peer transaction with a pre-selected third party company (the "Stablecoin Counterparty"), chosen by Paxful, for the exchange of your Bitcoin for a USD-equivalent amount of stablecoins, to be held by the Stablecoin Counterparty for your benefit.
Through this model, Paxful Stablecoin allows you to exit your Bitcoin position into the selected stablecoin.


 Referral Mechanism 

 The Paxful Stablecoin service is a limited purpose referral mechanism available on the Paxful platform.
Upon indicating your interest in performing a Paxful Stablecoin transaction, Paxful will refer you to the Stablecoin Counterparty for the consummation of the transaction.
You must then follow the provided prompts in order to submit your offer terms to the Stablecoin Counterparty.
Should the Stablecoin Counterparty accept your offer terms, the transaction will be consummated between you and the Stablecoin Counterparty.
As with the standard transactions conducted on its marketplace, Paxful will have no involvement, control, power, discretion, or authority in the Paxful Stablecoin transactions entered into or attempted between you and the Stablecoin Counterparty.
Paxful shall neither custody any stablecoins nor advise or instruct any Paxful user to obtain such stablecoins.

 The Stablecoin Counterparty may have their own terms and conditions for the Paxful Stablecoin service transactions, and the Paxful Stablecoin service may vary in exchange rate, speed of exchange, and other terms and conditions imposed by the Stablecoin Counterparty (the "Stablecoin Counterparty Terms").
By entering into a transaction with the Stablecoin Counterparty you agree to be bound by the Stablecoin Counterparty Terms.
The Stablecoin Counterparty Terms are valid in all cases except when they contradict or violate the Agreement, these Paxful Stablecoin Terms of Service, are illegal, are unreasonable or otherwise difficult to comply with (as determined in Paxfulâs sole and absolute discretion), or if you and the Stablecoin Counterparty consent to alter the Stablecoin Counterparty Terms.
IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO CAREFULLY READ THE STABLECOIN COUNTERPARTY TERMS AND FOLLOW THEM EXACTLY.
IF YOU DO NOT FOLLOW THE STABLECOIN COUNTERPARTY TERMS, YOUR TRANSACTION MAY BE DENIED.
NEVER ENTER INTO A PAXFUL STABLECOIN SERVICE TRANSACTION UNLESS YOU HAVE FOLLOWED ALL TERMS AND CONDITIONS LISTED. IF YOU FAIL TO FOLLOW THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, PAXFUL MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ASSIST YOU IN A DISPUTE PROCESS TO RECOVER YOUR FUNDS.
