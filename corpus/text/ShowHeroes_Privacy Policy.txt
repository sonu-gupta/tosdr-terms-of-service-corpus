however, if a data subject wants to use special enterprise services via our website, video-player widgets or any of our other products, processing of personal data could become necessary.
If the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no statutory basis for such processing, we generally obtain consent from the data subject.
The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a data subject shall always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to ShowHeroes SE (EuropÃ¤ische Aktiengesellschaft).

As the controller, ShowHeroes SE (EuropÃ¤ische Aktiengesellschaft) has implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed through this website.
However, Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute protection may not be guaranteed.

by telephone. 01 Definitions The data protection declaration of ShowHeroes SE (EuropÃ¤ische Aktiengesellschaft) is based on the terms used by the European legislator for the adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

To ensure this, we would like to first explain the terminology used.
In this data protection declaration, we use, inter alia, the following terms:


A Personal data

F Pseudonymisation

G Controller or controller responsible for the processing
Controller or controller responsible for the processing is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.

Website: www.showheroes.com 03 Cookies The Internet pages of ShowHeroes SE (EuropÃ¤ische Aktiengesellschaft) use cookies.
Cookies are text files that are stored in a computer system via an Internet browser.
Many Internet sites and servers use cookies.
Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID.
A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie.
It consists of a character string through which Internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored.
This allows visited Internet sites and servers to differentiate the individual browser of the dats subject from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies.
A specific Internet browser can be recognized and identified using the unique cookie ID.
Through the use of cookies, ShowHeroes SE (EuropÃ¤ische Aktiengesellschaft) can provide the users of this website with more user-friendly services that would not be possible without the cookie setting.
By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our website can be optimized with the user in mind.
Cookies allow us, as previously mentioned, to recognize our website users.
The purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to utilize our website.
The website user that uses cookies, e.g.
does not have to enter access data each time the website is accessed, because this is taken over by the website, and the cookie is thus stored on the userâs computer system.
Another example is the cookie of a shopping cart in an online shop.
The online store remembers the articles that a customer has placed in the virtual shopping cart via a cookie.
The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our website by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies.
Furthermore, already set cookies may be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or other software programs.
This is possible in all popular Internet browsers.
If the data subject deactivates the setting of cookies in the Internet browser used, not all functions of our website may be entirely usable. 04 Collection of general data and information The website of ShowHeroes SE (EuropÃ¤ische Aktiengesellschaft) collects a series of general data and information when a data subject or automated system calls up the website.
This general data and information are stored in the server log files.
Collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Internet site, (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet service provider of the accessing system, and (8) any other similar data and information that may be used in the event of attacks on our information technology systems.
When using these general data and information, ShowHeroes SE (EuropÃ¤ische Aktiengesellschaft) does not draw any conclusions about the data subject.
Rather, this information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our website correctly, (2) optimize the content of our website as well as its advertisement, (3) ensure the long-term viability of our information technology systems and website technology, and (4) provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal prosecution in case of a cyber-attack.
Therefore, ShowHeroes SE (EuropÃ¤ische Aktiengesellschaft) analyzes anonymously collected data and information statistically, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process.
The anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject. 05 Registration on our website The data subject has the possibility to register on the website of the controller with the indication of personal data.
Which personal data are transmitted to the controller is determined by the respective input mask used for the registration.
The personal data entered by the data subject are collected and stored exclusively for internal use by the controller, and for his own purposes.
The controller may request transfer to one or more processors (e.g.
a parcel service) that also uses personal data for an internal purpose which is attributable to the controller.
By registering on the website of the controller, the IP addressâassigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) and used by the data subjectâdate, and time of the registration are also stored.
The storage of this data takes place against the background that this is the only way to prevent the misuse of our services, and, if necessary, to make it possible to investigate committed offenses.
Insofar, the storage of this data is necessary to secure the controller.
This data is not passed on to third parties unless there is a statutory obligation to pass on the data, or if the transfer serves the aim of criminal prosecution.
The registration of the data subject, with the voluntary indication of personal data, is intended to enable the controller to offer the data subject contents or services that may only be offered to registered users due to the nature of the matter in question.
Registered persons are free to change the personal data specified during the registration at any time, or to have them completely deleted from the data stock of the controller.
The data controller shall, at any time, provide information upon request to each data subject as to what personal data are stored about the data subject.
In addition, the data controller shall correct or erase personal data at the request or indication of the data subject, insofar as there are no statutory storage obligations.
The entirety of the controllerâs employees are available to the data subject in this respect as contact persons. 06 Subscription to our newsletters On the website of ShowHeroes SE (EuropÃ¤ische Aktiengesellschaft), users are given the opportunity to subscribe to our enterpriseâs newsletter.
The input mask used for this purpose determines what personal data are transmitted, as well as when the newsletter is ordered from the controller.
ShowHeroes SE (EuropÃ¤ische Aktiengesellschaft) informs its customers and business partners regularly by means of a newsletter about enterprise offers.
The enterpriseâs newsletter may only be received by the data subject if (1) the data subject has a valid e-mail address and (2) the data subject registers for the newsletter shipping.
A confirmation e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address registered by a data subject for the first time for newsletter shipping, for legal reasons, in the double opt-in procedure.
This confirmation e-mail is used to prove whether the owner of the e-mail address as the data subject is authorized to receive the newsletter.
During the registration for the newsletter, we also store the IP address of the computer system assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) and used by the data subject at the time of the registration, as well as the date and time of the registration.
The collection of this data is necessary in order to understand the (possible) misuse of the e-mail address of a data subject at a later date, and it therefore serves the aim of the legal protection of the controller.
The personal data collected as part of a registration for the newsletter will only be used to send our newsletter.
In addition, subscribers to the newsletter may be informed by e-mail, as long as this is necessary for the operation of the newsletter service or a registration in question, as this could be the case in the event of modifications to the newsletter offer, or in the event of a change in technical circumstances.
There will be no transfer of personal data collected by the newsletter service to third parties.
The subscription to our newsletter may be terminated by the data subject at any time.
The consent to the storage of personal data, which the data subject has given for shipping the newsletter, may be revoked at any time.
For the purpose of revocation of consent, a corresponding link is found in each newsletter.
It is also possible to unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time directly on the website of the controller, or to communicate this to the controller in a different way. 07 Newsletter-Tracking The newsletter of ShowHeroes SE (EuropÃ¤ische Aktiengesellschaft) contains so-called tracking pixels.
A tracking pixel is a miniature graphic embedded in such e-mails, which are sent in HTML format to enable log file recording and analysis.
This allows a statistical analysis of the success or failure of online marketing campaigns.
Based on the embedded tracking pixel, ShowHeroes SE (EuropÃ¤ische Aktiengesellschaft) may see if and when an e-mail was opened by a data subject, and which links in the e-mail were called up by data subjects.
Such personal data collected in the tracking pixels contained in the newsletters are stored and analyzed by the controller in order to optimize the shipping of the newsletter, as well as to adapt the content of future newsletters even better to the interests of the data subject.
These personal data will not be passed on to third parties.
Data subjects are at any time entitled to revoke the respective separate declaration of consent issued by means of the double-opt-in procedure.
After a revocation, these personal data will be deleted by the controller.
ShowHeroes SE (EuropÃ¤ische Aktiengesellschaft) automatically regards a withdrawal from the receipt of the newsletter as a revocation. 08 Contact possibility via the website The website of ShowHeroes SE (EuropÃ¤ische Aktiengesellschaft) contains information that enables a quick electronic contact to our enterprise, as well as direct communication with us, which also includes a general address of the so-called electronic mail (e-mail address).
If a data subject contacts the controller by e-mail or via a contact form, the personal data transmitted by the data subject are automatically stored.
Such personal data transmitted on a voluntary basis by a data subject to the data controller are stored for the purpose of processing or contacting the data subject.
There is no transfer of this personal data to third parties. 09 Routine erasure and blocking of personal data The data controller shall process and store the personal data of the data subject only for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of storage, or as far as this is granted by the European legislator or other legislators in laws or regulations to which the controller is subject to.
If the storage purpose is not applicable, or if a storage period prescribed by the European legislator or another competent legislator expires, the personal data are routinely blocked or erased in accordance with legal requirements. 10 Rights of the data subject

A social network is a place for social meetings on the Internet, an online community, which usually allows users to communicate with each other and interact in a virtual space.
A social network may serve as a platform for the exchange of opinions and experiences, or enable the Internet community to provide personal or business-related information.
Facebook allows social network users to include the creation of private profiles, upload photos, and network through friend requests.
The operating company of Facebook is Facebook, Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, United States.
If a person lives outside of the United States or Canada, the controller is the Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland.
With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet website, which is operated by the controller and into which a Facebook component (Facebook plug-ins) was integrated, the web browser on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically prompted to download display of the corresponding Facebook component from Facebook through the Facebook component.
An overview of all the Facebook Plug-ins may be accessed under https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/.
During the course of this technical procedure, Facebook is made aware of what specific sub-site of our website was visited by the data subject.
If the data subject is logged in at the same time on Facebook, Facebook detects with every call-up to our website by the data subjectâand for the entire duration of their stay on our Internet siteâwhich specific sub-site of our Internet page was visited by the data subject.
This information is collected through the Facebook component and associated with the respective Facebook account of the data subject.
If the data subject clicks on one of the Facebook buttons integrated into our website, e.g.
the âLikeâ button, or if the data subject submits a comment, then Facebook matches this information with the personal Facebook user account of the data subject and stores the personal data.
Facebook always receives, through the Facebook component, information about a visit to our website by the data subject, whenever the data subject is logged in at the same time on Facebook during the time of the call-up to our website.

These applications may be used by the data subject to eliminate a data transmission to Facebook. 13 Data protection provisions about the application and use of Google Analytics (with anonymization function) On this website, the controller has integrated the component of Google Analytics (with the anonymizer function).
Google Analytics is a web analytics service.
Web analytics is the collection, gathering, and analysis of data about the behavior of visitors to websites.
A web analysis service collects, inter alia, data about the website from which a person has come (the so-called referrer), which sub-pages were visited, or how often and for what duration a sub-page was viewed.

The purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyze the traffic on our website.
Google uses the collected data and information, inter alia, to evaluate the use of our website and to provide online reports, which show the activities on our websites, and to provide other services concerning the use of our Internet site for us.
Google Analytics places a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject.
The definition of cookies is explained above.
With the setting of the cookie, Google is enabled to analyze the use of our website.

The cookie is used to store personal information, such as the access time, the location from which the access was made, and the frequency of visits of our website by the data subject.
With each visit to our Internet site, such personal data, including the IP address of the Internet access used by the data subject, will be transmitted to Google in the United States of America.
These personal data are stored by Google in the United States of America.
Google may pass these personal data collected through the technical procedure to third parties.
The data subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time by means of a corresponding adjustment of the web browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies.
Such an adjustment to the Internet browser used would also prevent Google Analytics from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject.
In addition, cookies already in use by Google Analytics may be deleted at any time via a web browser or other software programs.
In addition, the data subject has the possibility of objecting to a collection of data that are generated by Google Analytics, which is related to the use of this website, as well as the processing of this data by Google and the chance to preclude any such.
For this purpose, the data subject must download a browser add-on under the link https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout and install it.
This browser add-on tells Google Analytics through a JavaScript, that any data and information about the visits of Internet pages may not be transmitted to Google Analytics.
The installation of the browser add-ons is considered an objection by Google.
If the information technology system of the data subject is later deleted, formatted, or newly installed, then the data subject must reinstall the browser add-ons to disable Google Analytics.
If the browser add-on was uninstalled by the data subject or any other person who is attributable to their sphere of competence, or is disabled, it is possible to execute the reinstallation or reactivation of the browser add-ons.

6(1) lit.
a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose.
If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit.
b GDPR.
The same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services.
Is our company subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art.
6(1) lit.
c GDPR.
In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person.
This would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party.
Then the processing would be based on Art.
6(1) lit.
d GDPR.
Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit.
f GDPR.
This legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data.
Such processing operations are particularly permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator.
He considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a client of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).
Further informatiton can be found here. 23 The legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party Where the processing of personal data is based on Article 6(1) lit.
f GDPR our legitimate interest is to carry out our business in favor of the well-being of all our employees and the shareholders.
24 Period for which the personal data will be stored The criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period.
After expiration of that period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long as it is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or the initiation of a contract.
25 Provision of personal data as statutory or contractual requirement.
Requirement necessary to enter into a contract.
Obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data.
possible consequences of failure to provide such data We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g.
tax regulations) or can also result from contractual provisions (e.g.
information on the contractual partner).
Sometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data subject provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be processed by us.
The data subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with personal data when our company signs a contract with him or her.
The non-provision of the personal data would have the consequence that the contract with the data subject could not be concluded.
Before personal data is provided by the data subject, the data subject must contact any employee.
The employee clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the personal data is required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal data and the consequences of non-provision of the personal data.
26 Existence of automated decision-making 26.
