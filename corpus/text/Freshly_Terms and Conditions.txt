Indemnification

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold Freshly, its officers, directors, employees,
shareholders, affiliates agents, licensors, and suppliers, harmless from and against
any claims, actions or demands, liabilities and settlements including without limitation,
reasonable legal and accounting fees, resulting from, or alleged to result from, your violation
of this Agreement or your use of the Freshly Offerings or your use of any information obtained
from the Freshly Offerings.

Governing Law and Jurisdiction

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
State of New York, without regard to its conflict of laws rules.

Resolving Disputes â Arbitration

Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customerâs satisfaction BY
calling our customer service department at
1-844-FRESHLY.
IF Freshlyâs customer service
department is unable to resolve a complaint you may have to your satisfaction (or if Freshly
has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally),
we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or small claims court
instead of in courts of general jurisdiction.


All disputes or claims that arise under or related to this Agreement
(whether in contract, tort or otherwise, whether past, pre-existing, or future, and
including statutory, consumer protection, common law, intentional tort, injunctive,
and equitable claims) will be resolved either in small claims court or by individual
arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA").
Unless you and Freshly agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the
county (or parish) of your billing address.
The AAA Rules are available online at
adr.org,
by calling the AAA at
1-800-778-7879.
Freshly agrees that it will pay a consumerâs
filing fee FOR the arbitration.


You agree to arbitration on an individual basis.
In any dispute,
&nbsp.

NEITHER CUSTOMER NOR FRESHLY SHALL BE ENTITLED TO JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS
BY OR AGAINST OTHER CUSTOMERS, OR ARBITRATE OR OTHERWISE PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLAIMS
AS A REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS MEMBER, OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY.
If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable
provision shall be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms shall be enforced
(but in no case shall there be a class arbitration).
&nbsp.


The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in court under law.
Any award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on each of the parties, and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
This transaction and the arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act 9 U.S.C.
sec.
1-16 (FAA).

Waiver and Severability

No waiver by Freshly of any of the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement
shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver
of any other term or condition, and any failure of Freshly to assert a right or provision
under these Terms and Conditions shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.


If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court or other tribunal of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason,
such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that
the remaining provisions of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect.

Entire Agreement

This Agreement and our Privacy Policy constitute the sole and entire agreement
between you and Freshly with respect to the Freshly Offerings and supersede all
prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations and warranties,
both written and oral, with respect to the Freshly Offerings.

notice on the site, or by written communication delivered by first class U.S.
