Yotpo User Data is shared with the administrator of the customerâs account to which such User belongs (including data and communications concerning such userâs account).

However, although we make efforts to protect your privacy, we cannot guarantee that our Services will be immune from any wrongdoings, malfunctions, unlawful interceptions or access, or other kinds of abuse and misuse.9.
Data Subject RightsIndividuals have rights concerning their personal data.
If you wish to exercise your privacy rights under applicable law, including the GDPR, UK GPDR or the CCPA, such as the right to request access to, and rectification or erasure of your personal data held with Yotpo, or to restrict or object to such dataâs processing, or to port such personal data, or the right to equal services and prices (each to the extent available to you under the laws which apply to you) â please contact us by e-mail at: privacy@yotpo.com
Please note that when you ask us to exercise any of your rights under this policy or applicable law, we may need to ask you to provide us certain credentials to make sure that you are who you claim you are, to avoid disclosure to you of personal data related to others and to ask you to provide further information to better understand the nature and scope of data that you request to access.
Such additional data will be then retained by us for legal purposes (e.g.
as proof of the identity of the person submitting the request), in accordance with Section 4 above.
We may redact from the data which we will make available to you, any personal data related to others.

If you would like to make any requests or queries regarding personal data that we process on our customerâs behalf, please contact the customer or the administrator of such customerâs account directly, as they would be the âdata controllerâ of such data (see Section 10 below).
Note that if you do contact us in this regard, we may share your communications with the relevant customer and its account users.
and that we may also share the contact details of the account administrator with individuals who sent us such a request or query relating to this account.10.
Data Controller/ProcessorCertain data protection laws and regulations, such as the EU GDPR, UK GDPR or the CCPA, typically distinguish between two main roles for parties processing personal data: the âdata controllerâ (or under the CCPA, âbusinessâ), who determines the purposes and means of processing.
and the âdata processorâ (or under the CCPA, âservice providerâ), who processes the data on behalf of the data controller (or business).
Below we explain how these roles apply to our Services, to the extent that such laws and regulations apply.

Yotpo is the âdata controllerâ of Yotpo Website, CRM &amp.
Prospect Data.
With respect to such data, we assume the responsibilities of data controller (solely to the extent applicable under law), as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
In such instances, our Service Providers processing such data will assume the role of âdata processorâ.

Yotpo is the âdata processorâ of Customer Data, which we process on behalf of our customer (who is the âdata controllerâ of such data.
and our Service Providers who process such Customer Data on our behalf are the âsub-processorsâ of such data.

Yotpo is both a âdata controllerâ and âdata processorâ of Yotpo User Data.
Such data is processed by Yotpo for its own purposes (as described in Section 2 above), as an independent âcontrollerâ.
whilst those certain portions of it which are included in Customer Data will be processed by us on our customerâs behalf, as a âprocessorâ.
Accordingly, Yotpo processes Customer Data strictly in accordance with such customerâs reasonable instructions and as further stipulated in our Data Processing Addendum and other commercial agreements with such customer.
The customer, as controller of such data, will be responsible for meeting any legal requirements applicable to data controllers (such as establishing a legal basis for processing and responding to Data Subject Rights requests concerning the data they control).
For the avoidance of doubt, each customer is solely responsible for establishing a legal basis for proceeding and providing adequate notice to their account users and customers whose data may be contained in Customer Data â including sufficient reference to the processing of their personal data via the Services, and any other information necessary to comply with all applicable privacy and data protection laws.
and to obtain all approvals and consents from such individuals as required under such laws.11.
