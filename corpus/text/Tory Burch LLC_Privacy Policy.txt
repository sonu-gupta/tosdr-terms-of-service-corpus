From these cookies, we may collect information about your browser, including, where available, your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration.

Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system may issue cookies when you log on to our Websites.
Additionally, if a browser is set to issue a âdo not trackâ signal, we do not place tracking cookies on that browser.
However, some third parties who place cookies on our Websites may not respond to such âdo not trackâ signals, as the online community has not reached a consensus as to Do Not Track standards, implementations and solutions.
Pixel Tags:  We may also use "pixel tags" (sometimes called âInternet tagsâ, "web beacons" or "clear GIFS"), which are tiny graphic images, on our Websites.
Pixel tags help us analyze our customersâ online behavior and measure the effectiveness of our Websites and our advertising.
We work with service providers that help us track, collect, and analyze this information.
Pixel tags on our Websites may be used to collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the features you use, the links you click, and other actions you take in connection with the Websites.

This Customer Mobile Device Data may be collected for the purpose of determining the amount, location and frequency of customer traffic into our stores.
A mobile deviceâs MAC address identifies a specific device to the surrounding Wi-Fi networks.
The MAC address does not disclose the identity or any other personal data of the mobile device user.
You may opt-out of having your MAC address recorded by visiting the following link and entering your mobile deviceâs MAC address: https://optout.smart-places.org/.

We also work with business partners that use tracking technologies to deliver promotions on our behalf across the Internet.
These companies may collect information about your visits to our Websites, and your interaction with our advertising and other communications.
We may combine the information we collect through cookies and pixel tags with other information we have collected from you.
This information may be used to improve our Websites, to personalize your online experience, to help us deliver information to you, to determine the effectiveness of our advertising, and for other internal business purposes.

In the event of a corporate reorganization, asset transfer, or change of control, your personal data may also be transferred.
However, use of your personal data will remain subject to this Privacy Policy.
We may also disclose your personal data when legally required to do so, to cooperate with legal proceedings, law enforcement, court orders, laws, regulations, or other legal obligations, or to assist in an investigation, to protect and defend our rights and property, or the rights or safety of third parties, to enforce our Terms of Use, this Privacy Policy, or agreements with third parties, for crime-prevention purposes, or to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our Websites.

MAINTENANCE AND PROCESSING OF INFORMATION
Your personal data may be stored, transferred and process in and to the United States and in other countries by our affiliates and/or service providers.
The data protection laws in these countries may provide a lower standard of protection for your personal data than your country of residence.
We take great care in protecting your personal data and have put in place adequate mechanisms to protect it when it is transferred internationally.
We will transfer your personal data in compliance with applicable data protection laws and will implement suitable safeguards to ensure that your personal data is adequately secured by any third party that will access your information (for instance, by using the Model Clauses as approved by the European Commission).
By using our Websites and providing personal data to Tory Burch, you consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the collection, use, maintenance, transfer to and processing of your personal data in the United States or other countries or territories, and, unless otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we use this consent as the legal basis for that data transfer.
If you have questions or wish to obtain more information about the international transfer of your personal data or the implemented safeguards, please send us an email to inquiries@toryburch.com.
SECURITY
Security Measures: Tory Burch uses commercially reasonable measures to keep your personal data private and safe.
We take appropriate physical, electronic and administrative steps to maintain the security of personal data we collect, including limiting the number of people who have physical access to our servers, as well as employing electronic security systems and password protections that guard against unauthorized access.
In addition, it is our policy to never send your payment card number via email.
Our customer care center and stores operate over private, secure networks.
Please note, however, that email is not encrypted and is not considered to be a secure means of transmitting payment card information.
We use industry standard security technology in transferring information to process your orders.
All payment card transactions should take place in protected areas of our Websites, which are designed to reduce the risk of any loss, misuse or alteration of the information collected.
When you begin the checkout process, you should move into such a protected area.
Once you've entered, the page address (URL) should change from âhttpâ to âhttps.â Also, a key or a closed lock should appear in the lower right hand corner of your screen to notify you of this change.
You should remain in this secure zone for the entire checkout process.
Please check that you are still in this protected area when you type in your payment card details.
Despite our best efforts, the transmission of data over the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
While we use commercially reasonable means to ensure the security of information you transmit to us, we cannot guarantee that such information will not be intercepted by third parties.
We may, however, prosecute any unauthorized or fraudulent transactions to the fullest extent permitted by law.
Spoofing and Phishing: Spoofing and phishing are common Internet scams.
These may occur when you receive an email from what appears to be a legitimate source requesting personal data from you.
Please be aware that Tory Burch will never send you an email requesting you to verify payment card or bank information.
If you ever receive an email that appears to be from us requesting such information from you, do not respond to it, and do not click on any links appearing in the email.
Instead, please forward the email to us at inquiries@toryburch.com, as we will endeavor to investigate all instances of possible online fraud.
Other Websites: Our Websites may include links to third party websites whose privacy practices may differ from ours.
If you provide personal data to any of those third parties, your data is governed by their privacy policies, and we encourage you to read those privacy policies carefully before providing your personal data.
CHILDREN'S PRIVACY
Our Website is not intended for children.
We do not intentionally collect any personal data from children under the age of sixteen, and will dispose of any such information if we become aware that it has been provided to us.
CHANGES TO THIS POLICY
Tory Burch may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time.
If we change our Privacy Policy, we will post the updated Privacy Policy on this page with an updated date.
Under certain circumstances (for example, in connection with certain material adverse changes to this Privacy Policy), we may also elect to notify you through additional means, such as posting a notice on the home page of our Websites or contacting you via email.
