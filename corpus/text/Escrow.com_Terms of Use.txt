In addition, Escrow.com, in its sole discretion, may refuse to complete any Transaction that Escrow.com has reason to believe is unauthorized or made by someone other than you, may violate any law, rule or regulation, or if Escrow.com has reasonable cause not to honor it.
Each User agrees to indemnify and hold Escrow.com harmless for losses resulting from any use or attempted use of the Services in violation of this Agreement.

Rejection of Payment - Since the use of a bank account, credit card or debit card account, or the making of an electronic funds transfer may be limited by your agreement with your financial institution and/or by applicable law, Escrow.com is not liable to any User if Escrow.com does not complete a Transaction as a result of any such limit, or if a financial institution fails to honor any credit or debit to or from an Account.
Escrow.com may post operating rules related to payment on the Site and change such rules from time to time.

General Conditions of Use - If you arrive at the Site through entities linked and/or integrated with Escrow.com or otherwise by or through a third party (e.g., an auction, exchange, or Internet-based intermediary that hosts electronic marketplaces and mediates transactions among businesses), then you authorize such third party to transfer relevant data to Escrow.com to facilitate the Transaction.
You represent and warrant that all information you provide to Escrow.com or to such third party will be true, accurate and complete.
The party entering into this Agreement on behalf of any User represents and warrants that he/she is authorized to do so and to bind the User and is a natural person of at least eighteen (18) years of age.
In order to initiate and commence a Transaction, all Users to a Transaction must register at the Site, agree to all terms in the General Escrow Instructions and agree to the Transaction Escrow Instructions.

Obligations of Sellers - On the Transaction Detail Screens, each Seller to a Transaction must designate an Account to which payment for the Transaction will be made.
Each Seller authorizes IES and its authorized agents to initiate credit entries to such Seller's Account for payment of the purchase price, or applicable balance due, and to debit Seller's Account to discharge Seller's obligations.
Each Seller in a Transaction shall deliver the items set forth in Transaction Detail Screens directly to the Buyer (or Buyers), at the address specified by such Buyer as shown on the Escrow.com website and on the terms and conditions set forth in the Transaction Escrow Instructions and General Escrow Instructions.
Seller shall use a delivery service that provides a confirmation of delivery and Seller shall provide Escrow.com with a tracking or reference number for the shipment of the goods.
Seller gives Escrow.com permission to act as its agent in communicating with the shipping company regarding the notice of the delivery of the goods.
In the event Escrow.com does not receive notice of shipment from Seller within ten (10) calendar days of notification from Escrow.com's notice to Seller to ship the items, Seller authorizes Escrow.com to return the escrowed funds (excluding Escrow.com fees) to Buyer.
In the event of a return of the items by Buyer, Seller shall notify Escrow.com of the receipt of the returned items.
Upon receipt of such notice from Seller, the Seller's five (5) day inspection period shall commence.
In the event Seller accepts the returned items within the inspection period or fails to act within the inspection period, Escrow.com shall remit the escrowed funds (excluding Escrow.com fees) to Buyer.
If Seller notifies Escrow.com of its non-acceptance of any returned items within the Seller's inspection period, then Escrow.com will retain the escrow funds pending resolution of the dispute or take other action as authorized.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above, if all Users to a Transaction agree on the Transaction Detail Screens that there is no shipping required, then no party hereto will have any obligation under this Agreement with respect to shipping.

Obligations of Buyers - On the Transaction Detail Screens, Buyer must designate a payment mechanism and an Account from which the purchase price and related fees (unless such fees are to be paid by Seller) will be obtained for the deposit into escrow.
Depending on the amount of the Transaction and the currency selected for the Transaction, Buyer may remit the necessary funds via various methods, which may include corporate credit card, charge card, debit card or purchasing card, check (cheque), cashier's check, money order, ACH Debit or Wire Transfer.
In the case of wire transfers, Buyer will initiate the wire to an account designated by Escrow.com on or before the date set forth in the Transaction Detail Screens.
Regardless of the payment method, Buyer authorizes Escrow.com and Escrow.com authorized agents to initiate credit or debit transactions, as applicable, to obtain the purchase price and fees due for a Transaction and to initiate any debit or credit entries or reversals, as the case may be, as may be necessary to correct any error in a payment or transfer and to discharge Buyer's obligations under Section 22 of this Agreement.
Escrow.com will deposit funds received from Buyer into an escrow trust account maintained by Escrow.com (the "Escrow Account").
Unless otherwise requested as specified in the following sentence, escrowed deposits do not earn interest for Buyer or Seller.
If you anticipate an extended closing of the Transaction, then you may request and approve an instruction to have Escrow.com place Buyer's funds into an interest bearing account for the benefit of Buyer or Seller.
If interest is to accrue to the benefit of the Seller, then both Buyer and Seller must request and approve the establishment of the interest bearing account.
If this request is made, then Escrow.com will charge the account of the party to whom the interest accrues an additional nonrefundable service charge of $100.00, which must be paid in advance.
Buyer shall notify Escrow.com of the receipt or non-receipt of the items on the date the merchandise is received or the Buyer Inspection Period is started.
Buyer shall notify Escrow.com of the Buyer's acceptance or rejection of the items before the Buyer's Inspection Period expires.
Upon receipt of notice from Buyer that the items have been received and accepted, Escrow.com shall transfer the payment amount (less any amount payable to Escrow.com for Escrow.com fees) to Seller's Account.
Transfer to a Seller generally will be initiated within the next business day from the day on which notice of acceptance of the items is received from the Buyer.
If Buyer has not notified Escrow.com of the non-receipt or rejection of the items during the Buyer's Inspection Period, then Buyer authorizes Escrow.com to remit the escrowed funds (excluding Escrow.com fees) to the Seller.
Buyer shall follow the procedures set forth on the Site in the event the items are rejected.

Obligations of Brokers - On the Transaction Detail Screens, each Broker to a Transaction must designate an Account to which the Broker Fee payment will be made.
Each Broker authorizes IES and its authorized agents to initiate credit entries to such Broker's Account for payment of the Broker's commission, and to debit Broker's account to discharge Broker's obligations.
Each Broker in a Transaction shall provide Buyer email, Seller email, and Transaction details including purchase price, merchandise description, inspection period and which party is responsible for the Broker and Escrow fees.

Our Responsibilities - Escrow.com is obligated to perform only those duties expressly described in this Agreement and the General Escrow Instructions.
Escrow.com shall not be liable for any error in judgment, for any act taken or not taken, or for any mistake of fact or law, except for gross negligence or willful misconduct (subject to the limitations in Section 17 below).
Escrow.com may rely upon any notice, demand, request, letter, certificate, agreement or any other document which purports to have been transmitted or signed by or on behalf of a User indicated as the sender or signatory thereof and shall have no duty to make any inquiry or investigation.
In the event that Escrow.com is uncertain as to Escrow.com duties or rights under this Agreement, receives any instruction, demand or notice from any User or financial institution which, in Escrow.com's opinion, is in conflict with any of the provisions of this Agreement, or any dispute arises with respect to this Agreement or the Escrowed Funds, Escrow.com may (i) consult with counsel of our choice (including our own attorneys) and any actions taken or not taken based upon advice of counsel shall be deemed consented to by you, or (ii) refrain from taking any action other than to retain the funds in escrow for delivery in accordance with the written agreement of the Users, the final decision or award of an arbitrator pursuant to an arbitration commenced and conducted in accordance with the General Escrow Instructions or a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (iii) discharge our duties under this Agreement by depositing all funds by interpleader action with a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the procedures outlined in the General Escrow Instructions.

Escrow.com may, at any time, give notice of Escrow.com's intent to resign as Escrow Agent.
If, within ten (10) days of such notice, Escrow.com has not received notice from all Users in a Transaction that they have designated a substitute escrow agent (which notice shall identify the substitute escrow agent), Escrow.com may discharge Escrow.com duties under this Agreement by depositing all escrowed funds with a court of competent jurisdiction.
If an alternate Escrow Agent is so designated, Escrow.com shall be discharged from Escrow.com duties under this Agreement, the General Escrow Instructions and the Transaction Escrow Instructions by delivering all escrowed funds to such person or entity.
Upon payment of the escrow funds pursuant to this Agreement, Escrow.com shall be fully released from any and all liability and obligations with respect to the escrow funds and the Transaction.
