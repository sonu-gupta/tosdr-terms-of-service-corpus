 End User License Agreement The document that follows this paragraph is a license agreement that accompanies all of our Mac applications.
We put it here so people could check it out before downloading the app in the first place.
Why do we need such a thing? Well, to be perfectly honest, our lawyers have told us that we need to protect ourselves.
We at the Omni Group pride ourselves on our low-key style, but the global nature of the software business means that one lawsuit from one user in a far-flung jurisdiction could seriously affect us and our ability to provide software.
It also means that, without this license agreement, we might not have protection from people who misuse our software.
We do not want to risk our entire company on such possibilities, however unlikely, because we like doing what we do and want to continue to be able to do it.
And, so, we require you to read and agree to the terms of this document before using our software.
We think you will find it quite reasonable.
Obviously, if you disagree, click âDisagree.â But, donât just stop there.
Let us know.
Send some email to info@omnigroup.com telling us what you find unacceptable about our license agreement.
We canât promise to change anything, but we will do our best to get back to you.

END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT

THIS END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT (âLicense Agreementâ) IS A LEGAL AGREEMENT between you (either an individual or an entity) and Omni Development, Inc.
(âthe Omni Groupâ).
By clicking on the âAgreeâ button or installing, using or benefiting from the Omni Group software (the âSoftwareâ), you are agreeing to be bound by the terms and conditions of this License Agreement.
If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, do not click on the âAgreeâ button and you may not access or otherwise use or benefit from the Software in any manner.
The terms and conditions of this License Agreement also apply to any updates, supplements, Internet-based services, and support services for this Software, unless other terms accompany those items.
If so, those terms apply.

1.
Grant of Limited License.
Conditions.

Any license granted to you herein is conditioned on your compliance with the terms and conditions contained in this License Agreement.
(a) Downloaded and Software on Media.
The Omni Group grants to you a non-exclusive, personal, limited right to install and use the Omni Group software program downloaded or contained on the CD-ROM, disk or other media (the âSoftwareâ).
The license permits either (a) multiple users to install and use the Software on a single machine.
or (b) a single user to install and use the Software on multiple machines.
However, a single license does not allow multiple users to ever use Software on multiple machines, regardless of whether such use is concurrent, except in the case of Family Pack licensing.
Family Pack licenses permit you to install and use the software on up to five computers at a time as long as those computers are located in the same household (portables which are used primarily in this household are included) and used by persons who occupy that same household.
By âhouseholdâ we mean a person or persons sharing the same single family housing unit such as a home, apartment, mobile home or condominium.
This license does not extend to students who reside at a separate on-campus location or to business or commercial users.
(b) Online Subscription Software.
If available and you licensed the Software on an online subscription basis, the Omni Group grants to you a non-exclusive, personal, limited right to use and access the Software for the subscription period for which you have paid the applicable subscription fees, solely for your own internal business purposes, subject to the terms of this License Agreement and any other terms and conditions accompanying such Software.
If any subscription based Software is licensed on a ânamed userâ basis, rights of any user licensed to utilize the Software service cannot be shared or used by more than one individual.
In addition, a user may not be transferred from one individual to another unless the original user no longer requires, and is no longer permitted, access to the Software service.
You may have the option to extend your subscription or convert to a perpetual license.
If you extend your subscription, you may continue using the Software until the end of your extended subscription period.
See the Software activation screens or other accompanying materials for subscription details.
After the expiration of your subscription, features of the Software will stop running.

You may, however, make copies of the Software solely for your individual and personal use on multiple computers, provided that you include all copyright and proprietary rights notices on any copies.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may not make copies for use on multiple machines if multiple users (including employees, agents, or contractors) will use those machines unless you purchase a corresponding number of seat licenses.
Your possession, installation, or use of the Software does not transfer to you any title to the intellectual property in the Software, and you will not acquire any rights to the Software except as expressly set forth in this License Agreement.
To the extent you provide any comments or suggestions to the Omni Group, the Omni Group shall have the right to retain and use any such comments or suggestions regarding the Software in current or future software, products or services, without further compensation to you or without your approval.

You may not use the Registration Key for any unlicensed purpose and you may not provide the Registration Key to any third party.
(b) You may modify, reverse-engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software.
However, you may not do so for the purpose of disabling the feature of the Software that provides intermittent reminders that you have not registered your copy of the Software (i.e.
circumventing the Registration Key system), creating derivative works, or for the purpose of circumventing any of the terms of this License Agreement or any other provision of law.
(c) You may not claim that the Software, in whole or in part, is yours, and you may not use the name the Omni Group or Omni Development (or any of their suppliersâ) or any of their respective logos or trademarks in any manner without first obtaining the prior written permission from an authorized representative of the Omni Group.
(d) You must use the Software at all times in a manner that is consistent with any other software licenses granted to you by other companies that have provided software for your computer.
