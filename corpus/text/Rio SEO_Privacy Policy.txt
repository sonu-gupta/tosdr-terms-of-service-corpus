Do Not Track Policy &amp.
Opting OutWe use common tracking technologies.

We collect personal information about users over time and across different websites when you use this website or service.
We also have third parties that collect personal information this way.
To do this, we use several common tracking tools.
Our vendors may also use these tools.
These may include browser cookies.
We may also use web beacons, flash cookies, and similar technologies.


We use tracking technologies for a variety of reasons.

We use tracking tools:

To recognize new or past customers.
To store your password if you are registered on our site.
To improve our website.
To serve you with interest-based or targeted advertising (see below for more on interest-based advertising).
To observe your behaviors and browsing activities over time across multiple websites or other platforms.
To better understand the interests of our customers and our website visitors.


We engage in interest-based advertising.

We and our partners display interest-based advertising using information gathered about you over time across multiple websites or other platforms.
Interest-based advertising or âonline behavioral advertisingâ includes ads served to you after you leave our website, encouraging you to return.
They also include ads we think are relevant based on your shopping habits or online activities.
These ads might be served on websites or on apps.
They might also be served in emails.
We might serve these ads, or third parties may serve ads.
They might be about our products or other companiesâ products.

How do we gather relevant information about you for interest-based advertising?

To decide what is relevant to you, we use information you make available to us when you interact with us, our partners, and other third parties.
We gather this information using the tracking tools described above.
For example, we or our partners might look at your purchases or browsing behaviors.
We might look at these activities on our platforms or the platforms of others.
We work with third parties who help gather this information.
These third parties might link your name or email address to other information they collect.
That might include past purchases made offline or online.
Or, it might include online usage information.

You can control tracking tools.

Your browser may give you the ability to control cookies.
How you do so depends on the type of cookie.
Certain browsers can be set to reject browser cookies.
To control flash cookies, which we may use on certain websites from time to time, you can go here.
Why? Because flash cookies cannot be controlled through your browser settings.

Our Do Not Track Policy: Some websites have âdo not trackâ features that allow you to tell a website not to track you.
These features are not all uniform.
We do not currently respond to those signals. If you block cookies, certain features on our sites may not work.
If you block or reject cookies, not all of the tracking described here will stop.
Options you select are browser and device specific.

You can opt-out of online behavioral advertising.

RIO adheres to the Digital Advertising Allianceâs Self-Regulatory Principles for Interest-Based Advertising (www.AboutAds.info).
The Digital Advertising Alliance maintains a website where consumers can opt out from receiving interest-based advertising from some or all of the network advertising companies participating in the program (www.AboutAds.info/choices). To opt out of having your online behavior collected for advertising purposes, click here.
Choices you make are both browser and device-specific.
Rio SEO is committed to the highest possible standards of ethical, moral and legal conduct.
In conjunction with these values and our commitment to open communications, we have established an anonymous hotline reporting procedure, which is intended to be used for serious concerns relating to financial reporting, unethical or illegal conduct, etc.
Please report any such violations at (844) 744-9511.
