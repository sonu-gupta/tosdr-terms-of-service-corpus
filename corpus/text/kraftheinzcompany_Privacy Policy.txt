This Privacy Notice also explains how we may use and disclose such information, as well as your ability to control certain uses of it.

The personal information we collect may include your name, birth date or age, telephone number, and e-mail address.
If you purchase products or services from Kraft Heinz, we may also request your credit/debit card number or other financial information, along with billing information, so we can fulfill your order or request.
We donât require you to register or provide personal information to view our Sites or access much of its content, such as our many delicious recipes.
However, you may be required to provide certain personal information to create a Site account, use certain features, or receive certain offers.
For example, when you participate in certain interactive features on our Sites, such as using our recipe exchange, recipe ratings, and product ratings and reviews, you may also provide us with certain information like your email address, nickname, city and state of residency, or submit content, such as recipes, ratings, comments, or pictures to the Site.
In addition, we may give you the opportunity to tell your friends about certain features or information on our Sites.
If you take advantage of our âSend to a Friendâ option, we will ask you for your friendâs and your first name and e-mail addresses to send the information to them that you requested.
We also offer visitors to our Sites various features for their enjoyment, which we may change from time to time.
We may ask you to submit certain information so we can provide you with these features.
If you use a third party login to create your account (such as Facebook Connect) or otherwise link to us, we may receive certain information about you from the third party (such as a social network) based on your registration and privacy settings on those third party websites.
We may combine the information you provide to us with information from and about you that we automatically collect when you visit the Site, from third parties, or other online and offline sources. Information Collected By Automated Means We may use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, log files, or local shared objects (such as Flash cookies), and other technologies to collect certain information about visitors to our Sites, use of our online services, and interactions with our emails and online advertisements, and to allow us to keep track of analytics and certain statistical information which enables us to improve the Sites and provide you with more relevant content and advertising on our Site and other sites.
For example, through these means, we may automatically collect information such as your browser type, operating system, mobile device type and carrier, Internet service provider (âISPâ), and Internet Protocol (âIPâ) address.
We may also collect information about your use of and interaction with the Site, including as the webpages viewed, the date and time you visit the Site, the areas or pages of the Site that you visit, the amount of time you spend viewing or using the Site, the number of times you return to the Site, other click-stream or site usage data, whether you open, forward, or click-through links, emails, and ads, and other Site usage data.
Collecting this information, and linking it with your personal information, for example, helps us to best tailor our website and enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting a particular site, and to help identify site features, recipes, advertisements, and offers that may be of particular interest to you.
When you view the site using a mobile device, in addition to the other information we may collect from your actions, we may collect your mobile phone number, device identifier, geolocation information, or device type and carrier.
We also may use third party advertisements placed by ad networks to support our Sites.
Some of these advertisers and ad networks may use technology such as cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, log files, or local shared objects (such as Flash cookies) when they advertise on our Site, which will also send these advertisers and ad networks non-personal information including your IP address, ISP, browser type, and whether you have Flash installed.
Some of these advertisers and ad networks also may use anonymous data, such as demographic data, received from third parties to assist in the delivery of advertisements to you.
These third-party advertisers and ad networks use the information described above to provide you relevant advertisements based on your online behavior, search activities on our Site and on other third
party sites, and demographic information, so that the advertising you see on our site more closely reflects your interests and needs.
For example, if you search for, or browse a, recipe or product on our site, you may see an advertisement from a third party with information about, or an offer similar to, that for which you were searching or browsing on our site, or an offer related to a third party whose site you have visited in the past.

You are free to set your Internet browser settings to stop accepting new cookies, to receive notice when you receive a new cookie, to disable existing cookies, and to omit images (which will disable pixel tags).
