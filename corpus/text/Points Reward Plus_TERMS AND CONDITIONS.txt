Binding Arbitration with Class Action Waiver



Mandatory Informal Dispute Resolution Process.


PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY - IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND GOVERNS HOW YOU AND KROGER CAN BRING CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER.
THIS SECTION WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION, REQUIRE YOU AND KROGER TO SUBMIT CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.
THIS MEANS THAT YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BRING A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE LAWSUIT IN A COURT OF LAW BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY OR TO APPEAL DECISIONS CONCERNING ANY DISPUTE THAT MAY ARISE WHICH IS COVERED BY THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND ARE INSTEAD AGREEING TO SUBMIT ANY SUCH DISPUTE SOLELY ON YOUR OWN BEHALF TO AN IMPARTIAL ARBITRATOR.



There might be an occasion in which a Dispute (as defined below) arises between Member and Kroger.
Should such a situation arise, The Kroger Co.
is committed to working with you to resolve the Dispute.
Therefore, for any Dispute that arises between you and Kroger, both parties agree that they will first make a good faith effort to resolve it informally before initiating any formal dispute resolution proceeding as set forth below.

This informal dispute resolution process is a condition precedent and prerequisite to commencing arbitration or a proceeding in small claims court.

This process requires that one party send a written description of the Dispute, including the nature of the claim and the nature and basis of the specific relief sought, to the other party.
For any Dispute you initiate, you agree to send this written information about the Dispute along with your contact information sufficient details for Kroger to identify your transaction, account, or other relevant information via certified mail to POINTS REWARDS PLUS Legal, 10150 Mallard Creek Road, Suite 500, Charlotte, NC 28262.
The time period referenced below begins to run upon receipt of this written description.
Member and Kroger then agree to negotiate in good faith about the Dispute, including through an informal and individualized telephonic dispute resolution conference between you, Kroger.
If either party to the Dispute is represented by counsel, that partyâs counsel may participate, but the party also must personally appear at and participate in the conference.
This process should lead to resolution of the Dispute, but if it is not resolved within sixty (60) days after receipt of the written description detailed above, you and Kroger agree to the further dispute resolution provisions below.
The parties agree that any relevant limitations period and filing fee or other deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in this informal dispute resolution process.


Arbitration.
 Any Dispute between you and Kroger that cannot be resolved informally as detailed above shall be resolved through individual arbitration or in small claims court.
The term âDisputeâ shall be interpreted as broadly as permitted under the law and shall cover any claim or controversy, related to us or our relationship including but not limited to, any and all: (1) claims for relief and theories of liability, whether based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation, negligence, statute, regulation, ordinance, or otherwise.
(2) claims that arose before these or any prior Terms and Conditions.
(3) claims that arise after the termination of these Terms and Conditions.
and (4) claims that are the subject of purported class action litigation.
Notwithstanding the forgoing, either you or Kroger may elect to have a Dispute heard (1) in small claims court on an individual basis if the amount in controversy is properly within the jurisdiction of an appropriate small claims court or (2) in a court of competent jurisdiction to seek to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
The party initiating the arbitration proceeding may open a case with the American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ) by visiting its website (www.adr.org) or calling its toll-free number (1-800-778-7879).
You may deliver any required or desired notice by mail to POINTS REWARDS PLUS Legal, 10150 Mallard Creek Road, Suite 500, Charlotte, NC 28262. 
This arbitration provision shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.
Arbitrations shall be administered by the AAA pursuant to its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the âAAA Rulesâ) as modified by the version of this Arbitration Provision that is in effect when you notify us about your Dispute.
You can obtain the AAA Rules from the AAA by visiting its website (www.adr.org) or calling its toll-free number (1-800-778-7879).
If there is a conflict between this arbitration provision and the AAA rules, this arbitration provision shall govern.
If the AAA is unable to administer a proceeding under this arbitration provision as written, the parties shall agree on a substitute arbitration organization.
If the parties cannot agree, the parties shall mutually petition a court of appropriate jurisdiction to appoint an arbitration organization that will administer a proceeding under this arbitration provision as written applying the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules.
A single arbitrator will resolve the Dispute.
Unless you and Kroger agree otherwise, any arbitration hearing will take place at a location convenient to Member.
The arbitrator will honor claims of privilege recognized by law and will take reasonable steps to protect confidential or proprietary information.
The arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision that explains the arbitratorâs essential findings and conclusions.
The arbitratorâs award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties only if necessary for purposes of enforcing the arbitratorâs award.
An arbitratorâs award that has been fully satisfied shall not be entered in any court.
You agree to appear in an initial conference with the arbitrator and at any hearing, along with your counsel if you are represented.
Payment of filing and other fees shall be governed by the AAAâs Consumer Arbitration Rules.
For purposes of determining whether a claim or counterclaim was filed for purposes of harassment or is patently frivolous, the arbitrator may consider, without limitation, whether a party had previously offered full relief to the other party, including, but not limited to, a full refund of the sum paid for items purchased or whether the proceeding is part of multiple case filings.
THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON A CLASS ACTION, JOINT OR CONSOLIDATED BASIS OR ON BASES INVOLVING CLAIMS BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC (SUCH AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL), OTHER KROGER CUSTOMERS, OR OTHER PERSONS.
THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT INDIVIDUAL PARTYâS CLAIM.
THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT AWARD RELIEF FOR OR AGAINST ANYONE WHO IS NOT A PARTY.
THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSONâS CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.
THIS WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS AND COLLECTIVE RELIEF PARAGRAPH IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION AND CANNOT BE SEVERED FROM IT.
THE REMAINING PORTIONS OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION ARE NOT ESSENTIAL PARTS OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION AND CAN BE SEVERED FROM IT BY A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION.
NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, IF A COURT DETERMINES THAT PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF MAY NOT BE WAIVED AND ALL APPEALS FROM THAT DECISION HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED, THEN THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION SHALL SURVIVE AND ANY CLAIM FOR PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF SHALL BE STAYED PENDING ARBITRATION OF THE REMAINING CLAIMS.
If for any reason a claim may proceed in court rather than in arbitration, the parties waive any right to a jury trial, unless such waiver is unenforceable.
This means that any claim would be decided by a judge, not a jury.
This arbitration provision shall survive any termination of these Terms and Conditions or PRPP.
Any amendments to this arbitration provision shall be prospective only and shall not affect any pending claim or arbitration proceeding.


Applicable Law


The law applicable to the interpretation and construction of these Terms and Conditions in any arbitration shall be the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal laws and the laws of the State of Ohio, USA, without regard to principles of conflict of laws. If any Dispute is found not to be arbitrable, then ordinary choice of law rules will apply in any court proceeding in which the matter is adjudicated.
All parties agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (1980) and Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA), as adopted by any state, are specifically excluded from application to this Agreement.
