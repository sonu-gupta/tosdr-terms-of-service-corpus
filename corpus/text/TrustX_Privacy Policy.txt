        YOUR PRIVACY CHOICES

Effective Date: January 1, 2020 âTRUSTX is committed to the highest standards for personal privacy and user choice.
Thatâs why weâve created this simple privacy FAQ that addresses common user questions and explains the choices you have when TRUSTX handles your personal information in our Digital Advertising Marketplace.
In addition, weâve included a detailed Privacy Policy and some direct links to a few important privacy-related resources.
If you have any questions about privacy and TRUSTX, donât hesitate to reach out to privacy@trustx.org.
Weâll do our best to get back to you right away.FAQ: THE TRUSTX AD MARKETPLACE AND YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TRUSTX is a Digital Advertising Marketplace.
We provide supply-side programmatic advertising technology and services to a select group of digital content publishers, which enables them to sell advertising in an automated, programmatic fashion to advertisers.
One of the benefits we provide for publishers is the facilitation of ad targeting, or what is often referred to as âinterest-based advertising.â
The most common question we hear from consumers when it comes to interest-based advertising is, âWhat type of personal information do you collect and use to deliver this type of targeted advertising?â
When you browse one of our publisherâs websites, the publisher collects certain information about you and your device, which the publisher sends us each time they want us to attempt to sell an advertisement on their behalf.
This information does not directly identify you â that is, publishers donât send us your name, email address or any other contact details.
They do send us technical identifiers, such as your browserâs cookie, a mobile device ID and an IP addresses.
These technical identifiers are considered âpersonal informationâ under certain privacy and data protection laws.
When a publisher provides us this type of personal information about its users, we act as their service provider or processor of this information on their behalf, by passing the information to advertisers so they can respond with an ad they believe will be relevant to you.How does TRUSTX facilitate interest-based advertising?The TRUSTX Advertising Marketplace passes technical identifiers â cookies, device identifiers and similar technologies â to buy-side technology providers or buyers, who use this information to transact in an automated fashion.
Because some of these identifiers are persistent across the Internet, ads may be customized based on interests generated from a userâs visits to different websites via the same browser or device.
This type of customization â or targeting â is often referred to as âonline behavioral advertisingâ or âinterest-based advertising.â
Interest-based advertising means that publishers and advertisers share some level of personal information about users, which helps companies like TRUSTX better match a relevant advertisement with the user.

What kinds of personal information does TRUSTX collect from publishers?
Broadly speaking, the term âpersonal informationâ can mean directly identifiable data, such as a personâs name, email address or physical address, or it can mean technical information that identifies a userâs device or browser (e.g., mobile device ID or browser cookie) and an IP address.
As we explained in the introduction to this section, TRUSTX accepts technical information from publishers, although in some cases, publishers may send us generalized user-level attributes, such as a broad demographic segment (e.g., âfemale, 18 to 39 years oldâ), which weâll include when we offer the ad inventory for sale on publishersâ behalf as part of the programmatic ad delivery process.
We have contracts with our publishers that bind them to send us only these categories of personal information, and only in accordance with laws and their own privacy policies.What kinds of personal information does TRUSTX collect directly from users?TRUSTX also collects technical information that identifies a userâs device or browser, and we can independently identify each userâs IP address.Do we sell your personal information? No, we do not âsellâ personal information in the traditional sense of the word.
However, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the âCCPAâ) defines the word âsellâ as any exchange of personal information for something of value, such as the delivery of an interest-based ad.
For TRUSTX to facilitate programmatic real-time bidding, TRUSTX (a supply-side platform) must pass technical information (and in some cases, user-specific attributes) from our publishers to demand-side platforms (who provide technology and services to advertisers) in order to execute an ad sale.
Thus, under the CCPA definition, TRUSTX facilitates the âsaleâ of personal information from publishers so that advertisers may purchase interest-based advertising from our publisher members.Can you opt-out of the sale of your personal information?Yes.
You may instruct any of our publishers to not sell your personal information, as defined by the CCPA.
We encourage you to opt-out directly with those specific publishers for whom youâd like to exercise your âdo not sellâ choice.
You may find a list of our publishers here, and can find opt-out links within their privacy policies.
TRUSTX will honor the âdo not sellâ choices you have made with any and all of our publishers.
If you prefer to opt-out of the sale of your personal information through TRUSTX directly, which will affect how we handle your personal information received from all of our publishers, you may opt-out by clicking this Do Not Sell My Personal Information link.
Please note that by using this opt-out method, TRUSTX will treat your choice not only as a âdo not sellâ choice, but also as if you have opted-out of all interest-based advertising across all of our publishers.
In other words, an opt-out with TRUSTX eliminates all ad targeting based on any type of personal information.
Importantly, please understand that if you choose to opt-out with TRUSTX, your choice will apply only to programmatic advertising processed by TRUSTX.
we cannot affect how our publishers or other supply-side providers handle your personal information.Can you opt-out of interest-based advertising?Yes.
You may opt-out of receiving interest-based advertising that we facilitate on behalf of our publisher members.
These methods, however, may require that you opt-out separately from each browser and each device you use, since different browsers and devices use different identifiers.
If you opt-out of interest-based advertising, we will no longer collect the personal information described above from the opted-out device.
There are two ways in which you can directly opt-out of TRUSTX facilitating interest-based advertising.

We honor the Do Not Track (DNT) signal, which can be turned on or off in your browser.
When the DNT signal is on, we will treat your browser as if you have opted out of interest-based advertising.
You may opt-out by clicking this Do Not Deliver Interest-Based Advertising link, which will set a TRUSTX opt-out cookie on your browser.
The opt-out cookie is unique to the device through which you have opted-out, and there are cases where the cookie may not function properly if you have configured your browser to reject certain cookies.
Further, if you change browsers or your device, or delete the cookies on your device, you will need to opt-out again

Even if you opt-out of interest-based advertising with TRUSTX, you may still receive interest-based advertising when browsing our publishersâ websites unless you use the other choice mechanisms we outline in our detailed Privacy Policy and in our publisher membersâ privacy policies.Want to understand more about your privacy choices?We encourage you to read our Privacy Policy.

Your Rights and ChoicesYou have the right to opt-out of having your personal information used for the delivery of interest-based advertising.
There are a number of ways in which you can exercise this right.


Directly with any of our publishers: TRUSTX requires that our publishers post a clear and conspicuous privacy policy that includes explicit instructions on how to opt-out of interest-based advertising.
These policies are generally available on all content pages where personal information is collected or used.

By enabling the Do Not Track setting in your browser: Most web browsers offer users the opportunity to set a Do Not Track (âDNTâ) flag, which sends a signal to online adverting technology companies, like TRUSTX, not to collect or use information associated with the browser for interest-based advertising purposes.
TRUSTX respects this signal.
When the DNT signal is on, we will treat your device as if you have opted-out of the collection or use of any personal information for interest-based advertising.Please note that while TRUSTX will observe your DNT settings, each of our publisher members may or may not elect to comply with DNT, as may be described in each publisherâs privacy policy.

By declining or deleting cookies: You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to decline or delete cookies.
Most browsers accept cookies by default.
If you use multiple browsers on your device, you will need to instruct each browser separately.
Your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.

By resetting your mobile deviceâs advertising ID: You can do this at any time through your device settings, which allows you to limit the use of information collected about you.
For information on how to this on Apple or Android devices, please visit your device manufacturerâs websites.

By opting-out through the DAA AdChoices or NAI Opt-Out Programs: We require our publishers and advertisers to comply with the Digital Advertising Alliance AdChoices program, an industry self-regulatory program that allows consumers to opt-out of the use of cookie and non-cookie-based information for the purpose of delivering interest-based advertising. You can read more about the DAA AdChoices program and how to opt-out of interest-based advertising here.
You may read more about the Network Advertising Allianceâs opt-out choices here.

By opting-out with TRUSTX directly: Clicking this Do Not Deliver Interest-Based Advertising link sets a TRUSTX opt-out cookie on your browser.
The opt-out cookie is unique to the device through which you have opted-out, and there are cases where the cookie may not function properly if you have configured your browser to reject certain cookies.
Further, if you change browsers or your device, or delete the cookies on your device, you will need to opt-out again.

California residents and data subjects in Europe have additional rights as set forth in the section below entitled âAdditional Disclosures for California Residents.âTRUSTX as a Limited Service Provider, Third Party and Data ProcessorWhen TRUSTX provides Ad Marketplace services to publishers, we may use personal information provided by publishers to facilitate the delivery of interest-based advertising.
Our role, with respect to personal information, is defined under various laws in different parts of the world.
In the United States, in accordance with the CCPA, TRUSTX acts as a limited service provider, or a third party, with respect to your personal information, depending on the circumstances.
We operate on behalf of publishers, each of whom are separate legal entities.
You have the right to opt-out of having your personal information used for the delivery of interest-based advertising.
There are a number of ways in which you can exercise this right.
The European Union (âEUâ) data protection law (the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR) makes a distinction between organizations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as âcontrollersâ) and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as âprocessorsâ).
TRUSTX currently does not provide the Services to our publishers in jurisdictions covered by the GDPR, however, at such time that the Services are made available in these jurisdictions, the TRUSTX will act as a processor with respect to your personal data.
We will continue to operate on behalf of a publisher, a separate legal entity, which is the data controller.
California law defines personal information a little differently than EU law defines personal data, but both are subject to this policy.
When we refer to personal data or personal information throughout our policies, we mean to include anything covered by either term under applicable law.
Outside of our Ad Marketplace, there are circumstances where TRUSTX may act as a first party or data controller with respect to personal information collected on our website or for our own marketing purposes.
For more details, please see the section entitled, âWhen TRUSTX is a Marketer,â further below.Additional Disclosures for California ResidentsIf you are a California resident, you have the right to know certain information about our data practices in the preceding twelve months, the right to request more details about the personal information we have collected about you, and the right to delete the personal information we have collected from you.
If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please see our California Consumer Rights policy for instructions on how to do so.Additional Disclosures for European ResidentsPlease note that if you live in certain jurisdictions, such as the European Economic Area (âEEAâ), the United Kingdom (âUKâ) or Switzerland, you also have certain rights and protections under the law regarding the collection, processing, and use of information about you.
However, at this time, TRUSTX does not operate in any of these jurisdictions and thus does not collect or process any information subject to privacy and data protection laws in these jurisdictions.
When TRUSTX expands our geographic Services footprint to include jurisdictions subject to laws, such as the GDPR, we will update our Privacy Policy accordingly.Do Not Sell My Personal InformationTo the extent TRUSTX sells your personal information as the term âsellâ is defined under the California Consumer Privacy Act, you have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information by us to third parties at any time.

You may opt-out by clicking Do Not Sell My Personal Information.

Further, if you change browsers or your device, or delete the cookies on your device, you will need to opt-out again.
