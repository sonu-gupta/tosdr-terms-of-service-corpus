Scope of application
1.1 These "Terms of Use" of Xayn AG, Unter den Linden 42, 10117 Berlin, Germany (hereinafter "Xayn") apply to the Xayn App, available for download in various app stores (hereinafter the "App"), and to all services related to the App (the App and the services provided in connection with the Platform are hereinafter jointly referred to as "Services")

1.2 The Terms of Use apply in addition to the terms of use made available by Apple (as the operator of the iTunes / Apple app store), Google (as the operator of the Google Play store) or other providers (in the following collectively the "App Store Operators").
In the case of conflict, the present Terms of Use will take precedence over those of the App Store Operators with regard to the relationship between Xayn and the relevant user.
The App Store Operators are entitled, however, to assert the rights against the users arising from the present Terms of Use directly against the users.
 

1.3 Any terms and conditions of the users that deviate from or supplement these Terms of Use shall not apply.
2.
Use of services 
2.1 A prerequisite for the use of the Services is that the user of the App (the "User") has a device which complies with the current state of the art and which complies with the relevant specifications stated as minimum requirement in the respective app store.
Moreover, the use of the Services requires an internet connection of the User that provides a sufficient data transmission rate as well as sufficient disk space on the Us-er's device.


2.2 Xayn reserves the right to adjust the Services to the market conditions and to improve, expand, change and delete Services in whole or in part on an ongoing basis.
In order to use the Services, it is therefore particularly necessary to keep the device which is used to access the App up-to-date.3.
Scope of services 
3.1 The App provides the technical infrastructure to enable the User to search the inter-net by submitting "Search Requests" in the App which the App will pass-on to one or more third-party web crawlers ("Crawlers") routed by servers from Xayn which ensure that the Crawlers do not get the Usersâ IP address or other identifiable information apart from the Search Request.
Xayn does not have any control over the Crawlers or their availability.
The User is aware that the Search Requests (e.g., âweather in Berlin tomorrowâ) may be used by the operator of the Crawlers for whatever own purposes.
 

3.2 In the settings of the App, the User may activate the use of machine learning models ("Models").
Such Models may modify, improve and personalize the search results based on the knowledge they obtain from previous Search Requests submitted by the User and previous search results provided by the Crawlers.
In order to further improve the quality of the Models, the Models are shared with Xayn in an encrypted way, aggregated with Models from other users of other installations of the app on other devices, and then again transmitted to the User's App and to the other users' app installations, where they are further used as outlined in this section.
By activating the use of machine learning models in the settings of the App, the User agrees with the creation and usage of Models as described herein.

for maintenance work).
User acknowledges that in case of any non-availabilities of the Crawlers â again: Xayn is not responsible for the services of the Crawlers â, the App might not be functioning.


4.6 Xayn has no obligation to provide updates or upgrades for the App or to adapt the App in any other way to possible changes to hardware and/or software (in particular, operating systems).5.

measures which aim to circumvent technical protection measures, (iii) enables automatic data readouts, (iv) circulates or enables the circulation of viruses, worms, trojans, brute force attacks, spam or other malicious actions, (v) runs attacks on the Models, for example by trying to identify data from natural persons in the Models, or (vi) copy or otherwise uses the Models for any other purposes than within the App.
Misuse of the Services results in immediate exclusion from use and in the institution of civil and criminal proceedings.
 6.
IndemnificationIn the case of infringement of third-party rights for which the User is responsible, the User will be directly liable towards these third parties.
In the event of justified claims of third parties against Xayn due to such an infringement, the User has the obligation to indemnify Xayn in full unless the User proves that he/she is not responsible for the breach of duty that has caused the damage or loss.
