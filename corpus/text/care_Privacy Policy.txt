Log files, IP addresses and information about your computer and mobile device
When you visit the Site, Care.com receives the internet protocol ("IP") address of your computer
(or the proxy server you use to access the internet), your computer operating system, the type of
web browser you are using, and browser language.
If you are using a mobile device, Care.com may also

We may correlate this information with other information we have about you.
We may also automatically collect information related to the ways in which you interact with the

Cookies and other technologies
A cookie is a tiny data file that resides on your computer, mobile phone, or other device, and
allows us to recognize you when you return to the Site using the same computer (or mobile device)
and web browser.
Like most websites, we and our service providers use cookies, and tracking pixels
to track Site usage and trends, evaluate the effectiveness of our ads both on and off our Site,
customize your experience on the Site and improve the quality of our Services.
For example, using
these technologies we can determine, among other things, which pages of our Site you visit and which
ads you click on.
Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can modify your browser
settings to decline cookies.
In some cases, however, doing so may impact your ability to use
Care.com.
Tracking pixels do not identify individual users, and the analysis of data obtained by
tracking pixels is performed on an aggregate basis.



Online analytics and advertising
When you visit our Site or open one of our emails, we may allow authorized third parties, such as
ad servers, ad agencies, ad exchanges, ad technology vendors, and research firms, to place or
recognize a unique cookie, pixel, and/or similar technologies on your browser in order to provide
you relevant Care.com advertisements as you surf the Internet.
These advertisements may be targeted
to you based on information these authorized third parties know or infer about you and include in
the cookies placed on your browser, and/or on information about your Internet browsing activities
gathered through your browser.
If you prefer not to receive these online behavioral advertisements,
you may opt-out here or here.
In order for the opt-out
to work, your
browser
must be set to accept third party cookies.
Furthermore, if you buy a new computer or mobile device,
change web browsers or delete the opt-out cookie, you will need to perform the opt-out task again.
Please note that if you opt-out you may continue to receive Care.com advertisements as you surf the
Internet, including contextual ads based on the content on a webpage you are visiting.
However,
these advertisements will not be displayed based on information contained in, or collected by,
cookies or other technologies placed on your browser when you visit our Site or open our emails.
We also use Google Analytics to measure Site usage and improve our visitor experience.
The relevant
data is provided to us by Google in the aggregate (i.e., individual users are not identified) and
allows us to better understand our Site audience.
The Google Analytics features implemented by us
allow us (i) to evaluate and generate reports on certain demographic, behavioral, and interest
metrics of users collected by Google, and (ii) to create advertising remarketing audiences and
campaigns based on such metrics, which may be segmented into aggregated groups.
Visitors can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display
Network ads using the Ads Settings form at https://www.google.com/settings/ads.


Do Not Track Notice. Some browsers used to access the Internet may give you the option
through "Do Not Track" settings associated with such browsers to request that a website operator not
track your information across its website or other websites.
We engage in such tracking in order to
optimize and/or customize our Services, detect and respond to allegations of fraud, and to otherwise
ensure the safety of our Registered Users and Site Visitors.
While we do not currently honor such
browser requests, we will not use your information in a manner that violates this Privacy Policy.
In
addition, you retain the ability to opt out of certain online analytics and advertising activities
as discussed in this section above.


Social media features and widgets Our Site includes social media features and widgets, such as the Facebook "Like" button and the
Facebook "Share" button.
These features may collect your IP address, the URL of the page you are

features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site.
Your
interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

If you are a Care Provider and have elected to verify certain information with Care.com
or to have a background check performed, we may also disclose that information in your profile as a
Registered User in addition to your response rate and any payment or payroll preferences you have
indicated.

If you post information in a Care.com online group forum, such as the Working Moms Group, that

If you are a Care
Provider, your phone number may be visible to certain Registered Users if you elect to share it in
your profile.
In addition, your approximate residential location (through Google map plotting) is made
available to certain Registered Users and Site Visitors unless you elect to keep that information
confidential.

If you are a Care Seeker or a Care Provider, you will appear in search result listings if you match
the search criteria used by a Care Provider or Care Seeker, as applicable.
Similarly, you may appear
in emails sent to Care Providers or Care Seekers in your area.
Care Seekers may opt-out of being
included in Care Provider search results and in certain emails sent to Care Providers.
In addition, if
you are a Care Seeker and you view the profile of certain Care Providers, those Care Providers will be
able to see that you have viewed their profiles unless you opt-out of that information sharing.

If you are a Registered User, your Care.com online status may be made available to other Registered
Users unless you elect to keep that information confidential.
If you connect to Care.com through Facebook, we may allow any of your Facebook friends who have
connected to Care.com through Facebook to see that you are a Registered User.

specific day care or tutoring center, the contact information you submit on a form for the provider
will be forwarded to that provider.

to a corporate Care Provider's site from the Care.com site, any information you provide over the phone
or on the provider's site will be provided by you directly to the provider.

In addition, if you utilize our Backup Care Services or the Senior Care Planning Services to obtain
information about senior care or other care options for yourself or your loved ones, information you
provide Care.com, including contact, health, financial, and other information about yourself or your
loved ones may be forwarded to third party Backup Care Providers or Senior Care Services providers

contact you.

authority to provide us the information and to authorize us to share the information in accordance
with the terms of this Privacy Policy.
Once provided to a corporate Care Provider, the information is
subject to the privacy policies of the corporate Care Provider.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a
corporate Care Provider may share information about you and your dependents who are receiving their
services, including contact information, utilization information, and medical and health-related
information, with Care.com and our subsidiary, Care Concierge, Inc.
Such shared information would be
subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

online communication platforms.

Use of the Invisible
reCAPTCHA is subject to the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.


With listings in and through Google and other public search engines, social media sites (e.g.

In an effort to further facilitate the ability of Care Seekers or Care Providers to find a caregiver
or job, selected information contained in Care Seeker job postings and Care Provider profiles, which
may include photo, first name, first initial of last name, city, state, and job/provider description,
may also be shared with third party search engines, social media sites, and other third party websites
or vendors who run classified advertising and other businesses, and thus may be listed in third party
web site search results and on third party websites, which would make that information available to
the public and allow them to link to your Care.com posting.
Registered Users can opt-out of this
sharing by adjusting their account
settings.
