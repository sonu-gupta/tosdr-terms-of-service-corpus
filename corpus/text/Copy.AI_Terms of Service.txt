&nbsp.
&nbsp.
Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes.
We each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services (collectively, âDisputesâ) will be resolved solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding.

The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules.
The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at www.adr.org.

&nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
Arbitration Costs.
Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules, and we wonât seek to recover the administration and arbitrator fees we are responsible for paying, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous.
If we prevail in arbitration weâll pay all of our attorneysâ fees and costs and wonât seek to recover them from you.

To the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration.
The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.
