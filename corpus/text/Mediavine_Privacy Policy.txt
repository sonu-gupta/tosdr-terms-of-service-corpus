We also share information about your use of our Sites and our Services with our social media, advertising and analytics partners.
This section explains what cookies are, how we use Cookies and similar technologies on our Sites and our Service and what you can do to manage how Cookies are used. What are cookies? A cookie is a small text file which is sent to your computer or mobile device (referred to in this policy as a âdeviceâ) by the web server so that a website can remember some information about your browsing activity on the Sites and Service.
The Cookie will collect information relating to your use of our Sites, information about your device such as the deviceâs IP address and browser type, demographic data and, if you arrived at our Sites and Service via a link from a third party site, the URL of the linking page.
In addition to Cookies, our Sites may use web beacons.
Web beacons allow us to count the number of users who have visited or accessed the Sites and to recognize users by accessing our cookies.
We may employ web beacons to facilitate Site administration and navigation, to track the actions of users of the Sites, to compile aggregate statistics about Site usage and response rates, and to provide an enhanced online experience for visitors to the Sites.
We may also include web beacons in HTML-formatted e-mail messages that we send to determine which e-mail messages were opened.
A web beacon is often invisible because it is only 1 x 1 pixel in size with no color.
A web beacon can also be known as a web bug, 1 by 1 GIF, invisible GIF and tracker GIF. What are the different types of cookies and how do we use them? Essential â These are Cookies which are essential for the running of our Sites and Services.
Without these Cookies, parts of our Sites and Service would not function.
These Cookies do not track where you have been on the internet and do not gather information about you that could be used for marketing purposes.
Examples of how we may use essential Cookies include:

Setting unique identifiers for each unique visitor, so that website numbers can be analyzed.

Functional â These Cookies are used to remember your preferences on our Sites and Services and to provide enhanced, more personal features.
The information collected by these Cookies is usually anonymized, so we cannot identify you personally.

Advertising â Behavioral advertising Cookies, which may be placed on your device by us or our trusted third-party service providers, remember that you have visited a website and use that information to provide you with advertising which is tailored to your interests.
This is often called online behavioral advertising and is done by grouping together shared interests based upon web browsing history.
Your web browsing history can be used to infer things about you (e.g.
your age, gender etc.), and this information may also be used to make advertising on websites more relevant to you.
Although behavioral advertising Cookies can track your activity around the internet, these Cookies cannot identify you personally.
Examples of how we may use advertising Cookies include:

Manage online advertising.
The Services may use Cookies together with web beacons to provide advertising to you on the Publisher Sites and to enable us to manage our relationship with those advertisers by, for example, tracking how many unique users have seen a particular advertisement or followed a link in an advertisement.

Third Party Cookies â You may notice on some pages of our Sites and Services that Cookies have been set that are not related to us.
When you visit a page with content embedded from, for example, YouTube or Facebook, these third party service providers may set their own Cookies on your device.
We do not control the use of these third party Cookies and cannot access them due to the way that Cookies work, as Cookies can only be accessed by the party who originally set them.
Please check the third party websites for more information about these Cookies. How can you manage or opt-out of cookies? Cookies, including those which have already been set, can be deleted from your hard drive.
