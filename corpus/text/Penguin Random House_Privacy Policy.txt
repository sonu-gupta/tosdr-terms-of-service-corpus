If you disclose any Personal Information relating to other people to us or to our service providers in connection with the Services, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

We and our service providers collect Personal Information in a variety of ways, including:

To provide the Servicesâ functionality to you, such as arranging access to your registered account, and providing you with related customer service.

To respond to your inquiries and fulfill your requests, when you contact us via one of our online contact forms or otherwise, for example, when you send us questions, suggestions, compliments or complaints, or when you request a quote for or other information about our Services.
To enable you to participate in surveys, panels or research, and public forms on our websites.
To complete your transactions, verify your information, fulfill your orders, and provide you with related customer service.
To send administrative information to you, such as changes to our terms, conditions, and policies.

To send you marketing related emails, with information about our services, new products and other news about our company.
To opt out of these emails, please see the section labeled Choices and Access.

Aggregating and/or anonymizing Personal Information


We may aggregate and/or anonymize Personal Information so that it will no longer be considered Personal Information.

Combining Personal Information


To perform the above functions, we may match information collected from you through different means or at different times, including Personal Information and Other Information (as defined below, see the section labeled Other Information) and use such information along with information collected from other sources, such as demographic information and updated contact information.&nbsp.

We may also use and/or combine information we collect off-line or from third party sources to check the accuracy of, enhance and supplement your user records, and to better customize your experience with us.

This may include laws outside your country of residence.




To cooperate with public and government authorities



To respond to a request or to provide information we believe is necessary or appropriate.

To our authors 



In some cases, we manage our authorsâ websites and related services on their behalf.
In those cases, we may transfer Personal Information collected from those Services to the authors if they take over management of the Services (in which case, such Services are no longer controlled by us).
Under such circumstances we will use reasonable efforts to direct the author to use Personal Information you have previously provided to us in a manner that is consistent with our Privacy Policy.

We will try to comply with your request(s) as soon as reasonably practicable.&nbsp.
Please note that if you opt out of receiving marketing related emails from us, we may still send you important administrative messages, from which you cannot opt out.

How you can access, change, or delete your Personal Information 

If you would like to request to access, correct, update, suppress, restrict, or delete Personal Information, object to or opt out of the processing of Personal Information, or if you would like to request to receive a copy of your Personal Information for purposes of transmitting it to another company (to the extent these rights are provided to you by applicable law), you may contact us.
We will respond to your request consistent with applicable law.&nbsp.
If you are a California resident, please refer to the âAdditional Information Regarding Californiaâ section at the end of this Policy for more information about the requests you may make under the CCPA.

For your protection, we may only implement requests with respect to the Personal Information associated with the particular email address that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request.&nbsp.
We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable.
Please note that we may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting a change or deletion.

 


SENSITIVE INFORMATION
Unless we request it, we ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive Personal Information (e.g., social security numbers, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics or criminal background) on or through the Services or otherwise to us.
 


RETENTION PERIOD
We retain Personal Information for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was obtained and consistent with applicable law.&nbsp.
The criteria used to determine our retention periods include: 

The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide the Services to you (for example, for as long as you have an account with us or keep using the Services).

Whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example, certain laws require us to keep records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete them).
or 
Whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations). 

 


SECURITY
We seek to use reasonable organizational, technical and administrative measures to protect Personal Information within our organization.&nbsp.
Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.&nbsp.
If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please immediately notify us in accordance with the âContacting Usâ section below.

 


THIRD PARTY SERVICES
This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information, or other practices of any third parties, including any third party operating any website or service to which the Services link.&nbsp.
The inclusion of a link on the Services does not imply endorsement of the linked site or service by us or by our affiliates.

In addition, we are not responsible for the information collection, use, disclosure, or security policies or practices of other organizations, such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Google, or any other social media platform provider.
 


USE OF SERVICES BY MINORS
Except for a few of our child- and teen-directed Services, these Services are not directed to individuals under the age of eighteen (18), and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from individuals under 18.

For more information on PRHâs privacy practices for child-directed Services please refer to the Childrenâs Privacy Policy below.
The Privacy Policy on our child-directed Services will automatically link to this section.
 


CHILDRENâS PRIVACY POLICY
PRH respects the privacy of children and we are committed to complying with the Childrenâs Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).
This Childrenâs Privacy Policy describes our practices with respect to the collection of Personal Information and Other Information (as defined above, see section labeled What Personal Information We Collect About You) from children under the age of 13.
This Site does not knowingly collect, use, or disclose Personal Information from children under the age of 13 without prior parental consent, except as permitted by COPPA.

What Information We Collect and How We Use It

We do not require children to share any Personal Information in order to participate on this Site.&nbsp.
On occasion, however, we may collect Personal Information, such as an email address from a child as part of an activity, in accordance with COPPA.&nbsp.
For example:



Email address
: We may collect a childâs email address in order to respond to a one-time request from the child, such as if the child asks us or one of our authors a question.&nbsp.
In such case, we promptly delete the childâs email address from our system once we have responded, and we do not use the childâs email address for any other purpose. 




Send-a-friend
: In the case of send-a-friend email or card, we only collect a childâs first name and the friendâs email address to send the friend the email or card.&nbsp.
We do not store the friendâs email address for any longer than reasonably necessary to send the email or card to the friend.







Contests or Sweepstakes
: We may collect a childâs email address to enter the child in a sweepstakes or contest or to notify the child that he or she has won or lost a contest or sweepstakes or contest.&nbsp.
We will not keep the childâs email address after the promotion or use the childâs email address for any other purpose other than for the promotion.&nbsp.
For certain promotions, we may ask that a child give us his/her parentâs email address so we can obtain more personalized information for prize fulfillment purposes if the child wins the promotion or to notify the parent if we need more than the childâs email address to enter the child in the promotion.
In the latter event,
parents will be sent a notice along with instructions on how they may provide their consent for their child to participate in such promotion.


We may also collect Other Information automatically from your childâs computer or device, such as the frequency with which the child visits our Site and the pages visited, to support the internal operations of the Site.&nbsp.
We collect this information so we can understand and monitor usage of the Site, customize content on the Site and improve the performance of the Site.
This information is collected using technologies such as cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies.&nbsp.
This information is not used to behaviorally target children and we do not permit behavioral targeting on any of our Services that are directed to children. 

Special Circumstances for Information Sharing and Security
 

We may share childrenâs personal information with âThird Party Service Providersâ and âOther Third Parties When Required by Lawâ as disclosed above (see âWith Whom We Share Your Personal Informationâ).

Parentâs Rights&nbsp.

Under COPPA, you have the right to review and have any of your childâs information deleted from our records.&nbsp.
You also have the right to tell us to stop collecting or using your childâs personal information.
If you have questions concerning our information practices with respect to children, or if you would like to review, have deleted, or stop the further collection of your childâs personal information in connection with the transaction for which it was originally collected, you may email us at privacy@penguinrandomhouse.com.
For tips on protecting your childâs privacy online, please see the U.S.
Federal Trade Commissionâs brochure on this topic: www.onguardonline.gov.

 


JURISDICTION AND CROSS-BORDER TRANSFER
These Services are published in the United States.
We attempt to protect the Personal Information of all users of our Services and we attempt to comply with local data protection and consumer rights laws to the extent they may apply to PRHâs services, but our family of Services are located and targeted to United States citizens and our policies are directed at compliance with those laws.
