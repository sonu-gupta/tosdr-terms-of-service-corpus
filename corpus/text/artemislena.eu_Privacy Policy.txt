Disclaimer
 Privacy policy The value of the Tk HTTP header already says it,
basically: We do not knowingly collect data of any kind from you.
The server saves the public IP address of your machine in RAM for
the time that it needs to complete your HTTP request.
To our
knowledge, no logging of this process is happening, except when
certain errors occur that are not 400-type such as 404
(File not found), in which case, the request, including IP address
and user agent, may be logged to the system journal, which,
however, is only stored in RAM, not on disk, and is limited to a
few MBs.
These kinds of errors do not usually occur on the website,
but may happen on certain services like Libreddit or Invidious.
These logs typically are never automatically analyzed and only
viewed if debugging needs to happen.
In such cases, they may be
shared with third parties such as the developers of the service,
but only if all identifying information is redacted beforehand.
There are no tracking scripts or pixels, no cookies, and nothing
that calls out to third parties on the website.
Some pages on this
site may link to external sites.
We are not responsible for the
privacy policies of those sites.
The server runs on a connection provided by Deutsche Telekom AG.
They have their own privacy policy, and we cannot guarantee that
they do not perform any network-level logging.
However, due to the
use of transport-level encryption, they at least cannot see what
pages you visit on this site.
