Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, Pango grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, personal, non-transferable license during the term of this Agreement to install and use one (1) copy of the provided version of the Pango Software in object code format, to access the Service for internal and personal purposes only, and on no more than five (5) Devices (as defined in Section 6.1 below).
The Pango Software is âin useâ on a Device for purposes of this paragraph when it is loaded into the temporary memory (e.g., RAM) or installed into the permanent memory (e.g., hard disk, CD-ROM or other storage device) of a Device.

5.2 Pango Software License Restrictions.

You may not (and may not allow a third party to) rent, lease, sublicense, sell, assign, loan, use for time-sharing or service bureau purposes or otherwise transfer the Pango software or any of your rights and obligations under this agreement.
You may not (and may not allow a third party to): (a) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or attempt to reconstruct, identify or discover any source code, underlying ideas, underlying user interface techniques or algorithms of the Pango Software by any means whatsoever, except to the extent that such restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law.

5.3 Content Restrictions.

You may not (and may not allow a third party to) copy, reproduce, capture, store, retransmit, distribute, or burn to cd (or any other format) any copyrighted content that you access or receive while using the Pango software or the service.
you assume all risk and liability for any such prohibited use of copyrighted content.

5.4 Recurring Payments for Paid Service using Pango Software. When you purchase a subscription to Pangoâs Paid Service in connection with your use of the Pango Software, Pango will automatically renew your subscription to the Paid Service at the end of its initial term and at the end of each term thereafter.
The renewal term will be for the same period of time as the initial term.
This period of time is known as the Subscription Period.
At the conclusion of each subscription term, you will automatically be billed for the Pango Paid Service for a renewal subscription term lasting a period of time equal to the Subscription Period.
The Pango Paid Service fee is non-refundable except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.
Taxes may apply on the subscription fee.
You agree to pay for the subscription that you select for the Paid Service and you authorize us to automatically charge the payment method our service provider has on file for your recurring payments.
If the payment mechanism (such as a credit card) we have on file for you is declined for payment of your Paid Service subscription fee, we may retry the payment mechanism at the same or lower rate.
If we do not obtain payment, your Paid Service subscription will be canceled.
If you provide us with a new form of payment and are successfully charged within 30 days after the renewal date, your new Paid Service subscription term will be based on the original renewal date and not the date of the successful charge.
If your Paid Service is terminated, you may be entitled to a refund, subject to the limitations provided in Section 9 of this Agreement.
You are responsible to canceling your subscription regardless of whether you receive any notice from Pango about the renewal of that subscription.
In the event that your payment mechanism expires prior to the renewal date of your subscription, you are responsible for updating a new payment mechanism in your Pango account before the renewal date of your subscription to the Paid Service.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, Pango makes no representations or warranties about the continued availability of any particular form of payment method made available for use with the Service.
Several methods of cancelling the automatic renewal of your Pango Paid Service subscription are available to you, and are described at the website support@touchvpn.zendesk.com.
Once you have cancelled your automatic renewal, recurring subscription fees for Pango Paid Service fees will no longer be charged to the payment method we have on file for your account, and your subscription will remain active only until the end of the term for which you have fully paid the Pango Paid Service fee.
Unless you notify us before a charge that you want to cancel or do not want to auto renew, you understand your paid service subscription will automatically renew periodically and you authorize us to collect the then-applicable paid service subscription fee plus any applicable taxes, using any payment method we have on record for you.
Pango currently uses third-party payment processors for electronic commerce.
Our third-party e-commerce payment processor accepts payments through methods detailed on the applicable payment screen, which may include various credit cards.
By using such third-party payment processors, you agree to their terms and conditions of use.
Such third parties may charge fees to process payments.
We may, but are not required to, pay certain fees at our sole discretion.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, Pango disclaims all liability with regard to any fees or problems you have with third-party payment processors.

Dispute Resolution and Arbitration

15.1 Generally. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Pango in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Pango agree that any and all disputes arising out of or relating in any way to this Agreement or your use of the Service shall be resolved by binding arbitration.
Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.
Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts.
Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.
Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of this Agreement, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of this Agreement.
You understand and agree that, by entering into this agreement, you and Pango are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.

15.2

Notwithstanding Section 15.1, you and Pango agree that nothing herein shall be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.

15.3 Arbitrator.

Any arbitration between you and Pango will be conducted in English by a single arbitrator and will be governed by (i) the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ), if you are a resident of the United States, or (ii) the Swiss Rules of International Arbitration of the Swiss Chambersâ Arbitration Institution (âSCAIâ) in force on the date on which the Notice is submitted, if you are not a resident of the United States, in each case as modified by this Agreement (in either case, the âRulesâ), and will be administered by, respectively, the AAA in case (i) and the SCAI in case (ii).
The Rules and filing forms are available online at, respectively, www.adr.org or 800-778- 7879 (for the AAA), or www.swissarbitration.org or 41 44 217 40 50 (for the SCAI), or by contacting Pango.

15.4 Notice.
Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for You, by electronic mail (âNoticeâ).
For United States residents, Pangoâs address for Notice is: Pango Inc., 541 Jefferson Ave, Suite 100, Redwood City, CA 94063, USA.
For all other persons, Pangoâs address for Notice is: Pango GmbH, Hansmatt 32, 6370 Stans, Switzerland.
The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.
and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (âDemandâ).
We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, You or Pango may commence an arbitration proceeding.
During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by You or Pango shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.
provided that if our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Pango shall pay you the greater of (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, or (ii) the greatest amount offered by Pango in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitratorâs award, whichever is greater.

15.5 Fees.

In the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with this Agreement, Pango will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by the Rules.
Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Santa Clara County, California for United States residents, and at a location to be agreed upon in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland for all other persons, provided that if the claim is for US $10,000 or less, You may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the Rules.
If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in the United States Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the Rules.
In such case, you agree to reimburse Pango for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the Rules.
Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.
