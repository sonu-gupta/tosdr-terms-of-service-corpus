         Terms of Service

Ninite is provided to you on an "as is" and "as available" basis.
Your use
of the service is at your sole risk.


The free version of Ninite is only licensed for home use and as a trial for
Ninite Pro.
If you get paid for
running Ninite (like in an IT department, PC shop, managed service provider,
school, non-volunteer helpdesk, etc.) you must upgrade to
Ninite Pro.


Ninite Pro accounts and installers are good for one business/organization.
Please don't share them more broadly.

For managed service providers or IT support firms it's fine to use one big account across multiple clients.
Your firm is considered the one organization in that case.


Ninite installs third-party software.
By using Ninite you certify that you
have read and agree with the license agreements and restrictions of any
software you install with Ninite.
Ninite does not grant you any license to
any third-party software available on Ninite or elsewhere, nor does Ninite
guarantee the availability of any third-party software.


Please send us an email
if you have further questions.
