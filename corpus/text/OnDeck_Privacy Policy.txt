OnDeck Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy has been updated effective October 13, 2020. 


Overview

This Privacy Policy (âPolicyâ) applies to data collected by On Deck Capital, Inc.
and ODK Capital, LLC, which are wholly owned subsidiaries of Enova International, Inc.
doing business under the OnDeck brand (collectively with their respective subsidiaries and affiliates, âOnDeck,â âUs,â Ourâ or Weâ), a provider of business loan products and related services (collectively âServicesâ).
 The Policy has two parts:


Part 1 provides our U.S. Privacy Policy,  including our Privacy Policy for Ondeck.com (âWebsiteâ),&nbsp.
which is owned by  Enova and operated by OnDeck.
This Policy describes how OnDeck collects and uses the personal information you provide (directly or through third parties), or which is automatically generated when you interact with our Website, and our mobile application (âMobile Appâ).



Part 2 is our California Supplement, which provides our California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (âCCPAâ) Privacy Policy. The CCPA&nbsp.
provides various rights to consumers who reside in California with regard to personal information.&nbsp.
A natural person, including a  business owner or guarantor, is considered to be a consumer under the CCPA.&nbsp.
Any terms defined in the CCPA have the same meaning when used in Part 2.


Part 1: OnDeck US Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update such information.&nbsp.
For purposes of this Privacy Policy, âPersonal Informationâ means information that personally identifies you, including your contact information, IP address, and loan application information.
A large portion of the Personal Information we collect, use, share, and store is sensitive in nature, including your social security number and financial account information (âSensitive Personal Informationâ).

Information We Collect

We collect the following information from you:

Contact information such as name, business name, email address, mailing address, and phone number;
Financial information such as bank statements, credit card statements, your average bank balance, personal and business credit history, payment behavior, bank account information, and tax ID number;
Social security number;
Unique identifiers such as user name and password, and IP address;
Business information including company size, and business type, and
Beneficial ownership information*

In addition to collecting information via our Website and Mobile App, we may also conduct a site visit to collect information, and obtain information and external data used by lenders to process applications and complete and manage transactions, e.g., from credit reporting agencies and other vendors, as well as from social media.
Once you are an OnDeck customer, we may reach out to you for, or otherwise obtain, information if you decide to renew your loan or as otherwise needed to provide the Service.
* When required in the U.S., we will collect information on the beneficial owners of our business customers for purposes of verifying their identity only.
The U.S.
Government implemented the beneficial ownership regulation to help deter financial crimes.
By complying, we are doing part in upholding the regulation to protect the financial system.
Pursuant to our privacy policies and procedures, we will maintain beneficial ownership information in our system of record.

 Use of Information

We use the information we collect to:

Compile, save, use and analyze your Personal Information in both a personally identifiable form and as part of aggregated data;
