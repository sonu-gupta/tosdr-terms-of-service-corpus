Renewal: The initial term of Service shall be as set forth in the SOA (âInitial Termâ) and shall begin on the Start of Service Date.
If no Initial Term is set forth in an SOA, the initial term of Service shall be one (1) year.
If neither: Company notifies Customer of its intent not to renew the Agreement or any Service(s) provided pursuant to the Agreement, nor the Customer requests disconnection of Service(s) before the end of the Initial Term or any renewal term, then the Agreement and Service(s) provided pursuant thereof, unless otherwise provided in a SOA shall automatically renew for an identical term pursuant to the rates, terms and conditions contained in the Agreement.
Company, from time to time, will notify Customer in writing by bill message insert or otherwise of the automatic renewal pertaining to the Agreement and Service(s).

(If Service is suspended for nonpayment, Customer may be assessed reconnect fees and/or be required to pay a deposit equal to two monthâs charges prior to any reconnection of the Service.) If, following the suspension of Service, Customer fails to pay all amounts required under the Agreement within ten (10) days of the date of a notice of termination letter sent to Customer, the Company will terminate all Customer Service(s) (and the underlying Agreement(s)).
If, after the Start of Service Date, Customer fails to comply with any other material term of an Agreement, and such failure continues for thirty (30) days after written notice thereof from Company to Customer, Company will terminate Service(s) (and the underlying Agreement(s)).
Upon termination, Customer, at its expense, will receive written notice from Company establishing a time period within which it must remove all its equipment from RISE BROADBAND premises.
Any equipment not timely removed shall be deemed to have been abandoned by Customer and shall become the property of RISE BROADBAND to do with as it sees fit.
In the event of such termination for cause, Customer will be required to pay, in addition to all other amounts due and owing Company, applicable early termination charges equal to: (a) one-hundred percent (100%) of any Monthly Recurring Charges due for Service during the remainder of the Initial Term or any renewal term.

provided, however, that for Services with usage-based charges, if Customer has made an annual or other revenue commitment, the early termination charge assessed in subpart (b) above shall be an amount equal to the difference between the Customerâs commitment over the remaining Initial Term or any renewal term and the Service actually used by Customer up to the date of Service termination.

28.3.1 When Services furnished under this Agreement are used in common with Local Exchange Carrier services, the power of the signal applied to Local Exchange Carrier lines must be limited in order to prevent excessive noise and crosstalk.
Because a single valued limit for all applications cannot be specified, the Company will, for each application, specify the power of the signal in the band above 300 Hertz, which may be applied by the Customer Terminal Equipment at the point of termination.
28.3.2 To protect Services from interference at frequencies that are above the band of service provided, the Company will specify the acceptable signal power in the following bands to be applied by the Customer Terminal Equipment or communications systems at the point of termination to ensure that the input to Local Exchange Carrier lines does not exceed the following limits:
28.3.2.1 the signal applied by the Customer Terminal Equipment to the interface at no time shall have energy solely in the 2450 Hertz to 2750 Hertz range.
If the signal is in the 2450 to 2750 Hertz range, it must not exceed the power present at the same time in the 800 to 2450 Hertz band;
28.3.2.2 the power in the band from 3995 Hertz to 4005 Hertz shall be at least 18 dB below the power of the signal as specified above for the 2450 Hertz to 2750 Hertz range;
28.3.2.3 the power in the band from 4000 Hertz to 10,000 Hertz shall not exceed 16 dB below one milliwatt;

28.4.1 the maximum root-means-square (rms) value, including DC and AC components, of the current per conductor will not exceed .035 ampere;
28.4.2 the magnitude of the peak of the conductor or ground voltage shall not exceed 70 volts;
28.4.3 the conductor voltage shall be such that the conductor ground voltage limit in Section 28.4.2 preceding is not exceeded.
If the signal source is not grounded, the voltage limit in Section 28.4.4 preceding applies to the conductor-to-conductor voltage.
