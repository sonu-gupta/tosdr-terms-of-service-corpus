15.
Dispute Resolution.

15.1.
Any dispute arising out of these Terms of Use shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration conducted by the American Arbitration Association (the âAAAâ).
Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited.
However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual.
and an arbitrator must also follow the terms of these Terms, as a court would.
All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability and the scope or enforceability of this agreement to arbitrate shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide.
Arbitration shall take place in Washington, DC, unless We elect otherwise.

15.2.
The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the District of Columbia, without regard to any conflict-of-law rules or the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.
The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different Site users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same Site user to the extent required by applicable law.
The arbitratorâs award shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAAâs rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate.
If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, we will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration.
Any request for payment of fees by Us should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your demand for arbitration and We will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA.
If the value of the relief sought is more than $10,000 and you are able to demonstrate that the costs of accessing arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of accessing a court for purposes of pursuing litigation on an individual basis, we will pay as much of the filing, administration, and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the costs of accessing arbitration from being prohibitive.
In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse Us for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by Us on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAAâs rules.
If an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this agreement to arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this agreement to arbitrate shall still apply.

15.3.
You can choose to reject this agreement to arbitrate by mailing Us a written opt-out notice (âOpt-Out Noticeâ).
The Opt-Out Notice must be postmarked no later than thirty days after the date you accept these Terms of Use for the first time.
You must complete the Opt-Out Notice form by providing the information called for in the form, including your name, address (including street number and address, city, state, and zip code), phone number, and the email address used to log in to the G.
Brown account to which the opt-out applies.
You must sign the Opt-Out Notice for it to be effective.
This procedure is the only way you can opt out of the agreement to arbitrate.
If you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, all other parts of these Terms of Use will continue to apply.
Opting out of this agreement to arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with Us.

16.
Governing Law.

16.1.
Without limiting the terms of Section 15, these Terms and use of the Site are governed by the laws of the District of Columbia, without regard to Washington, DC conflict of laws rules.
If the arbitration agreement is deemed unenforceable or void, you irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in Washington, DC, for purposes of any legal action arising out of or related to the use of the Site or these Terms.

17.
Miscellaneous.

17.1.
The Site is controlled and operated from within the United States.
Without limiting anything else, we make no representation that the Site, Site Content, User Content, services, products, information or other materials available on, in, or through the Site is appropriate or available for use in other locations, and access to them from territories where they are illegal is prohibited.
Those who choose to access the Site from outside the United States do so on their own will and are responsible for compliance with applicable laws.

17.2.
These Terms, including the Privacy and Cookie Notice , constitute the whole legal agreement between you and Portable.TV and govern your use of the Site and any transactions you may have with Portable.TV through the Site and completely replaces and supersedes any prior agreements or understanding, arrangements, undertaking or proposal, written or oral, between you and Portable.TV in relation to such matters.

You agree that Portable.TV is under no obligation to provide you with notices regarding changes to the Terms.
You understand that it is your responsibility to check the Terms regularly for changes.

17.3.
The failure of Portable.TV to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms will not operate as a waiver of any such right or provision.
The section titles in the Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of the Terms does not affect or impair in any way the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein.
No person or entity not party to this agreement will be deemed to be a third-party beneficiary of these Terms or any provision hereof.
When used herein, the words âincludesâ and âincludingâ and their syntactical variations shall be deemed followed by the words âwithout limitation.

17.4.
