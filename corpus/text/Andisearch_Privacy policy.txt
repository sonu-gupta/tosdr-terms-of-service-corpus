We only collect and retain sufficient data to help our customers use the service effectively, when they want to create an account or be remembered between devices and sessions, and to improve the service we provide.
No data is shared with any other person or company, and personal information is not available to our team members beyond that directly required for customer support and service.
What we do to try to protect you

An embedded video might have cookies outside of our control.


Earning trust
We know we have to earn our customers' trust through our actions.
Our mission is to protect privacy, and we're trying to do it in a practical and useful way that's accessible to as many people as possible.
While we're in early test stages (alpha and beta) our privacy technology and systems will be evolving, and we expect to make changes and try different things, based on the principles here.
We're only a small team, but we are committed to our mission.
We're actively seeking feedback from our community about doing privacy right.
We support the principles of GDPR, and before we move out of prototype stage and release commercially, we will implement a fully GDPR-compliant privacy policy.
We commit to having our privacy systems, practices and technology audited by a reputable firm and the results made public before we leave beta testing.
We welcome feedback, help and suggestions! Email us at info@andisearch.com.AboutPrivacyHelpMade with â¤ï¸ by the Andi team
