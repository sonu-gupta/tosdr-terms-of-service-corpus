If our provision of the Services, or support for the App, or the Services, is delayed or otherwise impacted by an event outside our control then we will not be liable for any default that arises or may arise directly or indirectly from the same. 
26.9	Use of the App at your own risk. The App, and the Services are provided for the Purpose.
You acknowledge that each card scheme (i.e.
the relevant scheme under which your personal cards form part) and each provider of such cards (i.e.
your personal bank) may update and/or change certain benefits relating to the card type, from time to time.
Vitracash will use best endeavours to ensure that the appropriate card is used in each transaction.
However, you agree and acknowledge that VitraCash makes such choice at its own discretion and shall not be liable to you for any losses you may suffer as a result of such choice being made by VitraCash (i.e. certain levels of interest being charged under a chosen credit card or failure to obtain a preferred benefit, such as travel insurance).
Accordingly, you give VitraCash full right to make the relevant card choice on your behalf without having to obtain your approval for each transaction undertaken utilising the Services.
Accordingly, you use the App at your own risk.
26.10	Liability of VitraCash is limited.
Subject to clause 26.2, the total liability of VitraCash (whether stated in this clause 23 or otherwise determined), whether in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise and whether in connection with this licence, the Service or any collateral contract, shall in no circumstances exceed a sum equal to the Fees paid during the six (6) month period immediately before the date on which the cause of action first arose.
26.11	Tax.
It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the payments you make or receive, and it is your responsibility to collect, report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority.
We are not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your Transactions, or for collecting, reporting or remitting any taxes arising from any Transaction.
27.

WE MAY TRANSFER THIS AGREEMENT TO SOMEONE ELSE

We will always tell you in writing before this happens.
After notice is received by you, you may object to the assignment or transfer before the assignment or transfer takes effect.
If you notify us that you object to the assignment, this will serve as notice that you wish to terminate these terms and close your VitraCash Account in accordance with these Terms. 
29.
YOU NEED OUR CONSENT TO TRANSFER YOUR RIGHTS TO SOMEONE ELSE
You may only transfer or assign your rights, or your obligations under these Terms to another person if we agree in writing.

IF A COURT FINDS PART OF THIS CONTRACT ILLEGAL, THE REST WILL CONTINUE IN FORCE

If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.
32.
EVEN IF WE DELAY IN ENFORCING THIS CONTRACT, WE CAN STILL ENFORCE IT LATER
Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it later.
If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these Terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking this contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things, and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date.
