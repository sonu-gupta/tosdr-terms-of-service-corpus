Last Modified: November 26, 2019
 
SamplesAndSavings.com (âwe,â âus,â or âourâ) operates
the http://www.SamplesandSavings.com website
and other associated websites (collectively, the âSitesâ), where we provide you
with links to sites that offer the best free samples of brand name products
including household goods and health and beauty aids (âFree Sample
Linksâ) by providing us with certain information.
By accessing and using the Sites,
you agree to and accept these Terms &amp.
Conditions, as well as our Privacy
Policy and any additional terms, conditions and policies published on our Sites
(collectively, the âAgreementâ).&nbsp.
If you do not agree to and accept the
terms of the Agreement in their entirety, you do not have permission to visit
and/or use any of the Sites.

Mandatory Arbitration.
 These Terms &amp.
Conditions contain a
mandatory arbitration provision, as detailed below, that requires you to
arbitrate, individually, all disputes or claims that you may have with us, our
parent, related parties, advertiser clients and marketing partners
(collectively, âMarketing Partnersâ) who are third-party beneficiaries of the
mandatory arbitration provision.&nbsp.
Thus, for
example, if you provide prior express written consent to be contacted via
telemarketing or SMS/text messaging, any claims that you may have regarding any
telemarketing or SMS/text messages that you receive are subject to the
mandatory arbitration provision.&nbsp.
The
mandatory arbitration provision also waives your right to participate in a
class action or multi-party arbitration.&nbsp.
There are two narrow exceptions
to the mandatory arbitration provision: (1) you may opt-out by providing written notice of your decision to do so within thirty
(30) days of the date that you first register on one of our Sites.
and (2) you
may opt-out by filing a claim in Small Claims court provided the requirements
described below are met.

How the Site Works.  We comb the Internet for links to sites that offer the best free samples of brand name
products including household goods and health and beauty aids (âFree Sample
Linksâ).
 We are able to provide the Free Sample Links at no charge to
our consumers by them providing us with certain information about themselves
that enables us to identify products and services that may interest them and
sharing this information with our marketing partners.
 Our marketing
partners compensate us for connecting them with interested consumers.
To qualify to get access to the Free Sample
Links, youâll need to enter a valid e-mail address as well as your name,
address, and date of birth.
You may also need to respond to a series of survey
questions.
 You may also be asked to confirm that all of your information
is accurate and agree to be contacted by our marketing partners, typically via
email.
 In some cases, we will ask you to consent to be called and/or
texted by our marketing partners.
 You do not need to consent to be called
or texted to purchase the advertised item or to gain access to the Free Sample
Links.
 Then, you will be presented with Free Sample Links which enable
you to get samples of cosmetics, household items and other goods or services
from your favorite brands.
 If you click on a particular link, youâll
usually be directed to a website operated by the provider of the free sample
who may ask for your contact information so they can send you the free sample.
 The products and goods and services offered in the Free Sample Links may
change from time to time so please stop back and see whatâs available.

Telemarketing and Text Messages.  Where you provide âprior express
written consentâ within the meaning of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act

calls, pre-recorded messages and/or calls delivered via automated technology
and text and SMS messages to the telephone number(s) that you provided from us
and the marketing partners listed in and hyperlinked to the consent.
 You
are not required to provide this consent to obtain access to the Free Sample
Links and other offers on the Sites and your consent simply allows us to
contact you via these means.
 If you provide consent, CAC a related party
of ours and any of our other related parties ("Related Party") or
marketing artners named in the consent may send you SMS messages from their
short codes or long codes.
 Our short codes are 53294 and 411411.

messages per month.

not liable for delayed or undelivered messages.

Site and the content, information, documents, graphics and images displayed on
the Site are provided by us and our marketing partners, sample providers,
sample manufacturers and other third parties and could include inaccuracies,
typographical errors or other errors.

An AAA arbitrator will have exclusive authority
to resolve any dispute or claims that you may have with usâand our Marketing
Partners who are third-party beneficiaries of the mandatory arbitration
provisionâarising out of or related to the Agreement.&nbsp.
Matters subject to mandatory arbitration
include, without limitation, whether this Arbitration/Dispute Resolution
provision applies to your particular claim or dispute, and any claim that all
or any part of the Agreement, including this provision, are/is unenforceable.&nbsp.
If the claim is against us, you will need our
mailing address to file online.&nbsp.
To obtain our
mailing address, contact us by clicking here.
Either party may submit the dispute for resolution by arbitration at a location reasonably convenient to both parties.&nbsp.
If either party files for arbitration, it will be conducted in accordance with the then current AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules.  

If you proceed to arbitration against us, you
will pay all AAA filing fees and we will pay for all administration and
arbitrator fees unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous
or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b).&nbsp.
For claims brought by you of Ten
Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) or less, you can choose whether the arbitration
proceeds in person, by telephone or based only on submissions.&nbsp.
The
arbitrator may award any form of individual or equitable relief, including
injunctive relief.&nbsp.
Any award will be final and conclusive to the parties
and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.&nbsp.
If you
initiate arbitration against us and the arbitrator awards you relief that is
greater than our final written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was
selected, then we will pay you a minimum recovery of Five Hundred Dollars
($500.00), plus we will reimburse any reasonable expenses incurred by your
attorney, if any, including fees reasonably accrued for investigating,
preparing and pursuing the claim in arbitration.&nbsp.
Although under some laws
we may have a right to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses if we prevail
in arbitration, we agree that we will not seek such an award from you.&nbsp.
You and your attorneys are not required to keep the results of the arbitration
confidential.&nbsp.
You agree to the entry of injunctive relief to stop such a
lawsuit or to remove you as a participant in such a suit. 

Class Action Waiver.  The arbitration provision contained in
these Terms &amp.
Conditions does not constitute a waiver of any of your rights
and remedies to pursue a claim individually and not as a class action in
binding arbitration as provided above.&nbsp.
This provision preventing you from
bringing, joining or participating in class action lawsuits is an independent
agreement.&nbsp.


Exceptions to Mandatory Arbitration.&nbsp.
There are two narrow exceptions to mandatory arbitration.&nbsp.
First, you may opt-out of the
Arbitration/Dispute Resolution provision by providing written notice of your
decision within thirty (30) days of the date that you first register on the Site.&nbsp.
To obtain our mailing address, contact us by
clicking here.&nbsp.

Second, you may choose to pursue your dispute or
claim in Small Claims Court rather than by arbitration but only if your dispute
or claim qualifies for Small Claims Court in a location where jurisdiction and
venue over both you and SamplesAndSavings.com is proper.
Other than these two exceptions, you must
arbitrate any claims as provided above.

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, VIA YOUR
ACCEPTANCE OF THESE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS, YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A
JURY TRIAL, AS WELL AS YOUR RIGHT TO BRING, JOIN OR PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF
OR A CLASS MEMBER IN A CLASS ACTION SUIT OR MULTI-PARTY ARBITRATION BROUGHT
AGAINST US, OUR MARKETING PARTNERS OR ANY SERVICE PROVIDER USED BY US TO
PROVIDE THE SUBJECT SERVICE.


LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  WHEN PERMITTED BY LAW, WE AND OUR
MARKETING PARTNERS, SAMPLE PROVIDERS AND SAMPLE MANUFACTURERS, WILL NOT BE
RESPONSIBLE FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUES, OR DATA, FINANCIAL LOSSES OR INDIRECT,
SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.
 TO THE EXTENT
PERMITTED BY LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF US, AND OUR MARKETING PARTNERS, SAMPLE
PROVIDERS AND SAMPLE MANUFACTURERS, FOR ANY CLAIMS UNDER THESE TERMS &amp.
CONDITIONS, INCLUDING FOR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU
PAID US TO USE THE SITE AND THE SERVICES.
 IN ALL CASES, WE AND OUR
MARKETING PARTNERS, SAMPLE PROVIDERS AND SAMPLE MANUFACTURERS, WILL NOT BE
LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE THAT IS NOT REASONABLY FORESEEABLE.

Indemnification.  You agree to indemnify, hold
harmless and defend us, our shareholders, directors, employees and agents from
and against any action, cause, claim, damage, debt, demand or liability,
including reasonable costs and attorneyâs fees, asserted by any person or
entity, arising out of or relating to: (a) these Terms &amp.
Conditions and/or
any breach or alleged or threatened breach by you.
(b) your use of the Site or
any search results or other content or materials or services transmitted or
received by you.
(c) any unacceptable or objectionable use of the Site by you.
or (d) any negligent or willful misconduct by you.

Integration and Conflicting Terms.
Severability.
 These Terms &amp.
Conditions and the
Privacy Policy as referenced herein, constitute the complete and exclusive
agreement between you and us with respect to use of the Site and supersedes any
and all prior or contemporaneous communications, representations, statements,
agreements and understandings, whether in oral, written or electronic form,
between you and us concerning the use of the Site.
These Terms &amp.
Conditions
and the Privacy Policy shall be construed as consistent with each other
whenever possible, but if such construction is unreasonable due to conflicting
terms, the terms of the terms of the Privacy Policy shall control over the
Terms &amp.
Conditions.
Any provision of these Terms &amp.
Conditions
which is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable in
any jurisdiction shall be severable from these Terms &amp.
Conditions in that
jurisdiction without in any way invalidating the remaining provisions of these
Terms &amp.
Conditions.
The unenforceability of any provision in a given
jurisdiction shall not make that provision unenforceable in any other
jurisdiction.
