        What are cookies? Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website.
The term âcookieâ is used in this Cookie Statement in the broad sense to include cookies and all similar techniques and technologies, including web beacons.&nbsp.
Web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs") are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Online Properties or taken an action in relation to our Online Properties.  
Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.  
Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Eventbrite) are called "first-party cookies." Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies." Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics).
The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.
For more information on cookies, go to allaboutcookies.org.
&nbsp.
Why do we use cookies? Eventbrite uses first- and third-party cookies for several reasons.
Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Online Properties to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies.
Other cookies enable us to better understand your use of our Online Properties, to track and target the interests of our Users, and to enhance the experience of Users on our Online Properties.
Third parties serve cookies through our Online Properties for advertising, analytics and other purposes. 
Organizers can also use cookies on our Online Property to learn more about your interests in their event(s).
These practices are described in more detail below.
&nbsp.
Types of cookies we use 
First-party cookies

 
These cookies are created by Eventbrite.
They are primarily used to allow you to browse our Online Properties and use their features.
They may also assist us in our analytics activities.
These cookies may use non-personal data (e.g., aggregate or de-identified information about your use of the Online Properties) or information that uniquely identifies the browser or device you are using to access the Online Properties. 
&nbsp.

Third-party cookies

&nbsp.
In addition to the first-party cookies we use, some third-party companies may place cookies on your computer through our Online Properties, access those cookies, and associate web beacons with them.
These cookies enable third-party features or functionalities to be provided on or through our Online Properties.
The parties that set these third-party cookies can use them to recognise your device both when it visits our Online Properties and also when it visits certain other, unaffiliated websites.

&nbsp.
We use temporary cookies on our Online Properties to allow you to browse our Online Properties without interruption.
We may also use temporary cookies for internal reporting purposes.
After your browsing session ends, this type of cookie does not store any information on your hard drive.
&nbsp.

Persistent cookies

&nbsp.
Some of our first-party analytics cookies and certain third-party cookies are persistent cookies.
They allow us and third parties to understand visitorsâ browsing behaviour over a longer period of time, to provide you with additional features related to your use of the Online Properties, the content that you have saved or stored through them, as well as for advertising and marketing purposes.
Depending on their function, this type of cookie may persist for different lengths of time ranging from several hours, to a week, or even several years.

Cookie management If you want to control your cookie preferences, please follow the instructions below.
 
Additionally, for European Eventbrite domains, you have the option to adjust what cookies you allow us to place on your browser through our Cookie Settings tool.

All cookies: You can exercise your preference to receive all types of cookies by managing cookies using your web browser settings.
As the means by which you may allow or refuse cookies using browser settings varies from one web browser to another (e.g., Chrome, Safari, or Firefox), you should visit your web browserâs help menu for more information on setting your browser-based cookie preferences.

At the moment, it is technically impossible for you to synchronise your settings between your browsers and your devices (your computer or your smartphone).
You must set them on each browser/device that you currently use and each time you use a new browser or device.
Please note that if you choose not to allow, or otherwise disable or deactivate all cookies, this will apply to all cookie types and will affect the functionality of our Online Properties.
