Opting Out

You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link found in each of the marketing emails you receive from us or by contacting our customer service.
Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, you are not prohibiting us from using your personal data for other purposes, including personal data provided to us as a result of a product/service purchase, warranty registration, product/service experience or other transactions.

If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.

INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS 

We share your personal data within the ABS-CBN Group to internal third parties located in the countries specified in the definition of âInternal third partiesâ in the Glossary.
This will involve transferring your data outside your current location.

Many of our external third parties are based internationally so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside your location.

 Whenever we transfer your personal data internationally, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented: 


We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the appropriate government agency.
Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the appropriate government agency which give personal data the same protection it has under the law applicable to you.
Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.



Please contact our DPO or customer service if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data internationally.

In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know.
They are only permitted to process your personal data on our instruction and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

8.
DATA RETENTION 


How Long Will You Use My Personal Data For? 

We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, regulatory or reporting requirements.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
In some circumstances, you can ask us to delete your data.

Your Legal Rights
 You have the right to: 

Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a âdata subject access requestâ).
This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.

Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you.
This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.

Request erasure of your personal data.
This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.
You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law.
Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.

Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.
You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.
In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.

Request restriction of processing of your personal data.
This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the dataâs accuracy.
(b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.
(c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.

Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party.
We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.
Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.

Withdraw consent at any timewhere we are relying on and need your consent to process your personal data.
However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.
If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you.
We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.


Your California Privacy Rights
