What does Njalla mean? 

 From the dictionary: A njalla is a traditional type of storage hut or cache built on top of a long stump of a tree or pole in order to prevent animals getting hold of the contents (typically food or other perishables).

 The word is referring to the classic SÃ¡mi way of keeping the non-wanted beasts out of the stuff you care about.




What separates Njalla from traditional domain name registration services? 

 We're not actually a domain name registration service, we're a customer to these.
We sit in between the domain name registration service and you, acting as a privacy shield.

 When you purchase a domain name through Njalla, we own it for you.
However, the agreement between us grants you full usage rights to the domain.
Whenever you want to, you can transfer the ownership to yourself or some other party.




What packages do you have? 

 We don't do packages.
All of the domains include the same service, if you use them or not.
We want to keep things simple and we're not trying to compete on price but security.
We will never be the cheapest domain name registration service but we'll always be the most privacy centered one.

 That's our promise to you.




How can I register? 

 We support signing up for our service using e-mail or XMPP (and yes, we use OTR).
For e-mail we also support PGP so all of our outgoing e-mail will be signed and encrypted.




Who's behind Njalla? 

 We're a team of committed internet activists and we're also involved in other privacy projects such as the IPredator VPN service (now part of Njalla).
Some of us have also been involved in projects like The Pirate Bay and PiratbyrÃ¥n to mention a few things.
Or to keep it simple.
we've got a long history and serious understanding of the issues of anonymity on the internets.

 We care about your right to privacy.
We believe it's an important piece of democracy that we have the right to be anonymous.

 Njalla was started because we couldn't find a domain name service that we ourselves wanted to use.
Our goals are to be caring about privacy, simple and flexible.

 When you buy a domain in our system, we're actually purchasing it for ourselves.
We will be the actual owners of the domain, it's not an ownership by proxy as found with all other providers.
However, you will still have the full control over the domain name.
You can either use our information, our nameservers or you can go with your custom data.

 If you ever want to move the domain from our system, we'll of course give you the domain without any additional costs.

 The idea is to make sure that we minimise your visibility to the public.
We're not going to give your customer data out easily.
However, we will help if there are legal merits to any formal government requests to our system.
If you use our service in a way that affects anyones health or safety, we reserve the right to suspend your service.

 Njalla is run by 1337 LLC based in Nevis.
