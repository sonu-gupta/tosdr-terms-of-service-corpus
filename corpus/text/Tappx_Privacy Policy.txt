What information Tappx will collect



Device and app informationâ this category includes your deviceâs type and model, system language, the deviceâs operating system (such as Android or iOS), SDK version, mobile carrier name, mobile browsers installed on the device (such as Chrome or Safari, your deviceâs IP address, and identifiers assigned to your device, such as its iOS Identifier for Advertising (IDFA), Android Advertising ID, or other types of unique device identifiers (a number uniquely allocated to your device by your device manufacturer).

Ad informationâ this category includes information about the online ads and personalized content we have served (or attempted to serve) to you.
It includes things like how many times an ad has been served to you, what page the ad appeared on, whether you viewed, clicked on or otherwise interacted with the ad, ad engagement history and whether you visited the Advertiserâs website, downloaded an app or purchased the product or service advertised.

Location informationâ Tappx collects information about your general location (such as country).
For example, we may use the IP address to identify your general location.
This information does not tell us where your device is precisely located.
This information is sent as a normal part of internet traffic.
In addition, we also collect implicit location information, which allows us to infer that you are either interested in a place or that you might be at the place â this information does not actually tell us where your device is precisely located.

In addition, Tappx may collect the precise location of your device (using GPS signals, device sensors, Wi-Fi access points, Bluetooth signals, Beacons signals and cell tower ids that can be used to derive or estimate precise location, or other geo-location data), when location services have been enabled by the end user for the mobile app or website that uses our SDK (you typically have to choose to turn on device-based location services).


Log informationâ this category includes the app or website visited, time zone, and network connection type (e.g., WiFi, cellular).

Information from advertising partners (âAdvertisersâ) and other third partiesâ this category includes information we receive from our Publishers, Advertisers and other Partners that we work with to help us deliver ads and personalized content to you and recognize you across browsers and devices.
This may include pseudonymous advertiser identifiers that some Advertisers or other third party ad platforms choose to share with us.
This information is also used to enhance data points about a particular unique browser or device.

Demographic Information â this category includes information like gender, age, marital status, year of birth.

Referred Collectively âAd Dataâ

Tappx Role when processing Ad Data
Depending on the way Tappx will collect Ad Data Tappx will operate as a Independent Data Controller or just a pure Processor following Publisherâs instructions and directions, not having in any case direct relationship with the End Users whose information Tappx will process.
âData 
Controllerâ means an entity that determines the purposes and means of the processing of Personal Data.  Processorâ means an entity that processes Personal Data on behalf of a Data Controller.
In any case, Tappx will process Personal Data only on the legal grounds allowed under EU Data Protection Laws including General Data Protection Regulation (Contractual Necessity, Legitimate Interest and Consent).
Permitted uses of Ad Data

Serve interest-based advertising and personalized contentâ enable our partners to infer interests and serve ads and personalized content to users based on their behavior, app activity and inferred interests.
We will not serve interest-based ads or personalized content based on information that we consider sensitive, such as race, religion or health.
An End User is not under any obligation to provide us with any Personal Data.
In cases, where an End User is from EEA, we serve them interest-based advertisements, only when they have given us their express consent to use their Personal Data to enable us to serve interest based ads directed to them.
Even if you opt-out of interest-based advertising or have not given your express consent to interest-based advertising, you will still receive âgenericâ ads from Tappx which are context based or better known as âcontextual advertisingâ.
EEA means, the European Economic Area, United Kingdom and Switzerland


Ad reporting and conversionsâ measure ad performance, report to Advertisers or Demand Partners when and how users have viewed or clicked on their ads, or visited their website, and to report to Publishers when and how ads were shown on their properties and were clicked on.

Analytics and frequency cappingâ allow our Publishers to analyze their applications (for this purpose, we use aggregated and anonymous benchmark data) and prevent users from seeing the same ad too many times.
We also use usage information to analyze our web traffic, to figure out how often customers use parts of the site, to improve the site and generally to make it appealing to as many users as possible.

Fraud detection and preventionâ identify invalid or incentivized clicks (or ad queries) and protect Tappx and our partners from fraudulent behavior.
Enforce our policies, resolve disputes and communicate with you.

Providing and improving our servicesâ audit, research and analyze information in order to maintain, protect, and improve our services and develop new services, and to ensure that our technologies function properly.


 

Collectively, âPermitted Purposes
â


 

Information Sharing

A Publisher whose app you have accessed toâ we share information about how you have interacted with that Publisherâs app and its ads and personalized content, if any tailored ad.

Ways to Collect Information
Tappx have developed different technological tracking tools to collect information from End User device, such as:

Our SDK â the SDK is a bit of computer code that app developers (such as our Publishers) can include in their apps to enable ads and personalized content to be shown, data to be collected, and related services to be implemented.
Along with our Partners, we may use tracking technologies such as cookies, JavaScript, beacons and Local Storage such as HTML5.
Our Partners may also use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as Flash.
Local Storage (LS) such as HTML5 and Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as Flash are used to store content information and preferences.
Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSâs.
Beacons are clear graphic image(s) of 1Ã1 pixel that is delivered through a web browser usually as part of a webpage request.
Web beacons operate as a tag that records an End Users visit to a particular webpage.
Our Publisher may use cookies to track your behavior on their apps or websites.
A cookie is a small piece of text that is sent to a browser.
The browser provides this piece of text to the originating server when the visitor returns.
Most web browsers are initially configured to accept cookies, but you can change this setting so your browser either refuses all cookies or informs you when a cookie is being sent.
Also, you are free to delete any existing cookies at any time.
Please note that some features of Tappx may not function properly when cookies are disabled or removed.
JavaScript is a dynamic object oriented computer programming language.
JavaScript is used to understand the End Userâs behavior on an app or website.
Directly from the Publisher through Server to Server (S2S) or Video Vast Tags etc.

Consent Control
Access to Ad Data through Tappx SDK.
Tappx implemented a Consent Management Platform in our own SDK that allow to read and transmit information about which vendors and which purposes an end user has consented to with vendors.
Tappx will follow IAB standards and Consent Management Platform compliant with IAB requirements, in our own SDK in order to allow Tappx to read and transmit information about which purposes the end user has consented.
Online Behavioral Advertising:
We use third parties who collect data about their appsâ and sitesâ visitors through their own cookies, web beacons, and other technologies regarding your online activities, in an effort to understand your interests and deliver you advertisements that are tailored to your interests.
These third parties include Publishers, Advertisers and ad networks that may collect information about when you view or interact with one of their advertisements and may collect information regarding your online activities over time and across different apps and websites.
Like most Advertisers, we place advertisements where we think they will be most relevant to the recipient.
When an End User visits a third-party website or app on which that network advertising company has purchased ad space, the advertising company can then recognize the individualâs interest and deliver one of our advertisements.
End User choice and Opt-Out.
Ads delivered through Tappx SDK will allow End Users to out-put with a mechanism that permits End Users to set their preferences.
End Users in the EEA can withdraw their consent given to Tappx to collect and process data to optimize interest-based ads, either by revoking such consent on the page or app where they have found reference to Tappx as a partner or by writing to dpo@tappx.com indicating on it their Google Advertising ID (android) or IDFA (ios).
Without this technical information we cannot find the user and therefore comply with your revocation request.
If you do not consent to the treatment of your data, the advertisements you will see will be less adjusted to your interests.
Information Retention and Access to Information
We may retain personally identifiable information we process on behalf of our Clients for&nbsp.
a period of up to twelve (12) months unless otherwise required by law or applicable contract.
After the period, Tappx may retain and use such data in an aggregated format, as necessary for internal analytical purposes, to comply with its legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce agreements.
We may adopt shorter retention periods if so directed by our Clients.
Please note that in most of the cases we have no direct relationship with the End Users.
An End User who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate information should direct his query to the relevant Publisher.
If an End User requests us to remove any personally identifiable information relating to him or her, we will respond to their request within a reasonable timeframe.
Security
Tappx has implemented reasonable security measures in order to protect your information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction.
While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration to information will not occur.
we make good faith efforts to prevent such occurrences.
We do not warrant or represent that your account or any of your information will be protected against, loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties.

 

International transfers
Tappx may transfer the information we collect about you to countries other than the country where we originally collected it for the purposes of storage and processing of information and operating our services.
Those countries may not have the same information protection laws as your country.
However, when we transfer your information to other countries, we will protect that information as described in this Privacy Policy and take steps, where necessary, to ensure that international transfers comply with applicable laws.
We ensure it is protected by making sure at least one of the following safeguards is in place:

by transferring your personal information to a country that has been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection by the European Commission;


by using specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give your personal information the same protection it has within the EEA including to US;

where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US.
