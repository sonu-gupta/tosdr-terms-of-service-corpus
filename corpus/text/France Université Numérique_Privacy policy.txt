 Privacy policy Processing of personal data The protection of your personal data (any information about you that you provide us when using the site, for example when you create a user account, such as your name, your contact information, ...) is a priority of FUN.
We therefore take every precaution to ensure that no unauthorized third party has access. In short: We only use your data to operate the platform and have no strategy to reuse or sell your data: thus, we do not sell the data of our learners, and do not give any access to third parties other than our service providers (except to the authorities or institutions producing the MOOCs -which themselves do not have the right to reuse them without your agreement for other purposes-).
Without activity on your part, we will delete your identifying data after 5 years.
Within the framework of our missions, among which the contribution to the experimentation and the study of the teaching practices, we can also give access to researchers to certain data of use of the platform: in this case, these are entirely pseudonymised.

the data protection officer (DPO) of FUN-MOOC can be contacted at the same address or via the contact form ;
in the case of an academic cohort, the joint controller for the data processing is the organization for which the course is instantiated, as long as it contributes to determining the purposes and means of the treatment.
An arrangement was concluded between FUN and this organization, which specifies the responsibilities of each (FUN being responsible for the operation of the platform and the choice of service providers, the organization of the use of the services);
the personal data collected is as follows: 
identifying data (at least username, full name, email address);
usage data, which relate to your use of the site's services: raw data (IP address, operating system, activity on the site, etc.), corresponding to your use of the site's functionalities (eg learning modes of the learners, order of pages visited, control of the user interface, ...).


data collection is carried out in order to: 
to allow access and registration to the courses broadcast on the site, and to send you information on the activity of the platform (updates on the online courses offered by www.fun-mooc.fr or other events, to communicate about products or services of the site or affiliates, to send you emails about the maintenance of the site);
to allow courses to be followed, participation in educational activities and assessments, the issuance of certificates and / or certificates;
to carry out research work, statistical studies, after pseudonymisation, particularly in the fields of cognitive science and education;
to enroll the course as part of a broader training delivered by the institution of Higher Education and Research.




As an accessory, usage data can be used: 
to enable institutions to offer, administer and improve their courses;
to track the attendance, progress and completion of an online course and to analyze statistics on learner performance and how they learn;
to detect breaches of the user's charter, how to use the site as well as fraudulent uses or the potential to maintain and improve the operation and security of the site and our software, systems and networks.

to help improve the offer of www.fun-mooc.fr globally, personalize the experience and evaluate the accessibility and impact of www.fun-mooc.fr in the international educational community;

the recipients of the identifying data are the GIP FUN MOOC, as well as, for the only data necessary for their activity, its subcontractors (for hosting and user support in particular) whose activity is governed by contracts, and the institutions producing the courses (authorized members of the teaching teams, in charge of the training, official representatives of the institutions carrying the courses, and actors of the exploitation of the data, to accelerate the digital transformation of the initial trainings).
Note, incidentally, that your own activity is likely to transmit data to other learners, for example if you share personal information as part of a course.

contractual clauses of the European Commission, of which you can obtain a copy, are signed with these establishments.
