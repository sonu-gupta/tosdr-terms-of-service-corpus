This Site is operated by Zapier and has been created to provide information about our company and its content and data linking platform and related services (together with the Site, the "Service(s)") to our Service visitors ("you", "your").
This Privacy Policy sets forth Zapier's policy with respect to information including personally identifiable data ("Personal Data") and other information that is collected from visitors to the Site and Services.Third-Party Service IntegrationOur Service allows you to integrate and create commands for various online third-party services ("Third-Party Services").
In order to take advantage of this feature, you may need to authenticate, register for or log into Third-Party Services through the Service or on the websites of their respective providers.
When you enable linking between or log in to Third-Party Services through the Service, we will collect relevant information necessary to enable the Service to access that Third-Party Service and your data and content contained within that Third-Party Service ("Login Credentials").
We store your Login Credentials long enough to enable linking to the Third-Party Service.
When you enable the Service to link content and data between Third-Party Services, the Third-Party Services will provide us with access to certain information that you may have provided to the Third-Party Services, and we will use, store and disclose such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the rules you set to govern the linking.
In addition, you can use the Service to share content and Personal Data amongst the Third-Party Services you integrate with the Service.
Please remember that the manner in which Third-Party Services use, store and disclose your information is governed by the policies of such Third-Party Services, and Zapier shall have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any Third-Party Services that may be enabled within the Service.

In connection with the processing of such payments, we do not retain any personally identifiable information or any financial information such as credit card numbers.
