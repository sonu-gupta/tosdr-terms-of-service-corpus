Our data security principles

We try to reduce the amount of collected data to what is necessary for providing our services
We communicate internally only via encrypted communication
Unsafe communication (like email) is switched to secure communication as quickly as possible
All our mobile hard drives are encrypted
Unencrypted USB-sticks are used sparingly and only for public data (e.g.
presentations).
If technically possible, all our mobile devices are encrypted.
Anything which cannot be encrypted is locked away and inaccessible to anyone outside of the company.
