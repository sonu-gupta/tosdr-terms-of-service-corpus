This Data Processing Addendum (âDPAâ) amends and supplements the Terms of Service found at https://www.lucid.co/tos  and/or https://www.lucidpress.com/pages/tos, as applicable, as updated from time to time (the âAgreementâ), between Lucid Software Inc.
(âLucidâ) and an enterprise customer (âCustomerâ), and will be incorporated by reference into, and subject to the terms and conditions of, the Agreement.
If there is any inconsistency or conflict between this DPA and the Agreement as it relates to data protection, this DPA will govern.
This DPA sets out the terms that apply when Customer Personal Data is processed by Lucid under the Agreement.
The purpose of the DPA is to ensure such processing is conducted in accordance with the Data Protection Legislation and respects the rights of individuals whose Customer Personal Data is processed under the Agreement.

âSecurity Breachâ means a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, Customer Personal Data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed. 
âStandard Contractual Clausesâ means the standard contractual clauses, as agreed by the European Commission, for the transfer of personal data to processors established in third countries which do not ensure an adequate level of protection as set out in Commission Decision C(2010) 593, as updated, amended replaced or superseded from time to time by the European Commission, the approved version of which in force at present is that set out in the European Commission's Decision 2010/87/EU of 5 February 2010, available at: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32010D0087.

Customer will ensure that its instructions for the processing of Customer Personal Data comply with the Data Protection Legislation.

3.2.
Security.
Lucid will implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard Customer Personal Data taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons.

a valid mechanism in the exporting country (such as the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework) which is approved by the European Commission as ensuring an adequate level of protection.
Lucid has certified compliance with the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework.
If the transfer mechanism authorizing the transfer of Customer Personal Data from one country to another country as contemplated in this Section is no longer applicable to Lucid, then immediately upon its expiration, Customer and Lucid will enter into the Standard Contractual Clauses, incorporated herein by reference.&nbsp.
For purposes of the Standard Contractual Clauses, (a) Customer, the party transferring from the EEA or Switzerland, will be referred to as the âData Exporterâ.
and (b) Lucid will be referred to as the âData Importer.â Annex A to this DPA shall apply as Appendix 1 of the Standard Contractual Clauses.
Annex B to this DPA shall apply as Appendix 2 of the Standard Contractual Clauses.

Notification Obligations.
In the event Lucid becomes aware of any Security Breach, Lucid will notify Customer of the Security Breach without undue delay.
The obligations in this Section 7 do not apply to incidents that are caused by Customer or Customer's personnel or Users or to unsuccessful attempts or activities that do not compromise the security of Customer Personal Data, including unsuccessful log-in attempts, pings, port scans, denial of service attacks, and other network attacks on firewalls or networked systems. 
7.2.
Manner of Notification.
Notification(s) of Security Breaches, if any, will be delivered to one or more of Customerâs business, technical or administrative contacts by any means Lucid selects, including via email.
It is Customerâs sole responsibility to ensure it maintains accurate contact information on Lucidâs systems at all times.&nbsp.
Furthermore, it is Customerâs sole responsibility to notify the relevant data protection supervisory authority and, when applicable, the Data Subjects of a Security Breach as required under the Article 33 and 34 of the GDPR.

Term of DPA.
This DPA will remain in effect until, and automatically expire upon, deletion of all Customer Personal Data as described in this DPA.

Lucid shall retain Customer Personal Data in its possession until 30 days following the earlier of: (a) written confirmation from Customer that Lucid may delete Customerâs account and all User accounts.
or (b) the date that Customer and all Users delete their accounts.
Prior to deletion, Lucid will make any Customer Personal Data in its possession available for download by Customer.
Lucid shall have no obligation to retain any portion of Customer Personal Data after such period except to the extent that Lucid is required under Data Protection Legislation to keep a copy of the Customer Personal Data.
9.
AUDITS.
9.1.
Audit Rights.
Upon Customerâs written request no more than once per year, Lucid will provide a copy of its then most recent third-party audits or certifications, as applicable, or any summaries thereof, in order that Customer may reasonably verify Lucidâs compliance with the technical and organizational measures as required under this DPA.
Audit requests must be sent via certified mail to 10355 South Jordan Gateway, Suite 300, South Jordan, UT, USA 84095, ATTN: Legal.&nbsp.
To the extent Customer and this DPA are subject to the GDPR, Lucid will allow Customer or a mutually agreed upon independent auditor appointed by Customer to conduct an audit (including inspection) at Customerâs sole cost and expense, no more than once per year upon eight weeksâ notice sent to the above address complete with a detailed audit plan describing the proposed scope, duration, and start date of the audit.
Lucid will contribute to such audits whose sole purpose will be to verify Lucidâs compliance with its obligations under this DPA.
The auditor must execute a written confidentiality agreement acceptable to Lucid before conducting the audit.
The audit must be conducted during regular business hours, subject to Lucidâs policies, and may not unreasonably interfere with Lucidâs business activities. 
9.2.
Separate Service.
Any request for Lucid to provide assistance with an audit is considered a separate service if such audit assistance requires the use of resources different from or in addition to those required by law.
Customer shall reimburse Lucid for any time spent for any such audit at rates mutually agreed to by the parties, taking into account the resources expended by Lucid.
Customer shall promptly notify Lucid with information regarding any non-compliance discovered during the course of an audit.

(d) any premises or equipment not controlled by Lucid.
or (e) any information that, in Lucid's reasonable opinion, could: (i) compromise the security of Lucidâs systems or premises.
(ii) cause Lucid to breach its obligations under Data Protection Legislation or the rights of any third-party.
or (iii) any information that an independent auditor seeks to access for any reason other than the good faith fulfillment of Customer's obligations under the Data Protection Legislation.
