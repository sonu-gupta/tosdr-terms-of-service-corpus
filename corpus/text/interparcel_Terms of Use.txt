Fraud security checks.


3.2 Interparcel can only accept orders online from UK residents, who must be the end user and not another third party broker.
A UK registered card or PayPal Account must be used to purchase in order to ensure VAT is applied correctly and any refunds / credits due can be applied.

3.3 Interparcel will arrange delivery of the Consignment/s through a third party service with a reputable Carrier as chosen by you at the time of ordering.
Should that service not be available once purchased you will be immediately contacted with a comparable alternative or right to cancel.

3.4 The collection of a Consignment will normally occur on your chosen date which can be booked up to 7 days ahead.
Any order can be cancelled by you and a full refund will be given up until the time that the Consignment is collected from you.
HOWEVER, AFTER A CONSIGNMENT HAS BEEN COLLECTED FROM YOU, YOUR ORDER CANNOT BE CANCELLED.
This is because we have placed the order on your behalf with the Carrier and will be charged for the collection.
By arranging for the Consignment to be collected, you consent to the provision of services to you and accordingly you will not be able to exercise any legal cancellation right that you may have (also known as a 'cooling off' right) from the point when the Consignment is collected from you.

If this is not received, or if you require duplicate documentation, please contact our offices as described in section 13 and the transaction will be confirmed.

A claim will only be entertained up to the covered maximum.

4.9 Enhanced Cover is not valid for Prohibited Items and will only cover Loss on Restricted Items.

For further details see section 14 below.

7.8 Please note that any item travelling through our services must be able to withstand a short drop, fragile items should not be sent though our services.

7.16 It is the customer's responsibility to ensure that all the details are correctly completed and displayed on the correct Consignment as delivery will be made to the details listed on the Consignment.
It is not the driver's responsibility to check this information, so please ensure this is checked before he leaves.


7.17 Any consignment that is travelling outside of the UK should be left open for the driver to inspect the contents.
This can then be sealed by the collection point once the driver is satisfied.
DELIVERY AND TRACKING
8.1 Delivery dates and times are not guaranteed unless you have selected a Guaranteed Delivery Service.
A Guaranteed Delivery Service offers a money back guarantee if delivery is not attempted on the date specified (or by the time specified on guaranteed timed services) so long as the reason for delay has not been a customs query, because the delivery is to a remote area as described in section 9, incorrect information having been supplied or a delivery failure because the receiver cannot take delivery.
Non-guaranteed delivery services do not have this guarantee.


8.2 Transit times quoted are calculated from once collection is made and the consignment is in Transit.
For example, if a 'next day' guaranteed service is ordered, the 'next day' will be calculated from the date that the Consignment is collected.


8.3 Deliveries are made on Working days only usually between 8.30am-6pm (Timed services such as Pre 9,10 could be prior to 8.30am and delivery could be up until 9pm on any given working day for The Hermes Economy Service).
Saturday and Sunday deliveries are available to book online but are not guaranteed.
Refund of the weekend surcharge will be applied if delivery is not made on the relevant day.

8.4 Please be advised that Interparcel do not track parcels and as such it is the responsibility of the customer to track their own parcels, and to advise us if there are any problems.
Tracking is available through our Web site or by contacting our Customer Service department.
Tracking is available up to a period of 12 weeks from sending.
After that stage the tracking number may be re allocated to a new shipment.

8.5 You can track all orders online and may contact our offices prior to the return to rectify any issue.
Once returned any return charges that are due must be paid by the person that placed the order, the order will not be refunded and the item will not be re shipped free of charge.
The return completes the agreed contract.
Tracking is therefore essential to potentially aid delivery and prevent any return and associated costs.

8.6 If the driver has used a different tracking number than expected or if the collection point chooses to use a new shipping label from the driver, rather than supplied by Interparcel then you will only be able to track using the number left at the time of collection on the Carriers own website or by contacting our Customer Service team.


8.7 Interparcel Ltd can only deliver to a full street address.
We cannot deliver to a PO Box or BFPO address.
We also cannot deliver to an Argos Store for onward collection.

The drivers will not deliver to individual department or Block numbers.
Deliveries may be made to a neighbouring address if the delivery point is out, but only if the goods can be signed for.

8.9 A telephone number for the receiver is required for each Consignment (for example so that the receiver can be called in the event of an address query).
Please note for any overseas address a local number is needed, the Carrier will not call a UK number.

8.11 1-3 delivery attempts will be made for each Consignment, depending on the service if unsuccessful the Consignment will be returned to the sender.
A change of address can only be requested.
The contract is to deliver to the address on the item, so no change of address can be guaranteed.

You will be guided online to complete this if applicable and a template will be e-mailed to you once the order is placed.
An accurate description and reason for Export must be entered on this invoice.
If customs find different items than declared or an incorrect reason for export stated (such as Gift when actually purchased) then a surcharge could be applied, items confiscated or the shipment returned (which could be chargeable).
Four copies of the customs Invoice must be given to the driver on collection.

8.13 Interparcel services are generally offered âdoor to doorâ.
This means that we will arrange for pick up from one address and a drop off at another and gain a signature on delivery.
If the Consignee is out goods may be left with a neighbour if they are available to sign.
After the first delivery attempt the consignment may be left at a local access point to be collected.
Further please note that a small proportion of residential addresses are classified as a 'Driver release area' this is where the area is deemed 'safe' and the driver is able leave the goods out of sight and out of weather - please check the delivery postcode with our Customer Services before sending to see if it is included.
In exceptional circumstances, for example, but not limited to, the Coronavirus crisis in 2020, the couriers may take the decision to leave the goods without signature or sign for the goods themselves.


In addition we cannot offer door to door service where the delivery is going to be made in certain foreign countries.
It is advised to check the zip code/postcode before sending for International addresses in case of exclusions.

All shipments entering Europe must now include a customs invoice.
Therefore every shipment leaving the UK must now have an accompanying invoice.

For every shipment going into Europe the invoice must include an HS code to classify the goods you are sending.
We also advice to include one if you are sending anywhere outside of the UK to speed up the customs process.
It is the responsibility of the shipper to enter the correct HS code, otherwise the shipment could be delayed or returned with costs to be paid by the shipper.

If you are a VAT registered business sending into Europe then the customs invoice must also include your EORI number obtained from HMRC.
Again we advise entering this for all shipments leaving the UK to speed up the customs process.

12.2 By placing an order, you are prepaying for the outward postage charges of your Consignment/s only.
Interparcel has no control over any customs queries, delays or charges that may arise.
Customs charges may include VAT, penalties, storage charges or any other expense that has resulted from customs or governmental authorities.
Customs charges must be paid by the receiver (or Sender if customs agree this to be possible) before delivery is made.
Customs will deal directly with the receiver and in some cases, only the receiver.
If you do not wish to pay the charges and the Consignment is returned, all return charges will also be passed on.
Should a deadline be given before the goods are to be discarded and the deadline passes, no claim can be made for the loss and in addition abandonment charges may apply.
Please note, it is the Customers responsibility to track all orders and request Interparcel to intervene.
If the tracking states the goods are held under Customs query and they are returned, or abandoned and we have not been contacted then no refund or claim is due.

12.3 Consignments that exceed the value of Â£4,699 may be delayed as they will require further documentation for clearance.
In any case, you should be aware that the maximum Enhanced Cover offered by Interparcel is Â£1000 (as described in section 4 above) and therefore you are advised not to send high value goods using the Interparcel services.

CLAIMS FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE
PLEASE NOTIFY US AS SOON AS POSSIBLE OF ANY CLAIM RELATING TO LOSS OR DAMAGE OF A CONSIGNMENT AND WITHIN 28 DAYS OF THE DAMAGE OR LOSS.
This is because the carriers only maintain their records for a limited amount of time (normally up to a maximum of 12 weeks) we will then contact the relevant Carrier on your behalf to enable them to conduct an investigation.
After the 28 day period the carrier can be approached to investigate but we can only proceed if the carrier's systems allow.

14.1 All enquiries relating to loss or damage to Consignments should be directed through Interparcel.
Please do not contact the Carrier directly about your order.
If the Carrier is contacted directly, this may cause delays in the resolution of any issues you may have.

14.2 Please be aware that you should sign for goods as "damaged" if this is the case (and if you are not the Recipient of the goods, you should ask the Recipient to do the same).
If goods are signed for as being in good condition, it will be difficult for you to show that the goods were damaged in transit.
If you are unable to check when the driver is there, please arrange for goods to be signed for as "unchecked".

14.3 To process a claim, you will need to have proof that the Carrier has taken the Consignment from you.
The best form of such proof is the receipt which the Carrier should provide you with when the Consignment is collected or obtaining a signature on a copy of the shipping label you have.
In addition, in the event of a claim a copy invoice will be needed to prove the value of the Consignment.


14.4 The damaged item together with all packaging should be kept until the claim is concluded as more photographs or inspection of the item may be necessary.

14.5 If a claim is made that a Consignment has been damaged, all packaging should be kept for inspection by the Carrier.
The item must also be available for inspection in the state it was delivered, at the address it was delivered to.
Further journeys could cause further damage, making it difficult to assess the original damage.
We may also ask for photographs of the internal and external packaging as well as the damaged item to process the claim.


14.6 If it is shown that an item has been damaged in transit, we will (at our discretion) generally pay for damage to be repaired rather than a replacement â depending on the level of damage to the item and subject to the general provisions in Section 14 below.
Accordingly, if you make a claim relating to a damaged item we may also ask for an estimate of repair costs for that item supplied by an specialist who will carry out the repair.
If the item cannot be repaired then we would need this in writing from the specialist for a claim relating to the replacement of the item to be considered.


14.7 In the event that a claim is approved and repair/replacement costs are paid, we will also pay the costs of the reasonable evaluation report and the postage costs associated with that repair/replacement (subject to the postage being limited to the type of Carrier service where the item was damaged) - to the maximum amount specified in section 14.3.
The Interparcel claims team will arrange for your item to be carried for repair through the Interparcel Services when requested.

14.8 A claim relating to a lost item can only be processed once the Carrier has concluded its searches for the item.


14.9 Any amounts payable in relation to a lost or damaged item will only be paid to the party placing the order as further described in 16.4.
Please ensure the exact name or company name is entered at the time of booking as a Surcharge will be charged to re issue a settlement cheque.
See section 6 for further details regarding surcharges.

14.10 Interparcel will deal with the person who placed the order only.

14.11 If you wish to contest any claim decision, please write in to the Customer Service Director within this period (as described in the following section) after having discussed the decision with the Claim Manager - see section 13.1.


14.12 Exclusions - Please refer to 16.6 CLAIMS FOR LATE DELIVERY
15.1 Any parcel that is sent to or collected from a Guaranteed area on a Guaranteed collection or delivery service will be refunded in full if the guarantee fails as long as we are informed within 14 days.
Certain exclusions apply, see below.

15.2 Exclusions:
The money back guarantee for late deliveries is invalidated under any of the following circumstances:

If the Collection or delivery postcode is not in a guaranteed area (please check before sending)

Industrial / Strike action

Acts of God, such as extreme weather, mechanical issue or any naturally occurring event outside of human control.


Consequences of war

Delay due to customs or carrier clearance.

Insufficient Packaging 

If the consignment contains a prohibited or restricted item.


If 14 days after delivery has passed LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
16.1 Interparcel's liability to you is subject to the exclusions listed in this section.
This means that, with certain exceptions, the maximum amount of a claim that you can make against Interparcel will be limited in value.


16.2 Nothing in this section seeks to limit Interparcel's liability to you for claims relating to death or personal injury caused by Interparcel's negligence or for any other liability which cannot be excluded by law.

16.3 INTERPARCEL'S MAXIMUM LIABILITY TO YOU IS GENERALLY LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT OF TRANSIT COVER SELECTED WHEN AN ORDER WAS PLACED (INCLUDING ANY ENHANCED COVER) PLUS THE POSTAGE FEES PAID WITH THE ORDER.
For example, if a standard order with Â£25 of inclusive cover has been placed and no Enhanced Cover has been selected, then that order will have Â£25 of Transit Cover included.
If the cost of the postage was Â£15, then Interparcel's maximum liability to you in relation to that Consignment will be limited to a total of Â£40 (being the Â£25 of Transit Cover plus the Â£15 cost of postage).
In the same example, if Enhanced Cover was selected up to a value of Â£200, then Interparcel's maximum liability would be Â£240 (being the value of the Inclusive cover plus Enhanced Cover plus the cost of postage).
However, Interparcel's general limits on liability are subject to the remaining restrictions described in this section 14.

16.4 Interparcel's liability under these terms of use is limited to the contracting party who placed the order.
Should the Sender have placed the order then we do not have a contract with the receiver (and vice versa) and cannot be contractually liable for any losses suffered by other parties than the person that placed the order.

16.5 In any case, to the greatest extent that is permitted by law, Interparcel hereby limits its liability to the direct losses suffered by you (save as expressly stated otherwise in these terms of use).
Accordingly, we will not be liable for any claim for loss of profit, loss of use of an item, loss of revenue, administrative inconvenience, disappointment, or indirect or consequential loss or damage arising out of, or in relation to, the service you ordered.

16.6 Interparcel accepts no liability for loss or damage to Prohibited Items as these should not be sent using our services.
For further information on limitations relating to Prohibited Items, see section 11.

16.7 Interparcel will only accept liability for damage to Restricted Items where the goods have not been carried using reasonable skill and care.
You are reminded that we recommend that you do not send these items using our services and that the Carriers will assume that Consignments do not include Restricted Items.
For further information on limitations relating to Restricted Items, see section 10.

16.8 Interparcel accepts no liability for loss/damage to an item if it has not been correctly packaged and/or labelled unless it can be shown that we have not acted with reasonable skill and care.
