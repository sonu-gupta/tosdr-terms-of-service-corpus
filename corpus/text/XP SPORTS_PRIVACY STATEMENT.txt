10) Other Technologies

DNT is a concept that has been promoted by regulatory agencies such as the U.S.
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across sites by using browser settings.
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has been working with industry groups, Internet browsers, technology companies, and regulators to develop a DNT technology standard.
While some progress has been made, it has been slow.
No standard has been adopted to this date and, as a result, we are not equipped to respond to âdo not trackâ signals.
