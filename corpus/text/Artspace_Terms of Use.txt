The agreements between the buyers and sellers shall not be governed by the U.N.
Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded.

All bids will be recorded by Artspace and such recording shall constitute the final and conclusive determination and record of each bid and the highest bid.
Seller's reserve priceSellers may set a minimum price for an auction item (âReserve Priceâ).
A Seller is not required to accept any bids for less than the Reserve Price.
If bids are placed below the sellerâs Reserve Price, the bidder will be notified that the bid is below the Reserve Price.
Artspace biddingArtspace may, through employees, submit bids on auction items that are subject to a Reserve Price.
