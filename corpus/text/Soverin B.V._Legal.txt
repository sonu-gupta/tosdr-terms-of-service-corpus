Weâll only collect that data that is absolutely necessary for our service to run.

Weâll never share your data with others, unless we have to by law.
You control your data, so itâs up to you if you want to change it.
Your email and email account exist as long as you donât delete them.
However, gone is gone.
So be careful.
Soverin invests a lot of time in creating a safe and secure platform.
No one can guarantee 100% security, but we do our best!
Should we change anything in this policy, weâll notify you immediately.
Donât hesitate to contact us at any time, should you have any questions left (Preferably not in the middle of the night though, we do need our sleep). 1.

What personal data does Soverin process? 

Mandatory data (this data is necessary in order to provide you with our service)
In order to provide the aforementioned services and to provide you with a Soverin account, we need your phone number.

Once we have your phone number you get to choose your own email address.
Depending on the email address you choose, this could be considered personal data.

Soverin provides you with an email service.
Therefore we manage your email.
However, under no circumstances will we ever look into the content of your emails.

Optional data
Soverin can supply you with a domain name, linked to your email address.
Soverin will administer this domain name for you.
Depending on the domain name you choose, this can be considered personal data, for example if you choose a domain name that consists of your name (should you wish to register a domain name with your own name in it).

The backups of our servers do contain copies of your email.
However, these backups are encrypted with your personally generated key, granting you exclusive access.
