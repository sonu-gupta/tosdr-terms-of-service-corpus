         California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) 
WHAT IS IT?

The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is a privacy law that gives California residents more control over their personal information.
Consumers in California will be able to download their data, opt out of the sale of their data, delete their data and have a better understanding of what data is being collected and why. 

HOW CCPA AFFECTS YOU

As a California consumer, you can choose how a business collects and uses your personal information.
The CCPA defines the âsaleâ of data very broadly and includes sharing your information with our 3rd-party partners to improve your experience.
For example, we may share your information with 3rd-parties to create a personalized experience and make relevant promotional offers available to you.
You can manage your preferences regarding the sale of your data, delete collected data and download a copy of your data through our Privacy Center.

HOW WE USE YOUR DATA

When you sign up with Rakuten, we collect personal information from you and your connected accounts.
We use this information for a range of purposes including account management and general service improvement.
Your data also helps us find deals and ads that are relevant to you and provide you with a more personalized experience based on your shopping history.
Our collection, use and disclosure of your personal information is governed by our Privacy Policy.
Please review it carefully to understand our practices.
