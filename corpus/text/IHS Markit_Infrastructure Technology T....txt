Given the rapid increase in the velocity and volume of data delivery requirements, we have partnered with AWS to migrate our infrastructure estate to AWS native cloud and VMware cloud, over the next five years.
Our partnership allows us to offer a standardized security posture, while our processing infrastructure remains scalable, agile, and resilient.
A comprehensive cloud-based storage and processing platform across our vast range of data is an important next step in our digital transformation journey and we are excited to take you along.
Please refer to this short customer FAQ that will further outline this project.
