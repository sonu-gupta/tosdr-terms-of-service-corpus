Vanguard collects and processes both Personal Data and Other Data.
For purposes of this Policy, âPersonal Dataâ is any information that alone or together with other information in Vanguardâs possession relates to an identified or identifiable natural person, such as name, phone number, email address, financial account information, and online identifiers and account information such as user name and password.
âOther Dataâ is any additional information that is not Personal Data.
In this section, we describe our information-collection practices, including the types of Personal and Other Data that we collect.
In subsequent sections of this Policy, we describe how we use and disclose Personal and Other Data.
We may combine the Personal and Other Data we collect directly from you with information collected from or about you in other contexts, such as on the Sites.
This may include information collected online, such as through our email exchanges with you.
from publicly available sources, such as your company website if you are a financial adviser.
from the registrar for our exchange-traded funds so that we can provide information about products or services that may be of benefit.
or from offline sources, such as information that we collect when you establish your account with us or call customer service.
We will treat such combined information in accordance with this Policy.
If you do not wish to provide information to Vanguard, we may be unable to provide certain products or services to you, and if we or a fraud prevention agency determine that you pose a fraud or money laundering risk, we may refuse to provide or stop providing the services you have requested.

Information about third parties: We may collect information from you regarding other individuals related to your account.
Where you disclose information about authorised signatories, dependents, relatives, potential beneficiaries, employees, agents, or other representatives as outlined above, you warrant that you will only do so in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
that you will ensure that before doing so, the individuals in question are provided with a copy of this Policy and made aware of the fact that Vanguard will hold information relating to them and may use it for any of the purposes set out in this Policy.
and where necessary that you will obtain the other individualsâ consent to Vanguardâs collection, use, and disclosure of their information as described in this Policy.
Vanguard may, where required under applicable law, notify those individuals that they have been provided with their Personal Data and provide a copy of this Policy to them.

Information from telephone, email, online chat, or text message communications with Vanguard: If you communicate with Vanguard by telephone, email, online chat, or text message, Vanguard may keep a record of that communication.

We also may use similar tracking technologies in emails that we or third parties send to you, as further described below.
To learn more about how our Sites use cookies, please read our Cookie policy.
When you visit our Sites, you have the ability to accept or decline these cookies and other tracking mechanisms, except those that are strictly necessary in order for you to enter and move around the Sites and use essential Site features, and you can change your preference at any time.
Cookies: A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that is stored on your computer, tablet, mobile phone, or other device when you visit a website.
Cookies contain information that is transferred to or read on your device and allow websites to recognise devices and store certain information, such as user preferences.
Cookies are used to distinguish you from other users of our Sites.
This helps us to provide you with a useful experience when you browse our Sites and also allows us to improve our Sites.
We and our third-party service providers use session cookies, which link your actions during a particular browser session and expire at the end of that session, as well as persistent cookies, which remain on your device and allow us to remember your actions or preferences across multiple browser sessions.
If you are concerned about having cookies on your computer, you can set your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being set, allowing you to decide whether to accept it.
You can also delete cookies from your computer.
The help feature on most web browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to receive notice when a new cookie is set, and how to disable cookies altogether.
However, if you choose to block or delete cookies, certain features of the Sites may not operate correctly.
For further information about deleting or blocking cookies, please visit here.
Information about how to opt out of the use of cookies for certain purposes (such as interest-based advertising) is discussed below in the section titled Website analytics and Interest-Based Advertising.
Web beacons: The Sites or the emails that you receive from Vanguard use an application known as a âweb beaconâ (also known as a âpixel tagâ or âclear gifâ).
A web beacon is an electronic file that usually consists of a single-pixel image.
We and our service providers may use web beacons and cookies to determine whether and when you receive and open our emails.
these beacons and cookies may also capture information such as the type of device, operating system, email program, and web browser used to view the email, the IP address from which you opened the email, and whether you click on any links in the email.
These technologies enable us to gauge the effectiveness, relevance, and value of our email communications, as well as to target relevant advertising to you and to measure the impact of that advertising on your Vanguard relationships.
We may combine Other Data with additional information that we have collected about you, including, where applicable, your name and other Personal Data.
When we combine Other Data with Personal Data, we treat all of the combined information as Personal Data.
If you have registered for secure access on our Sites, we are able to combine the information we collect about your usage of our Sites during a secure (logged-on) session with other information we know about you, such as any searches you conduct or information you request during your web session.
We can also identify your computer or device on each visit to our Sites, even if you do not log on, and link information about that visit, as well as about Vanguard ads that you may have viewed on other websites, to you.
We may use this combined information to assess the appeal and usefulness of the information and tools offered on our Sites and the effectiveness of our online advertising, as well as to identify Vanguard products and services that may be of interest to you.
For more information about how we and our service providers use information for analytics and advertising purposes, please see the section below titled Website analytics and Interest-Based Advertising.
Use, legal basis, and disclosure
How do we use Personal and Other Data?
We use the Personal and Other Data that we collect for the purposes described in this Policy, for the purposes for which it was provided to us, as required by law, and for our business purposes, including:

To establish and administer accounts and your relationship with us, to fulfil the terms of any agreement you have with us, and to otherwise provide Vanguardâs products and services to you;

To prevent fraud and money laundering, and to verify your identity.
in this regard, we and fraud prevention agencies may also enable law enforcement agencies to process your Personal Data to prevent, detect, and investigate crime;
For marketing and promotional purposes, in accordance with applicable law.
For example, if you consent, we will use your Personal Data, such as your email address, to send you news and newsletters, or to otherwise contact you about Vanguard products or information we think may be of interest to you.

To support Site performance, perform Site analytics, enhance Site navigation, and improve our web design and functionality.
and
For other research and analytical purposes.

Legal bases for using Personal Data
We will only collect, use, and share your Personal Data where we are satisfied that we have an appropriate legal basis to do this.
This may be because:

Our use of your Personal Data is necessary to perform a contract or take steps to enter into a contract with you (for example where we use your contact, demographic, and banking information required to establish and fund your account in the performance of our services);
Our use of your Personal Data is necessary to comply with a relevant legal or regulatory obligation that we have (for example, where we are required to undertake vetting to comply with anti-money laundering legislation or where we are required to disclose Personal Data to a court or tax authority);
You have provided your consent to us using the Personal Data (for example in relation to our use of targeting cookies on the Sites).
and/or
Our use of your Personal Data is in our legitimate interest as a commercial organisation (for example in order to verify your identity and prevent fraud, to make improvements to our products and services and to provide you with information you request).
in these cases we will process your Personal Data at all times in a way that is proportionate and respects your privacy rights, and you have a right to object to this processing as explained in the section below titled Your legal rights.

If you would like to find out more about the legal bases on which we process Personal Data, please contact us using the details below.

The collection, use, and disclosure of information through these websites and services will be subject to the privacy policies of the third-party websites or services, and not this Policy.


Competitions, contests, and promotions: Vanguard may use an agency to run competitions, contests, or promotions on the Sites or elsewhere, and if you choose to participate, we or third parties may request your name, address, telephone number, email address, and other information where it is necessary to ensure your eligibility and to comply with lottery and gaming regulations.

Aggregated information: From time to time, Vanguard may share aggregated information about users of the Sites or Vanguardâs products and services, such as sharing reports on the usage of the Sites or Vanguardâs services for regulatory reporting or marketing purposes.
Website analytics and Interest-Based Advertising
We partner with third parties to collect the Other Data discussed above to engage in Site analysis, auditing, research, and reporting.
When you visit our Sites, these third parties may set and access cookies on your computer or other device and may use web beacons to collect information about your activity on the Sites.
We use these cookies to identify you as having confirmed your eligibility to enter and use our Sites, and to make sure you connect to the right service on our Sites when we make any changes to the way the Sites work.
These cookies are also used to help us improve how our Sites work and understand what interests our users, and for error management, to help us improve our Sites by measuring any errors that occur.&nbsp.
In particular, the Sites use Adobe Analytics to help collect and analyse certain information for the purposes discussed above.
The information generated about your use of the Sites may be transmitted to and stored by Adobe Analytics on servers outside your country of residence.
You may opt out of the use of cookies by Adobe Analytics here.
We also partner with third-party service providers, including social networks, to provide targeted advertising services that are customised based on your online activities over time and across unaffiliated websites (Interest-Based Advertising) and to help us measure brand awareness and the effectiveness of our online advertising.
If you provide your consent on our Sites, these service providers may use cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies to collect information about your activity on our Sites, and they may combine it with information about your activity on other, unaffiliated websites.
We and our service providers may use data collected on our Sites or when you open emails from Vanguard, together with other information we have about you and your Vanguard relationships, to serve Vanguard ads to you on other sites as you browse the web.
For example, third parties may use the fact that you visited the Sites to target ads for Vanguard products and services to you on non-Vanguard websites.
In addition, our third-party advertising providers might use information about your use of the Sites to help target non-Vanguard advertisements based on your online activity in general.
For more information about Interest-Based Advertising and how to opt out, please visit the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out page&nbsp.
(available in 27 languages).
Although our Sites currently do not respond to "do not track" browser headers, you can limit tracking by taking the steps discussed above.
The use of online tracking mechanisms by third parties is subject to those third parties' own privacy policies, and not this Policy.
Cross-border transfer of information
Vanguard generally maintains centralised servers and systems in the United States and may maintain servers and systems elsewhere.
These servers and systems are managed by or on behalf of The Vanguard Group, Inc., or Vanguard Affiliates located in or outside the United States.
Vanguard also may subcontract the processing of your information to, or otherwise share your information with, other third parties in the United States or countries other than your country of residence.
As a result, where the Personal and Other Data that we collect is transferred to and processed in the United States or anywhere else outside the European Economic Area (EEA) for the purposes described above, we will take steps to ensure that the information receives the same level of protection as if it remained within the EEA, including entering into data transfer agreements, using the EU Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses, or relying on certification schemes such as the EU-US Privacy Shield.
You may have a right to details of the mechanisms under which your data is transferred outside the EEA.
Personal Data quality
Vanguard relies on the accuracy of the information provided by its clients and others.
We take reasonable efforts to ensure that Personal Data collected by us or on our behalf is accurate, up to date, and complete, in accordance with applicable law.
If any information about you changes or you have any concerns regarding the accuracy of information about you held by Vanguard, you should contact us at the address provided in the Contact us section below.
Information security and retention
We use commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your Personal Data from loss, misuse, and unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction in accordance with applicable law.
Please be aware that despite our best efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security all of the time.
If you have online account access, we recommend that you take steps to protect against unauthorised access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your user name and password private.
For additional information, see our Online Security Policy.
Vanguard retains Personal Data for as long as necessary to provide our services to you, to fulfil the purposes described in this Policy and/or our business purposes, or as required by law, regulation, or internal policy.
We are obliged to retain certain information to ensure accuracy, to help maintain quality of service, and for legal, regulatory, fraud prevention and legitimate business purposes.
Fraud prevention agencies can hold your Personal Data for different periods of time, and if you are considered to pose a fraud or money laundering risk, your Personal Data can be held for up to six years.&nbsp.
A record of any fraud or money laundering risk will be retained by the fraud prevention agencies, and may result in others refusing to provide services, financing, or employment to you.
If you have any questions about this, please contact us using the details below.
The Sites may contain links to sites operated by partner networks, advertisers, and other companies not affiliated with Vanguard.
Vanguard does not sponsor or endorse the linked sites or any products or services offered by them.
If you follow a link to any of these sites, youâll be subject to the siteâs privacy policy, which you should read and understand before using the site or its products or services.
Your legal rights
Subject to certain exemptions, and in some cases dependent upon the processing activity we are undertaking, you have certain rights in relation to your Personal Data.

the data controllerâs identity.
and
the entities or categories of entities to whom your Personal Data may be transferred.

Right to rectify or erase Personal Data
You have a right to request that we rectify inaccurate Personal Data.
We may seek to verify the accuracy of the Personal Data before rectifying it.
You can also request that we erase your Personal Data in limited circumstances where:

it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected.
or
you have withdrawn your consent (where the data processing was based on consent).
or
following a successful right to object (see Right to object below).
or
it has been processed unlawfully.
or
to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject.

We are not required to comply with your request to erase Personal Data if the processing of your Personal Data is necessary:

for compliance with a legal obligation.

for the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims.

Right to restrict the processing of your Personal Data
You can ask us to restrict your Personal Data, but only where:

its accuracy is contested, to allow us to verify its accuracy.
or
the processing is unlawful, but you do not want it erased.
or
it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected, but we still need it to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.
or
you have exercised the right to object, and verification of overriding grounds is pending.

We can continue to use your Personal Data following a request for restriction:

where we have your consent.
or
to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.
or
to protect the rights of another natural or legal person.

Right to transfer your Personal Data
You can ask us to provide your Personal Data to you in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format, or you can ask to have it transferred directly to another data controller, but in each case only where:

the processing is based on your consent or on the performance of a contract with you.
and
the processing is carried out by automated means.

Right to object to the processing of your Personal Data
You can object to any processing of your Personal Data which has our legitimate interests as its legal basis, if you believe your fundamental rights and freedoms outweigh our legitimate interests.
If you raise an objection, we have an opportunity to demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate interests which override your rights and freedoms.
Right to object to how we use your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes
You can request that we change the manner in which we contact you for marketing purposes.

Right to obtain a copy of Personal Data safeguards used for transfers outside your jurisdiction
You can ask to obtain a copy of, or reference to, the safeguards under which your Personal Data is transferred outside of the European Union.
We may redact data transfer agreements to protect commercial terms.
Right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority
Vanguardâs primary supervisory authority for privacy and data protection matters is the UK Information Commissionerâs Office.&nbsp.
You also have a right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority if you have concerns about how we are processing your Personal Data.
We ask that you please attempt to resolve any issues with us first, although you have a right to contact your supervisory authority at any time. 
If you would like to exercise any of the rights described above, please send us a request at the address or email provided in the Contact us section below.
In your message, please indicate the right you would like to exercise and the information that you would like to access, review, correct, or delete.
We may ask you for additional information to confirm your identity and for security purposes, before disclosing the Personal Data requested to you.
We reserve the right to charge a fee where permitted by law, for instance if your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.
Subject to legal and other permissible considerations, we will make every reasonable effort to honour your request promptly or inform you if we require further information in order to fulfil your request.&nbsp.
We may not always be able to fully address your request, for example if it would impact the duty of confidentiality we owe to others, or if we are legally entitled to deal with the request in a different way.
Children's privacy
The Sites are not directed to children under the age of 18, and Vanguard does not collect information from anyone it knows is under the age of 18 (although information relating to persons under the age of 18 will be collected for the purposes of a Vanguard Junior ISA).
We recommend that persons under 18 years of age ask their parents for permission before using the Sites or sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.
