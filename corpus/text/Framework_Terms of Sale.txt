Order Acceptance
Framework reserves the right to change prices for Products at any time and without notice, and to correct errors in pricing that may occur.&nbsp.
Depending on your shipping location, the purchase price may not include shipping, import duties, taxes, transfer fees, and other governmental charges, which are the Customerâs responsibility.  
When placing an Order for a Product, you will be required to provide certain information, such as your address and other billing information.
You represent and warrant that all such information is accurate, and you will ensure that such information is kept current.
The Product will be delivered to the delivery address specified in âShipping Informationâ in the checkout process or provided through other payment profiles, such as PayPal.
You are responsible for providing the correct address in the ordering process.
Framework has no responsibility or liability for inaccurate information or information that later becomes outdated and has no obligation to make efforts to determine the correct contact or shipping information.&nbsp.

The Product will be shipped to you in accordance with the shipping option chosen by you in the ordering process.
The cost of shipping is detailed in the order process.
The estimated dispatch and delivery date will be stated in the order process.

Changes and/or delays to the estimated dispatch and delivery date may occur.
Framework will notify you of any changes impacting the delivery of your ordered Product.
Framework is not liable for delays in the estimated delivery date for the Order.
Orders and Pre-orders may be subject to order quantity limits, which will be shown during the checkout process.
Framework reserves the right to decline, reject, or cancel your order or limit order quantity at any time.&nbsp.
This may be for reasons which include but are not limited to product availability, quantity limits, errors in stated price, invalid or unsupported shipment addresses, or payment processing issues.&nbsp.
If you have already paid, we will refund you the full amount of the declined, rejected, or cancelled order or the amount of adjusted order quantity, including applicable taxes and any delivery charges.&nbsp.

Once you have placed an Order, Framework strives to deliver in a timely manner.&nbsp.

Framework will send a confirmation email to the email you provided if the cancellation was successful.
If the cancellation is confirmed by Framework, you are entitled to a full refund of purchase price.
Framework strives to process refunds within a reasonable amount of time.
Pre-orders
Each Pre-order you submit for a Product acts as a deposit for a future purchase of the Product.&nbsp.
You will be charged a Pre-order deposit, plus any applicable taxes, at the time of placing the Pre-order for Product.&nbsp.
The remainder of the specified purchase price, plus any applicable taxes, duties, shipping and other costs, will be charged before the Product is released for shipment.

Framework will make reasonable efforts to contact you to provide a refund after that 30-day period, but if Framework does not receive a response from you within 90 days of our initial request to complete your Order, or if Framework is not able to process your refund after that 30-day period (for example, due to a cancelled credit card), then Framework will treat the amount that you paid as unclaimed property in accordance with applicable law.
Although we will make efforts to begin delivering Products as soon as reasonably practicable, you understand and agree that there may be delays.
In the event that a delay arises and the estimated shipment date is not met, Framework is not responsible for any damages that may occur due to the delay, nor is it obligated to provide any discounts, refunds or credits due to any such delays.

If you do so prior to completing the Product purchase by making the second payment, Framework will refund your Pre-order deposit without interest.
