Arbitration

READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT CAREFULLY.
IT LIMITS CERTAIN LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO OBTAIN RELIEF OR DAMAGES THROUGH COURT ACTION OR AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS.

As used in this Arbitration provision and the subsequent Class Action Waiver provision, "You" and "Your" includes you, your heirs, survivors, representatives, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interests, successors, and assigns.
This Arbitration Agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted.
It applies to any and all claims, disputes, or controversies of any nature whatsoever that You may raise against Whirlpool and/or its Affiliated Entities, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, including but not limited to statutory, common law, fraud (whether by misrepresentation or by omission) or other intentional tort, property, or equitable claims arising out of, relating to, or in connection with: the Platform, all content on the Platform, products sold or advertised on this Platform (including but not limited to the use, design, testing, manufacture, marketing, advertising, or labeling of any product advertised or purchased on this Platform), and these Terms (including any claims relating to the validity, scope, interpretation, breach or enforceability of these Terms) (all of which are collectively referred to herein as "Claims").
You agree that you will assert any Claim against Whirlpool and/or the Affiliated Entities by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ) in accordance with its Consumer Arbitration Rules (âAAA Rulesâ), and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.&nbsp.
To the extent there is any inconsistency between the terms of this Arbitration provision and the AAA Rules the provisions of this provision shall apply.
The AAA Rules, forms and information are available online at www.adr.org, or can be obtained by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.
Unless Whirlpool and You agree otherwise, any arbitration hearing(s) will take place in the province or jurisdiction in which you reside or, in the case of residents of Quebec, the seat of arbitration will be Ontario.
In the event that any provision of this Arbitration provision or the Class Action Waiver provision is found to be invalid or unenforceable in a particular case or jurisdiction, that provision will be severable in that case or jurisdiction, as the case may be, without affecting the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of the Agreement, and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the Agreement in other cases and jurisdictions.
In the event that You intend to commence an arbitration or a court proceeding, You must first notify Whirlpool by contacting Our Customer Experience Center at 1-866-698-2538 (U.S.) or 1-800-807-6777 (Canada) ("Notice") and attempt to resolve Your Claim.
If You and Whirlpool and/or the Affiliated Entities do not reach an agreement to resolve Your Claim within 30 days after Notice has been provided, either party may commence an arbitration proceeding in accordance with this Agreement.
We agree to pay Your filing, administration, service, case management, arbitrator and reasonable hearing fees.
You may be ordered to reimburse us in whole or in part for any of the amount that We pay if the arbitrator or the court, as the case may be, finds that any of your Claims were filed for purposes of harassment or are frivolous.

Class Action Waiver

READ THE FOLLOWING CLASS ACTION WAIVER AGREEMENT CAREFULLY.
IT LIMITS CERTAIN LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO OBTAIN RELIEF OR DAMAGES AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS.


EXCEPT WHERE PROHIBITED BY LAW, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER, WHETHER BEFORE AN ARBITRATOR OR IN COURT, ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT.
You expressly waive any right you may have to bring or participate in a Claim as a class, collective or representative proceeding in court or before an arbitrator against Whirlpool and/or the Affiliated Entities.
Further, unless both You and We agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate Your claim with another person's claim, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
Notwithstanding anything herein, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court for disputes within that court's jurisdiction.&nbsp.
