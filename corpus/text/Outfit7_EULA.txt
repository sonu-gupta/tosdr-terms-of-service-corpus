TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL OUTFIT7, ITS SUBSIDIARIES OR ITS AFFILIATES AND ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY PERSONAL INJURY, PROPERTY DAMAGE, LOST PROFITS, COST OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION OR ANY OTHER FORM OF DIRECT OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES FROM ANY CAUSES OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS EULA OR THE APPLICATION, WHETHER ARISING IN TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, WHETHER OR NOT OUTFIT7 HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE AND WHETHER OR NOT REPAIR, REPLACEMENT, OR A REFUND (IF AWARDED AT OUR SOLE DISCRETION) FOR THE APPLICATION DOES NOT FULLY COMPENSATE YOU FOR ANY LOSSES.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATIONS OR CERTAIN INTENTIONAL OR NEGLIGENT ACTS, OR VIOLATION OF SPECIFIC STATUTES, OR THE LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

THIS LIMITATION APPLIES, BUT IT IS NOT LIMITED TO ANYTHING RELATED TO THE APPLICATION, SERVICES, OR CONTENT MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE APPLICATION.
You agree that the provisions in this EULA that limit liability are essential terms of this EULA.

Outfit7 reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by You, in which event You will cooperate in asserting any available defenses.
12.
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

This Agreement and all disputes or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of England and Wales, if You use the Application in the EU, excluding its conflict of laws rules, or in accordance with the laws of the State of California, excluding its conflict of laws rules, if You use the Application anywhere else in the world.
14.
ARBITRATION
We will make every reasonable effort to resolve any disagreements that You have with Outfit7.
If those efforts fail, by using the Application You agree that any claim, dispute, or controversy You may have against Outfit7 arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with this Agreement and/or the Application, shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration, as defined in this Section 14.
If You are a resident of the United States of America: (a) any such arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (the âAAAâ) and conducted before a single arbitrator pursuant to the applicable rules and procedures established by the AAA (the âAAA Rules and Proceduresâ).
(b) the arbitration shall be held at a location determined by the AAA pursuant to the AAA Rules and Procedures (provided that such location is reasonably convenient for You), or at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by You and Outfit7.
(c) the arbitrator shall apply California law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law.
(d) there shall be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class or representative basis, arbitration can decide only Your and/or Outfit7âs individual claims, and the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated.
(e) in the event that You are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Outfit7 will pay as much of Your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.
(f) all arbitration submissions, communications, and proceedings shall be made or conducted in English.
and (g) with the exception of clause (d) above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the AAA Rules and Procedures, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein.
If You are a resident of any country other than the United States of America: (a) any such arbitration shall be administered by the International Chamber of Commerce (the âICCâ) and conducted before a single arbitrator pursuant to the Rules of Arbitration of the ICC (the âICC Rules of Arbitrationâ).
(b) the arbitration shall be held in London, England, or at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by You and Outfit7.
(c) the arbitrator shall apply California law consistent with the ICC Rules of Arbitration and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law.
(d) all arbitration submissions, communications, and proceedings shall be made or conducted in English.
and (e) if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the ICC Rules of Arbitration, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein.
