We, as well as third parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on the Services, may use cookies, pixel tags, local storage, and other technologies (âTechnologiesâ) to automatically collect information through the Services.

However, if you do that, the Services may not work properly.

Pixel Tags/Web Beacons.
A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is a piece of code embedded in the Services that collects information about engagement on the Services.

Flash cookies are stored on your device, but they are managed through an interface different from the one provided by your web browser.
This means it is not possible to manage Flash cookies at the browser level, in the same way you would manage cookies.
Instead, you can access your Flash management tools from Adobeâs website directly.
The Adobe website provides comprehensive information on how to delete or disable Flash cookies.
Please be aware that if you disable or reject Flash cookies for the Services, you may not be able to access certain features, such as video content or services that require you to sign in.
