SLA credit is calculated from the time a ticket is opened regarding the issue to the time the issue is resolved.
Customers claiming credit under our uptime guarantee must do so by opening a ticket within 72 hours of the incident with their username and main account domain.
All requests after 72 hours of the downtime incident happening will be voided.

Bulk emailing is strictly prohibited.
Any mail sent beyond the hourly email limit will be failed and will be discarded without delivery.

Frequent attacks would result in longer periods of null-routing.

Limenex reserves the right to terminate the service of any DDoS attacked customer without liability.

This guarantee does not cover tickets submitted to our Web Hosting Support, VPS Hosting Support and Dedicated Server Support department(s) pertaining to issues irrelevant to Customer's hosting service.

The follow support restrictions apply for all hosting accounts:


Limenex does not provide support for any 3rd party scripts including but not limited to all scripts listed in Softaculous, Fantastico, RVSiteBuilder and any other script unless explicitly stated.
If you open a ticket requesting support for a 3rd party script, Limenex may provide assistance on a "best-effort" basis but we reserve the right to not provide any assistance regarding any 3rd party scripts.

You are ultimately responsible for all actions taken under your account, including but not limited to the compromise of any portion of your account(s).

You are responsible for the development of your website.
Limenex may provide assistance on a case by case basis but it is not our duty to provide assistance on developing your website.
You should consult a web developer if necessary.


The offer of any particular service does not constitute an obligation on Limenex part to tutor the necessary skills to utilize that service, only to provide system-specific information.


Problems with domain names/DNS issues are NOT directly the responsibility of Limenex.
DNS is a cooperative system and works solely because the parties involved in running the system agree to cooperate in the furtherance of the DNS/domain system.
We will do our best to isolate the source of the problem at hand, however unless this source is hardware directly under the control of Limenex, then the task of acquiring a solution will fall back into your hands.
Limenex will advise when requested, but rarely intervene in domain issues not directly related to the operation of one of our DNS servers.


Limenex may provide a free migration assistance for customers switching over to us.
However, this is a courtesy service provided to customers whose previous host is also running cPanel control panel and uses cPanel's default backup system.
We do not make any guarantees regarding the availability, possibility or time required to complete an account migration.
Some hosting companies configure their system in an incompatible or proprietary format which makes it extremely difficult or otherwise impossible to migrate data.
We may be unable to assist you in a migration of data from your previous host if our staff deem that it will be too difficult or impossible to do so.


Limenex only provides full cPanel account transfer assistance.
We will backup a copy of your cPanel account at your previous host and restore it on our server.
Any special request including partial migration or migration from a different control panel may be chargeable.
Please contact our sales department if you have any concerns regarding this.


Limenex will not provide migration assistance for any cPanel account that is larger than 15GB in size.
Customers with cPanel accounts bigger than 15GB will have to manually transfer the files over using FTP.
This only applies to Cloud Web Hosting, Cloud Reseller Hosting and Business Cloud Hosting accounts.

Abuse Tickets


Limenex standard policy is to contact The Customer during which a violation of the AUP or TOS has occurred, however, Limenex does reserve the right to suspend or terminate an account with or without notice at its own discretion.
The Customer agrees to maintain up to date primary contact email information with Limenex.
The violation shall be listed in the Subject of the email sent from our abuse department (abuse@limenex.com).
The Customer shall be given all appropriate details of the Violation as well as a time frame to correct the issue before action shall be taken.
Once the email has been sent to The Customer, Limenex will consider that The Customer has been notified.
Limenex reserves the right to use discretion on the amount of time given for a customer to correct the issue before action is taken.


For example: A violation containing a "Phishing" site is lodged against the customer, the offending files will be immediately disabled and the customer will be given 24 hours to clean and secure the site.
If after 24 hours the Customer has not replied confirming they have taken action, further action may be taken such as suspending the individual site and/or suspending the entire VPS or Dedicated Server.


For example: A violation resulting in a "Spam" complaint.
We may investigate the complaint to determine how the spam is being sent.
We may provide a best effort analysis to locate the source of the spam.
If for example it is being sent from a script, we may attempt to disable that script and notify The Customer.
If it is being sent from an individual account, if possible, we may attempt to disable password access to that account.
We may then notify the customer giving them 24 hours to investigate the complaint and provide a resolution to the abuse complaint.
Should we be unable to isolate and/or disable the source of the "Spam" we may place a SMTP filter against The Customer's service to prevent additional emails from being sent out until at which time a resolution to the issue is made.
If after 24 hours no response has been received from the customer, additional steps may be taken to ensure the "Spam" has been stopped such as system wide SMTP filters, suspension of individual sites, disabling password access to certain accounts, disabling of scripts or as a final step suspension of all services.


For example: A violation resulting from "Resource Abuse".
We may investigate the resource abuse and provide the Customer with a best effort analysis of the problem causing the resource abuse.
At which time the Customer may be given a time frame to make the corrections to their code, scripts, MySQL queries or software services running.
If the issue is not corrected within the time frame given, Limenex may then take further steps to ensure the stability of the network and servers and may take actions including but not limited to disabling plugins, themes, accounts, scripts, services and in reserves the right to issue a full service suspension depending on the severity of the issue based upon Limenex's judgment of the scenario.


None of the above examples are meant to be specific guidelines with regards to how each and every case may be handled.
Limenex reserves full rights to use its judgment and discretion in how each individual case is handled.


Limenex handles any and all Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) complaints very seriously and will thoroughly investigate each complaint received.
Limenex reserves the right to pursue civil remedies for any costs associated with the investigation of a substantiated policy violation.
The following actions will be taken on a case-by-case basis:

A ticket is opened as a warning, providing 24 hours to resolve the situation.
After 24 hours with no client response, connection to the IP address from the DMCA complaint will be disabled at the network level.
At this time, Limenex reserves the right to assess a USD$50 fine.
After 72 hours with no resolution, services on the server in question will be suspended.
After 7 days of being suspended and the issue not having been resolved, services on the server in question will be canceled and an Abuse Charge of USD$300 will be placed on the account.
All client data will be destroyed immediately after the cancellation date.
Customers who violate this policy and fail to resolve the situation within 24 hours agree that in addition to these administrative penalties, they will pay 'Research Fees' not to exceed USD$75 per hour that Limenex personnel must spend to investigate the matter, to be charged only if claims are found to be valid.
Limenex may charge $50 per abuse incident as per our discretion.

This clause is mainly enforced at users who frequently violate our Terms of Service or has a disproportionately high amount of abuse incidents.
