 SECTION 1 - OVERVIEW
(Please, please read the whole thing, this is a contract after all.)
Platform.sh is your hosting solution.
Our PaaS (Platform as a Service) will let you host your products and services on a dedicated real-time basis, configured and optimized by us, Platform.sh.
Our end to end complete infrastructure allows you to simply deploy your applications to the cloud without any headaches.
We automatically configure and run not only your application server but all the services on which it depends (databases, search engines, cache backends, etc.).
On top of an easy to navigate web interface, we offer you APIs to control all your third-party integrations and tools.
âPlatform.shâ is operated by Platform.sh SAS, a French company located at 131, Boulevard de SÃ©bastopol, Paris, 75002 France, and Platform.sh, Inc.
a Delaware registered corporation, addressed at PO Box 536 Brooklyn, MI 49230 and may include its affiliates, subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, contractors, and/or licensors (together, referred to throughout these Terms of Service as âPlatform.shâ or âusâ or âweâ).
By visiting our site and/ or purchasing something from us, you agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions (âTerms of Serviceâ, âTermsâ), including those additional terms and conditions and policies referenced herein and/or available by hyperlink, including our Privacy Policy.
These Terms of Service apply to all users of the site, including without limitation users who are browsers, vendors, customers, merchants, and/or contributors of content.
We offer many services, tools, products, software, and offerings on related Platform.sh websites (the âServicesâ), including but not limited to, all information, tools and Services available from this website (or âsiteâ) to you (the âuserâ, âcustomer,â âcompanyâ conditioned upon your acceptance of such terms, conditions, policies and notices in or referenced in the Terms of Service.
Please read these Terms carefully before accessing or using our website.
By accessing or using any part of the site, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this agreement, then you may not access the website or use any services.
If these Terms of Service are considered an offer, acceptance is expressly limited to these Terms of Service.
METERED AND USAGE BASED: Our Services are bundled in monthly plans, but the actual billing is based on the actual usage you make of our services.
To learn more about our self-service plans, please visit our pricing page.
UPTIME: We try to keep our Services up all the time, but the self-service plans only come with a very limited uptime guarantee of 99.5% (our track record is much higher, but we will not commit to it because not all services run with redundancy).
Most other providers wonât even commit to this.
If you need guaranteed uptime because you depend on your website for your companyâs income you should check out our ENTERPRISE offering.
SUPPORT: The self-service Professional plans do not include personalized support.
We do give support, on a best effort basis, through an online service desk, and on public forums.
We are sorry but our engineers will simply not take phone calls (if you are using this service you are probably a developer, and do not like taking phone calls either).
If your organization needs people they can contact 24/7, again you will need to purchase an optional ENTERPRISE offering (which redefines white gloving, our support staff will be more than happy to talk to you!).
Please contact your salesperson for our terms.
ENTERPRISE SUPPORT: Selected self-service Professional plans do offer an optional enterprise SLA, which provides the following ticket response times through an online service desk: Priority 1 â Less than 1 hour, Priority 2 &amp.
3 â Less than 1 working day.
This SLA is offered on an annual term basis, paid for in advance, and is non-refundable.
Further details can be found in the specific terms referenced in the Order/Quote form you will need to sign to buy this.

Specifically, we call your attention to the fact that, in accordance with applicable law, specifically French law, you must clearly be identifiable to third parties in your function as a web host, if you use our services to host public communication services online (notably websites or blogs), regardless of whether you are only an editor to such services.

Some changes may incur additional fees, for which you will be informed and will be subject to your express prior consent.

In order to reduce storage, you may need to subscribe to a new Platform.sh Service offering and transition the content from the larger one to the smaller one.

DDoS, botnet, spamming).


In any event, Platform.sh reserves the right to interrupt some or all of the Services in order to perform a technical intervention, particularly in the case of defective operation, or to improve the operation, or to perform maintenance.
In accordance with our 99.5% self-service uptime, we will do everything necessary to limit the time of such interruption as much as possible and, if possible, we will give you reasonable prior notice, indicating the date, type, and duration of the intervention, so that you can make all the necessary arrangements.
However, you acknowledge that we will not be able to give you prior notice in the case where the Service interruption is due to an external reason, for example emergency security patching (and in particular, one that would be inherent to the internet itself, acts of God, war, terrorism, riot, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, earthquakes, labor strikes, industrial disputes, or fuel crises) or if it is explicitly requested by a competent authority or in application of current French law.
Platform.sh Professional is intended to be used to host websites, web-applications, and web-APIs with unmetered bandwidth based on fair-use assumptions.
It is not intended to be used as a download service or as a Content Delivery Network (CDN).
As such, the Services self-service offering currently does not limit the bandwidth you may use, as long as it falls inside the realm of what Platform.sh deems as ordinary usage.
The Professional Enterprise offering includes CDN with a 1Tb per month included amount, beyond which overages are chargeable.
Our development environments share resources between themselves and as such are not intended to be used for production type workloads such as intensive calculations and regular long running jobs.
Should Platform.sh deem a customerâs account as exceeding fair use bandwidth consumption, or development environment usage, Platform.sh will notify the customer and allow the customer to remedy the problem.
However, should a customerâsâ bandwidth or Central Processing Unit (CPU) usage be significantly greater than what Plaform.sh deems as fair use of the Services, Platform.sh reserves the right to suspend or throttle the customerâs account where appropriate.
In such event, Platform.sh will notify you and discuss other available options and Services that could better suited for your use and needs.

Not patching notified vulnerabilities may lead to account suspension, at the discretion of Platform.sh.
Any notified vulnerabilities must be patched as soon as possible.
For the avoidance of any doubt, Platform.sh will not be responsible for any such vulnerabilities and the customer remains solely responsible for applying security patches.


At its sole discretion, Platform.sh may employ mitigation techniques to reduce the effects of any attack or security vulnerability, without taking on any such liability for such mitigation.


Platform.sh may provide templates and code examples in its documentation, public repositories, and support interactions.
It will make reasonable efforts to make sure these examples respect secure coding standards but the client recognizes that example code may not be ready for production settings, and it is the clients responsibility to make sure and application code they run, even when originally provided by Platform.sh is up-to-date and secure.

Governing Law.
Judicial forum for disputes.

These Terms are governed by French law and in accordance with the laws the Commerce Tribunal of Paris, France, without regard to any such conflicts of law principles.
You and Platform.sh agree that any judicial proceeding to resolve claims relating to these Terms will be subject to the mandatory international arbitration provisions below.
Both you and Platform.sh consent to such mandatory arbitration.
If you reside in a country (for example, European Union member states) with laws that give consumers the right to bring disputes in their local courts, this paragraph doesnât affect those requirements or rights.

IF YOUâRE A U.S.
RESIDENT, YOU ALSO AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS:

Both Parties Agree To Arbitrate. You and Platform.sh agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms through final and binding arbitration before one arbitrator, except as set forth under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below.
This includes disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this âMandatory Arbitration Provisionsâ section, including its enforceability, revocability, or validity.

Arbitration Procedures. Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Terms of Service and incorporated agreements or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration in London, United Kingdom before one arbitrator(s) with substantial experience arbitrating claims relating to commercial contracts relating to software.
The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its International Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those Rules or pursuant to JAMSâ International Arbitration Rules and Procedures.
This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.
The language to be used in the arbitral proceedings will be English.
Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof.

Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate.

Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above.
If the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Commerce Tribunal of Paris, France to resolve your claim.

NO CLASS ACTIONS. You may only resolve disputes with Platform.sh on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action.

Notwithstanding the above, if you reside in a country with laws that give consumers the right to bring disputes in their local courts (for example, European Union member states), the Terms of Service shall be governed by the laws of the Commerce Tribunal of Paris, France (or construed in accordance with your local laws if the laws of France are not enforceable).
