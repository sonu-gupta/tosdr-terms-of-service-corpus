Nike, Inc.
(referred to as âNikeâ, âourâ, âweâ or âusâ in this privacy policy).

WHAT Personal Data Do We Collect, When, and From What Sources?

We ask you for certain personal data to provide you with the products or services you request.
For example, when you make purchases, contact our consumer services, request to receive communications, create an account, participate in our events or contests, or use our Platform. 
This personal data includes your:

fitness activity data provided by you or generated through our Platform (time, duration, distance, location, calorie count, pace/stride).
or
personal preferences including your wish list as well as marketing preferences.

We collect additional personal data from you to enable particular features within our Platform.&nbsp.
For example, we request access to your phoneâs location data to log your run route, your contacts to allow you to interact with your friends, your calendar to schedule a training plan or your social network credentials to post content from our Platform to a social network.&nbsp.
This personal data includes your:

movement data from your deviceâs accelerometer;
photos, contacts and calendar information;

or

When interacting with our Platforms, certain data is automatically collected from your device or web browser, as further described below in the section titled âCookies and Pixel Tags.â This data includes:

Device IDs, call state, network access, storage information and battery information.
and
Cookies, IP addresses, referrer headers, data identifying your web browser and version, web beacons, tags, and interactions with our Platform.


KIDS

We do not knowingly collect personal information online from children under the age of 13. 

TOOLS to Manage What Personal Data We Collect

When using our Platform, we also provide in-time notice or obtain consent for certain practices.
For example, we will obtain consent to use your location or to send push notifications.
We may obtain this consent through the Platform or using the standard permissions available on your device.
In many cases, your web browser or mobile device platform will provide additional tools to allow you to control when your device collects or shares particular categories of personal data.&nbsp.
For example, your mobile device or web browser may offer tools to allow you to manage cookie usage or location sharing.&nbsp.
We encourage you to familiarize yourself with and use the tools available on your devices.   
At this time, we do not respond to âdo not trackâ signals sent by web browsers.

WHY and HOW Do We Use Your Personal Data?

We use your personal data in the following ways:

To Provide the Features of the Platform and the Services You Request 
When you use our Platform, we will use your personal data to provide the requested product or service.&nbsp.
For example, if you make a purchase on Nike.com, or participate in an event or promotion, we will use the contact information you give us to communicate with you about the purchase, event or promotion.
If you contact our consumer services, we will use information about you, such as delivery or payment information, or the product you have purchased to help you resolve a problem or question. 
If you use our Platform to track your fitness activity or physical characteristics, we will collect this personal data and store it so that you can review it in the Platform.&nbsp.
Your fitness activity data may include data you enter about your activity or data collected by your device during your activity such as location data and movement data.&nbsp.
We may use this activity data to calculate further information about your activity, such as distance run, or calories burned, so that the calculated information can be provided to you as part of the functionality of the Platform. 
In many cases, to use particular features within our Platform you may need to provide Nike with additional data or additional consent to use particular data in a certain way.&nbsp.
For example, to use the heart rate tracking features of our Platform, you may need to connect to a heart rate monitoring device.
Similarly, to share content on social media, you may be required to provide your social media account credentials to sign in.

To Communicate Information about our Products, Services, Events and for Other Promotional Purposes

If you are an existing customer of Nike (for example, if you have placed an order with us), we may use the contact details you provided to send you marketing communications about similar Nike products or services, where permitted by applicable law (unless you have opted out).
In other cases, we ask for your consent to send you marketing information.
We may use the information that you provide to us as, well as information from other Nike products or services such as your use of Nikeâs Platform to personalize communications and advertisements regarding our products and services that may be of interest to you.&nbsp.
For registered users, this may include data collected from your interactions with our Platform that are associated with your account across devices.

To Operate, Improve and Maintain our Business, Products and Services 
We use the personal data you provide to us to operate our business.&nbsp.
For example, when you make a purchase, we use that information for accounting, audits and other internal functions.&nbsp.
We may use personal data about how you use our products and services to enhance your user experience and to help us diagnose technical and service problems and administer our Platform. 


To Protect Our or Others' Rights, Property or Safety 
We may also use personal data about how you use our Platform to prevent, detect, or investigate fraud, abuse, illegal use, violations of our Terms of Use, and to comply with court orders, governmental requests or applicable law. 


For General Research and Analysis Purposes 
We use data about how our visitors use our Platform to understand customer behavior or preferences.&nbsp.
For example, we may use information about how visitors to Nike.com search for and find products to better understand the best ways to organize and present product offerings in our storefront.

As discussed above, Nike collects data about your fitness activity or your physical characteristics, together, âWorkout Infoâ, to provide certain services on our Platform.&nbsp.
Because of the personal nature of this data, we strive to provide you with clear information about how Workout Info will be used.&nbsp.
