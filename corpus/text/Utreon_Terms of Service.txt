You and Utreon agree that you will notify each other in writing of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises.
Notice to Utreon shall be sent to Utreon Inc., Attn: Legal, 477 Madison Avenue, 6th floor, PMB# 4859, New York, NY, 10022.

and that the state or federal courts in New York County, New York have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals of an arbitration award and over any suit between the parties not subject to arbitration.
Other than class procedures and remedies discussed below, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court.
Any dispute between the parties will be governed by this Agreement and the laws of the State of New York and applicable United States law, without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that may provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction.
Whether the dispute is heard in arbitration or in court, you and Utreon will not commence against the other a class action, class arbitration or other representative action or proceeding.
(ii) If you are a resident in any jurisdiction in which the provision in the section above is found to be unenforceable, then the following shall apply:
