Each of these is discussed below:

Cookies (or Browser Cookies)

A cookie is a small file placed on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device.
It may contain certain data, including, but not limited to: the name of the server that has placed it there, an identifier in the form of a unique number, and an expiration date (some cookies only).
Cookies are managed by the web browser on your computer (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, or Google Chrome).
Different types of cookies which have different purposes are used on our Website.

Essential Cookies

These cookies are essential to allow you to browse our Website and use its functions.
Without them, services such as shopping baskets and electronic invoicing would not be able to work.

Performance Cookies

These cookies collect information on the use of our Website, such as which pages are consulted most often.
This information enables us to optimize our Website and simplify browsing.
Performance cookies also enable our affiliates and partners to find out whether you have accessed one of our Websites from their site and whether your visit has led to the use or purchase of a product or Service from our Website, including the references for the product or Service purchased.
These cookies do not collect any information which could be used to identify you.
All the information collected is aggregated, and therefore anonymous.

Functionality Cookies

These cookies enable our Website to remember the choices you have made when browsing.
For example, we can store your geographical location in a cookie so that the Website corresponding to your area is shown.
We can also remember your preferences, such as the text size, font, and other customizable aspects of the Website.
Functionality cookies may also be able to keep track of the products or videos consulted to avoid repetition.
The information collected by these cookies cannot be used to identify you and cannot monitor your browsing activity on websites which do not belong to us.
It is possible that you will come across third-party cookies on some pages of websites that are not under our control.
You may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating the appropriate setting in your browser.
However, if you select this setting, you may be unable to access certain parts of our Website.
Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you direct your browser to our Website.
We also use cookies to implement tracking technology on our Website.
This allows us to display advertising that is tailored to you on our Website, which parts of our content interest you the most, and which Service categories you request.
This tracking uses De-Identified Personal Information data.
We will not combine this data with your other Personal Information without your express permission.
Some of our contracted vendors and affinity partners are allowed to place cookies on our Website.
Those companies may also provide you with the option of preventing the use of cookies in the future.
For more information, contact the relevant third-party provider.

Local Storage Cookies. Certain features of our Website may use locally stored objects (or Adobe Flash cookies) to collect and store information about your preferences and navigation to, from, and on our Website.
Local storage cookies are not managed by the same browser settings as are used for browser cookies.

Web Beacons.
Pages of our Website and our emails may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear GIFs, pixel tags, and single-pixel GIFs) that permit us, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened an email and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity).

Pixel Tracking. In addition to using Cookies, the Website may employ "pixel tracking," a common process which may be used in connection with advertisements on other websites.
Pixel tracking involves the use of pixel tags that are not visible to the user and consist of a few lines of computer code.
Pixel tracking measures the effectiveness of advertisements and compiles aggregate and specific usage statistics.
A "pixel tag" is an invisible tag placed on certain pages of websites that is used to track an individual user's activity.
We may access these pixel tags to identify activity and interests that may allow us to better match our goods, services, and other offers with your interests and needs.
For example, if you visit our Website from an advertisement on another website, the pixel tag will allow the advertiser to track that its advertisement brought you to the Website.
If you visit our Website, and we link you to another website, we may also be able to determine that you were sent to and/or transacted with a third-party website.
This data is collected for use in our marketing and research.

GIF. We may use tiny images known as clear GIFs to track behavior of users, including statistics on who opens our emails.
IP Address.
Our servers automatically record certain log file information reported from your browser when you access the Website or Services.
These server logs may include information such as which pages of the Website you visited, your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, and other information on how you interact with the Website.
These log files are generally deleted periodically.


Third-Party Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies


We also collect information though our Google AdWords tracking code to support advertising by Google AdWords, which collects data about our Website's traffic via the DoubleClick cookie.
We have implemented Google AdWords features based on Display Advertising, which may include Remarketing, Google Display Network Impressions Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager Integration, or Google AdWords Demographics and Interest Reporting.
We may use Remarketing with Google AdWords to advertise online through third-party vendors, including Google, which may display our ads on websites throughout the Internet.
We and our third-party vendors, including Google, may use first-party cookies (such as the Google AdWords cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve advertisements based on your past visits to our Websites, and to report our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services as it relates to visits to our Websites.
We may use data from Google's interest-based advertising or third-party audience data (such as age, gender, and interests) with Google AdWords to, among other things, better provide you with appropriate content.
