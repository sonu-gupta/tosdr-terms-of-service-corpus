We reserve the right to remove Content alleged to be infringing or otherwise illegal without prior notice and at our sole discretion.
In appropriate circumstances, we will also terminate a Mapillary Userâs account if the Mapillary User is determined to be a repeat infringer.
7.9 Governing Law.

You acknowledge and agree that breach of these Terms, or any unauthorized use, disclosure or distribution of the Mapillary Solution or Content, may cause irreparable harm to us, the extent of which would be difficult to ascertain, and that we will be entitled to seek immediate injunctive relief (in addition to any other available remedies), in any court of competent jurisdiction under the applicable laws thereto.
7.13 Sweden-Based Site.
The Mapillary Solution is controlled by Mapillary from its offices in Sweden.

The Terms constitute the entire agreement between us and govern each Mapillary User's use of the Mapillary Solution, superseding any prior agreements.
Each Mapillary User may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when that Mapillary User uses affiliate services, third party content or third party software.
If any provision of the Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms remain in full force and effect.
No waiver of any provision of these Terms will be deemed a further waiver or continuing waiver or such provision or any other provision, and our failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
Nothing herein will be deemed to create an agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer or franchisor-franchisee relationship of any kind between us and any user or other person or entity, nor do these terms extend rights to any third party.
The parties hereto confirm that they have requested that these Terms and all attachments and related documents, if any, be drafted in English.
