1.
GENERALLY.
You and the Covered Parties (defined below) agree that any and all disputes and claims between you and the Covered Parties will be resolved by binding individual arbitration.
All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except for those issues relating to the arbitrability of disputes and the validity, enforceability, and scope of this arbitration provision, including the interpretation of paragraph 7 below, must be determined by a court and not an arbitrator.
For purposes of this Arbitration Provision, references to âyouâ include your direct and indirect parents, subsidiaries, and affiliates as well as the predecessors, successors, assigns, officers, directors, agents or employees of any of them.
references to âCovered Partiesâ include Wave Financial, Inc.
and Wave Financial USA Inc., their respective direct and indirect parents, subsidiaries, and affiliates as well as the predecessors, successors, assigns, officers, directors, agents or employees of any of them.&nbsp.
This agreement to arbitrate includes, but is not limited to, all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of services provided by Wave, whether based in equity, contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise prior to, during, or after the termination of any service.  
YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND THE COVERED PARTIES ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, JOINT OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION.
2.
EXCEPTIONS.

3.
PRE-ARBITRATION NOTICE OF DISPUTE.
A party who intends to seek arbitration must first mail a written Notice of Dispute (âNoticeâ) to the other party.
The Notice to the Covered Parties should be addressed to: Wave-Legal Department, Attention: Notice of Dispute, Wave Financial USA Inc.
1500 Wewatta Street, Ste.
200, Denver CO 80202.
The Notice must be on an individual basis and provide at least the following information: (a) the claimantâs name, telephone number, and e-mail address.
(b) the nature or basis of the claim or dispute.
and (c) the specific relief sought.
If the dispute is not resolved within 60 days after the Notice is received, then you or the Covered Parties may file an arbitration.
The existence or substance of any settlement discussions shall not be disclosed.
4.
ARBITRATION RULES.
Any arbitration between you and the Covered Parties will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ), or if the AAA determines that you are not a consumer, the AAAâs Commercial Arbitration Rules, as modified by this Arbitration Provision or any other instructions that the parties may agree upon at the time (collectively, the "AAA Rules"), and will be administered by the AAA.
The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.
If AAA is unavailable or unwilling to administer the arbitration consistent with this Arbitration Provision, the parties shall agree to, or the court shall select, another arbitration provider.
The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney specifically licensed to practice law in the state of your residence and selected by the parties from the arbitration providerâs national roster of arbitrators.
The arbitrator will be selected using the following procedure: (1) the arbitrator provider will send the parties a list of five candidates meeting this criteria.
(2) if the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator from the list, each party shall return its list to the arbitration provider within 10 days, striking up to two candidates, and ranking the remaining candidates in order of preference.
(3) the arbitration provider shall appoint as arbitrator the candidate with the highest aggregate ranking.
and (4) if for any reason the appointment cannot be made according to this procedure, the arbitration provider will provide the parties a new list of five candidates meeting the above criteria until an appointment can be made.
5.
ARBITRATION COSTS.
Payment of all filing, administrative, arbitrator, and hearing fees will be governed by the applicable AAA rules.&nbsp.
If you inform us that you cannot afford to pay your share of the fees, we will consider advancing those fees on your behalf.
In addition, if the AAA concludes that its Consumer Arbitration Rules apply, we will reimburse you for your share of the fees at the conclusion of the arbitration (regardless of who wins) unless (i) you failed to comply with paragraph 3 above or paragraph 7 below, or (ii) either the substance of your claim or the relief you sought was determined to be frivolous or brought for an improper purpose as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), in which case the payment of fees will be governed by the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules and you agree to reimburse the Covered Parties for all fees advanced on your behalf.
6.&nbsp.
HEARING.
Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county of your billing address.
7.&nbsp.
NO CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMS.

The arbitrator is empowered to resolve the dispute with the same remedies and defenses available in court, but the arbitratorâs rulings or any relief granted must be individualized to you and will not apply to or affect any other Person or company.
If a court decides that applicable Law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraphâs limitations as to a particular claim or any particular request for a remedy for a claim (such as a request for public injunctive relief), then only that particular claim or only that particular request for a remedy (and only that particular claim or particular request for a remedy) must remain in court and be severed from any arbitration.
