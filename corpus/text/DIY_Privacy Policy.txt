DIY (âwe,â âus,â âour,â or âDIYâ) knows that you care about how your Personal Information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously.
We are committed to protecting the privacy of children who use our site and applications, and have drafted this policy in accordance with the U.S.
Childrenâs Online Privacy Protection Act (âCOPPAâ).
For more information about COPPA and general tips about protecting childrenâs online privacy, please visit OnGuard Online.
Please read the following to learn more about how we use your Personal Information.
By visiting, accessing or using the http://diy.org website, and any other linked pages, features, content, or application services (including mobile applications) offered by DIY in connection therewith (collectively, âDIYâ), or using any of our services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?This Privacy Policy covers DIYâs treatment of personally identifiable information (âPersonal Informationâ) that DIY gathers when you access DIY and when you use DIYâs services.
This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that DIY does not own or control (including any third-party products or services used for logging into DIY or that are integrated with the DIY), or to individuals that DIY does not employ or manage.
DIY may contain links to other sites.
DIY is not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites.
When linking to another site a user should read the privacy policy stated on that site.What Personal Information Does DIY Collect?The information we gather from users enables us to provide, personalize and improve our services, and allows our users to set up a user account and profile that can be used to personalize their experience on DIY and interact with other users through the site.
In connection with DIY, we request and display some Personal Information to other users and visitors of DIY, which allows users to identify one another.
We collect the following types of information from our users:Personal Information You Provide to Us:During the account registration process, we receive and store the following information: full name of the parent or guardian, full name of the child, parentâs email address, a password for the parental account, a password for the child account, and the childâs birthdate (to verify their age).
In addition, children choose an âavatarâ and username (ânicknameâ) which will represent them on the service.
We encourage children to use our anonymous nickname generator.
Consistent with the requirements of COPPA, we collect a parent or guardian email address before we collect any Personal Information from a child.
We collect credit card information for verification purposes but do not store that information on our servers.
Weâve partnered with Stripe to help make verification and payments easier and safer.
Stripe meets and exceeds the most stringent industry standards for security.
You can learn more about the technical details of Stripe's secure infrastructure here.
DIY does not store full credit card numbers, but instead, only the last four digits and expiration date.
For contests and sweepstakes, we typically require only the information necessary for a child to participate, such as first name (to distinguish among family members) and parent email address (to notify the parent where required by law).
We only contact the parent for more personalized information (such as a mailing address) for prize-fulfillment purposes when the child wins the contest or sweepstakes.
DIY does not intentionally collect any Personal Information from children other than the information set out above.
However, as part of the functionality of our service, we allow child accounts to upload certain content to the site, including photos, videos, and comments.
We take measures to prevent children from communicating Personal Information through these features, but we cannot guarantee the effectiveness of these measures.
If you use these features to disclose personally identifiable information, you should be aware that such information could be read, collected, or used by other users and/or third parties.
You agree not to provide any personally identifiable information through these features, and we are not responsible for any personally identifiable information that you provide using these features.
You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to create an account or take advantage of many of DIYâs  special features.
The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as obtaining parental consent as set forth above, providing parents with notice of our privacy practices, answering questions, improving the content of DIY, responding to your requests for certain information, products and services, attribution for content you submit, customizing the advertising and content you see, allowing you to communicate with other users, and communicating with you about DIYâs products and services, including specials and new features.Personal Information Collected Automatically:

We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with DIY or use our services.
DIY automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, browser information, operating system, timezone, device ID, the pages you request, and the actions and path you take on DIY.


Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to DIY and how they use its various components.
DIY only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally.
This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how users use parts of DIY or services so that we can make DIY appealing to as many users as possible, and improve those services.
As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our users, collectively, use DIY or services.
We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how people use DIY or services, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience.
Again, DIY never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.


We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from DIY if your computer or device supports this type of functionality.
DIY uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful and to improve DIY and our services.
You can opt out of these communications by sending us an email at help@diy.org.

Consent by purchase

In order to participate in DIY, a parent or guardian must purchase access by providing their credit card information (note: âFree Trialsâ are considered âpurchasesâ for the purpose of consent).
In so doing, the parent or guardian grants us permission to collect necessary Personal Information from their child.
This kind of credit card verification is in compliance with COPPA and ensures an adult is the one signing a child up for DIY.

Content generated by a child

Certain activities on our sites and applications allow children to create or manipulate content (like photos, videos and comments) and save it within DIY.
By registering and creating an account for your child on DIY, you grant us permission to share your childâs content within DIY, and to share your childâs content publicly on our social media channels as long as it does not contain Personal Information.

Teacher consent in lieu of a parent

With regard to school-based activities, COPPA allows teachers and school administrators to act in the stead of parents to provide consent for the collection of Personal Information from children.
Schools should always notify parents about these activities.
For more information on parental rights with respect to a childâs educational record under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), please visit the FERPA site.

Comment System

Certain activities allow users to communicate directly with other users by means of a comment system.
In most cases, these chat systems employ filters that are intended to prevent the communication of both Personal Information and age-inappropriate words and phrases.
In addition to filters, we may employ live moderation and/or encourage other users to flag inappropriate communications.
We strongly encourage children who use these interactive features on our sites and applications never to provide Personal Information about themselves or any third party, and certainly never to attempt to circumvent our filters or moderation.
We also recommend that parents carefully supervise their children when the children participate in online activities.
Where DIY employs a comment system that does not filter out Personal Information, we will first seek high-level consent from the parent.When will DIY e-mail me?We may use your contact information to send emails to you about DIY and other related topics that may be of interest to users of DIY.
You can opt out of these communications by sending us an email at help@diy.org.
As part of DIYâs services, you will receive email and other communication relating to your childâs User Submissions.
You acknowledge and agree that by posting such User Submissions, DIY may send you email and other communication that it determines in its sole discretion to be related to your User Submissions.
Please note that if you do not want to receive legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Policy, those legal notices will still govern your use of DIY, and you are responsible for reviewing such legal notices for changes.When will DIY e-mail my child?On occasion, in order to respond to a question or request from a child, DIY may need to ask for the childâs online contact information, such as an email address.
DIY will delete this information immediately after responding to the question or request.
In connection with certain activities or services, we may collect a childâs online contact information, such as an email address, in order to communicate with the child more than once.
In such instances we will retain the childâs online contact information to honor the request and for no other purpose such as marketing.
One example would be a newsletter that provides occasional updates about an activity.
Whenever we collect a childâs online contact information for ongoing communications, we will simultaneously require a parent email address in order to notify the parent about the collection and use of the childâs information, as well as to provide the parent an opportunity to prevent further contact with the child.
On some occasions a child may be engaged in more than one ongoing communication, and a parent may be required to âopt-outâ of each communication individually.Changes to this Privacy PolicyDIY may make changes to this Privacy Policy from time to time.
Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used.
