11. PAYMENT TERMS AND CONDITIONS:  Welcome to the Payment Terms and Conditions (the "Payment Terms and Conditions") for use of the Online Payment Portal for MCM.
These Payment Terms and Conditions are part of this TOU and are applicable to any payment transaction you initiate on the MCM Website or the MCM App (each, a âPayment Transactionâ).
If you choose to use either the MCM Website or the MCM App to make a Payment Transaction, you accept and agree to these Payment Terms and Conditions.

11.1 Scope:  These Payment Terms and Conditions cover your participation in the Online Payment Portal offered by MCM (the âProgramâ).
In these Payment Terms and Conditions, the words âyouâ and âyourâ refer to the user of the MCM Website and/or the MCM App and the Online Payment Portal.
The words âwe,â our,â and âusâ refer to MCM (or its agents).
The words âbank accountâ refer to the account held by a bank, securities firm, or other financial institution from which payment will be made when you make a Payment Transaction under the Program.
The words âyour bankâ mean the bank, securities firm, or other financial institution that holds your account and/or issued your credit or debit card.
Participating in the Program will enable you to pay your MCM account(s) online or through the MCM App.
MCM, in its sole discretion, may refuse this payment option service, and specific payment methods, to anyone or any user without notice for any reason at any time.

11.2 Payment Authorization (Including Automatic Payments):  To use the Program to make a Payment Transaction, including automatic payments (if eligible), you must designate a valid major credit card, check, or electronic check (âPayment Methodâ).
Each time you initiate a Payment Transaction(s), you authorize us or our agent to draw a check or draft, initiate an automated clearing house (âACHâ) debit, and/or charge your Payment Method, in your name to the bank account you specify, payable to us or to our agent, in the amount of the Payment Transaction, on the date(s) specified ("Billing Date") of the month(s) of payment according to the schedule (one-time or recurring) that you have affirmatively elected to enroll in for your MCM account.
Your transaction must be payable in U.S.
dollars.
By paying using your designated Payment Method, you agree that: (a) you have read, understand and agree to these Payment Terms and Conditions, and that this agreement constitutes a "writing signed by you" under any applicable law or regulation.
(b) you consent to the electronic delivery of the disclosures contained in these Payment Terms and Conditions.
(c) you authorize MCM (or its agent) to make any inquiries we consider necessary to validate any dispute involving your payment, which may include ordering a credit report and performing other credit checks or verifying the information you provide against third party databases.
(d) you authorize MCM (or its agent) to initiate one or more drafts or ACH debit entries (withdrawals) or the creation of an equivalent bank draft for the specified amount(s) from your bank account.
and (e) you authorize the financial institution that holds your bank account to deduct such payments, debit your debit card, and/or charge your credit card, and to initiate any debit or credit entries to your bank account in the amount of such payments or corrections.

11.3 Charges:.  Before you make your payment, make sure you have enough money in your bank account to cover the payment.
For each transaction, your bank may assess its customary per-check or item-handling charge, if any.
Your bank may also assess its customary charge for each dishonored check or draft.
If any transaction (check, demand, draft, debit, or charge debited or drawn by us or our agent in connection with the Program) is not honored by your bank, we have the right to collect the amount from you as permitted by applicable law.
If this happens, we may cancel your right to participate in the Program.
For certain accounts, you may have a separate agreement with a participating bank, securities firm, or other financial institution that allows a line of credit to be accessed in the event that your account contains insufficient funds to make payment to us.
You should refer to the appropriate agreement relating to that line of credit for the terms and conditions that govern its use.

11.4 Payment:.  Any request or order to settle or make a Payment Transaction shall require MCMâs confirmation of acceptance and may also require additional verification or information from you before acceptance by MCM.
All amounts are denoted in US Dollars ($).
MCM utilizes third party payment processors, and you hereby agree that MCM may charge your chosen payment method for any Payment Transaction and for any applicable taxes.
You agree to pay all charges incurred by you in connection with any credit card, debit card, or other payment method utilized in connection with a Payment Transaction with MCM.
MCM does not assess fees or interest to a consumerâs balance throughout the period of active repayment (except those awarded by a court upon agreement with the consumer or after due process of law).
however, missed payments will invalidate any agreed upon arrangement.
Interest on the account, if applicable, which had been deferred while payments were being received may be added back to the account after payments ceased.
MCM also reserves the right to terminate or suspend access to the MCM Website or the MCM App if you fail to pay any amounts when due.
You shall reimburse MCM for all reasonable costs incurred (including reasonable attorneyâs fees) in collecting past-due amounts.

11.5. Third-Party Processors:  You acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for compliance with any third-party payment processorâs terms and conditions and may be required to establish an account with a third-party payment service provider in order to complete a Payment Transaction.
You may also be required to abide by additional instructions from and to agree to further terms and conditions with MCM regarding payment, retrieving data, and receiving other services.
If there is a conflict between this TOU and such other or third-party terms and conditions, this TOU shall control as it relates to the subject matter of this TOU.

11.6 Current Information:  It is your responsibility to make sure that your Payment Method information and contact information are current at all times during the term of the payment plan you specify in your Payment Transaction.

11.7 Payment Processing for Online Payments:  With limited exceptions, Payment Transactions made through the Program will be processed within 24 hours of receipt.
Payment Transactions made through the Program at or before 2:00 pm PST will be credited to your account the same day.
Payment Transactions made after 2:00 pm PST may be credited to your account the following business day.
You are solely responsible for making payments sufficiently available prior to the due date, and you are solely responsible for actions taken on your account resulting from a late payment.

11.8 Turning Off Automatic Payment or Voiding Your Plan:  To cancel automatic payments on your payment plan, please contact us directly at the phone number at the bottom of the page.
You may also void your plan by logging into your account located on the MCM Website or the MCM App, or by calling the same number.
Such cancellation or termination shall be effective at the time of cancellation or termination.
To cancel, change, or modify your payments or plan, please call or log-on at least two (2) Business Days before the Billing Date, unless otherwise permitted under applicable law, or your payment may be debited and/or charged for the then due payment.
If you have entered into an agreement on a pending civil action regarding the underlying debt or a court has approved your payment plan and it, or the agreement itself, requires additional actions by either party in the event of your non-payment or default, then your cancellation of online automatic payments will be honored.
However, this may not affect your legal rights or your obligations to pay as agreed.
"Business Day" means Monday through Friday, excluding official U.S.
government holidays and official MCM corporate holidays.

As general rule, you should report any fraudulent, erroneous or unauthorized transactions to your bank within 60 days after the questionable transaction FIRST appeared on your bank account statement.
You should contact your bank for more information about the policies and procedures that apply to your account and any unauthorized transactions, including any limits on your liability.
We will not be liable to you in the following instances:
Â·  If, through no fault of ours, your account does not contain enough money to complete the transaction;
Â·  If the funds in your account are subject to legal process or other encumbrance restricting the transaction.
or
Â·  If circumstances beyond our control (such as fire or flood) prevent the transaction, despite reasonable precautions that we have taken.

11.12 Disclosure of Payment Information to Third-Parties:  To protect your privacy, we will not disclose any information about your online Payment Transactions to any person, except as follows:
1.  as necessary to complete transactions;

We have the right to assign these Payment Terms and Conditions to a subsidiary or affiliate company at any time.

11.16 Note for Massachusetts Residents:

GENERAL DISCLOSURE STATEMENT: Any documentation provided to you which indicates that an electronic fund transfer was made shall be admissible as evidence of such transfer and shall constitute prima facie proof that such transfer was made.
The initiation by you of certain electronic funds transfers from your account will, except as otherwise provided in these Payment Terms and Conditions, effectively eliminate your ability to stop payment of the transfer.
UNLESS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THESE PAYMENT TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU MAY NOT STOP PAYMENT OF ELECTRONIC FUND TRANSFERS.
THEREFORE, YOU SHOULD NOT EMPLOY ELECTRONIC ACCESS FOR PAYMENTS UNLESS YOU ARE SATISFIED THAT YOU WILL NOT NEED TO STOP PAYMENT.
DISCLOSURE OF ACCOUNT INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES: If you give us your written authorization to disclose information about you, your account or the transactions that you make to any person, that authorization shall be effective until we receive written notification from you to cancel such authorization, unless otherwise agreed or permitted by law, or as necessary under Paragraph 11.12.

We reserve the right to subcontract any of our rights or obligations under these Payment Terms and Conditions and TOU.

In addition, any feedback received by MCM will be deemed to include from you a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, non-exclusive right and license for MCM to adopt, publish, reproduce, disseminate, transmit, distribute, copy, use, create derivative works of, display (in whole or in part) worldwide, or act on such feedback without additional approval or consideration, in any form, media, or technology now known or later developed for the full term of any rights that may exist in the information, material, or content related to such feedback, and you hereby waive any claim to the contrary.

13. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER:  THE MCM WEBSITE AND THE MCM APP, AND EACH OF THEM, ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE", AND MAY INCLUDE ERRORS, OMISSIONS, OR OTHER INACCURACIES.
MCM MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES ABOUT EITHER THE MCM WEBSITE OR THE MCM APP AND HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

MOREOVER, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AGREE THAT IN NO EVENT SHALL MCM BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, FOR LOST PROFITS, FOR LOST DATA, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH YOUR USE OF THE MCM WEBSITE OR THE MCM APP, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF MCM HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGES.
WITHOUT LIMITATION OF THE FOREGOING, TOTAL LIABILITY OF MCM FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER RELATED TO USE OF THE MCM WEBSITE OR THE MCM APP, RESULTS FROM USE OF THE MCM WEBSITE OR THE MCM APP, OR FOR ANY CLAIMS RELATING TO THIS TOU SHALL NOT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100.00 USD).

15. ARBITRATION:  Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of the MCM Website OR THE MCM APP, or to any interaction with MCM or its parent or affiliates, whether through the MCM website, THE MCM APP, or otherwise, or to any product(s) or service(s) offered by mcm or its parent or affiliates will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify.
The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.

There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.
However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Conditions of Use as a court would.

To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent Corporation Service Company.
The arbitration will be conducted by any appropriate arbitration forum including, but not limited to the American Arbitration Association (AAA) or JAMS, under their rules, including any Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes.
The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
JAMS rules are available at WWW.JAMSADR.COM or by calling (800) 352-5267. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the rules of the arbitration forum. mcm, its parent OR affiliates will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.
You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.

We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial.
We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.

16. ENFORCEMENT:  MCM wishes to maintain the MCM Website and the MCM App as helpful resources for all of its users.
As it relates to MCM, MCM reserves the right to view, monitor, and/or record activity on the MCM Website and/or the MCM App (in accordance with applicable law) and to comply with government or court appointed authorities when necessary.
Actual or attempted unauthorized use of the MCM Website or the MCM App may also result in criminal and/or civil prosecution, including, without limitation, punishment under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 under U.S.
federal law.
You shall therefore not, nor shall you permit any third party to, disable, circumvent, or otherwise avoid any security device, mechanism, protocol, or procedure established by MCM for use of or with the MCM Website or the MCM App.
Moreover, you also acknowledge that any breach, threatened or actual, of this TOU by you may cause irreparable injury to MCM and/or its licensors, such injury would not be quantifiable in monetary damages, and MCM and/or its licensors would not have an adequate remedy at law.
You therefore agree that MCM and/or its licensors (or on their behalf) shall be entitled, in addition to other available remedies, to seek and be awarded an injunction or other appropriate equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction restraining any breach, threatened or actual, of your obligations under any provision of this TOU.
Accordingly, you hereby waive any requirement that MCM or its licensors post any bond or other security in the event any injunctive or equitable relief is sought by or awarded to MCM to enforce any provision of this TOU.

17. TERMINATION:  MCM also reserves the right at any time and on reasonable grounds, which shall include, without limitation, any reasonable belief of fraud, illegal activity, or actions or omissions that violate any term or condition of this TOU, to terminate this TOU with you (including any registered account) and your right to access and use the MCM Website and/or the MCM App.
You acknowledge and agree that MCM shall have the sole right to determine in its reasonable discretion whether you are engaging in any unauthorized activity and/or violating any term or conditions of this TOU.
MCM shall also not be responsible or liable for any damages or loss, such as loss of sales or profits, as a result of any termination of this TOU in accordance with this section.
You may also terminate at any time by ceasing to use the MCM Website and/or the MCM App.
