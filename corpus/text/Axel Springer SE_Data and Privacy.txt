 Data and Privacy 
Privacy policy of axelspringer.com

We are very pleased about your interest in axelspringer.com.
With this Privacy Policy, we aim to inform you about how, why and to what extent we process personal data, and what your rights are as a Data Subject.


 Data Controller


Unless otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, the Data Controller in accordance with Art.â¯4â¯no.â¯7â¯GDPR is Axel Springer SE, Axel-Springer-Str.
65, 10888 Berlin, Germany, Phone: +49 30 2591 0, E-Mail: information@axelspringer.de (hereinafter also âweâ or âusâ).


 Accessing the website


When you use our service, we will automatically collect and process various data items.
These include for example:

Information about the end device accessing the site and the software used
Date and time of the access
Cookies and pseudonym IDs (core services)
Websites from which the user has accessed our website or which the user accesses through our website
IP address

This IP address must be stored for technical reasons, even if only temporarily, in order to enable the website to be downloaded to the userâs end device.
The legal basis for data processing is provided by Art.â¯6â¯para.â¯1â¯pointâ¯bâ¯GDPR.
Our servers also store your IP address for up to 14â¯days for internal security purposes (Art.â¯6â¯para.â¯1â¯pointâ¯fâ¯GDPR).


 Newsletter


If you have subscribed to one of our notification services or newsletters, we will use your e-mail address to send you the newsletter that you have subscribed to.
The legal basis for data processing is provided by Art.â¯6â¯para.â¯1â¯pointâ¯aâ¯GDPR.
You can withdraw your consent at any time with future effect or unsubscribe from the subscribed newsletter, for example by clicking on the unsubscribe link provided for this purpose in each newsletter.
These e-mails feature âtracking pixelsâ for the purpose of and in service of our interest in optimising our newsletter.
This provides us with information about which browser and which operating system is being used, which IP address is currently accessing it, and also who the provider is.
It is also used to detect if the e-mail has been read and whether the link integrated into the e-mail has been clicked on, such that the website has been visited from that IP address.
Moreover, it is used to count the number of accesses to the website and the relevant time of day when the e-mail was opened and the access was performed.
The approximate location of the user is also identified by these means.
If you do not wish to be tracked in this fashion, you can unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time as described above.
The legal basis for data processing is provided by Art.â¯6â¯para.â¯1â¯pointâ¯fâ¯GDPR.


 Contact initiated by you


When you contact us, for example using one of our contact forms or e-mail addresses, the data that you provide (your e-mail address, possibly your name and your telephone number) will be processed by us for the purpose of responding to your enquiry.
We will delete data collected in this connection once it is no longer required for the aforementioned purpose, unless the deletion of this data would contravene statutory retention obligations.
The legal basis for data processing is provided by Art.â¯6â¯para.â¯1â¯sentenceâ¯1â¯pointâ¯fâ¯GDPR.


 Place of Processing


We also process data in countries outside of the European Economic Area (âEEAâ), for example in the USA.
To ensure that a suitable level of data protection is observed, we make use of the EU Standard Contractual Clauses for the preparation of the contracts with services employed in Third Countries as per Art.â¯46â¯para.â¯2â¯pointâ¯câ¯GDPR, unless there is an adequacy decision issued by the European Commission for that Third Country:
Standard Contractual Clauses with Data Processors
Standard Contractual Clauses with Data Controllers


 Transmission of Data


Unless otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we will only transmit your personal data to third parties if transmission is required to comply with our contractual obligations to you and this evidently needs to be done through or jointly with another provider, if we are permitted or required by law to transmit the data on other grounds, or if you have provided us with the relevant consent.


 Cookies and similar Technologies


In order to provide our service, ensure security and prevent fraud, the use of cookies and similar technologies is necessary (core services).Your Privacy Settings and your cookie settings (regarding permitted/blocked cookies) are also stored on your end device.
The use of cookies is required for us to provide you with the service requested by you.
Please refer to the Privacy Settings for further information on these special categories of cookies.
Cookies are small files that your browser places in a folder designated for this purpose on your device.
This makes it possible, for instance, to determine whether you have visited a website before.
Many cookies contain what is known as a âcookie IDâ.
A cookie ID is a unique cookie identifier.
It consists of a string of characters which websites and servers can associate with the specific web browser where the cookie has been stored.
This enables visited websites and servers to differentiate between the specific browser of the Data Subject and other web browsers containing different cookies.
A specific web browser can be recognised and identified using the unique cookie ID.
Without additional information, cookies cannot be used to identify you personally.
Unless otherwise agreed, we and our partners will only employ other cookies and similar technologies with your consent expressed through corresponding Privacy Settings.
These cookies are used by ourselves and our partners to store and process data on your end device for the purposes listed below in this Privacy Policy.
If consent is not granted for the setting of cookies, it may not be possible to fully use all functions of our website.
More information on the cookies used and equivalent technologies and our partners is provided in the relevant parts of this Privacy Policy and your Privacy Settings, where you can withdrawal your consent with future effect at any time.
Previously created cookies can also be deleted by you at any time using your web browser or another software solution.
This is possible in all standard web browsers.
Please note that this will also delete any settings you have made in your Privacy Settings, such that these will need to be reconfigured when you visit our website again.
The duration of the cookies is limited to a maximum of one year unless otherwise stated.


 Content Performance Measurement


With your consent, we use services for the purpose of measuring the performance of content on our service.
These services collect metrics and provide reports on the deployment of content to users and how these users interact with this content.
The legal basis for data processing is provided by Art.â¯6â¯para.â¯1â¯pointâ¯aâ¯GDPR.

Where erasure of your personal data is prohibited by statutory retention obligations, your data will be marked with the aim of restricting its future processing.

Data Portability

Where applicable, you also have the right to have your personal data transmitted to you or to another Data Controller in a structured, standardised and machine-readable format, as long as processing is performed on the basis of consent or contract using automated procedures.
This does not apply, however, where the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.
You also have the right to have the personal data transmitted directly from one Data Controller to another, provided that it is technically feasible to do so and does not infringe upon the rights and freedoms of other persons.

You can withdraw your previously-given consent at any time with future effect by contacting the aforementioned address.
Moreover, you have the right to object to the processing of your personal data at any time (where such processing is based on a legitimate interest) for reasons arising from your particular circumstances.
This also applies to profiling activities based on these provisions.
If such an objection is received, we will cease to process the personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override the interests, rights and freedoms of the Data Subject, of if the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
If we are processing personal data for the purpose of direct marketing, you have the right to object to the processing of your personal data at any time for the purpose of such marketing by contacting the aforementioned address.
This also applies to profiling insofar as it is connected with such direct marketing.
You also have the right to file an objection for reasons arising from your particular circumstances against processing of your personal data that we are engaged in for scientific, historical research or statistical purposes, unless such processing is required to perform a task that is in the public interest.

Right of Complaint

You also have the right to submit a complaint to the competent supervisory authority and to seek legal remedies.
The supervisory authority with whom the complaint was lodged will notify the complainant about the status and result of their complaint, including the option of seeking a judicial remedy.
