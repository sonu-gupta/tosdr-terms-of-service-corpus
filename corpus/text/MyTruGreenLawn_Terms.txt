Any arbitration hearing at which the parties appear personally will take place at a location within the United States federal judicial district in which the subject property is located.
AAA Rules and forms may be obtained and all claims shall be filed at any AAA office, www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
The demand for arbitration shall be made within a reasonable time after the dispute has arisen, but in no event shall it be made more than one year from when the aggrieved party knew or should have known of the controversy, claim or facts forming the basis of the dispute.&nbsp.
Each party shall be responsible for paying its own attorneysâ fees, costs and expenses, the arbitration fees and arbitrator compensation shall be payable as provided in the AAA Consumer Rules.&nbsp.
However, for a Claim of $15,000 or less brought by you in&nbsp.
your capacity, if you so request in writing, TruGreen will pay your&nbsp.
arbitration fees and arbitrator compensation due to the AAA for such Claim to the extent they exceed any filing fees that you&nbsp.
would pay to a court with jurisdiction over the Claim.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, the arbitrator shall not have the power to award special, consequential or indirect damages against any party.
The arbitratorâs power to conduct any arbitration proceeding under this arbitration agreement shall be limited as follows: any arbitration proceeding under this agreement will not be consolidated or joined with any arbitration proceeding under any other agreement, or involving any other property or premises, and will not proceed as a consolidated, class action, multi-claimant or private attorney general action.
The foregoing prohibition on consolidated, class action, multi-claimant and private attorney general arbitrations is an essential and integral part of this arbitration clause and is not severable from the remainder of the clause.
The decision of the arbitrator shall be a final and binding resolution of the Claim.
This arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.
9 U.S.C Sections 1-16.
Judgment upon the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
Neither party shall dispute the enforcement of this arbitration agreement of the arbitratorâs award.
If either party unsuccessfully disputes the enforcement of this agreement or the arbitratorâs award, then that party shall pay the attorneyâs fees and costs of the adverse party.&nbsp.
THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT THEY WOULD HAVE HAD A RIGHT OR OPPORTUNITY TO LITIGATE DISPUTES THROUGH A COURT AND TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE THEIR CASE, BUT THEY CHOOSE TO HAVE ANY DISPUTES DECIDED THROUGH ARBITRATION.&nbsp.
THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THIS PROVISION IS INTENDED TO AND SHALL SURVIVE TERMINATION OF THIS OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES.
