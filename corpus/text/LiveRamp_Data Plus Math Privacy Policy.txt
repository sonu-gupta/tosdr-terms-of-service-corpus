DATA PLUS MATH PRIVACY POLICY FOR VISITORS INTERACTING WITH THE PLATFORM
Last revised and effective as of: November 19, 2018
Data Plus Math Corporation (âData Plus Mathâ âweâ or âusâ or âourâ) operates a TV/video attribution platform (the âPlatformâ) that helps our customers (âCustomersâ) measure the effectiveness of their TV/video campaigns.&nbsp.
In providing the Platform to our Customers, we may collect information from visitors to our Customersâ websites and applications and recipients of our Customersâ advertisements.
When you visit a website or application, or view an advertisement, of one of our Customers through which we are collecting information, you are interacting with our Platform.&nbsp.
This Privacy Policy relates to information collected online by Data Plus Math Corporation (âData Plus Mathâ âweâ or âusâ or âourâ) from visitors to our Customersâ websites and mobile applications and recipients of our Customersâ advertisements (each a âVisitorâ or âyouâ) in order to provide the Platform to our Customers.
Data Plus Math also has a Website Privacy Policy that applies to information collected on the Data Plus Math website at www.dataplusmath.com and any subdomains.
As used in this Privacy Policy, the terms âusingâ and âprocessingâ information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our affiliates within the United States or internationally.
This Privacy Policy serves to notify you of the following:

What information about me is collected?
Where and when is information collected (including through the use of cookies and action tags)?
Does Data Plus Math collect information from children under 13 years of age?
What does Data Plus Math do with the information it collects?
How long does Data Plus Math retain the information it collects?
When does Data Plus Math disclose information to third parties?
Does this Privacy Policy apply when I link to other websites or services?
Is the information collected through the Platform secure?
Could my information be transferred to other countries?
What choices do I have regarding the collection, disclosure and distribution of&nbsp.
information?
How will I know if there are any changes to this Privacy Policy?
Who do I contact if I have any privacy questions?

What information about me is collected?
With respect to Visitors interacting with the Platform, we collect device-identifiable information only.
We also may receive device-identifiable and/or pseudonymous information about you from third parties.
Nevertheless, it is helpful to describe the differences between personally-identifiable information on the one hand and device-identifiable information on the other.

Personally-Identifiable Information

Personally identifiable information (PII) is information that identifies an individual or can be used to identify or contact an individual.
Such information may include a name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, financial account number, billing information, and government-issued identifier.

Device-Identifiable Information

Device-Identifiable Information (DII) is any data that is linked to a particular browser or device if that data is not used, or intended to be used, to identify a particular individual.
DII may include, but is not limited to, unique identifiers associated with browsers or devices, such as cookie identifiers or advertising identifiers, and IP addresses, where such data is not linked or intended to be linked to Personally-Identifiable Information (PII).
DII includes data that is linked to a series of browsers or devices linked through Cross-Device Linking (the practice of linking two or more devices or browsers used or likely used by the same user), if that data is not used, or intended to be used, to identify a particular individual.
Where and when is information collected (including through the use of cookies and action tags)?
We may receive Device-Identifiable Information about you through use of cookies, action tags and log files as part of your interaction with the Platform, provided that such interaction originates from an identifiable geography within the United States of America or one of its territories.

Cookies and action tags

Through the Platform, we may collect Device-Identifiable Information passively using âcookiesâ and âaction tags,â including when you interact with our Platform (such as by visiting the website or application, or viewing an advertisement, of one of our Customers).
âCookiesâ are small text files that can be placed on your computer or mobile device in order to identify your Web browser and the activities of your computer as it interacts with the Platform and other websites.
âAction tags,â also known as web beacons, pixel gifs or gif tags, are a web technology used to help track website usage information, such as how many times a specific page has been viewed.
Action tags are invisible to you.
When you disable cookies, action tags still detect a unique website visit.
By using cookies and action tags together, we are able to provide the Platform and other services to our Customers.

Advertising device identifiers

Through the Platform, we may collect Device-Identifiable Information passively using âadvertising device identifiers,â including when you interact with our Platform (such as by visiting the application, or viewing an advertisement, of one of our Customers on a device application).
âAdvertising device identifiersâ are unique identifiers generated by your device operating system for the purpose of providing a consistent device identifier for advertising purposes, also known as âIdentifiers For Advertising (IDFA),â âGoogle AdID,â or other such similar names.

Collection of information through your interaction with the Platform on other websites

In providing services (including our Platform) to our Customers, we use cookies, action tags (including pixels), and scripts to collect information about Visitors to the websites and&nbsp.
applications of our Customers and Visitors who receive our Customersâ advertisements.
The information we collect includes browser type, operating system, Internet provider, IP Address, domain name, pages visited on Customer websites or applications, actions take on Customer websites or applications or in response to Customer advertisements, and date and time of visits to Customer websites or applications or viewing of Customer advertisements.
Additionally, we combine the information we collect with other information we receive from third parties about Visitors to our Customersâ websites and applications and Visitors who receive our Customersâ advertisements, including by synchronizing behavioral information with the behavioral information of third parties via server to server cookie synchronizing technologies.
We also may use cross-device and cross-app technologies to establish deterministic or statistical connections among related devices such as smartphones, tablets, computers, SmartTVs, etc.
For the avoidance of doubt, our cookies, action tags (including pixels), and scripts operate on third-party websites, applications, and advertisements.
This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by us on the websites, applications, or advertisements of our Customers through the Platform.&nbsp.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected about you from third parties or third-party websites.
In addition, the placement of our cookies, actions tags (including pixels) on the websites, applications, or advertisements of our Customers does not imply that Data Plus Math endorses or has reviewed the websites, applications, or advertisements of our Customers.&nbsp.
We suggest contacting those websites, applications, services, entities or persons directly for information on their privacy policies.

Log Files

We also collect Device-Identifiable Information through our Internet log files, which record data such as user IP addresses, browser types, domain names, and other anonymous statistical data involving interaction with the Platform.
This information may be used to analyze trends, to administer the Platform, to monitor interactions with the Platform, and to gather general demographic information.
Does Data Plus Math collect information from children under 13 years of age?
We are committed to protecting the privacy of children.
The Platform is not designed for or directed to children under the age of 13.
We do not collect personally identifiable information from any person we actually know is under the age of 13.
What does Data Plus Math do with the information it collects?
In general, we use the information collected to provide the Platform and other services to our Customers, to help us understand who interacts with the Platform and for internal operations such as operating and improving the Platform.&nbsp.
We may also use the information gathered to perform statistical analysis of Visitor behavior in providing the Platform or to evaluate and improve the Platform.
As indicated above, we may also combine your information with other information we receive about you from third parties.
How long does Data Plus Math retain the information it collects?
In general, we retain the information collected for a period of three (3) years, before it is aggregated for reporting purposes.
Specific Customer or Third-Party requirements, or applicable law, may reduce or extend this retention period.
When does Data Plus Math disclose information to third parties?
We generally disclose information we gather from you through the Platform to the following types of third parties and as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy or as specifically authorized by you.

Customers

We may share your information that we collect on a Customerâs website, application, or advertisement with the applicable Customer, and such Customerâs service providers, vendors, consultants, and other partners, as requested by such Customer.&nbsp.
In addition, we may share information that we collect about Visitors through the Platform with our Customers.
As noted above, we may combine your information with other information we receive about you from third parties.

Laws and legal rights

We may disclose your information if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in order to comply with an applicable statute, regulation, rule or law, a subpoena, a search warrant, a court or regulatory order, or other valid legal process.
We may disclose information in special circumstances when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating any contractual terms with Data Plus Math, to detect fraud, for assistance with a delinquent account, or to protect our rights or property or the safety or security of our users, the Platform or the general public.

Third parties generally

We may provide to third parties information, including where such information is combined with similar information of others who use or interact with the Platform.
For example, we might inform third parties regarding the number of unique users interact with the Platform or the demographic breakdown of those who interact with the Platform.&nbsp.
The third parties to which we may provide information may include providers of products or services (including analytics service providers, vendors, consultants and website tracking services), Customers and partners, vendors, or consultants of Customers (as described above), or partners, merchants, affiliates and other actual or potential commercial partners, sponsors, licensees, researchers and other similar parties.

Outside contractors

We may employ independent contractors, vendors and suppliers (collectively, âOutside Contractorsâ) to provide specific services and products related to the Platform, such as hosting and maintaining the Platform, providing fraud screening, and developing applications for the Platform.
In the course of providing products or services to us, these Outside Contractors may have access to information collected through the Platform.
We use reasonable efforts to ensure that these Outside Contractors are capable of protecting the privacy of your information.

Sale of Business

We reserve the right to transfer information to a third party in the event of a sale, merger or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of Data Plus Math&nbsp.
or any of its Corporate Affiliates (as defined below), or that portion of Data Plus Math or any of its Corporate Affiliates to which the Platform relates, or in the event that we discontinue our business or file a petition or have filed against us a petition in bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, provided that the third party agrees to adhere to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

Affiliates

We may disclose information about you to our Corporate Affiliates.&nbsp.
For purposes of this Privacy Policy: âCorporate Affiliateâ means any person or entity which directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with Data Plus Math, whether by ownership or otherwise.
and âcontrolâ means possessing, directly or indirectly, the power to direct or cause the direction of the management, policies or operations of an entity, whether through ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the voting securities, by contract or otherwise.
Any information relating to you that we provide to our Corporate Affiliates will be treated by those Corporate Affiliates in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.
Does this privacy policy apply when I link to other websites or services?
Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of any websites or services other than the Platform.
We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of each and every such website and service.
This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by us through the Platform.
The implementation of the Platform on the websites, applications, or advertisements of our Customers does not imply that Data Plus Math endorses or has reviewed the websites, applications, or advertisements of our Customers.
We suggest contacting those sites, services, entities or persons directly for information on their privacy policies.
Is the information collected through the platform secure?
We want your information to remain secure.
We strive to provide transmission of your information from your computer or mobile device to our servers through techniques that are consistent with industry standards and to employ administrative, physical, and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access.
Notwithstanding the above, you should be aware that there is always some risk involved in transmitting information over the Internet.
There is also some risk that others could find a way to thwart our security systems.
As a result, while we strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security or privacy of any information you transmit to us by interacting with the Platform.
Could my information be transferred to other countries?
Information collected through the Platform may be transferred from time to time to our offices or personnel, or to third parties, located throughout the world, and the Platform may be viewed and hosted anywhere in the world, including countries that may not have laws of general applicability regulating the use and transfer of such data.
By interacting with the Platform, you voluntarily consent to the trans-border transfer and hosting of such information.
If you are a Visitor interacting with the Platform from a jurisdiction with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure that differ from those of the United States, please be advised that all aspects of the Platform are governed by the internal laws of the United States and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, USA, regardless of your location.
What choices do I have regarding the collection, disclosure and distribution of information?

Internet enabled devices

We generally use Device-Identifiable Information as described in this Privacy Policy or as authorized by you or as otherwise disclosed at the time we request such information from you.
Visitors may also âopt outâ of our collection and use of their Device-Identifiable Information as described in this Privacy Policy by following this opt-out link (each, a âRequesting Visitorâ).
Please note that in order to implement a Requesting Visitorâs opt-out request, we place a cookie on the Requesting Visitorâs computer or mobile device indicating that such Requesting Visitor has opted out.
Requesting Visitors consent to the placement of such cookie in their computer or mobile device by requesting to opt out.
Because the implementation of the opt out is contingent on the presence of the cookie described in this section:

 the opt out will only be effective on the computer or mobile devices on which the Requesting Visitor has made his or her request and will not be effective across devices unless such Requesting Visitor makes a corresponding request on each such device.
and
 clearing or deleting the cache of cookies on your computer or mobile device will have the effect of canceling the opt out and subject a Requesting Visitor to our collection and use their Device-Identifiable Information as described in this Privacy Policy unless and until they request to opt out again.


Mobile devices

In addition to the above, mobile devices can provide Device-Identifiable Information distinct from cookie-based identifiers and may require additional steps to control what information is shared with the Platform beyond the above âopt outâ instructions.
For more information on how to manage Device-Identifiable Information on mobile devices, please visit this Mobile Choice link.

Self-regulatory internet based advertising groups

Various self-regulatory industry groups exist to provide you with the means of convenient control of your information shared with its members.
Memberships
Data Plus Math, a LiveRamp company, adheres to all membership compliance requirements as described in the LiveRamp Service Privacy Policy.
Do not track
The term âDo Not Trackâ refers to a HTTP header offered by certain web browsers to request that websites refrain from tracking the user.
We take no action in response to Do Not Track requests.
How will I know if there are any changes to this privacy policy?
We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time.&nbsp.
We encourage you to check this page periodically for any changes.
If any changes to this Privacy Policy are unacceptable to you, you must immediately contact us and, until the issue is resolved, opt out of interacting with the Platform, as described above.
Your continued interaction with the Platform following the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of those changes.
Who do I contact if I have any privacy questions?
If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy or feel that we are not abiding by the terms of this Privacy Policy, please contact our Privacy Agent in any of the following ways:

DATA PLUS MATH WEBSITE PRIVACY POLICY
Last revised and effective as of: January 22, 2018

As used in this Privacy Policy, the terms âusingâ and âprocessingâ information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our affiliates within the United States or internationally.
This Privacy Policy serves to notify you of the following:

What information about me is collected?
Where and when is information collected (including through the use of cookies and action tags)?
Does Data Plus Math collect information from children under 13 years of age?
What does Data Plus Math do with the information it collects?
When does Data Plus Math disclose information to third parties?

What choices do I have regarding the collection, disclosure and distribution of personally identifiable information?

How will I know if there are any changes to this Privacy Policy?
Who do I contact if I have any privacy questions?

What information about me is collected?
Depending on your use of the Site, we may collect two types of information: personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information.

Personally Identifiable Information

Personally identifiable information is information that identifies you or can be used to identify or contact you.
Such information may include your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, and billing and credit card information.

Non-Personally Identifiable Information

Non-personally identifiable information is information, any single item of which, by itself, cannot be used to identify or contact you, including demographic information (such as age, profession, gender, current location, zip code, birth date, or year of birth), IP addresses, browser types, unique device identifiers, device types, requested URL, referring URL, browser language, the pages you view, the date and time of your visit, domain names, and statistical data involving the use of the Site.
Certain non-personally identifiable information may be considered a part of your personally identifiable information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified.
However, the same pieces of information are considered non-personally identifiable information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-personally identifiable information (for example, your viewing preferences).
Where and when is information collected (including through the use of cookies and action tags)?
We will collect personally identifiable information that you submit to us.
We may also receive personally identifiable information about you from third parties providing credit and debit card authorization and fraud screening services as part of your use of the Site.

Registering to Use the Site and in the Course of Using the Site.

You may be required to establish an account in order to take advantage of certain features of the Site.
If so, if you wish to establish an account you will be required to provide us with information (including personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information) such as name, postal address, e-mail address, birth date and credit card and billing information.
We may also receive personally identifiable information about you from third parties providing credit and debit card authorization and fraud screening services as part of the registration process.
In addition, we may obtain your personally identifiable information from you if you identify yourself to us by sending us an e-mail with questions or comments.
Also, we will have access to any personally identifiable information that you choose to share through the Site.

Cookies and Action Tags.

We may collect non-personally identifiable information passively using âcookiesâ and âaction tags.â
âCookiesâ are small text files that can be placed on your computer or mobile device in order to identify your Web browser and the activities of your computer on the Site and other websites.
Cookies can be used to personalize your experience on the Site (such as dynamically generating content on webpages specifically designed for you), to assist you in using the Site (such as saving time by not having to reenter your name each time you use the Site), to allow us to statistically monitor how you are using the Site to help us improve our offerings, and to determine the popularity of certain content.
You do not have to accept cookies to use the Site.
Although most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, you may reset your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or to reject cookies generally.
Most browsers offer instructions on how to do so in the âHelpâ section of the toolbar.
However, if you reject cookies, certain features or resources of the Site may not work properly or at all and you may experience some loss of convenience.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Site uses third-party service platforms (including to help analyze how users use the Site).&nbsp.
These third-party service platforms may place cookies on your computer or mobile device.
If you would like to disable âthird partyâ cookies, you may be able to turn them off by going to the third partyâs website.
Here is a link to the main third-party platform we use: https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/
âAction tags,â also known as web beacons or gif tags, are a web technology used to help track website usage information, such as how many times a specific page has been viewed.
Action tags are invisible to you, and any portion of the Site, including advertisements, or e-mail sent on our behalf, may contain action tags.
By using cookies and action tags together, we are able to gain valuable information to improve the Site and measure the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns.
Finally, you should be aware that third parties may use their own cookies or action tags when you click on a link to their websites or services on or from the Site.
This Privacy Policy does not govern the use of cookies or action tags or the use of your information by such third-party websites or services.

Log Files.

We also collect non-personally identifiable information through our Internet log files, which record data such as user IP addresses, browser types, domain names, and other anonymous statistical data involving the use of the Site.
This information may be used to analyze trends, to administer the Site, to monitor the use of the Site, and to gather general demographic information.
We may link this information to personally identifiable information for these and other purposes such as personalizing your experience on the Site and evaluating the Site in general.
Does Data Plus Math collect information from children under 13 years of age?
We are committed to protecting the privacy of children.
The Site is not designed for or directed to children under the age of 13.
We do not collect personally identifiable information from any person we actually know is under the age of 13.
What does Data Plus Math do with the information it collects?
In general, we use the information collected to provide the Site to you and process your transactions, to help us understand who uses the Site, for internal operations such as operating and improving the Site, to contact you for customer service and billing purposes, and, if you âopt inâ, so that we and third parties can contact you about products and services that may be of interest to you.
We may use your information to send you a welcoming e-mail that may confirm your user name and password.
If you opt in, we and third parties may send you electronic newsletters, contact you about the Site, products, services, information and news that may be of interest to you, and provide you with targeted feedback.
If you no longer desire to receive these communications, we will provide you with the option to change your preferences.
If you identify yourself to us by sending us an e-mail with questions or comments, we may use your information (including personally identifiable information) to respond to your questions or comments, and we may file your questions or comments (with your information) for future reference.
We may also use the information collected to send announcements and updates regarding the Site or, if applicable, about your billing account status.
You will not be able to unsubscribe from these Site announcements and updates as they contain important information relevant to your use of the Site.
We may also use the information gathered to perform statistical analysis of user behavior or to evaluate and improve the Site.
We may link some of this information to personally identifiable information for internal purposes or to improve your experience with the Site.
When does Data Plus Math disclose information to third parties?
Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy or as specifically authorized by you, we will not disclose any information we gather from you through the Site.

Laws and Legal Rights.

We may disclose your information (including personally identifiable information) if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in order to comply with an applicable statute, regulation, rule or law, a subpoena, a search warrant, a court or regulatory order, or other valid legal process.
We may disclose personally identifiable information in special circumstances when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating any agreement with Data Plus Math, to detect fraud, for assistance with a delinquent account, or to protect the safety and/or security of our users, the Site or the general public.

Third Parties Generally.

We may provide to third parties non-personally identifiable information, including where such information is combined with similar information of other users of the Site.
For example, we might inform third parties regarding the number of unique users who use the Site, the demographic breakdown of our users of the Site, or the products and/or services purchased using the Site and the vendors of such products and services.
If you opt in, we may also provide to third parties personally identifiable information.
For example, we might share our usersâ responses to questionnaires and e-mail addresses with third parties in order for third parties to contact users about products and services that may be of interest.&nbsp.
In addition to the above, when users use our Site, third parties (including without limitation third-party analytics providers and commercial partners) may directly collect personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information about our usersâ online activities over time and across different websites.
The third parties to which we may provide or who may independently directly collect personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information may include providers of products or services (including analytics service providers, vendors, consultants and website tracking services), customers, customer partners and vendors or consultants of customers or customer partners, merchants, affiliates and other actual or potential commercial partners, sponsors, licensees, researchers and other similar parties.
Please note in particular that the Site uses Google Analytics, including its data reporting features.&nbsp.
Information collected by Google Analytics includes but is not limited to web metrics.
For information on how Google Analytics collects and processes data, please see the site âHow Google uses data when you use our partnersâ sites or appsâ, currently located at www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.

Outside Contractors.

We may employ independent contractors, vendors and suppliers (collectively, âOutside Contractorsâ) to provide specific services and products related to the Site, such as hosting and maintaining the Site, providing credit card processing and fraud screening, and developing applications for the Site.
In the course of providing products or services to us, these Outside Contractors may have access to information collected through the Site, including your personally identifiable information.

By using the Site and submitting such information on it, you voluntarily consent to the trans-border transfer and hosting of such information.
If you are a user accessing the Site from a jurisdiction with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure that differ from those of the United States, please be advised that all aspects of the Site are governed by the internal laws of the United States and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, USA, regardless of your location.
What choices do I have regarding the collection, disclosure and distribution of personally identifiable information?
Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, we will only use personally identifiable information for the purposes described above or as otherwise disclosed at the time we request such information from you.
You must âopt inâ and give us permission to use your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.
You may also change your preference and âopt outâ of receiving certain marketing communications from us by following the directions provided in association with the communication or such other directions we may provide or by contacting privacy@dataplusmath.com.
Do not track
The term âDo Not Trackâ refers to a HTTP header offered by certain web browsers to request that websites refrain from tracking the user.
We take no action in response to Do Not Track requests.
Can I update or correct my personally identifiable information?
You have the right to request the restriction of certain uses and disclosures of personally identifiable information as follows.
You can contact us in order to (1) update or correct your personally identifiable information, (2) change your preferences with respect to communications and other information you receive from us, or (3) delete the personally identifiable information maintained about you on our systems (subject to the following paragraph), by contacting privacy@dataplusmath.com or following other directions we may provide.
Such updates, corrections, changes and deletions will have no effect on other information that we maintain, or information that we have provided to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such update, correction, change or deletion.
To protect your privacy and security, we may take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you profile access or making corrections.
You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.
You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to us from our system.
The need to back up our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your personally identifiable information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate.
After receiving your request, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to update, correct, change, or delete, as appropriate, all personally identifiable information stored in databases we actively use and other readily searchable media as appropriate, as soon as and to the extent reasonably practicable.
How will I know if there are any changes to this privacy policy?
We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time.&nbsp.
We will not make changes that result in significant additional uses or disclosures of your personally identifiable information without allowing you to âopt inâ to such changes.
We may also make non-significant changes to this Privacy Policy that generally will not significantly affect our use of your personally identifiable information, for which your opt-in is not required.
We encourage you to check this page periodically for any changes.
If any non-significant changes to this Privacy Policy are unacceptable to you, you must immediately contact us and, until the issue is resolved, stop using the Site.
Your continued use of the Site following the posting of non-significant changes to this Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of those changes.
Who do I contact if I have any privacy questions?
