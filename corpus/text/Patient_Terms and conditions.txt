We want the forums to be a useful resource for our users but it is important to remember that the forums are not moderated or reviewed by doctors and so you should not rely on opinions or advice given by other users in respect of any healthcare matters.
Always speak to your doctor before acting and in cases of emergency seek appropriate medical assistance immediately.
From time to time, topics may be discussed on the Discussion Forums on which there is potential for users to have very strongly held opinions that may seem controversial or which differ significantly from those of other users.
You acknowledge that we may remove posts and/or close threads where we consider that they have gone âoff-topicâ, become unconstructive, are contentious as between users and/or are not within the spirit of the Discussion Forums: this may include contributions which are not in breach of these Terms of Use.
