If you no longer wish for Bain to process your data or if you wish to exercise your rights, please contact Alumni.Relations@Bain.com.

 Definitions Definitions 
1. The data controller is the person or company that, together or jointly with others, determines the purposes (why) and means (how) of the processing of personal data.

2. Personal data is any information that relates to an individual who is identified or identifiable, for instance by reference to a name, an identification number or an online identifier.

3. Standard Contractual Clauses are an agreement that can be entered into by companies for transfers of personal data outside of the European Union.
They are a mechanism approved by the European Commission to ensure adequate safeguards to personal data when it is transferred outside of the European Union.

4. 
Anonymizing means transforming data in such a way that it is no longer identifiable, i.e.
the data can no longer be linked to an individual, even if combined with other information. Anonymous data is not considered "personal data".

5. Pseudonymizing means transforming data in such a way that it is no longer identifiable without the use of additional information. Pseudonymous data is still considered "personal data". Ready to talk? I want to talk to your experts in: Select an industry
