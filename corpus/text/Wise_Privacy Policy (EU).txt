Where we store your personal data


6.1 The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA").
It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers.
Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your payment order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services.
By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing.
We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.


7.
Sharing your data outside of the EEA


7.1 In order to provide our Services to you, it is sometimes necessary for us to transfer your data to the third parties outlined in section 5.1 that are based in countries located outside of the European Economic Area which are not subject to an adequacy decision by the European Commission.
In these cases, we ensure that both ourselves and our partners take adequate and appropriate technical, physical and organisational security measures to protect your data.
We also ensure a level of data protection at least equivalent to the one prevailing in the European Union by having appropriate contractual protections in place with these third parties.


8.
Profiling and Automated Decision Making


8.1 We may use some instances of your data in order to customise our Services and the information we provide to you, and to address your needs - such as your country of address and transaction history.
For example, if you frequently send funds from one particular currency to another, we may use this information to inform you of new product updates or features that may be useful for you.
When we do this, we take all necessary measures to ensure that your privacy and security are protected - and we only use pseudonymised data where ever possible.
This activity has no legal effect on you.

8.2 As part of being a highly technical and innovative company, we may use Automated Decision Making (ADM) in order to improve your experience, or to help fight financial crime.
For example, so that we can provide you with a fast and efficient service, we may use ADM to verify your identity documents, or to confirm the accuracy of the information you have provided to us.
We can perform a manual double check on your demand.
