 If you provide User Content, such as an email to our customer service or response to a restaurant survey, we may use your comments and feedback to tell others about our services, and may post your comment in our marketing materials or on our Website.
In connection with such User Content and our Rewards Program, we may also display partial information such as first name, initial of last name, city and state.
Such partial information is not considered Personally Identifiable Information.
