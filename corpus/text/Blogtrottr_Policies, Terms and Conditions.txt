Personal information we collect, and how it's used
Profile information
You may provide us with profile information such as your e-mail address, name, and password when you sign up for a subscription, create an account, or when you edit your account information.
We use your email address to provide you with updates to your subscribed feeds, and we may also use it to provide you with technical support or billing notifications.
We do not store your password directly, instead we store a non-reversible cryptographic hash using an industry standard hashing mechanism.
We retain your profile information until you delete your account. Site visitation and tracking
 Like many websites, this site uses Google Analytics (GA) to track user interaction.
We use this data to determine the number of people using our site, to better understand how they find and use our web pages and to see their journey through the website.
Although GA records data such as your geographical location, device, internet browser and operating system, none of this information personally identifies you to us.
We configure our tracking codes to anonymise any IP addresses.
 Payment details
 We do not store your payment details ourselves, instead we partner with ChargeBee, a Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) level 1 certified payment services provider.
 Advertising
Our Free plan is supported by adverts placed in the update emails you receive.
We try and keep these adverts
appropriate to your language, country, and interests.
We partner with LiveIntent to provide this advertising, and you can read their privacy policy here: https://liveintent.com/services-privacy-policy
In order for LiveIntent to provide you with relevant advertising, we share a hashed representation of your email address with them. Support by e-mail
If you contact us by email, you will be sharing your contact details (e-mail address and name) with us for the purposes of responding to your query.
This is necessary to provide our service to you.
We retain all support tickets for the purposes of auditing and training of staff. Backups
We maintain data backups for use in disaster recovery.
These backups are encrypted and stored securely for 1 year. Our servers
We operate using both cloud and physical servers located in the UK, Ireland, and Germany.
Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems and are required to keep the information confidential.

All sales for services are final: Blogtrottr Ltd does not offer refunds at this time, but under certain circumstances
we may offer pro-rated credit for services purchased. EU VAT
In order to comply with the EU's 2015 rules on the supply of electronic services, Blogtrottr is obliged to charge VAT on invoices to EU consumers, in accordance with the local VAT rate of the member state where the customer belongs.
EU businesses who supply a VAT number will be charged no VAT, as it will be for them to account for the tax under the EU VAT reverse charge mechanism.
Blogtrottr currently trades below the UK VAT threshold, and thus no VAT will be added for UK customers. About us
