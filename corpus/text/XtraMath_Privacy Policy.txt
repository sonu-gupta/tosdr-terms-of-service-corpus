What Data We CollectXtraMath collects the minimum amount of data required to operate our program.
Below we summarize the data we collect on students, teachers, and parents.
For an up-to-date list that shows what user data we collect, and how we use that data, see Appendix B,
Record of Data Processing.Definitions



Data includes all information connected with a personâs or educational entityâs use of XtraMath.
This includes, but is not limited to, Personal Data, metadata, usage and performance data.

Personal Data includes any data that can directly or indirectly identify an individual person.
For example: an email address is always considered Personal Data.
a studentâs grade level generally is not, but could be in conjunction with other information.

School includes: individual schools.
teachers acting on behalf of schools.
school districts.
and other local educational entities.


Student DataWe collect a studentâs first name, grade level, and program settings from the studentâs parent or teacher.
As the student uses XtraMath, we collect usage and performance data, such as when they signed in, how many questions they answered correctly, and how long it took them to answer questions.
If a student signs in via a single sign-on provider, such as Google, we collect an identifier from the provider that allows us to authenticate their sign-in.
We do not collect the student email address that may be used for such a sign-in.
Other personal information about the student could be inferred from data that we collect.
If a student account belongs to a class, for example, then we could infer that they attend a certain school.Parent DataWe collect a parentâs name and email address when they sign up for an account.
If they sign up using a single sign-on provider, we also collect an identifier that allows us to authenticate their sign-in.
We also collect some metadata and account settings, such as their time zone, the language they used to sign up, and their email preferences.
A parent supplies a password when they create an account.
The password is hashed (scrambled) on the userâs computer before it is ever sent to XtraMath.
We do not have access to a userâs original password, and cannot obtain it from the hashed version that we receive.
Other personal information about the parent could be inferred from data that we collect.
For example, we could infer that a parent whose account is linked to a student account is the parent or guardian of that student.Teacher DataWe collect the same data for teacher accounts as parent accounts, with a few additions.
For example, we collect the name by which students address the teacher, such as âMs.
Smith.â We also collect information about each class that the teacher creates, such as its name and its end date.
Other personal information about the teacher could be inferred from data we collect.
For example, we could infer that the teacher works at a specific school based on their email address.How We Use and Share DataXtraMath processes user data in order to establish and maintain accounts, to provide educational activities to students, to compile and deliver reports about those activities to teachers and parents, and to understand and improve our programâs effectiveness.
For an up-to-date list that shows the specific types of user data we collect, and how we use that data, see Appendix B,
Record of Data Processing.Student DataA studentâs Personal Data is used internally to provide the student with appropriate educational activities, and to report their performance to their parents and teachers.
We may access student Personal Data when providing customer support or investigating a reported issue with our program.Parent and Teacher DataA parentâs or teacherâs Personal Data is used internally for sign-in purposes and, with permission, to send them reports, announcements, and alerts related to XtraMath.
We may access a parentâs or teacherâs Personal Data when providing them with requested support.Sharing Personal Data with Third PartiesWe release Personal Data to third parties only in the following circumstances:


When the user requests the disclosure, such as a teacher sharing their class with another teacher.

When the third party is a trusted service provider, and the data is required to adequately perform the service.
We carefully vet our service providers and their security practices.
For details, see Appendix A,
List of Third Party Providers.

When required by law or a court order.


In the event of a joint venture, sale or merger with a third party.
The third party would be required to uphold our Terms, including our Privacy Policy for all existing accounts.
We would provide advance notice before sharing data with that third party.



XtraMath never releases Personal Data for any kind of third-party advertising.Use of De-identified DataWe may use de-identified usage data internally to analyze and improve our educational services, and to develop new products or features.
We will never attempt to re-identify data that has been de-identified.
We may release de-identified data to educational researchers for the purpose of evaluating the effectiveness of our program.
We will not release de-identified data unless we are confident it cannot be re-identified, due to the removal of all direct and indirect personal identifiers, and the educational researchers have agreed in writing that they will not attempt to re-identify any individuals, classes, or Schools.
We may use aggregate de-identified data, such as the number of users of our service, for promotional purposes.How We Securely Store DataXtraMath takes security seriously.
We implement a variety of industry-standard security measures to prevent any unauthorized access to our usersâ data.
Such measures include, but are not limited to: data minimization.
encrypting data in transit via HTTPS.
hashing sensitive data, like passwords.
deletion of outdated data.
locked physical facilities.
employee training.
and administrator account security.Data Storage and International TransferXtraMath stores and processes all data on servers in the United States.
All servers that store XtraMath data are operated by trusted third party processors with whom we have contractual Data Processing Addendums.
Our providers are certified under the
EU-US Privacy Shield and Swiss-US Privacy Shield, to better protect the data of our international users.
For details, see Appendix A,
List of Third Party Providers.Data Breach ResponseWhile we use industry-standard practices to safeguard data, no service can guarantee absolute data security.
We have a Breach Response Plan, which we will follow if we ever discover that Personal Data has been accessed improperly.
As part of our response, we will: take action to stop further data loss or unauthorized access.
investigate how the breach occurred.
promptly contact all affected users via email.
and contact law enforcement and government agencies when appropriate.Data Retention and DeletionXtraMath retains Personal Data only for as long as necessary to ensure continuity of math skill-building for students, and for the convenience of parents and teachers.
We close user accounts, and delete all associated identifiable data, upon request.
Most types of data are also deleted automatically after a certain amount of time has passed.
For details, see Appendix B,
Record of Data Processing.
We may retain de-identified, aggregate data, which cannot identify any individual user, for research and program improvement purposes.
Such data is deleted once no longer necessary for these purposes.
We will provide certification of data deletion upon request.Compliance with Data Privacy LawsXtraMath intends to comply with the data privacy and data protection laws of all jurisdictions where it operates.
See the XtraMath and Student Data Privacy whitepaper for the latest information on compliance.
Some specific examples of legislation that we comply with are described below.United States
Childrenâs Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA):
As a non-profit organization, XtraMath is not subject to
COPPA.
Nevertheless, we fully comply with the law as if we were subject to it.
Children under the age of 13 may not create accounts.
We only collect usage and performance data from students as a result of their performing educational activities, and we only use that data for educational purposes.
If we gain actual knowledge that a child is using XtraMath without the appropriate consent, we terminate the account.

Family Education Rights Protection Act (FERPA):
Schools in the United States may provide student data to XtraMath while complying with
FERPA.
When a School provides us with a studentâs Personal Data (or PII â Personally Identifiable Information) under the FERPA school official exemption, they remain in control of that data.
XtraMath will only use and disclose that data as specified in our Terms and as allowed by law.International
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):
XtraMath affirms and respects all data subject's rights under
GDPR.
We minimize the data we collect and process, and use data only as described in this policy.
For detailed information about what data we process, for what purpose, for how long, and our basis for doing so under the GDPR, see Appendix B,
Record of Data Processing.
