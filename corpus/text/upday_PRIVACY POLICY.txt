The functions of our application.
Scope of these terms of use
With upday we offer an application which aggregates news contents from the internet for you in several ways (hereinafter the âAppâ).
The goal of our App is to aggregate those articles for you, which best correspond to your interests content-wise:
The selection of the content to be aggregated is mainly based on topic preferences actively set by you as well as, in this context, on your use of the App.
If, for example, you are interested in the topic of âsportsâ, you will be able to select this topic in order to later receive articles regarding this topic in aggregated form.
If specific, content-related centres of interest can be derived from your use of the App in the course of time, for example, if you particularly read a great deal of articles regarding the topic âscienceâ, the App will automatically aggregate an increased number of articles for you regarding this topic.
Aside from the determined or derived preferences described above, the App also offers you an aggregation of news content which is of general relevance (current events or the like).
Furthermore, we will aggregate specific articles for you, which we ourselves have selected.
All aggregated articles will be presented with a headline, a short summary as well as with a possible selection of images.
If you click on one of these representations the article will be shown to you in full and in unchanged form in the app, however, this article will be delivered directly from the source website.
For this purpose the App has a browser function, which shows the web content of the provider of the article.
We reserve the right to change, modify, substitute or remove without notice any information on the App from time to time.
The legal provisions for the download of the App or the activation of the preinstalled service on the âZero-pageâ homescreen (hereinafter âDownload" and "Activationâ respectively) of the app, its use and the services of the App, especially the aggregation of articles, can be derived from these terms of use as well as from the privacy statement of the App.
As a precautionary measure we would like to clarify in this context that the App and the services connected to the App and provided by the App are exclusively provided by upday GmbH &amp.
Co.
KG.
This means that, for example, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.
as manufacturer of your terminal device is not the provider.
Thus (as a non-exhaustive example), Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.
would not be lawfully responsible for the App, especially not for the collection and processing of data (including any data transmissions to third parties), which lie within the control and responsibility of upday GmbH &amp.
Co.
KG.

We process your data exclusively on the basis of one or more of the applicable legal regulations.
Pursuant to GDPR, personal data can be processed on the basis of a contract or on the implementation of pre-contractual measuresâsubject to complianceâon the basis of legitimate interests or a law, and for the protection of essential or public interests.
Registration is required in order for us to provide certain content or services on our website.
Every user can register themselves for free at upday by specifying their first name, last name, email address, and a password, after which your registration data is sent to us.
The collection and processing of this data is carried out in line with the licence agreement between us and the user, Art.
6, Â§ 1 b GDPR.
Weâll also use the email address we collected in the course of your registration or in the context of contract management, to inform you about similar products or services as well as previously existing subscriptions or general information on upday.
In this case, email address processing is carried out on the basis of our legitimate interests in requests for our products and services (Art.
6, Â§ 1 f GDPR).
In addition, we use your email address to send you our newsletter, if youâve clearly indicated your agreement to receiving newsletter content or, as the case may be, publicity.
To this effect we process your email address in order to send you the newsletter, as requested (Art.
6, Â§ 1 f GDPR).
You can always object, either in writing or per email, to the usage of your email address for such purposes taking effect in the future: 65, Axel-Springer-Str., Berlin, 10888, privacy@upday.com.
No costs will be charged other than the transmission costs according to the base rate.
On the Internet, every device needs to have a clear address for the transferral of data.
This is called the IP address.
Preliminary storage of the IP address is technically required in order to transfer the website to the computer of the user.
In doing so, we abridge IP addresses before processing, thus, any later processing will take place anonymised.
Any further storage or processing related to the unabridged IP addresses will not take effect.
In addition, our servers save your IP address for 14 days for the purpose of your safety.
During processing operations, which are determined by one or several of the previously mentioned legislative bases, processing will take place when itâs necessary for the purpose of preserving legitimate interests, unless these legitimate interests are overridden on the basis of a comprehensive weighing of your interests, and your fundamental rights and freedoms (Art.
6, Â§ 1 f GDPR).
A legitimate interest can be assumed when the person concerned is a customer of the controller.
The processing of personal data and our legitimate interest therein and, in particular, the execution of our business operations, shall be in favour of the welfare of our employees and our shareholders.
Our legitimate interest in offering you custom products, informing you on our products, improvements, and quality features, as well as continuing to improve our services and products, through which weâre also able to increase our sales, is the legal basis for the purpose of Big Data processing, online behavioural advertising, web/app analysis, and advertisement ranking (gathering different selection criteria for suitable advertising).

You can object to data processing on the basis of legitimate interests at any time (see section 12).
In case the data is processed for any other purpose than as determined by data collection, a compatibility assessment will be carried out (see Art.
6, Â§ 4 GDPR).
Subsequent processing is only permitted if the original purpose is compatible with the new purpose, or when allowed by reason of a special legal basis.
Recognised compatible purposes are, among others, enforcement, exercising or defence of claims subject to civil law, insofar as no overriding interest of the person concerned exists.
We will inform you in case of a change in purpose.
A new data collection will take place on the grounds of a new legal basis if the new purpose is incompatible with the purpose as determined by data collection.
We will inform you on the change in purpose, should this be the case.

Web/App Analysis Services
We deploy services which collect and interpret data for us from the website and the app in order to continuously improve and update our content in line with usersâ interests, in addition to displaying behavioural online advertising.

Below you can learn in more detail about the analysis services deployed by us:
AppNexus We use AppNexus to help us display behavioural advertising.
AppNexus is an advertising service provider and a mediation platform operator (AppNexus, 28 W.
23rd Street, New York, New York, 10010, USA).
AppNexus collects and stores information about your activity, which enables the analysis of your user behaviour.
These profiles are used to display advertising which specifically reflects your interests.

Crashlytics Crashlytics is an analysis tool which is offered and run by Crashlytics Inc., based in Cambridge MA, USA.
Crashlytics produces so-called crash reports.
Crash reports outline operational dysfunctions or malfunctions of the app, they outline when and in what context the malfunctions occurred, how many users were affected, etc.
We use these reports to learn about operational dysfunctions or malfunctions and in order to, in the interest of our users, react in a faster, more goal orientated and efficient manner, and to technically improve the app.
For this purpose, Crashlytics, in conjunction with your upday app IDâwhich you can remove at any timeâ, records data in relation to the crash and general data on the IT environment (in particular the end device used, the mobile network operator, and the operating system).
Any personal or pseudonymous data will be deleted by Crahslytics after no more than seven days.
This information tells Crashlytics, and subsequently us, if and how the app functions and is used, including, in particular, any operational dysfunctions or malfunctions.
More information on the privacy policy applied by Crashlytics is available here: https://try.crashlytics.com/terms/privacy-policy.pdf.
Google AdSense We integrated Google AdSense on this website.
Google Adsense is an online service which enables us to advertise on third party websites.
Google Adsense is based on algorithms that select advertisements displayed on third party websites which are suited to the respective websitesâ content.
Google AdSense allows interest-based targeting of the internet user, which is converted by generating individual user profiles.
The operating company of Google AdSense component is Alphabet Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA.
The goal of the Google AdSense component is the integration of advertisements on our website.
Google AdSense places a cookie on the information technology system of the person concerned.
Through placing cookies, Alphabet Inc.
is able to analyse our website usage.
Each time one of the pages of our website into which a Google AdSense component is incorporated, is accessed, the internet browser on the IT system of the person concerned is automatically prompted by the respective Google AdSense component, to transfer data to Alphabet Inc for the purpose of online advertising and to calculate the respective commission fees.
In the context of this technical procedure, Alphabet Inc.
acquires knowledge on personal data, such as the IP address of the person concerned, which enables Alphabet Inc.
to trace the origin and the clicks of the visitor, and subsequently calculate the according commission fees.
The person concerned can, at any time, permanently prohibit the placement of cookies by our website, as explained above, by adjusting internet browser settings.
In addition, the adjusted internet browser settings would also prohibit Alphabet Inc.
to place a cookie on the IT system of the person concerned.
Furthermore, any cookies which were previously placed by Alphabet Inc.
can, at any time, be deleted via the internet browser or other software programmes.
Google AdSense uses so-called web beacons.
A web beacon is a miniature graphic image which is incorporated into a website to enable the creation of a log file record and a log file analysis, which in turn serves to conduct statistical analysis.
Alphabet Inc.
can, by means of the incorporated web beacon, record if and when a website has been accessed by a person concerned and which links the person concerned clicked on.
Web beacons help to, among other things, determine the visitor flow of a website.
Via Google AdSense, personal data and information including the IP address, which is necessary to select the displayed advertisement and determine the according commission fees, are transferred to Alphabet Inc.
in the United States of America.
The personal data are stored and processed in the United States of America.
Under certain circumstances, Alphabet Inc.

Google AdSense is explained in more detail here: https://www.google.co.uk/intl/de/adsense/start/.
Google AdWords We integrated AdWords into this website.
Google AdWords is an internet advertising service which allows advertisers to include ads in Google search engine results as well as in Google advertising networks.
Google AdWords enables advertisers to determine certain keywords in advance, by means of which an ad in the Google search engine results will be shown in case the userâs search results are relevant in relation to these keywords.
In the Google advertising network, ads are distributed across websites with relevant subjects by an automated algorithm and in consideration of the previously determined keywords.
The operating company of Google AdWords is Google Inc.
1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA.
The goal of Google Adwords is to publicise our website through placing interest-based advertising on the websites of third parties and in Google search engine results, in addition to placing third party ads on our website.
Google will place a so-called Conversion Cookie on the information technology system of the person concerned, should the person concerned have accessed our website via a Google ad.
A conversion cookie will lose its validity after thirty days and is not used to identify the person concerned.
By means of the conversion cookie, provided that the cookie is still valid, it will be determined if any subpages or, for example, the shopping basket of an online shop system on our website, have been accessed.
The conversion cookie helps us, and Google, to determine if a person concerned that ended up on our website via an AdWords ad, has generated sales in terms of completing or cancelling the purchase of product(s).
The data and information collected through the application of a conversion cookie is used by Google to create visitor statistics for our website.
These visitor statistics are in turn used by us, to determine the total number of users which were brought to us via AdWords ads.
That is to say, to determine the success or the failure of the respective AdWords ads and to optimise our future AdWords ads.
Neither our company nor any other Google AdWords clients receive information from Google which can be used to identify the person concerned.
Personal information is stored by means of the conversion cookie, for instance the websites visited by the person concerned.
Personal data, which includes the IP address and the internet connection used by the person concerned, is stored during each visit to our website and transferred to Google in the United States of America.
Google in the United States of America stores this personal data.
Under certain circumstances Google will transfer the personal data collected by means of the described technical procedures, to third parties.
The person concerned can, at any time, permanently prohibit the placement of cookies by our website, as explained above, by adjusting the internet browser settings.
In addition, the adjusted internet browser settings would also prohibit Google to place a conversion cookie on the information technology system of the person concerned.
Furthermore, any cookies which were previously placed by Google AdWords can, at any time, be deleted via the internet browser or other software programmes.
Furthermore, the person concerned can object to the interest-based advertising placed by Google.
In order to do this, the person concerned must access the following page: https://adssettings.google.co.uk , in each internet browser used and implement the desired adjustments.

Google Analytics We have integrated Google Analytics (with the anonymisation feature) on this website.
Google Analytics is a Web Analysis service.
Web analysis is the collection, storing, and analysation of behavioural data of visitors to our website.
A web analysation service determines, among other things, which website brought a person concerned to the current website (the so-called referrer), which subpages have been accessed on the website, or how often and for how long a subpage was visited.
Web analysis is predominantly used to optimise a website and for a cost-benefit analysis of internet advertising.
The operating company of Google Analytics Component is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA.
We use the extension â_gat._anonymizeIpâ, for web analysis via Google Analytics.
With the use of this extension, Google abridges and anonymises the IP address of the person concernedÂ´s internet connection when our website is accessed from a Member State of the European Union or another contractual state within the European Economic Area.
The goal of the Google Analytics component is the analysis of the visitor flow on our website.
Google uses the acquired data and information to evaluate the usage of our website, among other things, and to create online reports which illustrate the activity on our websites, and to fulfil other services connected to our website.
Google Analytics places a cookie on the information technology system of the person concerned.
