If you are a Scroll member in the United States (including its possessions and territories), you and Scroll agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to the Scroll service, these Terms and this Arbitration Agreement, shall be determined by binding arbitration or in small claims court.
Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.
Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts.
Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.
You agree that, by agreeing to these Terms, the U.S.
Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and Scroll are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.
This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and the termination of your Scroll membership.
If you elect to seek arbitration or file a small claim court action, you must first send to Scroll, by certified mail, a written notice of your claim ("Dispute Notice") to the address provided above If Scroll initiates arbitration, it will send a written Dispute Notice to the email address used for your membership account.
A Dispute Notice, whether sent by you or by Scroll, must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.
and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand").
If Scroll and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Dispute Notice is received, you or Scroll may commence an arbitration proceeding or file a claim in small claims court.
The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA.
The AAA Rules and Forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Dispute Notice Address.
The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement.
All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration agreement.
Unless Scroll and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your residence.
If your claim is for US$10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.
If your claim exceeds US$10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision explaining the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
If the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Scrollâs last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected (or if Scroll did not make a settlement offer before an arbitrator was selected), then Scroll will pay you the amount of the award or US$5,000, whichever is greater.
Except as expressly set forth herein, the payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
YOU AND SCROLL AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
Further, unless both you and Scroll agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.
The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.
RelationshipYou understand that your relationship with us is solely that of a user of our services, as an independent entity.
You are not our employee.
No agency, partnership or joint venture is intended or created by these Terms.Force MajeureNo one will have any liability under these Terms by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of our or your obligations on account of strikes, shortages, riots, acts of terrorism, insurrection, fires, flood, storm, explosions, earthquakes, pandemics, epidemics, Internet and/or electrical outages, computer viruses, acts of God, war, governmental action, or any cause that is beyond our or your reasonable control.WaiverOur failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights.
If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect.Entire Agreement.

SeverabilityThese Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have between us regarding the service.
