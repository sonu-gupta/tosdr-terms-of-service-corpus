We log the following via Apache HTTP logs:

- User agent (your computer OS, browser, and possibly language) 
- IP address (can be used to locate you within a 20-70 mile radius) 
- Request time 
- Referrer (how you found the site)

More about this can be found at the logging page.
Logs are deleted after 30 days.
If you don't want your IP to be collected, consider using our Onion services.

This information is collected for debugging, basic metrics (ie.
using an automated tool to display stats such as number of unique visitors), and blocking bots.
It is never shared or sold to third parties.
We do not track you.

For analytics, we use the open source program Plausible.
