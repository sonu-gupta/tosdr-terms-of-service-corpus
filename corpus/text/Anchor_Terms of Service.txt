Rights you grant to us
User Content
You retain ownership of your User Content.
Using Anchor does not cause you to lose ownership of your content.


Explainer: You own your content.
Anchor prides itself on empowering creators, and we have no intention to take ownership of your content in any way.

In order to host and assist you in monetizing your User Content, we do need to obtain certain non-exclusive rights from you.
By submitting User Content, including any Provided Content (defined below), through the Services, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive license to use, edit, modify, create derivative works from (such as transcriptions of User Content), aggregate, reproduce, distribute, make available, transmit, display, and perform, the User Content in connection with the operation of the Services, the promotion, advertising or marketing of the Services, and the operation of Spotifyâs (and its successorsâ and affiliatesâ) business.
This license is worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable (through multiple tiers) and transferable.

Explainer: In order to use Anchor, you are giving us permission to use, host, and distribute the content you create.
For example, this license allows us to syndicate your content to other platforms, so that your audience can hear your podcast anywhere they choose.
We believe strongly in creatorsâ rights, and in no way does this license take away the ownership rights you have in your content.

You agree that this license includes, without limitation, the right for Spotify to provide, promote, and improve the Services.
We may also use this license to make User Content available to other companies, organizations or individuals who partner with Spotify for the syndication, broadcast, distribution, transmission or publication of such User Content on other media and services.

Explainer: One of the best parts of Anchor is the ability to create in one place and optionally let us handle the hassle of distributing your podcast everywhere.
This language allows us to distribute your content on your behalf, so that you can focus on creating and leave the technical headache of podcast distribution to us.
You are also welcome to distribute your podcast to other platforms manually if you prefer.

For the avoidance of doubt, such license includes any and all rights in or to the User Content, including, without limitation, copyright, rights of privacy or rights of publicity.
Where applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive and not enforce any âmoral rightsâ or rights, such as your right to be identified as the author of your User Content, including Feedback, and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content.
If such moral rights are not waivable, then you at least agree not to sue us for failure to identify you as the author of any User Content or for any use of your User Content on or in connection with the Service.
You represent and warrant that you have all rights to grant such licenses to us without infringement or violation of any third party rights, including without limitation, any privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, trademarks, contract rights, or any other intellectual property or proprietary rights.
You also agree that, if you create your User Content with one or more collaborators, you will ensure that each such collaborator either (a) has an Account and has agreed to these Terms or (b) has granted to you all of the rights that you need in order for you to grant the licenses that you grant to us herein in such User Content.

Provided Content
â).
If your User Content makes use of or includes any Provided Content, or any other content created by any third party, you represent and warrant that you have all rights and permissions necessary to grant the licenses granted in Section 5(a) above.
If you create, contribute content for, produce, record, participate in, contribute to, share or otherwise assist in creating any Provided Content for use by another userâs Account, you grant to such user a non-exclusive license to use, edit, modify, create derivative works from (including transcriptions of Provided Content), aggregate, reproduce, distribute, make available, transmit, display, and perform the Provided Content in connection with the operation of the Services, promotion, advertising or marketing of the Services, and the operation of Spotifyâs (and its successorsâ and affiliatesâ) business.
This license is worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable (through multiple tiers) and transferable.
You acknowledge and understand that any sharing of Provided Content with one or more other users is voluntary, and the recipient of any Provided Content has no obligation to incorporate or otherwise use such Provided Content in their User Content.
You also agree that, if another user decides to use your Provided Content in connection with such userâs User Content, this does not result in you acquiring an ownership interest in such User Content.

Explainer: If you provide any content for use in connection with another personâs User Content, you give them the right to use that content.
If you receive any content from another person and incorporate that into your User Content, you must ensure you have all necessary permissions to use it.

13.
Limitation of Liability
This Section 13 applies to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law:


You agree that your sole and exclusive remedy for any problems or dissatisfaction with the Services is to stop using the Service.
you agree that Spotify has no obligation or liability arising from or related to third party services made available through or in connection with the Services.


In no event will Spotify and its affiliates, and its and their officers, directors, shareholders, employees, agents, suppliers, partners or third-party licensors, and any successors or assigns, be liable for (1) any indirect, special, incidental, punitive, exemplary, or consequential damages.
(2) any loss of use, data, business, or profits (whether direct or indirect), in all cases arising out of the use of or inability to use the Services, or third party services, regardless of legal theory, without regard to whether Spotify has been warned of the possibility of those damages, and even if a remedy fails of its essential purpose.
or (3) aggregate liability for all claims relating to the Services more than the amounts paid by you to Spotify during the prior twelve months in question.


Nothing in the Terms removes or limits Spotifyâs liability for fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, death or personal injury caused by its negligence, and, if required by applicable law, gross negligence.


You agree that any claim against Spotify must be commenced (by filing a demand for arbitration under Section 14 or filing an individual action under Section 15(a) within one (1) year after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act, omission, or default giving rise to the claim.
and there shall be no right to any remedy for any claim not asserted within that time period.
If applicable law prohibits a one-year limitation period for asserting claims, any claim must be asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law.


Explainer: We have no intention of this ever happening, but if we do something that somehow causes you to suffer a financial loss, you agree to a limit on how much we are required to reimburse you.
14.
Arbitration
Dispute resolution and arbitrationYou and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Terms or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration.
You and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.
Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.
THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.
There may be more limited discovery than in court.
The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.
This arbitration provision will survive termination of these Terms.

ExceptionsNotwithstanding the clause above Section 14(a), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.
small claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator.
In addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesnât stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.
Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).

No Class or Representative Proceedings: Class Action WaiverYOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.
Unless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one personâs claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that partyâs individual claim.
If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraphâs limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.

Arbitration rulesEither you or we may start arbitration proceedings.
Any arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ) then in force (the âAAA Rulesâ), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.
You and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).
The AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.
Spotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.
Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.
(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.
or (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.
If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee.
Spotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order.
Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.
The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitratorâs ruling on the merits.

Notice.
ProcessA party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail ("Notice").
Spotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc.
Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA.
The Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.
and (2) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand").
We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding.
During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.
In the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotifyâs last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.
All documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitratorâs decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.

EnforceabilityIf this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 15 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to these Terms.



Explainer: If you and Anchor ever have a disagreement (and we hope that never happens!), instead of facing the lengthy and expensive process of going to court, we agree to use the alternative dispute resolution process described here.
