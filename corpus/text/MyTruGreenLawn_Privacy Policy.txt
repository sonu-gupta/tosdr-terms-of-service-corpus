Information Collected Through Technology

In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies such as cookies, pixel tags and web beacons, browser analysis tools, and web server logs.
As you use our TruGreen Applications, your browser and devices communicate with servers operated by us, our business partners and our Product and Service providers to coordinate and record the activity and fill your requests for our Products and Services and information (âUsage Informationâ).
We collect many different types of information from cookies and other technologies.
For example, we may collect information from the devices you use to access our TruGreen Applications, your operating system type or mobile device model, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone of your device.
Browsers routinely send these types of information to web servers.
In addition, we collect your IP address or other unique identifier (âDevice Identifierâ) for your computer or other device used to access the TruGreen Applications (any, a âDeviceâ).
A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to the device used to access the TruGreen Applications, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier.
We may also collect information about the website you were visiting before you came to our TruGreen Applications and the website you visit after you leave our TruGreen Applications, if this information is supplied to us by your browser.
We may use this Usage Information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance or otherwise improve the TruGreen Applications.
The information from cookies and related technology is stored in web server logs and also in web cookies kept on your Device(s), which are then transmitted back to our Site by your Device(s).
These servers are operated and the cookies managed by us, our business partners or our service providers.
For example, when you visit TruGreen Applications, we and our service providers may place cookies on your Device(s).
Cookies allow us to recognize you when you return, and may track and target your interests in order to provide a customized experience.
They also help us detect certain kinds of fraud.
A âcookieâ is a small amount of information that a web server sends to your browser that stores information about your account, your preferences, and your use of the AHS Applications.
Some cookies contain serial numbers that allow us to connect your activity with TruGreen Applications with other information we store about you in your profile or as related to your interactions with TruGreen Applications.
Some cookies are temporary, whereas others may be configured to last longer.
âSessionâ cookies are temporary cookies used for various reasons, such as to manage page views.
Your browser usually erases Session cookies once you exit your browser.
âPersistentâ cookies are more permanent cookies that are stored on your computers or mobile devices even beyond when you exit your browser.
We use Persistent cookies for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided.
âFlashâ cookies, known as local shared objects, are data files placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device to personalize your visit.
Our third-party service providers also may use Flash cookies to collect and store information.
Flash cookies are different from standard browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored.
Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages.
You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a Persistent or Session cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off such cookies through your browser settings.
Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.
However, cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies.
To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, please click www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html. If you choose to disable cookies on your Device, some features of the TruGreen Applications may not function properly.
For instance, if cookies are disabled, you will not be able to log into the Site and therefore you will experience an anonymous user experience.
Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on the AHS Applications or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed specific actions.
When you access the AHS Applications or open email messages, the pixel tags and web beacons generate a notice of that action to us, or our service providers.
These tools allow us to measure response to our communications and improve the AHS Applications and promotions.
We also use embedded scripts which are programming codes designed to collect information about your interactions with the TruGreen Applications, such as the links you click on.
The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the TruGreen Applications, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.
We use HTML5, another form of collection, in our apps for the iPhone or iPad (and any other Apple iOS device).
HTML5 is another form of collection, tracking and storage that does not rely on traditional browser cookies.
Like Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies can be used to track users across website but are not stored in browsersâ cookie files.
To our knowledge there is currently no known way for a user of a mobile device to remove HTML5 tracking and storage.
In many cases, the information we collect using cookies and other tools is used in non-identifiable ways, without any reference to Personal Information.
For example, we use information we collect about TruGreen Application users to optimize our Products and Services and understand traffic and usage patterns.
In other cases, we associate the information we collect using cookies and related technologies with Personal Information.
Whenever we associate Usage Information or a Device Identifier with your Personal Information, we will treat it as Personal Information.

If that person becomes a customer or registers with us, his/her information will be treated in the same manner as all other customers or registered users.

Important disclosures, practices and contact information

Links to other Website(s) and Communities. To the extent hyperlinks may be utilized to access external or third party website(s) and communities, you should be aware that these external or third party website(s) and communities are not controlled by us and, therefore, are not subject to this Privacy Policy.
We recommend that you check the privacy policies of each such website and community to determine how your personal information will be utilized by their proprietors.

Security. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of information transmitted to us.
To guard your information delivered to us electronically, the TruGreen Applications use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).
SSL encrypts your credit card number, name and address so only we are able to decode your information.
Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
As a result, while we strive to protect your contact information, to the extent permitted by law, we do not guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or from the TruGreen Applications, and you do so at your own risk.
We urge you to keep any password that you establish with us in a safe place and not to divulge it to anyone.
Also remember to log off your account and close your browser window when you have finished your visit.
This is to ensure that others cannot access your account, especially if you are sharing a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place.

You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions.
Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.
We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:

Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.
Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.
Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.
Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.
Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal.
Penal Code Â§ 1546 et.
seq.).
Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the informationâs deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the researchâs achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.
Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.
Comply with a legal obligation.
Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.



Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights


To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by sending us a message on our website.
Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information.
You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.
You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.
The verifiable consumer request must:

Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.
We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestorâs identity or authority to make the request.


Response Timing and Format


We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt.
If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.
We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.
Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer requestâs receipt.
The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.
For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance, specifically by electronic mail communication.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.
If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.


Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights


If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us to not sell your personal information at any time (the âright to opt-outâ).
We do not sell the personal information of consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the âright to opt-inâ) from either the consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age.
Consumers who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time.
To exercise the right to opt-out, you (or your authorized representative) may submit a request to us by visiting the following our webpage and sending us a message.
Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize personal information sales.
However, you may change your mind and opt back in to personal information sales at any time by visiting our website and sending us a message.
We will only use personal information provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request.
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.
Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:

Deny you goods or services.
Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.

However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels.
Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal informationâs value and contain written terms that describe the programâs material aspects.
Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.
Californiaâs âShine the Lightâ law (Civil Code Section Â§ 1798.83) permits users of our Website that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
To make such a request, please send us an electronic message through our website or write us at our address listed on our webpage.
