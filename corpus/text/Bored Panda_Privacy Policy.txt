 Hello and thank you for visiting the Privacy Policy page, where we explain how we handle the information you provide to us, what information we collect ourselves, why we do it and who else we trust with it.
It also tells you how you can exercise your rights regarding your own data.

 When you use our products and services, by browsing the site, registering to have an account, logging in, commenting and such you do so under the policies we outline on this page.


1.
What personal information do we collect and why do we collect it?

 1.1.
Information you provide to us: When you register for an account on our site, we ask for your email address so we can check whether you already have an account, if you donât, we ask you to provide: â Email address, so we can let you know about your account status and activity on the page, you can change the Notification settings of your account by visiting this page while logged in, â Password â oh, donât worry, we donât see it, so feel free to use the name of your crush (as long as itâs at least 8 symbols and has a number in it:) ).
You can always reset it too, in case it doesnât work out.
 â Full name â you can lie here, nobody will know.
We use this as your Pen name when you comment or post articles.
Feel free to use a tool like this if you please.
You can change it once the popularity becomes too heavy or any other time, weâre chill.
 We will also ask you if you would like to receive our awesome newsletter, no pressure, and then we will send you an activation email â just to make sure youâre a real person or at least a very clever bot.
 Ah, true, almost forgot, if you chose to use your Facebook login to create an account with us, you give Facebook  permission to share with us the associated email and your profile name, good news though, that also means we donât need to vet you for humanness, so no confirmation email â woohoo! 
 1.2.
Information we get from your device: In order to make sure that the site performs at its best â functions properly, is informative, up-to date and tailored just for you â when you visit it, we collect information from your device.
That may include: â Device info â we want to know if you should be seeing a desktop or mobile version of the site, which application store you might need and such.
 â Network data â such as IP, helps us diagnose problems with our servers, administer our sites and also helps us to make sure our comment section is hate free. â Cookies â the no calories kind.

For example, if you request to delete your account we still have to retain some data for fraud prevention purposes and financial auditing.

8.
What about Cookies?

 8.1.
When you use our websites and apps we may collect information using cookies or similar technologies.
Cookies are small files that are downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you visit a website.
Your browser sends these cookies back to the website every time you visit the site again, so it can recognise you.
This allows websites to tailor what you see on the screen.
 We use cookies as they are a very important part of the internet, they help sites to work smoother, just like what a cup of morning coffee does to you.
The cookies we use are for: â Services â to make sure the site functions as expected, they are essential to you being able to enjoy the experience, â Analytics â those are also super important, they allow us to understand how all users combined use our site, make business decisions based on it and do what we need to do on our side to make the site viable, â Preferences â yeah, this is to remember your consent status, so we donât bug you with a pop-up on each visit, â Advertising â you might not think that, but this part is very important too, cookies help us provide you the best possible experience with ads, without them there would be a wild wild west of terrible banners everywhere.
Also they help us pay our bills and provide you with great content, just keep that in mind.
We use a Google tool called Google Double Click to make this all happen.

 8.2.
If you use an Ad-blocker on our site, we cannot fully execute our services and therefore ensure your rights under this policy.

 8.3.
You can manage your cookie settings by: â changing your Privacy Settings, â changing settings on your mobile device, â changing your browser settings, â opting out here.
 Please contact us if you need assistance with anything.
We want you to be aware that by changing certain preferences you might cause the page to not work correctly, or at all, and that would be very sad, wouldnât it? Changing the settings, also, would not remove advertising from the site, but would instead make it less relevant and even more annoying.


9.
Changes?



 We may amend or update this Privacy Policy from time to time, so you should check it periodically.
 Where changes are made, we will post the revised Policy here with an updated effective date.
