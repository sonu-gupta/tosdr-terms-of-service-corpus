         Connected Caregiverâ¢ Standard Terms 
Updated April 13, 2022

These Connected Caregiver Standard Terms constitute a legally binding agreement (the âAgreementâ) between you (as defined below) and Verustat, Inc., doing business as Connected Caregiver (âConnected Caregiver,â âweâ, âusâ, âthe companyâ) and specifically govern (i) any hardware we ship or sell to you (any such hardware is referred to herein as a âDeviceâ), (ii) the use of the Connected Caregiver applications (the âAppâ) and www.myConnectedCaregiver.com, our website (the âWebsiteâ), and (iii) any related services we provide to you.
The Device(s), App, Website and related services, including, but not limited to, software, data, subscription services, the use of de-identified and aggregated data for improving any of the foregoing, and other services provided by Connected Caregiver shall be collectively referred to herein as the âServices.â
References to âyouâ in this Agreement refer to each of the following, collectively or individually, as the context may require, and as applicable for each registered Connected Caregiver account: (i) the person who has purchased the Services for the purpose of monitoring the health information of a loved one (referred to herein individually as the âPrimary Caregiverâ) and (ii) the person whose health information is monitored by the Services (your âLoved Oneâ).
In the case where the Primary Caregiver has purchased the Services to monitor his or her own health information, references to Primary Caregiver and to Loved One herein will be understood to be to the same person.

The Primary Caregiver is responsible for ensuring that your Loved One has received and reviewed a copy of this Agreement, consents to be bound hereby, and specifically consented to being monitored by the Services as set forth in Section 2.9 below.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Connected Caregiver may rely on your Loved Oneâs use of any Device as evidence that such consent has been properly given.


The Devices and Services are not intended and not authorized for use to diagnose any medical condition or identify or, with the exception of Safety Devices (as defined in Section 2.17 below), alert anyone when medical care (urgent or otherwise) or other urgent assistance is required.
If you are experiencing a medical emergency, you should immediately contact emergency services (e.g., by dialing 9-1-1 in the United States).
The Connected Caregiver Services are not designed to identify when a medical emergency has arisen and, with the exception of Safety Services, are not able to contact emergency services (9-1-1) on your behalf. 


Each Device (other than the STAT-Phone and Safety Devices) is a medical device regulated by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration.
Please read all information that accompanies each Device.
By using a Device, you assume the risks associated with using it. 


IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE SERVICES.

Connected Caregiver, at its discretion, may make available future Device Software Updates for a Device.
The Device Software Updates, if any, may not necessarily include all existing software features or new features that Connected Caregiver releases for newer or other models of a Device.
The terms of this License will govern any Device Software Updates provided by Connected Caregiver that replace and/or supplement the Original Device Software product, unless such Device Software Update is accompanied by a separate license in which case the terms of that license will govern.
2.5.
All waveform data and all information surrounding the alert data is confidential, a trade secret, and/or otherwise proprietary to Connected Caregiver.

2.9.
If you are the Primary Caregiver who has ordered Devices and Services to be used by your Loved One, you warrant that you have provided a copy of this Agreement to your Loved One and obtained their consent to be monitored and have their health information collected by the Devices and the Services and shared with you and any End Users you designate, as well as with Connected Caregiver to be used in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and in particular Section 6 below.
2.10.

For example, Connected Caregiverâs Alerts provided by the Services, or the lack of a Connected Caregiver Alert, should not be relied on by you and you must seek medical attention for your Loved One as you would in the absence of the Device and Service.
If your Loved One has any medical condition that you believe could be affected by a Device, consult with a physician prior to using the Device.
2.13.
End Users.
Additional persons who are granted access to the Services by the Primary Caregiver or your Loved One to be able to monitor or review the health information of your Loved One are referred to herein as âEnd Users.â You will be deemed to have taken any action that you permit, assist or facilitate any End User to take.
You are responsible for End Usersâ use of the Services and any use or disclosure of information about your Loved One accessed by an End User through the Services.
You will ensure that all End Users comply with your obligations under this Agreement.

If you cease to subscribe to the Services, the Devices may no longer be usable.
The STAT-phone may not be used as a typical mobile phone device (e.g., it cannot be used to make phone calls).
2.16.
You may share the information collected through the Services with a physician, but we do not warrant the informationâs accuracy or completeness and any use of such information is at the physicianâs discretion and your sole risk.
Any medical advice provided (or not provided) by your physician, and any decision made (or not made) by or care or treatment provided (or not provided) to you (collectively, âCare Decisionsâ), whether or not in reliance on any information from the Services, is solely at your own risk.
Connected Caregiver specifically disclaims any responsibility for any Care Decisions.
2.17.
Safety Monitoring Services and Devices.
This section 2.17 applies solely to the Connected Caregiver Safety Monitoring service, a personal emergency response service provided by Connected Caregiver to subscribers (âSafety Servicesâ) and the Devices supplied to you by Connected Caregiver to provide such Safety Services (âSafety Devicesâ).
Except to the extent in conflict with any terms of this Section 2.17, all provisions in this Agreement applicable to Services and Devices apply equally to Safety Services and Safety Devices, respectively.
To the extent of any such conflict, the terms of this Section 2.17 will control, but solely with respect to Safety Services and Safety Devices.
The Safety Services include the location tracking services and receipt, analysis and response to alarm signals initiated by you or others via the Safety Devices (or when the Safety Device detects a fall) for so long as you subscribe for such Safety Services.
Upon receipt of an alarm (whether user initiated or due a fall being detected), Connected Caregiver will make reasonable efforts to contact you via your Safety Device, and if deemed necessary in Connected Caregiverâs reasonable judgment, other persons (e.g., loved ones or medical professionals) and entities (e.g., local police, fire, ambulance or other emergency services) you have specified (and in the order you have specified) at the time you subscribed for the Safety Services (collectively, âRespondersâ) may be contacted.
You are solely responsible for ensuring that all Responder information (including name and contact details) is accurate and kept up-to-date.
Note, if we receive an alarm and receive no response when we attempt to contact you via your Safety Device, and are unable to reach you or the Responders you have designated in your account profile, we may dispatch emergency services to your location (as reported by your Safety Device).
Connected Caregiver is expressly authorized to rely on any statements made by you or anyone sending an alert or communicating with us (or our monitoring service provider) via the Safety Device or via other means (e.g., via phone at your home or other location where your Safety Device is registered) as to your condition or location and specifically in connection with making a decision on which Responders to contact, if any, and without verifying such personâs identity or authority to speak on your behalf.
Connected Caregiver may also disregard any alarm if you or any of the foregoing direct Connected Caregiver to do so (and may also in such case advise Responders to disregard any such alarm).
You agree that attempting to contact the designated Responders as set forth above (when determined necessary in Connected Caregiverâs reasonable judgment) is Connected Caregiverâs exclusive duty as far as responding to any alarm received from your Safety Device.
Without limiting the foregoing, (a) Connected Caregiver is not responsible for the promptness, sufficiency or adequacy of the action of any Responder or any third party acting for a Responder.
(b) Connected Caregiver in no way represents or guarantees that Responders can be contacted, can or will respond, or that any response will be safe, timely, or effective.
(c) the Responders designated by you, and the emergency services available in your area, are not agents or other representatives of Connected Caregiver.
(d) Connected Caregiver will not send any of its personnel to your premises in response to any emergency signal.
(e) you will be responsible for any fines imposed for any false alarms (including any such fines imposed on Connected Caregiver or its suppliers or licensors providing any part of the Safety Services).
and (f) Connected Caregiver will not be responsible for any medical bills or other charges or liability for which you are billed by any Responder in connection with their response to an alarm (even if you conclude that we should not have contacted a Responder or that the Responderâs response was not needed or ineffective or not covered by insurance).
The Safety Services are not insurance.
Connected Caregiver does not provide insurance and does not guaranty that no loss or injury will occur by having a Safety Device or using the Safety Services.
The Safety Device relies on mobile data networks to be able to deliver tracking information and alarms to Connected Caregiver.
Connected Caregiver is not responsible if the Safety Device is unable to deliver tracking information or an alarm or if Connected Caregiver is unable to provide the Safety Services as a result of any disruption or fault in such networks from any cause or if the Safety Device is used outside the geographic area where such networks operate.
You are responsible for maintaining your Safety Device in good operating condition.
Connected Caregiver is not responsible if your Safety Device is unable to detect a fall or send an alarm due to negligent care on your part.
You expressly authorize us to direct any Responder to force entry into your home or premises in response to an alarm.
You acknowledge that this may result in damage to your home or such premises (and/or damage to property, or injury, up to and including death, to persons or pets, located therein).
You agree that neither Connected Caregiver nor any such Responder will be responsible for any such damage or injury.
You acknowledge that as part of the Safety Services, Connected Caregiver may collect location tracking information via the Safety Devices and such tracking information may be shared with third parties with which Connected Caregiver has contracted to provide any part of the Safety Services.
Such tracking information may be used by Connected Caregiver and such third parties for any lawful purpose, subject to Connected Caregiverâs Privacy Policy, which can be viewed at https://MyConnectedCaregiver.com/terms.
You acknowledge that the networks over which such tracking information is communicated are not secure and may be intercepted.
As a consequence of the foregoing, you acknowledge that tracking information should not be considered confidential.
For more details on how this tracking information may be collected, shared and used by us and the third parties with which we do business, refer to our Privacy Policy.
You may be required by your local governmental authority or agency to obtain a permit before you can lawfully receive the Safety Services.
You will be responsible for obtaining any such permits and paying any associated fees as well as for any fines imposed as a result of any failure to obtain or maintain such permits.
If we receive an excessive number of false alarms from your Safety Device, we may impose additional fees and/or cancel your subscription to the Safety Services.
The Federal Communications Commission and Federal Aviation Administration prohibit the use of the Safety Devices on commercial aircraft, including in checked baggage.
If your subscription for the Safety Services expires or is terminated, Connected Caregiver may disregard any alarm from your Safety Device (and may take steps to prevent the receipt of any further communications from your Safety Device).


 Devices.


3.1.
This Section 3 applies specifically to the Devices and any other tangible goods sold or shipped by Connected Caregiver to you when you subscribe for Services.
3.2.
Devices will be shipped promptly after your order is received.
Any delivery date we communicate to you at the time of order is an estimate only and not a guaranty.
Title and risk of loss with respect to the Devices passes to you upon delivery to the delivery address you provided at the time of order.
This means that if a Device is lost or damaged after you have received it, Connected Caregiver may charge your authorized form of payment a Lost/Non-Returned Device fee based on the type and number of Devices affected (in the case of loaned Devices).
This fee is waived if your subscription has been active and fully paid for at least 6-months from the date the affected Devices were shipped to you, and this fee does not apply in the case of Devices you purchase separately.
3.3.
You must inspect the Device(s) promptly upon receipt to ensure no damage has occurred during shipping and that you have received the Device(s) you ordered.
You should also immediately activate and test the Device(s) to ensure they are functioning correctly.
You may contact Connected Caregiver customer support if you have any difficulties activating your Device(s).
You should immediately notify us if there is any damage or discrepancy in your shipment or if any Device(s) are not functioning properly.
You will be deemed to have accepted the Device(s) if we have not received a report of damage or other issue within twenty (20) days of the date of delivery.
3.4.
If a Device stops working properly, and assuming we are not able to address the issue remotely (e.g., over the phone or via email or web support), we will promptly ship a replacement Device to you at no cost.
Along with the replacement Device, you will be provided a return shipping label to ship the defective Device back to us at our cost once the replacement Device has been received.
You must promptly return the defective Device to us using the return shipping label and the packaging your replacement Device arrives in (care should be taken when opening the replacement Device package upon delivery to ensure the packaging can be reused).
If we do not receive the defective Device back within thirty (30) days of delivery of the replacement Device, you may be charged a Lost/No Return Fee on your authorized form of payment.
This Section 3.4 will apply only for so long as you are continuously subscribed to receive the Services.
3.5.
Devices are manufactured by third parties.
Except with respect to the Device Software, Connected Caregiver has no input in the design or manufacture of the Devices.
TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, CONNECTED CAREGIVER SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY DEFECT IN THE MANUFACTURE OR DESIGN OF ANY DEVICE.

EXCEPT FOR ANY WARRANTY PROVIDED BY THE ORIGINAL MANUFACTURER, DEVICES ARE SOLD AS-IS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.

4.5.
You may not use as a username the name of another person or entity or that is not lawfully available for use, a name or trademark that is subject to any rights of another person or entity other than you without appropriate authorization, or a name that is otherwise offensive, vulgar or obscene.
