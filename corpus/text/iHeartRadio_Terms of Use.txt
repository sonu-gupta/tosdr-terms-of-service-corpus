and (4) an "All Access Family Plan." The following terms are applicable only if you purchase the Plus Service, the All Access Service, or the Family Plan (each, a "Paid Subscription Service").
In order to obtain access to the Paid Subscription Service, you must also pay a specified, automatically recurring subscription fee (e.g., monthly, quarterly, or annually).
Further details about the Paid Subscription Service can be found at http://www.iheartradioondemand.com.
iHeartMedia may, at its sole discretion, prospectively change the features and services offered in any of the Paid Subscription Service at any time.
The Paid Subscription Services are available to US residents only.

Paid Subscription Service - Billing and Fees

Before you register for a Paid Subscription Service, iHeartMedia will provide notice of and get your affirmative consent to any charges. By registering for a Paid Subscription Service (which includes "Direct Purchases" and "In-App Purchases," as defined below), you affirmatively consent to pay all fees and charges associated with the Paid Subscription Service on a timely basis and are responsible for any charges incurred by your account. You warrant that the credit card information that you provide is correct and is your account. We are not liable for any loss that you may incur as a result of someone else using your password or account, whether with or without your knowledge.
BY REGISTERING FOR A PAID SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE AND PROVIDING YOUR CREDIT CARD INFORMATION, YOU AUTHORIZE US (IN THE CASE OF A DIRECT PURCHASE) OR THE APP STORE PROVIDER (IN THE CASE OF AN IN-APP PURCHASE) TO CHARGE YOUR CREDIT CARD FOR THE PAID SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE FEE AT THE THEN-CURRENT RATE AND ANY ADDITIONAL CHARGES (INCLUDING LATE CHARGES AND APPLICABLE FEDERAL, STATE, OR LOCAL TAXES), AS WELL AS TO CHARGE YOUR CREDIT CARD ON AN AUTOMATIC AND RECURRING BASIS (E.G., MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, OR ANNUALLY), AS CONSENTED TO AT THE TIME OF REGISTRATION, UNTIL YOU CANCEL YOUR PAID SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE. You may cancel online by following the instructions below ("Paid Subscription Service - Cancellation").
If you make an in-app purchase of the Paid Subscription Service (an "In-App Purchase") via the applicable app store provider (e.g., Apple App Store, Google Play, etc.) (an "App Store Provider"), then the App Store Provider will charge your account the applicable fees or charges. Billing for In-App Purchases will be handled by the App Store Provider, according to their terms.
If you purchase a Paid Subscription Service directly from us (a "Direct Purchase"), we may use a third party that is not affiliated with us to process your payments as merchant of record ("Processor"). You agree that this Processor is solely responsible for controlling, handling and processing your payments. For Direct Purchases, you will receive a bill for the Paid Subscription Service fee based on the term of the subscription for which you registered. For example, if you signed up for a monthly paid subscription, you will be billed one day after each month on the calendar day that corresponds with the commencement of your subscription. If your payment date falls on a date that does not exist in that month (e.g., the 31st day of a month), we will bill your credit card on the last day of the applicable month. However, you acknowledge that we reserve the right to change our billing methods effective upon notice to you. You may visit your member account to update your credit card information, and you agree to maintain a valid credit card during the subscription term. You are liable for any amounts that are unsettled and overdue. We may deactivate your member account without notice if your payment method is invalid and your payment becomes past due. Any delinquent payments are due in full within thirty (30) days of the termination or cancellation of a Direct Purchase Paid Subscription Service.

Paid Subscription Service - Promotional Trial

iHeartMedia may offer a free or reduced price trial subscription of the Plus Service or the All Access Service for a specified trial period either without payment or with payment of a reduced fee (a "Trial"). To initiate the Promotional Trial, you will be required to provide your credit card information. By initiating the Promotional Trial, you affirmatively consent to have your credit card charged automatically on a periodically recurring basis if you do not cancel your subscription before the end of the Promotional Trial.
Unless otherwise specified, Trials are limited to a single Paid Subscription Service.
you may not obtain more than a single Trial using the same account or credit card and if you have previously used the same account or credit card to obtain a Trial or Paid Subscription Service, then that card will immediately be charged applicable fee upon registration.
iHeartMedia may, at its sole discretion and to the fullest extent permitted by law, revoke or alter a Promotional Trial without notice to you and at any time.
Your Promotional Trial will end as soon as you purchase a Paid Subscription Service.
BY INITIATING A PROMOTIONAL TRIAL, YOU AFFIRMATIVELY CONSENT TO BE AUTOMATICALLY ENROLLED IN THE PAID SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE YOU SELECTED DURING REGISTRATION, AND TO HAVE YOUR CREDIT CARD AUTOMATICALLY CHARGED THE APPLICABLE FEES (INCLUDING APPLICABLE FEDERAL, STATE, OR LOCAL TAXES) ON A RECURRING PERIODIC BASIS (E.G., MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, OR ANNUALLY), UNLESS YOU CANCEL THE PAID SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE PRIOR TO EXPIRATION OF THE PROMOTIONAL TRIAL. You may cancel online by following the instructions below ("Paid Subscription Service - Cancellation"). 

Paid Subscription Service - All Access Family Plan

If you purchase an All Access Family Plan, you, as the paying account holder may designate up to five (5) non-paying account holders (each, a "Family Account Holder") to access the All Access Service.
You will be the only party responsible for paying for the All Access Family Plan and may add or remove Family Account Holders from your All Access Family Plan at any time.
To invite a prospective Family Account Holder to participate in your All Access Family Plan, you must provide the prospective Family Account Holderâs email address. iHeartMedia will send an email to the prospective Family Account Holder inviting them to participate in your All Access Family Plan. To accept your invitation to participate in the All Access Family Plan, the Family Account Holder must create an account with iHeartMedia (if they do not already have one) and enter the paying account holderâs billing zip code.
All Family Account Holders must live in the same household and be at least 13 years of age.

Paid Subscription Service- Automatic Renewal

By registering for a Paid Subscription Service, you affirmatively consent to have your Paid Subscription Service automatically renewed, and to have your credit card charged on a periodically recurring basis (e.g., monthly, quarterly, or annually), unless you cancel your subscription before the end of your current subscription term. You may cancel online by following the instructions below ("Paid Subscription Service - Cancellation"). Cancellation will be effective the day after the end of your current subscription term. Your failure to cancel your subscription during the current term will result in the automatic renewal of your subscription at the then-current subscription rate and for the same term as your current subscription (e.g., monthly, quarterly, yearly). As described below, if iHeartMedia plans to change the subscription rate, we will provide you with advance notice of the new rate. The cancellation of a Paid Subscription Service will result in a downgrade of your subscription service to the Free-of-Charge Service as of the end of your current subscription term.

Paid Subscription Service- Subscription Rate Changes

We may change the subscription rate from time to time. If we do, we will provide you advance notice of any change in the subscription rate. If you do not agree with the new subscription rate, you may cancel your subscription prior to the new subscription rate taking effect. You may cancel online by following the instructions below ("Paid Subscription Service - Cancellation"). If you continue to use the Paid Subscription Service after the subscription rate has gone into effect, you will be charged the new rate until you cancel or the rate changes.

Paid Subscription Service - Data

As part of your purchase of a Paid Subscription Service, data collected through the registration and payment process may be shared with our applicable payment service provider. If you purchase the Paid Subscription Service online, such information will be shared with Processor. If you make an in-app purchase of the Paid Subscription Service, such information will be shared with the applicable app store provider (e.g., Apple App Store, Google Play, etc.). Your data will be handled in accordance with our Privacy Policy at https://www.iheartradio.com/legal/privacy.

Paid Subscription Service - Member Account and Password

You are responsible for any membership name and password that is associated with your account during registration. If the Paid Subscription Service does not recognize your device from a previous sign-in, you will be asked for information that will help us to identify your registration. It is your responsibility to maintain the confidentiality of your password, if one is established. You are entirely responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account, and agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.

The Paid Subscription Services are for US residents only. The Paid Subscription Services are for your personal and non-commercial use only. You may not modify, copy, distribute, transmit, display, perform, reproduce, publish, license, create derivative works from, transfer, or otherwise exploit the Paid Subscription Services without our prior written consent.

Paid Subscription Service - Cancellation

You can cancel your Direct Purchases or a Paid Subscription Service at any time by going to your online account "Settings" and following the cancellation instructions.
you may cancel your In-App Purchases by following your App Store Providerâs instructions.
