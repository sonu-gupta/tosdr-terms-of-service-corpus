COPYRIGHT AND TRADEMARK ISSUES

While we are not
obligated to review User Submitted Materials for copyright or trademark
infringement, we are committed to protecting copyrights and trademarks and
expect users of our Sites and Apps to do the same.
The Digital Millennium
Copyright Act of 1998 (the âDMCAâ) provides recourse for copyright owners who
believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under
U.S.
copyright law.
If you believe in good faith that any material used or
displayed on or through our Sites and Apps infringes your copyright, you (or
your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or
access to it blocked.
The notice must include the following information: (a) a
physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the
owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
(b) identification of
the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted
works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such
works).
(c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or
the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to
allow us to locate the material on our Sites and Apps.
(d) the name, address,
telephone number and email address (if available) of the complaining party.
(e)
a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the
material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner,
its agent or the law.
and (f) a statement that the information in the
notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining
party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed.
If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright
infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send
us a counter-notice.
Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current
statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA.
see http://www.copyright.gov for
details.
DMCA notices and counter-notices regarding our Sites and Apps, or
notices concerning trademark use in personalized products we make or in our
Sites and Apps, should be sent to:

18. ARBITRATION AGREEMENT


Please read this carefully.
It
affects your rights.&nbsp.
If you are a Shutterfly customer in the United States
(including its possessions and territories), you and Shutterfly agree that any
dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to the
Shutterfly service, these Terms of Use and this Arbitration Agreement, shall be
determined by binding arbitration or in small claims court.
Arbitration is more
informal than a lawsuit in court.
Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead
of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is
subject to very limited review by courts.
Arbitrators can award the same
damages and relief that a court can award.
You agree that, by agreeing to these
Terms of Use, the U.S.
Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and
enforcement of this provision, and that you and Shutterfly are each
waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.
This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and the
termination of your Shutterfly account.
If you elect to seek arbitration or file a small claim court action, you must first send to Shutterfly, by certified mail, a written Notice of your claim (âNoticeâ).
The Notice to Shutterfly must be addressed to: General Counsel, Shutterfly, LLC, 2800 Bridge Parkway, Redwood City, CA 94065 (âNotice Addressâ).
If Shutterfly initiates arbitration, it will send a written Notice to the email address used for your account.
A Notice, whether sent by you or by Shutterfly, must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.
(b) set forth the specific relief sought and the basis for the calculations.

(c) include your name, the email address associated with your Shutterfly account, your current phone number, mailing address, and email address, and your signature.
and (d) if you have retained an attorney, your signed statement authorizing Shutterfly to disclose your confidential account records to your attorney if necessary in resolving your claim.
If Shutterfly and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 60 days after the Notice is received, you or Shutterfly may commence an arbitration proceeding or file a claim in small claims court.
You may download or copy a form Notice and a form to initiate arbitration at www.adr.org.
If you are required to pay a filing fee, after Shutterfly receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, if you previously had fully complied with the Notice requirement in the preceding paragraph, Shutterfly will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US$1,000, in which event you will be responsible for filing fees.
The arbitration will be
governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, âAAA Rulesâ) of the
American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ), as modified by this Agreement, and
will be administered by the AAA.
The AAA Rules and Forms are available online
at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at
1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address.
The arbitrator is bound by
the terms of this Agreement.
All issues are for the arbitrator to decide,
including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration
agreement.
Unless Shutterfly and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings
will take place in the county of your residence.
If your claim is for US$10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.
If your claim exceeds US$10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
The arbitrator may consider rulings in other arbitrations involving different customers, but an arbitratorâs ruling will not be binding in proceedings involving different customers.
If you had fully complied with the Notice requirement above and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Shutterflyâs last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected (or if Shutterfly did not make a settlement offer before an arbitrator was selected), then Shutterfly will pay you the amount of the award or US$1,000, whichever is greater.
Except as expressly set forth herein, the payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
YOU AND SHUTTERFLY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
Further, unless both you and Shutterfly agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one personâs claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that partyâs individual claim.&nbsp.
If any provision of this paragraph is determined to be unenforceable with respect to any claim or any particular remedy for a claim (such as a request for public injunctive relief), then the parties agree that the claim or particular remedy (and only that claim or remedy) must be decided by a court after all other claims and requests for relief are arbitrated.

Our mobile app for Groovebook subscription service (each a
âSubscription Photobook Appâ) offers you an opportunity to have your smartphone
photos shipped to you in a 4â³ x 6â³ photo book every month.
By purchasing or
receiving a Subscription Photobook App, you agree to these Terms.
If you do not
agree with these Terms, please do not use the Subscription Photobook App.
The Subscription Photobook App, which may start with a free
trial, will continue month-to month unless and until you cancel your
subscription or we terminate it.
Your device must be able to support the
Subscription Photobook App and you must provide us with a current, valid,
accepted method of payment (as such may be updated from time to time, âPayment
Methodâ) to use the Subscription Photobook App.
We will bill the monthly
subscription fee to your Payment Method.
The monthly subscription price
includes shipping and handling, but does not include any applicable taxes.
We
may change the price for the subscription from time to time, and will
communicate any price changes to you.
Price changes will take effect at the
start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.
By continuing to use the Subscription Photobook App after the price change
takes effect, you accept the new price.
If you reside in a country that is part
of the European Union and have purchased a subscription, you have the right to
change your mind and receive a full refund within fourteen (14) days of
purchase (the âCooling-off Periodâ), but only if you have not logged in or otherwise
redeemed or started to consume it.
Any cancellation of your Subscription
Photobook App will take effect the day after the last day of the current
subscription period.
However, if you cancel your payment and/or terminate the
Terms after the Cooling-off Period is over (where applicable), and/or before
the end of the subscription period, we will not refund any fees already paid to
us, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law.
In certain jurisdictions, gift subscriptions for the
Subscription Photobook App may be available for purchase, which are one time
use cards and are only redeemable for the Groovebook Service in countries where
the service is offered in the currency denominated on the gift subscription.
Gift subscriptions are assigned a fixed monetary value (e.g., $35).
The entire
value of the gift subscriptions will be applied to your Subscription Photobook
App account upon redemption.
Gift subscriptions are not refundable (whether
cash or otherwise), except to the extent required by applicable law.
Gift
subscriptions cannot be used to purchase other gift subscriptions, and cannot
be reloaded, resold or transferred for value.
Gift subscriptions will expire in
the time period specified on the gift subscription.

and the risk of loss, destruction or deterioration pass to the purchaser upon
purchase.

stolen, destroyed or used without your permission.

subscription is non-functional, your sole remedy, and our sole liability, will
be the replacement of such gift subscription.
From time to time, other types of promotional codes may be
available, including those provided as part of a third party promotion.
Promotional codes may be redeemed as described in the specifics of the
promotion.

cash, and may be subject to certain restrictions as determined by us in our
sole discretion.

party, additional conditions may apply.
We may offer trials of the Subscription Photobook App for a
specified period without payment (a âTrialâ).

absolute discretion, to determine your eligibility for a Trial, and to withdraw
or to modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability.
For some Trials, we will require you to provide a Payment Method to start the
Trial.
At the end of such Trials, we may automatically start to charge you for
the Subscription Photobook App on the first day following the end of the Trial,
on a recurring monthly basis.
By providing a Payment Method in conjunction with
the Trial, you agree to this charge.
You will not receive a notice from us that
your Trial has ended or that the paying portion of your subscription has begun.
If you do not want this charge, you must cancel your Subscription Photobook App
by contacting customer service at info@groovebook.com (for the Groovebook
mobile app) before the end of the Trial.
The monthly subscription fee for the Subscription Photobook App
will be billed at the beginning of the paying portion of your subscription and
each month thereafter unless and until you cancel your subscription.

automatically bill your Payment Method each month on the calendar day
corresponding to the commencement of your paying subscription.

fees are fully earned upon payment.
We reserve the right to change the timing
of our billing, in particular if your Payment Method has not successfully settled.

you can view this information at any time in the mobile app.
You may also
contact customer service at info@groovebook.com (for the Groovebook mobile app)
at any time with any billing questions. In the event your paying
subscription began on a day not contained in a given month, we may bill your
Payment Method on a day in the applicable month or such other day as we deem
appropriate.
For example, if you started your Subscription Photobook App on
January 31st, your next payment date will likely be February 28th, and your
Payment Method would be billed on that date.
Payments are nonrefundable and there are no refunds or credits
for partially used subscriptions.
Following any cancellation, however, you will
continue to have access to the Subscription Photobook App through the end of
your current billing period.
At any time, and for any reason, we may provide a
refund, discount, or other consideration (âcreditsâ).
The amount and form of
such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole and absolute
discretion.
The provision of credits in one instance does not entitle you to
credits in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide
credits in the future, under any circumstance.
We will make reasonable efforts to keep the Subscription
Photobook App operational.
However, certain technical difficulties or
maintenance may, from time to time result in temporary interruptions.
We
reserve the right, periodically and at any time, to modify or discontinue,
temporarily or permanently, functions and features of the Subscription
