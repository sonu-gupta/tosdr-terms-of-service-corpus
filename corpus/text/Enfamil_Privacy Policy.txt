J.
Do-Not-Track
Currently, our systems do not recognize browser âdo-not-trackâ requests because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed.
We may honor âdo not trackâ signals in the future.
You may, however, disable certain tracking by disabling cookies or opting-out of targeted advertising as noted below.
K.
Cookies
We use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to improve our Services and provide you with the best possible experience.
We use cookies to track your preferences and purchases as you navigate through our Site and to save you from having to re-enter information every time you visit our Site.
By using cookies to track your visits, we can make your next shopping experience on our Site better.
To search our Site and/or place an order, you need to have the cookies feature of your web browser turned on.
We may also use technologies, such as our own cookies, to provide you with personalized online display advertising tailored to your interests.
Some cookies are necessary to make the Site work properly.
These cookies can be disabled, but the Sites and Services may not work properly.
Other types of cookies go towards functionality, personalization, performance or analytics, which are optional.
These optional cookies may be disabled should you elect to opt-out from having them collected from you.
1. Types of Cookies
Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computerâs hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes.
Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate Our Site and Services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at Our Site and Services.
There are two types of cookies: session and persistent cookies.



Session Cookies.
 Session cookies exist only during an online session.
They disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer.
We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged into Our Site.
This allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through Our Site.


Persistent Cookies.
 Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer.
We use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity.

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future.
The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.
Visitors to Our Site who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the Site, but some features may not function.
2. Local Storage Objects
We may use Flash Local Storage Objects (âFlash LSOsâ) to store your site preferences and to personalize your visit.
Flash LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored.
Typically, you cannot control, delete, or disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs through your web browser.
For more information on Flash LSOs, or to learn how to manage your settings for Flash LSOs, go to the Adobe Flash Player Help Page, choose âGlobal Storage Settings Panelâ and follow the instructions.
To see the Flash LSOs currently on your computer, choose âWebsite Storage Settings Panelâ and follow the instructions to review and, if you choose, to delete any specific Flash LSO.
3. Clear GIFs, Pixel Tags and Other Technologies
Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computerâs hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages.
We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a.
web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with Our Site to, among other things, track the activities of Our Site visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about site usage.
We and our third-party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our customers, to help us track email response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.
4.
Third-Party Analytics
We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of Our Site.
We also may use other analytic means to evaluate Our Site.
We use these tools to help us improve Our Siteâs performance and user experiences.
These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies, such as web beacons or local storage objects (Flash LSOs), to perform their services.
To learn more about Googleâs privacy practices, please review the Google Privacy Policy at https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/.
You can also download the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on to prevent their data from being used by Google Analytics at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.

Cross-Device Use. We and our third-party service providers, including Google, may use the information that we collect about you (whether directly from Our Site, through your device(s), or from a third-party) to help us and our third-party service providers identify other devices that you use (e.g., a mobile phone, tablet, other computer, etc.).
We, and our third-party service providers also may use the cross-device use and other information we learn about you to serve targeted advertising on your devices and to send you emails.
To opt-out of cross-device advertising, you may follow the instructions set forth in the Third-Party Ad Networks section below.
Please note: if you opt-out of these targeted advertising cookies, your opt-out will be specific to the web browser or device from which you accessed the opt-out.
If you use multiple devices or web browsers, you will need to opt-out each browser or device that you use.
5.
Third-Party Ad Networks
We use third-parties such as network advertisers to display advertisements on Our Sites, to assist us in displaying advertisements on third-party websites, and to evaluate the success of our advertising campaigns.
Network advertisers are third-parties that display advertisements based on your visits to Our Site as well as other websites.
This enables us and these third-parties to target advertisements by displaying ads for products and services in which you might be interested.
Third-party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors, and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs, and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you.
These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third-partyâs specific privacy policy, not this one.
We may provide these third-party advertisers with information about your usage of Our Site and our Services, as well as aggregate or de-identified information about visitors to Our Site and users of our Services.
You may opt-out of many third-party ad networks, including those operated by members of the Network Advertising Initiative (âNAIâ) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (âDAAâ).
For more information regarding this practice by NAI members and DAA members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including how to opt-out of third-party ad networks operated by NAI and DAA members, please visit their respective websites: www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp (NAI) and www.aboutads.info/choices (DAA).
Opting out of one or more NAI member or DAA member networks (many of which will be the same) only means that those members no longer will deliver targeted content or ads to you.
It does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads on Our Site or other websites.
You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing.
Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your NAI or DAA opt-out may no longer be effective.
Additional information is available on NAIâs and DAAâs websites accessible by the above links.
