Transferring your Data outside the EU or the EEA
 Corelâs principal place of business is in Canada, which is a "Third Country" under the GDPR.
Third Countries are generally not considered to afford the same level of protection that you enjoy in the EU, but Corel still provides an adequate level of protection for your Personal Data - decision 2002/2/EC of the EU Commission states that Canada is deemed to provide an adequate level of data protection regarding commercial organizations such as Corel.
