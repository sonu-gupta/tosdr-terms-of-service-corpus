14 Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement.
Please read the following arbitration agreement in this section (âArbitration Agreementâ) carefully.
It requires users to arbitrate disputes with Splice and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.
a.
Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.
You and we agree that any dispute, claim, or request for relief by or against the Splice relating in any way to your access to or use of the Splice Properties or this Agreement will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you and we may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if such claims qualify and remain in small claims court.
and (2) you or Splice may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents).
For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, the terms âweâ, âusâ or âSpliceâ mean Distributed Creation, Inc.
(D/B/A Splice) and any of its predecessors, successors, assigns, corporate parents, subsidiaries and affiliates, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives.

b.
Arbitration Rules and Forum.
The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.
To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your dispute or claim or request for relief to Splice at the contact address found at the end of these Terms.
The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider.
Disputes involving claims, counterclaims, or requests for relief under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneysâ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMSâs most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/.
all other disputes shall be subject to JAMSâs most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/.
Any arbitration of a dispute relating to your use of the Splice Properties primarily for personal, family or household purposes shall also be subject to the allocation of arbitration costs and other requirements of the JAMSâ policy regarding Consumer Arbitrations Pursuant to Pre-Dispute Clauses Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness available at https://www.jamsadr.com/consumer-minimum-standards/.
JAMSâs rules are also available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267.
If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.
If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay any applicable JAMSâs filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, Splice will pay them for you.
In addition, Splice will reimburse all such JAMSâs filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for disputes, claims, or requests for relief totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.
If you are a consumer User of our Services residing in California, we waive any rights to recover our costs or attorneyâs fees as a prevailing party in arbitration.

 You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.
Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

c.
Authority of Arbitrator.
The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement and (b) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any assertion that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.
The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Splice.
The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.
The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim.
The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forumâs rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement).
The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.
The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.
The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.

d.
Waiver of Jury Trial.
YOU AND SPLICE HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.
You and Splice are instead electing that all disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 14(a) (Applicability of Arbitration Agreement) above.
An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would.
However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.

e.
Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief.
ALL DISPUTES, CLAIMS, AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS.
ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.
If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this subsectionâs limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim for relief and only that claim for relief shall be severed from the arbitration and brought into the State or Federal Courts located in the State of New York.
All other disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be arbitrated.

f.

Â§ 512(c) with respect to such User Content.
We have discretion, however, to terminate the account of any User after receipt of a single notification of claimed infringement or upon our own determination.

 The DMCA provides recourse for intellectual property owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S.
law.
If you believe in good faith that materials posted on the Splice Properties infringe your intellectual property rights, then you (or your agent) may send us a âNotification of Claimed Infringementâ requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked.
The notice must include the following information:

 A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.


 If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, then the DMCA permits you to send us a counter-notice.
