 Child Safety on YouTube
 The safety of our creators, viewers, and partners is our highest priority â and we look to each of you to help us protect this unique and vibrant community.
Itâs important you understand our Community Guidelines, and the role they play in our shared responsibility to keep YouTube safe.
Please take the time to carefully read the policy below.
You can also check out this page for a full list of our guidelines.
Update: Content that targets young minors and families but contains sexual themes, violence, obscene, or other mature themes not suitable for young audiences, is not allowed on YouTube.
In addition to your titles, descriptions, and tags, ensure your audience selection matches the audience your content is suitable for.&nbsp.
YouTube doesnât allow content that endangers the emotional and physical well-being of minors.
A minor is defined as someone under the legal age of majority -- usually anyone younger than 18 years old in most countries/regions.
If you find content that violates this policy, report it.
If you believe that a child is in danger, you should contact your local law enforcement to report the situation immediately.
Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines are available here. If you've found multiple videos or comments that you would like to report, you can report the channel.  What this policy means for you If you're posting content Donât post content on YouTube if it fits any of the descriptions below.

How to protect minors in your content

Our goal is to protect uploaders as well as viewers.
Before posting content of yourself, your family, or friends, think carefully about whether it may put anyone at risk of negative attention. 

Ensure the minor is supervised by an adult and is performing age-appropriate activities such as demonstrating hobbies, educational content or public performances.
Ensure the attire worn is age-appropriate.
Avoid attire that overexposes the minor or is very form-fitting. 
Use YouTube's privacy settings to limit who can see the videos you post.


Donât post content on YouTube that features minors and meets one or more of the following: 


Filmed in private spaces at home such as bedrooms or bathrooms.
Features minors soliciting contact from strangers, dares or challenges online, or discussing adult topics.
Shows activities that could draw undesired attention to the minor, such as performing body contortions or ASMR.
Reveals personal details about a minor.

These are just some examples, you can get more best practices for child safety here.
If you are under 18 or the applicable age of majority in your country, Be internet awesome can help you be safe online. Examples Here are some examples of content not allowed on YouTube.

A video featuring minors involved in provocative, sexual, or sexually suggestive activities, challenges and dares, such as kissing or groping.

A video with tags like "for children", or whose audience is set to âYes, itâs made for kidsâ, featuring family friendly cartoons engaging in inappropriate acts like injecting needles.
