OTHER IMPORTANT ISSUES

We do not use automated decision-making without human intervention, including profiling, in a way that produces legal effects concerning you or otherwise significantly affects you.


For Personal Data that we collect and process for other purposes described above, we typically retain such Personal Data for no longer than the period necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy and Cookies Policy and as otherwise needed to address tax, corporate, compliance, litigation, and other legal rights and obligations.
