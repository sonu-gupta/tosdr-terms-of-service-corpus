2.   &nbsp.
Users of a Streamotion Service (users or you) agree to be bound by these terms and conditions (Terms).
 These Terms apply to each Streamotion Service you subscribe to and your use of, and access to, a Streamotion Service indicates your acceptance of these Terms (and any changes to them). 

Changes
 
3.   &nbsp.
These Terms and any Subscription Fee are subject to change by Streamotion on 21 daysâ notice to you.

4.   &nbsp.
The Streamotion Services, including content that is made available to watch via the Streamotion Services, is updated regularly and may change from time to time.
Where we make a material change to the Streamotion Service which has a detrimental impact, we will provide you with 21 daysâ notice prior to making that change where reasonably practicable.
A change for which we will endeavour to provide you notice under this clause 4 includes removing a channel without providing a similar replacement channel or reducing the price you pay.
If it has a detrimental impact to you, you may cancel your subscription to the Streamotion Service in accordance with clause 33 below.

6.   &nbsp.
Users of a Streamotion Service are responsible for all costs arising from the use of the Streamotion Service including, without limitation, all subscription, browsing/data charges and internet costs.
Subscription Fees do not include data costs that are dependent on how much and how you download content and your agreement with your provider.
Please contact your ISP or carrier network provider about these costs. 
7.   &nbsp.
You must ensure, before you subscribe to a Streamotion Service, that your internet connection speed is appropriate for streaming audio-visual content and that your personal computer, tablet, mobile devices, operating system and any other associated connected equipment or property (including your television) are compatible and satisfy all other technical requirements as set out at the Help Page of the Streamotion Service.&nbsp.
Streamotion software may vary by device and medium, and functionalities and features may also differ between devices.  
8.   &nbsp.
The number of concurrent streams you can use across your devices to view a Streamotion Service at any one time (concurrent streams) will depend on your Subscription Plan and you cannot use more than the stated number of concurrent streams. 
9.   &nbsp.
A Streamotion Service (or a particular Subscription Plan) may implement a limit on the number of devices that may be registered to your account at any one time.&nbsp.
Streamotion may monitor the number of devices registered to a Streamotion account in order to prevent account sharing.  
10.&nbsp.

47.&nbsp.
To the extent permitted by applicable law, you unconditionally and irrevocably:

and 
b)   &nbsp.
waive, and will obtain all other necessary unconditional and irrevocable written waivers of, all moral rights. 

Competitions
 
48.&nbsp.
Terms and conditions of entry for any promotion or competition (Competition Terms) conducted via a Streamotion Service will be accessible on the Streamotion Service.
You should read those Competition Terms in conjunction with these Terms. 

Liability
 
49.&nbsp.
You will be responsible for all actions and omissions of any person who uses your Streamotion Service account or a Streamotion Service you subscribe to. 
50.&nbsp.
Nothing in these Terms excludes, restricts or modifies any rights that you have under existing laws or regulations and codes, including the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) and fair trading laws.
The Streamotion Service provided to you under these Terms comes with guarantees that cannot be excluded under the Australian Consumer Law set out in Schedule 2 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth).
For major failures with the Streamotion Service, you are entitled: 
Â·     &nbsp.
to cancel your Streamotion Service contract with us.
and 
Â·     &nbsp.
to a refund for the unused portion, or to compensation for its reduced value. 
You are also entitled to be compensated for any other reasonably foreseeable loss or damage.
If the failure does not amount to a major failure you are entitled to have problems with the Streamotion Service rectified in a reasonable time and, if this is not done, to cancel your contract and obtain a refund for the unused portion of the contract. 
51.&nbsp.
Apart from any rights you have that cannot be lawfully excluded, we do not make any promises or assurances to you about a Streamotion Service and/or these Terms.
To the maximum extent permitted by law, all other terms, conditions and warranties, whether express or implied by legislation or the common law or otherwise relating to the provision by us of a Streamotion Service, or otherwise in connection with these Terms, are expressly excluded. 
52.&nbsp.
Where permitted under local law, including the Australian Consumer Law, the liability, excluding any liability arising from gross negligence, wilful misconduct and/or fraud, of Streamotion, its related bodies corporate, suppliers, agents and contractors for any breach of a term or condition implied by law is limited at Streamotionâs discretion, to the supply of any service again or the payment of the cost of having any service supplied again.&nbsp.
However, Streamotion cannot limit its liability in this manner if you establish that it would not be fair or reasonable for Streamotion to do so. 
53.&nbsp.
Except where we have breached any of your rights under the Australian Consumer Law or any other applicable legislation which cannot be lawfully excluded or limited, we are not responsible in any way for any indirect or consequential loss that arises out of or in connection with this Agreement, the or the Streamotion Service. 
54.&nbsp.
The information within a Streamotion Service is not comprehensive and is intended only to provide a summary of the subject matter covered.
Streamotion does not undertake to keep the Streamotion Services up-to-date and is not liable to you or any other person for any loss or disappointment suffered if a Streamotion Service or content within it is not available or the content within the Streamotion Service is incorrect, incomplete or not up-to-date.
You must make your own assessment of it and rely on it wholly at your own risk. 
55.&nbsp.
In addition to any rights against you that we may have under these Terms, you will be liable to Streamotion and must keep us, our related bodies corporate, suppliers, agents and contractors indemnified against any loss, cost, expenses, damage or other liability (including legal costs on a solicitor/client basis) arising out of any claim or demand against us by you or any person other than you, which arises from or is connected with our supply or removal of a Streamotion Service to you or your use of a Streamotion Service, unless and to the extent that any loss, cost, expense, damage or other liability is caused by or contributed to our, our related bodiesâ, suppliersâ, agentsâ or contractorsâ wilful default, negligence or breach of these Terms or any law. 
56.&nbsp.
You agree to fully indemnify and hold harmless Streamotion and its related bodies corporate, suppliers, agents and contractors against any and all liabilities, claims (actual, threatened or potential), loss (including consequential loss) and damage incurred in connection with and arising from: 
a)   &nbsp.
your use of or access to a Streamotion Service in breach of these Terms.
or 
b)   &nbsp.
User Generated Material which you post, upload, communicate or otherwise make available. 
This indemnity will survive these Terms and your use of the Streamotion Services.
