What is Tree Topâs Childrenâs Privacy Policy?

Some portions of our website may be directed to children under age thirteen (13).
Submission and use of personally identifiable information about children under age 13 is governed by the federal Childrenâs Online Privacy Act (âCOPPAâ) and supporting regulations.
We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 on our website, except as provided by law.
We sometimes offer promotions on our website, such as contests, sweepstakes and games, as well as interactive activities to allow users to share experiences or express opinions.
We may permit a child to enter promotions directed to children or to submit interactive content by submitting a first name and email address only, along with the name and email address of the childâs parent.
We then notify the parent about the childâs entry and offer the parent an opportunity to withdraw the entry and remove the submitted information from our database.
If the parent permits the childâs participation in the promotion and the child wins, we contact the parent (not the child) for further information needed for any prize delivery.
Unless the parent has explicitly consented, we do not use the childâs personally identifiable information for any purpose other than to complete the promotion, nor do we share the information with third parties except as described above.
We do not retain the childâs or the parentâs personally identifiable information in our database unless the parent has given us permission to do so.
We permit children under the age of 13 to contact us through the website âContact Usâ link with questions or comments.
We request only the childâs first name and email address and use that information solely to respond directly to the child on a one-time basis.
We do not use the information to contact the child again and we delete the childâs personal information from our database after responding to the one-time inquiry.
Upon proper identification, a parent may review any personal information we have collected from or about the child to the extent such information has been retained in our database.
The parent also may request that the childâs information be deleted from our database and may refuse to permit further collection or use of that information.
If you are a parent and wish to exercise these rights, please contact us as described below.
