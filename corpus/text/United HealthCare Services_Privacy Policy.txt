The purpose of this policy is to let you know how we handle the information collected through the use of this website.
Portions of this website may describe privacy practices applicable to specific types of information or to information provided on specific web pages.
This policy does not apply to information collected through other means such as by telephone or in person, although that information may be protected by other privacy policies.
As used in this policy, terms such as âwe,â âus,â âour,â and âCompanyâ refer to UnitedHealthcare and its current and future affiliated entities, including our parent company UnitedHealth Group.
This website is intended for a United States audience.
Any information you provide, including any personal information, will be transferred to and processed by a computer server located within the United States. Cookies and Tracking The Company may use various technologies, including cookies, tokens, tags, web logs, web beacons, scripts, and web server logs to gather automatically collected information and may aggregate this information from our website visitors or to enable certain features of our website.
This information may include demographic data, technical information about the technology (e.g., phone, computer) used to connect to our website, web browser information, your IP address, and browsing behavior such as pages visited and how often they are visited (âActivity Informationâ).
We may also use third-party analytics companies to provide these services.
We may also allow third-party service providers to use cookies and other technologies to collect information and to track browsing activity over time and across third-party websites such as web browsers used to read our websites, which websites are referring traffic or linking to our websites, and to deliver targeted advertisements to you.
We do not control these third-party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies.
For more information about third-party advertising networks and similar entities that use these technologies, see www.aboutads.info/consumers, and to opt out of such ad networksâ and servicesâ advertising practices, go to www.aboutads.info/choices and www.networkadvertising.org/choices.

Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into our website, you may still receive advertisements even if you opt out of tailored advertising.
In that case, the ads will just not be tailored.
Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links and are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.
Activity Information is captured using various technologies and may include cookies.
âCookiesâ are small text files that may be placed on your computer when you visit an Online Service or click on a URL.
Cookies may include âsingle-session cookiesâ which generally record information during only a single visit to a website and then are erased, and âpersistentâ cookies which are generally stored on a computer unless or until they are deleted or are set to expire.
