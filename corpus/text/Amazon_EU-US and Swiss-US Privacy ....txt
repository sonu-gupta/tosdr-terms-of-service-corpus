 Security and Privacyâº EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield  EU-US Privacy Shield Framework 

 We do not rely on the Privacy Shield but continue to keep to the commitments below that we made when we certified to the Privacy Shield.

Amazon.com, Inc.
and certain of its controlled US affiliates (together, the Amazon Group Companies, or "We") participate in the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries, the United Kingdom and Switzerland.
We have certified with the Department of Commerce that we adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles.
To learn more about the Privacy Shield Principles, visit here.
If you have any inquiries or complaints about our handling of your personal information under Privacy Shield, or about our privacy practices generally, please contact us at: privacyshield@amazon.com.
We will respond to your inquiry promptly.
If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third-party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.
If neither Amazon nor our third-party dispute resolution provider resolves your complaint, you may pursue binding arbitration through the Privacy Shield Panel.
To learn more about the Privacy Shield Panel, visit here.
As explained here and here we sometimes provide personal information to third parties to perform services on our behalf.
If we transfer personal information received under the Privacy Shield to a third party, the third party's access, use, and disclosure of the personal information must also be in compliance with our Privacy Shield obligations, and we will remain liable under the Privacy Shield for any failure to do so by the third party unless we prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
You can review our Privacy Shield registration here.
The Amazon Group Companies are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
We may be required to disclose personal information that we handle under the Privacy Shield in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
