For more general information about privacy at 8Ã8, please see the 8Ã8 Privacy Notice.&nbsp.
The meet.jit.si Privacy Notice replaces the âWhat personal information does 8Ã8 collect and why?â section of the 8Ã8 Privacy Notice.

What is meet.jit.si?

8Ã8 is the main contributor to the Jitsi.org open-source video meetings solution.&nbsp.
Meet.jit.si is an application of the Jitsi.org open-source video meetings solution that 8Ã8 hosts, which allows users to hold free video meetings.

In some cases, meeting related content, which may contain personal information, is temporarily stored to enable user functionality in a meet.jit.si video meeting.&nbsp.

If you use the chat function, chat content is stored during the meeting.
If you record a meeting, the recording of the meeting is temporarily stored until it is uploaded to your file hosting service (e.g.
DropBox).
If you livestream your meeting, video content is temporarily stored to buffer the livestream.
In addition, users of meet.jit.si have the option of providing name, email address, and link to a picture that will be displayed to participants in the meeting.


How is this information used?

8Ã8 is not in the business of selling personal information to third parties.&nbsp.
