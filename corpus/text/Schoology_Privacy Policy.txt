Internet Privacy &amp.
Security 
Schoology and your school work together to protect the online privacy of all of your school community members that use Schoology, including students, parents, teachers, and administrators.
This privacy policy and Schoologyâs information collection and security practices have been authorized by your school or teacher, and Schoology strives to manage your school's internet services in a secure manner.
For example, Schoology uses industry-standard technology called SSL (Secure Socket Layer).
SSL encrypts information transmitted across the internet to and from Schoology.
You will know that SSL is working when you see the presence of an image of a closed lock or solid key in the bottom bar of your browser window.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure and âhacker-proof,â and Schoology cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information managed by the site, whether transmitted to Schoology by you, your school, or your teacher.
Schoology shall not be liable if a security breach occurs, if the site malfunctions, or if information is misused or mismanaged in any way to your detriment or the detriment of a third party, whether by Schoology, your school, your teacher, or an unauthorized third party.

This policy is designed to comply with PIPEDA.
