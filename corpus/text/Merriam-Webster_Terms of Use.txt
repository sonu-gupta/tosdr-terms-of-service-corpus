BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER
This section applies to any dispute EXCEPT DISPUTES RELATING TO THE ENFORCEMENT OR VALIDITY OF MERRIAM-WEBSTER'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.
The term âdisputeâ means any dispute, action, or other controversy between you and Merriam-Webster or its directors, officers, shareholders, parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, licensors or content providers concerning the Services or this Agreement, whether in contract, warranty, tort, statute, regulation, ordinance, or any other legal or equitable basis.
âDisputeâ will be given the broadest possible meaning allowable under law.

Binding arbitration. Any dispute will be conducted exclusively by binding arbitration governed by the U.S.
Federal Arbitration Act.
You are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in as a party or class member) all disputes in court before a judge or jury.
Instead, all disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final and binding.
Any court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitrator's award.

Class action waiver.
Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis.
Neither you nor Merriam-Webster will seek to have any dispute heard as a class action, private attorney general action, or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity.
No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings.

Arbitration procedure.
Any arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (the âAAAâ) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules.
If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you.&nbsp.
For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in Chicago, Illinois, United States of America, and you and Merriam-Webster agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located there, in order to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.&nbsp.
The arbitrator's award shall conform with these Terms of Use, including without limitation the Limitation of Liability set forth above.

Claims or disputes must be filed within one year.
To the extent permitted by law, any claim or dispute must be filed within one year. &nbsp.
The one-year period begins when the arbitration notice first could be filed.
If such a claim or dispute is not filed within one year, it shall be permanently barred.

Survival. The provisions of these Terms of Use which by their nature should survive the termination of these Terms of Use shall survive such termination.

Waiver. No waiver of any provision of these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such provision or any other provision, and your or our failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

Entire Agreement. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between Merriam-Webster and you, superseding any prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic). Section 2.
