Governing Law and Jurisdiction.


With respect to Customers domiciled in North America, South America, or Australia, this Agreement shall be construed and governed in accordance with the laws of the State of California and the United States, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of laws thereof and without regard to the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.
The competent state or federal courts San Francisco, California shall have sole and exclusive jurisdiction over all disputes between the Parties, and the Parties further agree and submit to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of such courts for litigating any such claim or action.

In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover costs and attorneysâ fees.





Severability. Should any term of this Agreement be declared void or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, such declaration shall have no effect on the remaining terms hereof.



No Waiver.
The failure of either party to enforce any rights granted hereunder or to take action against the other party in the event of any breach hereunder shall not be deemed a waiver by that party as to subsequent enforcement of rights or subsequent actions in the event of future breaches.



Injunctive Relief. Since a breach by a Party of any of its confidentiality obligations contained herein or any unlawful action made in connection with a Partyâs Intellectual Property Rights, may result in irreparable and continuing damage to the other party, for which there may be no adequate remedy at law, the breaching Party acknowledges and agrees that money damages will not be a sufficient remedy for any such breach or actions, and therefore the damaged Party will be entitled, in addition to money damages, to seek specific performance and injunctive relief and any other appropriate equitable remedies in connection therewith.&nbsp.
