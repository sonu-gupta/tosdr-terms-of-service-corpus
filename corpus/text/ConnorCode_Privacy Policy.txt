Connor Code Home Writing About Source 
 ð About Me Good evening, I'm Connor Slade.
I am just some random kid with way too much free time.
Anyway, welcome to my website connorcode.com V6.0.0! 
 I'm interested in Photography, Software development and some Web development.
My favorite The Best programming language is Rust! Like just look at the cute mascot.
I use it for most of my projects.
In fact, I'm hosting this site with Rust and my dependency free web server framework afire.

 I started my programming journey around 2014 with C++ on the Arduino.
Then I learned how to make basic websites with HTML and CSS, and then how to make it interactive with JavaScript.
After that, I learn Python and eventually started to learn much more including Docker, NodeJS, Nim, Assembly, C#, Java, Kotlin, Ruby, Lua and of course Rust.
It turns out, after getting the fundamentals picking up other languages is not too hard ð.
