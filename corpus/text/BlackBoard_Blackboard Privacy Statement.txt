 Introduction 
We care about privacy. We believe that privacy is a fundamental right for all individuals.
Our clients entrust us with the personal information of their employees and their users, who are often students.
We take the obligations that are attached to this information very seriously.
We therefore have a dedicated data privacy program with privacy by design at heart.
You can learn more about our data privacy program by visiting our Privacy Center.
Our business model is different from that of companies that collect your personal information to monetize such data.
We collect and use personal information to allow us to provide our products and services to our clients and end users.
In most cases, we do this at the direction of our clients.
We do not and will not sell or rent your data to third parties unless this is required in the context of changes to our business structure such as a merger or acquisition.
See Vendors, partners &amp.
other types of disclosures for more details on how we may disclose personal information in the context of changes to our business structure.
We are a proud signatory of the Privacy Pledge 2020, and a member of the Future of Privacy Forum.
