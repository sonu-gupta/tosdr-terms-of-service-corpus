Any person who knowingly misrepresents that the material or activity is infringing, shall be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneysâ fees, incurred to the alleged infringer, to any copyright owner, copyright ownerâs authorized licensee or to Novelty, who is injured by such misrepresentation.
