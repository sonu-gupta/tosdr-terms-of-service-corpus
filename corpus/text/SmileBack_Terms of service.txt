or (ii) the greater of ten (10%) percent or $50.

If SmileBack is required to use a collection agency or attorney to collect money owed by you, you agree to pay the reasonable cost of collection.
These collection costs include, but are not limited to, any collection agencyâs fees, reasonable attorneysâ fees and court costs.

i.

Dispute resolution 
Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with SmileBack and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.

Except for small claims disputes in which you or SmileBack seek to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county of your billing address or disputes in which you or SmileBack seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, you and SmileBack waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms, our Service or Site resolved in court.
Instead, all disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms, our Service or Site will be resolved through confidential binding arbitration held in New Castle County, Delaware in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (â
Rules
â) of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (â
JAMS
â), which are available on the JAMS website and hereby incorporated by reference.
You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS or waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.

You and SmileBack agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms, our Service or Site is personal to you and SmileBack and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.

You and SmileBack agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.
Â§ 1, et seq.
(the âFAAâ), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.
As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court.
provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms.
The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individualâs claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.
If you are an individual, you and SmileBack agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee and SmileBack will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs.
You and SmileBack agree that the state or federal courts of the State of Washington and the United States sitting in King County, Washington have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.
ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR OUR SITE OR SERVICE MUST BE FILED WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER SUCH CLAIM AROSE.
OTHERWISE, THE CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED, WHICH MEANS THAT YOU AND SMILEBACK WILL NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASSERT THE CLAIM. 22.
Governing law, jurisdiction and venue These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware, without reference to its choice of law principles to the contrary.
The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
For any action to compel arbitration or enforce an arbitration award or seek injunctive relief pursuant to these Terms, the parties hereby expressly consent to the jurisdiction and venue of the state and/or federal courts in and/or for New Castle County, Delaware, USA, and each party hereby expressly waives any objection to such venue based upon forum non-conveniens or otherwise. 23.
Force majeure Neither party shall be liable for any delay in performing its obligations if such delay is caused by circumstances beyond the partyâs reasonable control, including, without limitation, any delay caused by any act or omission of the other party, acts of God, war, terrorism, floods, windstorm, labor disputes, or delay of essential materials or services.
The delayed party shall promptly notify the other party of the reasons for and the likely duration of the delay, whereupon an extension of time equal to the period of delay, but not greater than thirty (30) days, shall be granted to the delayed party.
If the period of the delay shall exceed thirty (30) days, then the non-delayed party may cancel further performance of the delayed obligation, without any penalty whatsoever.
This paragraph shall not apply to any payment obligations. 24.
Term and survival Your agreement to be bound by these Terms commences with your visiting or using this Site, registering to use or using the Service, or otherwise submitting information through this Site or the Service, and your agreement to be so bound will continue until your right to use this Site and/or the Service is either canceled or terminated.
The following provisions will survive cancellation or termination: Sections 1, 7, and 9 through 24.
If, following the cancellation or termination of your right to use this Site and/or the Service, you visit or use this Site, register to use or use the Service, or otherwise submit information through this Site or the Service, then you again agree to be bound by these Terms. 25.

The failure of SmileBack to require performance of any obligation under these Terms will not affect our right to enforce any provision of these Terms at a subsequent time, and the waiver of any rights arising out of any breach will not be construed as a waiver of any rights arising out of any prior or subsequent breach.
