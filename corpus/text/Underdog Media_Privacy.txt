Underdog Media provides this privacy policy to online consumers regarding how our Technology (https://udmserve.net) collects and uses consumer data.

This policy also covers privacy practices and data collection on our marketing website ( https://underdogmedia.com) and our Publisher Dashboard (https://underdogmedia.com/login/).

Privacy Practices 

Underdog Mediaâs Publisher monetization products place digital advertising from our Marketing partners on our Publishersâ websites via our ad placements.
 As a part of this process we record information that an ad was requested or delivered to the webpage.&nbsp.
This information does not include any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and is used for reporting and accounting purposes.

Data Our Technology Collects through Client Websites via udmserve.net 


Personally and Non-Personally identifiable information

 This type of information or PII typically includes things like: your name, email address, phone number, mailing address or social security number.&nbsp.

As part of our efforts to identify this type of online fraud, Underdog Media will analyze Log Data for a period of 7 days, while our systems look for signatures of suspicious activity.
 After the 7-day period Log Data is then deleted.&nbsp.
Some examples of Log Date include: the referring http location from the page our Underdog Media ad placement or technology was placed, the IP Address, browser type, operating system, and a timestamp of these related events.
