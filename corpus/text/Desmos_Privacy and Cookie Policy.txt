If you create an account on the Desmos Services, or communicate with Desmos, you may provide to Desmos certain information by which someone could personally identify you, such as your name, email or unique username (âPersonally Identifiable Informationâ), as well as information about yourself such as your employment or level of schooling by which someone could not personally identify you (âDemographic Informationâ).
When we link Demographic Information to your Personally Identifiable Information, we treat all of it as Personally Identifiable.
We also collect information when you save or post content to the Service (âUser Contentâ), authorize us to access your device camera and photo roll, and communicate with us.
We refer to all of this data collectively as âPersonal Dataâ.
We may also collect Personal Data about you from a third party Internet site or service.
For example, if you login to your Desmos account through Google or another authentication tool, or if you interact with Desmos on social media, we may collect the Personal Data you authorize that third party service to share.
