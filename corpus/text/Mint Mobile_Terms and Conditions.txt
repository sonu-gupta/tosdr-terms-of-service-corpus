These Terms and Conditions (âT&Csâ) are part of your service agreement with Mint Mobile and constitute a contract under which we provide you Service under terms and conditions that you accept.
Your service agreement (âAgreementâ) with us includes (i) these T&Cs, (ii) our website Terms of Use located at mintmobile.com/site-terms-of-use, (iii) our Privacy Policy located at mintmobile.com/privacy-policy, (iv) our Acceptable Use Policy located at mintmobile.com/acceptable-use-policy, (v) any subscriber agreement or transaction materials that you sign or accept, (vi) the service plan(s) that you choose as set forth in our written services and transaction materials that we provide or refer you to during the sales transaction (if your service plan is not specifically set forth in any printed materials, the requirements and terms set forth in the current written services and transaction materials apply, excluding plan charges and number of minutes included in your service plan), (vii) any confirmation materials that we may provide to you, (viii) the terms set forth in any applicable coverage map brochures, and (ix) any other supplemental terms and conditions that we provide or otherwise make available to you.
In the event of a conflict between these T&Cs and any other materials that makeup the Agreement, these T&Cs shall govern to the extent necessary to resolve the conflict.

Please read these T&Cs carefully. They cover important information about our services provided to you (âServiceâ).
your phone, handset, device, SIM card, data card, or other equipment or third party device used with our Service (âDeviceâ).
and any access and usage charges, taxes, fees, assessments, and other charges we bill you or that were accepted or processed through your Device (âChargesâ). These T&Cs include terms regarding service plan changes and late payments, limitations of liability, privacy and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.

You and any authorized users on your account will have access to account information and may be able to make changes to the account. If you give your personal account validation information to someone, they can access and make changes to your account. Those changes will be binding on you.
Authorized changes may require your agreement to new T&Cs.


Acceptance.
YOUR AGREEMENT WITH MINT MOBILE STARTS WHEN YOU ACCEPT.
You represent that you are at least the age of majority in your state of residence (twenty-one (21) years old or legally emancipated if you are a Puerto Rico customer) and you are legally authorized to enter into this Agreement.
You accept your Agreement by doing any of the following: (a) giving us a written or electronic signature, or telling us orally that you accept.
(b) activating Service.
(c) using your Service after you make a change or addition.
or (d) paying for the Service or a âMint Mobile Deviceâ (a Device purchased from Mint Mobile, a Mint Mobile dealer, or other Mint Mobile authorized retailer (âDealerâ) for use with the Mint Mobile Service). IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO ACCEPT, DO NOT DO ANY OF THESE THINGS.


Dispute Resolution and Arbitration.
MINT MOBILE AND YOU AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW (AND EXCEPT AS TO PUERTO RICO CUSTOMERS), ANY AND ALL CLAIMS OR DISPUTES IN ANY WAY RELATED TO OR CONCERNING THE AGREEMENT, OUR SERVICE, DEVICES OR PRODUCTS, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL, NON-REPRESENTATIVE, BASIS. This includes any claims against other parties relating to Service or Devices provided or billed to you (such as our suppliers, Dealers or third-party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in the same proceeding.
Mint Mobile and you each also agree that the Agreement affects interstate commerce so that the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply (despite the choice of law provision in Section 22).
THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.
THE ARBITRATOR MUST FOLLOW THIS AGREEMENT AND CAN AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT (INCLUDING ATTORNEYSâ FEES).

For all disputes (except for Puerto Rico customers), you must first give us an opportunity to resolve your claim by sending a written description and supporting documentation of your claim to the address set forth in Section 12 below.
Mint Mobile and you agree to negotiate your claim in good faith.
If Mint Mobile and you are unable to resolve the claim within sixty (60) days after Mint Mobile receives your claim description and supporting documentation, you may pursue your claim in arbitration.
As an alternative to arbitration, Mint Mobile may choose to resolve billing disputes in small claims court in the county of your most recent billing address.
Mint Mobile and you agree that if you fail to timely pay amounts due, Mint Mobile may assign your account for collection, and the collection agency may pursue, in small claims court, claims limited strictly to the collection of the past due amounts and any interest or cost of collection permitted by law or the Agreement.

Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings. You must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent (see Section 12) to begin arbitration.
The American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ) will arbitrate all disputes.
For claims of less than Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars ($75,000.00), the AAAâs Consumer Arbitration Rules will apply.
for claims over Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars ($75,000.00), the AAAâs Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply.
The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org.
Upon filing of the arbitration demand, Mint Mobile and you will share equally all filing, administration and arbitrator fees for claims that total less than Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars ($75,000.00).
For claims that total more than Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars ($75,000.00), the payment of filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules.
An arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available in a court, including injunctive or declaratory relief and attorneysâ fees. Puerto Rico customers: Refer to Section 11 for details of the Puerto Rico Telecommunications Dispute Procedure.

CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
MINT MOBILE AND YOU AGREE THAT ANY PROCEEDINGS, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR COURT, WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR AS A MEMBER IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.
Neither you, nor any other customer, can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding against Mint Mobile.


JURY TRIAL WAIVER. If a claim proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, MINT MOBILE AND YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.

Your Service is subject to our business policies, practices, and procedures, which we can change without notice. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO CHANGE OR MODIFY THESE T&Cs, OUR SERVICES, DISCOUNTS, TECHNOLOGIES (INCLUDING CHANGES TO OUR NETWORK THAT MAY IMPACT YOUR DEVICEâS COMPATIBILITY), COVERAGE, OR ANY OTHER TERMS IN THE AGREEMENT AT ANY TIME AND YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL SUCH CHANGES OR MODIFICATIONS ON THE EARLIER OF WHEN WE (i) POST THEM ON THE MINT MOBILE WEBSITE, OR (ii) SEND THEM TO YOU (ELECTRONICALLY OR OTHERWISE).

Outages and interruptions in Service may occur, and speed of Service varies.
You agree we are not liable for problems relating to Service availability or quality.

7.
Important Emergency and 9-1-1 Information and Emergency Alerts.
When making a 9-1-1 call, always state the nature of your emergency and provide both your location and phone number, as the operator may not automatically receive this information. Mint Mobile is not responsible for failures to connect or complete 9-1-1 calls or if inaccurate location information is provided.
9-1-1 service may not be available or reliable and your ability to receive emergency services may be impeded. We or our network supplier may use a variety of information and methods to determine the location of a 9-1-1 call, including Global Positioning Satellites, our network supplierâs wireless network, the street address you have provided us as your primary use location (âPrimary Addressâ), or other information.
Even with this information, an emergency operator may not be able to locate you in order to provide emergency services.
Other third party entities are involved in connecting a 9-1-1 call and neither Mint Mobile nor its network supplier determines the public safety agency to which your 9-1-1 call is routed.
If you are porting a phone number to or from us, we may not be able to provide you with some Services, such as 9-1-1 location services, while the port is being implemented.
If you are porting a phone number to us, it is your obligation and responsibility to make certain that all information forwarded from the port out carrier is accurate and complete.
If you dial 9-1-1 while outside the U.S., 9-1-1 services may not be available.

8.
Service Plans.

8.1 General. Your Service will operate only after you have purchased and redeemed a Mint Mobile Service plan.
We may offer plans that can only be activated through the Mint mobile application (each, aâTrial Planâ).
Trial Plan access to the Mint Mobile service will cease according to the specific terms of your Trial Plan.
Trial Plans are not renewable and you must become a paid subscriber to the Mint Mobile service in order to continue your access to the Mint Mobile service.
For certain Trial Plans, you may only be able to transfer your mobile phone number from your existing carrier when you purchase a standard Mint Mobile service plan.
Visit our website located at mintmobile.com for specific details.
Mint will not transfer phone numbers from Trial Plans to a new carrier.
If you have activated any Trial Plan, you will not be able to transfer the phone number associated with that Trial Plan to a new carrier unless you convert your Trial Plan to a three, six, or twelve month plan.
For all other Mint Mobile service plans, airtime expiration is subject to the terms of your plan.
Your account may be canceled if your account balance remains at $0 for 60 consecutive calendar days or more.
To ensure uninterrupted service, you are required to renew your account before your airtime expires.
Please visit our website located at mintmobile.com for the latest information regarding our Service plans and Trial Plans.
8.2 Charges.
 You agree to pay all charges we bill you or that were accepted or processed through your Device. All Mint Service plans are measured on a 30-day cycle, except that 12-month plans are measured on 31-day cycles in even numbered months.
We may offer you the opportunity to set up automatic payments through the method of payment on your account will be automatically charged at the end of your applicable billing cycle (âAuto Renewâ).
When you enroll in Auto Renew, automatic payments for plan fees that you incur will continue until you cancel.
The recurring charge may vary if you change your plan or we change our prices, following notice to you.
You may cancel Auto Renew or review your payment preferences at any time by (i) contacting our customer service department at (800) 683 7392, or (iii) managing your account preferences on the Mint Mobile website.
You must change your Auto Renew preferences or cancel 24 hours prior to the end of your billing cycle in order for the change to go into effect.
No minimum purchase is necessary to enroll in Auto Renew.
For disputed charges, see Section 11.
You agree to provide us with accurate and complete billing information and to immediately report to us all changes to your billing information.
8.3 Voice Usage. Mint Mobile Service plans include a voice plan as part of your Service.
We round up any fraction of a minute to the next full minute.
Airtime usage is measured from the time the network provider begins to process a call (before the phone rings or the call is answered) through its termination of the call (after you hang up) and the network disconnects.
8.4 Data Usage and Messaging. Mint Mobile Service plans include a data plan (âData Planâ) as part of your Service.
Data usage is rounded up to the next full-kilobyte increment at the end of each data session.
Your data usage includes, among other things, text, web browsing, instant or picture messages, and email whether read or unread, sent or received, solicited or unsolicited.
We use filters to block spam messages, but we do not guarantee that you will not receive spam or other unsolicited messages, and we are not liable for such messages.&nbsp.
All data purchased through a Mint Mobile Service plan (both data that comes with a particular Mint Mobile Service plan and any additional data you purchase as an add-on), will expire immediately upon termination of your Mint Mobile Service plan for any reason.
8.5 Permissible and Prohibited Uses. Your Data Plan is intended for Web browsing, messaging, and similar activities on your Device and not on any other equipment.
Other uses, including for example, using your Device as a modem or tethering your Device to a personal computer or other hardware, may be permitted under your Data Plan, but are also subject to our Acceptable Use Policy located at mintmobile.com/acceptable-use-policy.
Examples of prohibited uses can be found in Section 14 of these T&Cs and in our Acceptable Use Policy.
8.6 Data Usage Level. Mint Mobile has set a 30-day 4G, 4G LTE and 5G data usage level (âUsage Levelâ) for each of the Mint Mobile Service plans.
Our network supplier measures your upload and download data usage (âActual Usageâ) to determine if your total Actual Usage, as aggregated over the applicable 30-day period (âUsage Totalâ), exceeds the 30-day 4G, 4G LTE and 5G Usage Level for the Service plan you selected.
Please note that âActual Usageâ includes all of your requests to upload or download data, whether or not such data is actually uploaded or downloaded, as well as network overhead.
For example, if you request that an image be downloaded to your Device or your Mobile HotSpot (tethering), but travel outside of your network coverage area before the download is complete, such request will be included in your Actual Usage even though the image was never downloaded to your Device.
If you purchased a Service plan that includes 3, 8, or 12GB of data in a 30-day Service period and you exceed your Service planâs 30-day Usage Level for high-speed data, Mint Mobile will reduce the data speeds to 128 kbps until the end of the applicable 30-day period.
If you purchased a Service plan that includes unlimited data and you exceed your Service planâs 30-day Usage Level of 35GB of high-speed data, Mint Mobile will reduce the speed at which you can send and receive data over the Mint Mobile network to 128 kbps until the end of the applicable 30-day period.
The initial reduction in your data speed depends upon your Service plan and can be found in the Mint Mobile FAQs.
If you continue to send and/or receive a substantial amount of data (as determined by Mint Mobile in its sole discretion) after our initial reduction of your data speed, we may further reduce your data speed to 64 kbps.
Once you begin a new 30-day period in your Service plan, your Service plan Usage Level will be reset and your upload and download speeds will be restored.
Please be aware that your Usage Level is much more likely to exceed your Service planâs 30-day Usage Level if you use streaming video, a Mobile HotSpot (tethering), or if you download significant quantities of music files, movies, software applications, or engage in other high-bandwidth activities.
8.7 Protective Measures. To provide a good experience for the majority of our customers and minimize capacity issues and degradation in network performance, we may take measures including temporarily reducing data throughput for a subset of customers who use a disproportionate amount of bandwidth.
If you use your Data Plan in a manner that could interfere with other customersâ service, affect our ability to allocate network capacity among customers, or degrade service quality for other customers, we may suspend, terminate, or restrict your data session, prioritize on-Device over Mobile HotSpot (tethering) traffic, or switch you to a more appropriate Data Plan which may result in an increased cost.
We also manage our network to facilitate the proper functioning of services that require consistent high speeds, such as video calling, which may, particularly at times and in areas of network congestion, result in reduced speeds for other services.
Additionally, we may implement other network management practices, such as caching less data, using less capacity, sizing video more appropriately for a Device to transmit data files more efficiently, and deploying streaming video optimization technology.
Streaming video optimization technology is intended to manage data usage on the network, reduce the risk of streaming video stalling and buffering, and reduce the amount of high-speed data consumption used for streaming video.
Streaming video optimization improves streaming video reliability as well as makes room for other users to enjoy higher browsing speeds.
The streaming video optimization process is agnostic as to the streaming video content itself and to the website that provides it, however, we may prioritize on-Device data over Mobile HotSpot (tethering) data.
While most changes to streaming video files are likely to be indiscernible, the optimization process may minimally impact the appearance of the streaming video as displayed on your Device.
These practices operate without regard to the content itself or the source of the content, and do not discriminate against offerings that might compete against those offered by us on the basis of such competition.
8.8 Wi-Fi Features. Mint Mobile, at its sole discretion, may make available Wi-Fi voice and text messaging services, i.e., the ability to originate and terminate calls and text messages over a Wi-Fi connection (âWi-Fi Calling).
If offered by Mint Mobile, Wi-Fi Calling will only be available for Mint Mobile customers that (i) have a Wi-Fi capable Mint Mobile Device with Mint Mobile supported Wi-Fi calling capability, (ii) have Wi-Fi Calling service provisioned on their account, (iii) have a compatible SIM card, and (iv) are connected to functioning third-party internet service.
Not all services available on Mint Mobileâs supplierâs network are available while using Wi-Fi Calling.
For example, emergency alerts may not be available with Wi-Fi Calling.
You acknowledge that calling 9-1-1 via Wi-Fi Calling uses the internet and operates differently than traditional 9-1-1 (see our complete 9-1-1 disclosure posted on the Mint Mobile website at mintmobile.com/911-disclosure).
For example, 9-1-1 may not work during power or internet outages or disruptions, or if internet or your Service is suspended.
Location information when using Wi-Fi Calling may be limited or unavailable.
If Mint Mobile makes Wi-Fi Calling available to you, you must provide us with your up-to-date, primary address.
If the location at which you primarily use Wi-Fi Calling changes, either temporarily or permanently, you must promptly update your address with Mint Mobile.
You may provide us with your primary address, or update your primary address, by contacting us at the email address, telephone number or mailing address specified in Section 12.
If you do not provide us with your primary address and update it promptly as described above, we or our network supplier may block your usage of certain Wi-Fi Networks.
When you call 9-1-1 over Wi-Fi away from your primary address, we and our network supplier may have no or very limited information about your location. NEITHER MINT MOBILE NOR ITS NETWORK SUPPLIER IS RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANYTHING RELATED TO YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE ANY WI-FI CALLING MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY FAILURE OF EMERGENCY CALLS (WHETHER 9-1-1 CALLS OR OTHERWISE).  Wi-Fi Calling may decrement Service plan minutes.&nbsp.
Most devices will not transition between Wi-Fi and the wireless network.&nbsp.
Devices using wireless connections may be vulnerable to unauthorized attempts to access data and software stored on the device.
8.9 Downloadable Content and Applications. Content or applications (e.g., downloadable or networked applications, wallpapers, ringtones, games, and productivity tools) (collectively, âContent &amp.

Check your Device to determine if you are Roaming.
There may be extra charges (including long distance, tolls, data usage) and higher rates for Roaming usage, and your quality and availability of service may vary significantly.

9.
International Long Distance / Global Text. 

9.1  General.  All international long-distance services included in your Service are handled by PLD, LLC (âPLDâ) and are delineated on your invoices separately from the services provided by Mint Mobile.
PLD is not affiliated with Mint Mobile.
9.2  International Roaming Credits.  Your Mint Mobile Service plan may include international roaming credits (âCreditsâ) that you can use for international roaming minutes or data without additional charge.
The amount of Credits that you receive in connection with your Service plan may be determined by us in our sole discretion, and additional details are available on our website.
Mint Mobile may allow you to store Credits in your account for use at a later time.
When your balance of Credits is zero, unless you add Credits to your account, you will not be able to use international roaming Service.
Please be aware that except as provided by these T&Cs, Mint Mobile will be under no obligation to offer any refunds or reimbursements for Credits that you receive from Mint Mobile.
Credits will be reclaimed by us should your account be terminated for any reason.
9.3 International texts.
âGlobal Textâ and âUnlimited Global Textâ means text or unlimited text only to applicable mobile-to-mobile destinations, and excludes audio, picture, and video messaging.&nbsp.
Data usage rates and charges may apply if you send audio, pictures, and/or video messages to an international mobile-to-mobile destination.

10.
Taxes, Fees and Surcharges. You are responsible for, and shall pay, the taxes, fees and surcharges set forth in Sections 10.1 â 10.5 below (âTaxes, Fees and Surchargesâ) in connection with your Service account.
Such Taxes, Fees and Surcharges will be included in your Service account charges (a) at the time you order the Service and (b) each time there are any further charges to your Service account.
Payment of Taxes, Fees and Surcharges is in addition to payment for the Service and will be billed to your credit card.
10.1 Recovery Fee. The Recovery Fee is assessed to help recover Mint Mobileâs costs to comply with various federal and state programs, taxes and fees including, but not limited to, (i) state and federal Telecommunications Relay Service Programs, (ii) Federal Universal Service Fund Program, (iii) international, federal, state, municipal, local and/or other governmental franchise, excise, public utility and other telecommunications taxes, fees and charges now in force or enacted in the future, and (iv) other costs we incur to comply with government regulations and programs, which are not taxes or fees that local, state or federal governments require Mint Mobile to collect.
For 3GB, 8GB and 12GB plans the Recovery Fee is calculated as a flat fee of $1.25 for a one-month plan.
$3.75 for a 3-month plan.
$6.75 for a 6-month plan.
and $11.75 for a 12-month plan.
For the âUnlimited dataâ plan, the Recovery Fee is calculated as a flat fee of $5.50 for a 3-month plan.
$8.75 for a 6-month plan.
and $16.25 for a 12-month plan.
A flat per transaction fee ($0.50 for service charges of $10.00 or less and $1.00 for service charges of $10.01 or more) may apply for non-plan service purchases (e.g., 4G LTE/5G data add-ons).
A flat fee per transaction of 2.5% will also be applied to help recover other administrative fees.
Although added to the overall charge, the Recovery Fee is separate from the cost of Service and the Recovery Fee shall not result in the purchase of any additional Service time.
We set the Recovery Fee, and the amount and what the Recovery Fee includes may change without notice.
10.2 Federal Universal Service Fund Fee. The Federal Universal Service Fund Fee is designed to recover Mint Mobileâs contribution to the Federal Universal Service Fund program.
The Federal Universal Service Fund Fee is used to fund programs to increase access to advanced telecommunications services for consumers in rural areas at reasonable rates and provides federal program funding.
Rate may change as determined by the Federal Communications Commission.
The Universal Service Administrative Company (âUSACâ) establishes a quarterly contribution factor, and Mint Mobile charges its customers the then-applicable rate charged to Mint Mobile by USAC.
10.3 State Universal Service Fund Fees.&nbsp.
The State Universal Service Fund Fee is designed to recover Mint Mobileâs contribution to various state universal service fund programs.
The State Universal Service Fund Fee is assessed as a percentage of intrastate revenues, gross revenues, or as a flat rate per line as set forth by the various state, county or municipal jurisdiction.
Certain state agencies establish a quarterly, semi-annual or annual contribution factor, and Mint Mobile may choose to charge its customers to recoup the state universal service fund fees charged to Mint Mobile.
10.4 Sales and Use Taxes. Sales and use taxes are assessed to allow Mint Mobile to recover the cost of all federal, state, municipal, local or other governmental sales and use taxes now in force or enacted in the future, that arise as a result of your subscription to, use of, or payment for Mint Mobile Service.
To determine sales and use taxes, we will use the street address you identified as your Place of Primary Use (âPPUâ).
The PPU for Puerto Rico must be in Puerto Rico.
If you did not identify the correct PPU, or if you provided an address (such as a PO box) that is not a recognized street address, does not identify the applicable taxing jurisdictions or does not reflect the Service area associated with your telephone number, you may be assigned a default location for tax purposes.
In the event of a disputed tax jurisdiction location being assigned, any tax refund must be requested within sixty (60) days of our notification to you that the tax has been assessed.
10.5 9-1-1 Fees. Each state, city, municipality, or county has specific charges that are levied for access to 9-1-1.&nbsp.
Determination of the applicable 9-1-1 charges depends on where you purchase Mint Mobile Service.&nbsp.
Mint Mobile may bill its customers for 9-1-1 charges.&nbsp.
Any such 9-1-1 charges are a monthly recurring charge assessed on a per line basis and will appear on your monthly invoice.

11.
