        Scope of these terms

ente ("Drizzle Technologies Private Limited", "we", "us") provides cloud storage with user-controlled encryption.
We provide services ourselves at our website at https://ente.io, subdomains and related sites ("website"), using our mobile apps ("mobile apps"), and our application programming interface (âAPIâ).
Using ente, you and other users can encrypt your files and data by way of user-controlled encryption ("UCE") with a key derived from your "password" (or "passphrase"), upload, access, store, manage, share, communicate, download and decrypt files and other data (all of which we call "data" in these terms) and give access to that data to others (all together, "services" and each, a "service").


These terms are binding and apply to any use of the services, website and our mobile apps by you and anyone who you allow to access your data or our services.
By using our services, the website or our mobile apps, you and they irrevocably agree to these terms.
If you do not like these terms or don't want to be bound, you can't use our services, the website or our mobile apps.
In particular, OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED SUBJECT TO CERTAIN DISCLAIMERS BY US AND UNDERTAKINGS BY YOU, INCLUDING AN INDEMNITY FROM YOU IF YOU BREACH THESE TERMS.


We can change these terms at any time by providing you at least 30 days' prior notice of the change, whether via our website, via our mobile apps, by sending you an email or via any messaging service we provide.
Your continued use after that notice means that you agree to the changed terms.
If you have paid for a subscription that is due to expire after that 30 day notice period and you do not wish to continue to use our services under the new terms, you may terminate your subscription before the new terms come into force.
We will then (but not otherwise) refund the unexpired portion of your subscription payment within 30 days and close your account.


If you comply with these terms, then we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license to access and use our services via the website, our mobile apps and our API if applicable, in accordance with these terms and any plan you have subscribed for.

Your data

If you allow others to access your data (e.g.
via any of the sharing features within ente), in addition to them accepting these terms, you are responsible for their actions and omissions while they are using our services and you agree to fully indemnify us for any claim, loss, damage, fine, costs (including our legal fees) and other liability if they breach any of these terms.


UCE is fundamental to our services.
This means that you, not us, have encrypted control of who has access to your data.
You should keep your password and Recovery Key safe and confidential.
You must not share your password with anyone else and should not release encryption keys to anyone else unless you wish them to have access to your data.
If you lose or misplace your password, you will lose access to your data.
Encryption wonât help though if someone has full access to your system or device.
We strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety and security of your system and devices (e.g.
via unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing and encrypting your devices).
We will never send you emails asking for your password.


You must maintain copies of all data stored by you on our services.
There could be a loss of data and we cannot guarantee that the services will be bug free.
You should download all data prior to termination of services.


We will store and process your data on our service subject to these terms and any plan you subscribe to.
If you choose to stop using our services, you must download your data first because we will schedule your uploaded files for deletion within the next 30 days.
We may still maintain minimal metadata about the now deleted files to ensure that clients who at one point had access to these files can render these deletions gracefully.
Post account-deletion we may also maintain your email address, IP address and user agent information in a hashed form to prevent an abuse of free trials.
If we suspend or terminate our services to you because you have breached these terms, or someone you have given access to has breached these terms, during the term of that suspension we may, if we wish, delete your data immediately or deny you access to your data but keep it for evidential purposes.
In circumstances where we cease providing our services for other reasons, we will, if we consider it appropriate, it is reasonably practicable and we are not prevented by law or likely to incur any liability in doing so, give you 30 days' notice to retrieve your data.

Your obligations

Once you have subscribed to a plan for our services (with payment having been made via the website, or one of our mobile apps, you need to pay the fees (if any) for that plan (and any other taxes or duties).
Your contract for services is with us and is governed exclusively by these terms and our policies referenced in these terms.
We can also change the fees for our services (other than those you have already contracted and paid for) at any time if we give you notice.
In the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement.


If at any time you do not make a payment to us when you are supposed to (including on termination), we can (and this doesn't affect any other rights we may have against you) suspend or terminate your use of the service.

MAKE YOUR PASSWORD A STRONG ONE AND KEEP IT SECURE.
We are not responsible if someone else gains access to your computer or other device and/or your ente password and/or encryption keys for any files.Intellectual PropertyOur IP

You are strictly prohibited from using our services to infringe copyright.
You may not upload, download, store, share, access, display, stream, distribute, e-mail, link to, communicate, transmit, or otherwise make available any files, data, or content that infringes any copyright or other proprietary rights of any person or entity.

a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and, under penalty of perjury (unless applicable law says otherwise), that you are authorised to act on behalf of the copyright owner.

We reserve the right to remove data alleged to be infringing without prior notice, at our sole discretion, and without liability to you.
In appropriate circumstances, we will also terminate your account if we consider you to be a repeat infringer.
Details of our designated copyright agent for notice of alleged copyright infringement are on our contacts page.
Copyright Counter-Notices

We process all takedown notices based on good faith acceptance of the representations from the party submitting the takedown notice.
We do not review the material before processing the takedown notice.


You may file a counter-notice if you believe that access to a file you have uploaded has been wrongly disabled because it was the subject of an incorrect takedown notice.
You should only do so if you are confident that no other party owns copyright in the material, or you have rights to store the material and, if you are sharing it, that you have the right to do so.


Please understand that:


21.1.
When we receive your counter-notice, we pass it, including your address and other contact information, to the party who issued the original takedown notice.
By submitting your counter-notice you authorise us to do so.
21.2.
Filing a counter-notification may lead to legal proceedings between you and the complaining party.
21.3.
There may be adverse legal consequences in India and/or your jurisdiction if you make a false or bad faith allegation by using this process.
21.4.
If, when using this counter-notice process, you make a false or bad faith allegation or otherwise breach these terms or any of our policies and that causes us any loss, costs (including legal costs), damages or other liability, we reserve the right to claim for and recover from you that loss, those costs (including full legal costs on a solicitor-client basis), damages and other liability, by deduction from any balance in our account and/or by proceedings in India and/or the jurisdiction of the address in your counter-notice.
21.5.
We provide this counter-notice process voluntarily for the purposes of all applicable copyright takedown and counter-notice regimes in India and other jurisdictions, but, in doing so, we do not submit to any jurisdiction, law, tribunal or court other than those of India, as set out in these terms.
We may amend, suspend or withdraw this counter-notice process at any time, provided that any counter-notices in train at that time shall continue to be processed.


By filing a counter-notice, you are deemed to have accepted the above terms.
If you do not accept the above terms, do not file a counter-notice.


To file a counter-notice with us, you must provide a written communication to copyright@ente.io that includes substantially the following:


23.1.
Identification of the specific URL(s) of material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled.
23.2.
Your full name, address, telephone number, email address and the name within your ente account.
23.3.
The statement: "I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled."
23.4.
The reasons for that good faith belief, sufficient to explain the mistake or misidentification to the person who filed the original takedown notice.
23.5.
The statement "I will accept service of proceedings in India or in the jurisdiction where my address in this counter-notice is located, from the person who provided Drizzle Technologies Private Limited with the original copyright takedown notice or an agent of such person."
23.6.
Signature.
A scanned physical signature or usual signoff in an email.
23.7.
You may also provide comments.


We will only accept a counter-notification directly from the user from whose account a folder or file has been disabled.
Counter-notifications must be submitted from the email address associated with the ente account.


If we do not receive any further communication from or on behalf of the person who originally submitted the takedown notice, or any communication we do receive does not in our sole opinion adequately justify the original takedown notice, we may, but shall not be obliged to, reinstate the material in approximately 10-14 days provided we have no reason to believe that the material infringes copyright.


Nothing in this counter-notice section prejudices our right to remove or disable access to any material at any time, for any reason or no reason.

Other Infringement Notices
If you consider there has been some other infringement or breach of law, or of these terms, and wish to file a complaint, contact us at the relevant address on our contacts page.
We will generally require the same amount of detail as set out above for copyright infringement notices.
See also our Takedown Guidance Policy.
Suspension and Termination

You can terminate your access to our services at any time by following the 'Cancel your account' link in the Account section of the website or the Settings section of our mobile apps or by writing an email to account-closure@ente.io from your registered account's email address.

We can immediately suspend or terminate your access to the website and our services without notice to you if you breach any of these terms or any other agreement you have with us.

All charges outstanding on your account must be paid at termination.

Severability and Waiver
If any provision of these terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.
If we do not enforce any right or provision of these terms or if we in any instance grant any concession or indulgence, that will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision or obligate us to grant any concession or indulgence to anyone else.
Force Majeure
We will not be liable by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of our obligations because of events beyond our reasonable control, which may include, without limitation, denial-of-service attacks, strikes, shortages, riots, insurrection, fires, flood, storm, explosions, acts of God, war, terrorism, governmental action, labour conditions, earthquakes, material shortages, extraordinary internet congestion or extraordinary connectivity issues or failure of a third party host, (each a "Force Majeure Event").
