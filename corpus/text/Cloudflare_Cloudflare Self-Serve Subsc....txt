If you permit third parties to access your Cloudflare account (e.g., by providing your API token or using OAuth), you do so at your sole risk and Cloudflare will not be directly or indirectly responsible or liable to you in any manner, for any harms, damages, loss, lost profits, special or consequential damages, or claims, arising out of or in connection with such permission.
You acknowledge that by permitting a third party to access your Cloudflare account, the third party may obtain, modify, or delete your account data and settings.
You agree to notify Cloudflare promptly of any actual or suspected unauthorized use of any Credentials.
Cloudflare reserves the right to terminate any Credentials that Cloudflare reasonably determines may have been accessed or used by an unauthorized third party and will provide immediate notice of such to you.

2.4 Subscription Terms, Renewals, and Cancellations
All Cloud Services that are provided to you as Paid Services (each a, âPaid Cloud Serviceâ) will be provided to you on a subscription basis for the length of term that you specified during the initial sign-up process (âSubscription Termâ).
All of your subscriptions to Paid Cloud Services will automatically renew for periods equal to your initial Subscription Term, and you will be charged at our then-current rates unless you cancel your subscription through the Cloud Servicesâ account dashboard prior to your next scheduled billing date.
2.5 Your Information
2.5.1
You and your End Users (as such term is defined in the Privacy Policy) will retain all right, title and interest in and to any data, content, code, video, images or other materials of any type that you or your End Users transmit to or through the Cloud Services (collectively, âYour Informationâ) in the form provided to Cloudflare.
Subject to the terms of this Agreement, you hereby grant us a non-exclusive, fully sublicensable, worldwide, royalty-free right to collect, use, copy, store, transmit, modify and create derivative works of your Your Information, in each case to the extent necessary to provide the Cloud Services.
2.5.2
You must obtain all necessary rights, releases and permissions to provide Your Information to Cloudflare, and Your Information and its transfer must not violate any applicable local, state, federal and international laws and regulations (âLawsâ) (including without limitation those relating to export control or electronic communications).

2.5.3
Cloudflare may modify certain components of Your Information on or transmitted to or from your website to enhance your websiteâs performance or security or the functionality of the Cloud Services.
For example, depending on the Cloudflare Services you select or the Apps that you enable, Cloudflare may: (i) intercept requests determined to be threats and take actions, such as, presenting them with a challenge page, dropping the request, presenting alternative content, redirecting and other similar measures.
(ii) add cookies to your domain to track visitors, such as those who have successfully passed the CAPTCHA on a challenge page.
(iii) add scripts to your pages to perform additional performance tracking.
(iv) add firewall rules to your website.

or (c) engage in any activities that are illegal, including disseminating, promoting or facilitating child sexual abuse material or engaging in human trafficking.
2.8 Limitation on Serving Non-HTML Content
The Services are offered primarily as a platform to cache and serve web pages and websites.
Unless explicitly included as part of a Paid Service purchased by you, you agree to use the Services solely for the purpose of (i) serving web pages as viewed through a web browser or other functionally equivalent applications, including rendering Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) or other functional equivalents, and (ii) serving web APIs subject to the restrictions set forth in this Section 2.8.
Use of the Services for serving video or a disproportionate percentage of pictures, audio files, or other non-HTML content is prohibited, unless purchased separately as part of a Paid Service or expressly allowed under our Supplemental Terms for a specific Service.
If we determine you have breached this Section 2.8, we may immediately suspend or restrict your use of the Services, or limit End User access to certain of your resources through the Services.

If however, directly applicable law prohibits enforcement of the foregoing, you may engage in Reverse Engineering solely for purposes of obtaining such information as is necessary to achieve interoperability of your own or third party software with the Software, and to the limited extent permitted by directly applicable law, but only if: (a) Reverse Engineering is strictly necessary to obtain such information.
and (b) you have first requested such information from us and we fail to make such information available (for a fee or otherwise) under reasonable terms and conditions.
3.3 Software Modifications
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, for any elements of the Software provided to you in source code form you may modify such source code solely to the extent necessary to support your permitted use of the Software (collectively, âModificationsâ).
Unless expressly stated otherwise, you may not distribute your Modifications to any third party.
Cloudflare has no support, warranty, indemnification or other obligation or liability with respect to your Modifications or their combination, interaction or use with our Cloud Services.

If Cloudflare makes a Third Party Product available to you, it is on an âAS ISâ and âAS AVAILABLEâ basis, and Cloudflare may cease providing it without entitling you to any refund, credit, or other compensation.
Each Third Party Product is governed by the terms of service, end user license agreement, privacy policies, and/or any other applicable terms and policies of the third party provider.
Your access or use of a Third Party Product is solely between you and the applicable Third Party Product provider.
Cloudflare will not be directly or indirectly responsible or liable to you in any manner, for any harms, damages, loss, lost profits, special or consequential damages, or claims, arising out of or in connection with the installation of, use of, or reliance on the performance of any of the Third Party Products.

Following any cancellation, however, you will continue to have access to the Paid Services through the end of your current Subscription Term.
We may, in our sole discretion, provide a refund, discount, or credit (âCreditsâ) to you in a specific instance, however the provision of Credits in a specific instance does not entitle you to Credits in the future for similar instances or obligate us to provide additional Credits.
4.4 Taxes
Unless otherwise stated, our charges do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments, including value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes assessable by any local, state, provincial or foreign jurisdiction (collectively âTaxesâ).
You are responsible for paying Taxes, except those assessable against Cloudflare as measured by our net income.
Unless you provide us with evidence of an exemption, we will invoice you for such Taxes if we believe we have a legal obligation to do so and you agree to pay such Taxes if so invoiced.
5.
Beta Services
From time to time, we may make early stage or non-production Cloud Services and Software (âBeta Servicesâ) available to you at no charge.
You may access these Beta Services in your sole discretion.
Beta Services are intended for evaluation purposes only, and may be subject to additional terms that will be presented to you at the time of sign-up.
Cloudflare may, but is not obligated to, provide you with support for the Beta Services or correct any bugs, defects, or errors in the Beta Services.
Unless otherwise stated, any Beta Services trial period will expire upon the earlier of one year from the trial start date or the date that a version of the Beta Services becomes generally available without the applicable Beta Services designation.
We may discontinue Beta Services at any time in our sole discretion and may never make them generally available.
Notwithstanding Section 12, we will have no liability for any harm or damage arising out of or in connection with any Beta Services.
6.
Data Processing and Security
6.1 Data Processing
If Your Information includes the personal data of European data subjects as those terms are defined by EU and UK Data Protection Laws, then Cloudflare is a data processor or sub-processor, as applicable, and Cloudflareâs Data Processing Addendum is incorporated by reference into this Agreement.
âEU and UK Data Protection Lawsâ means all laws and regulations of the European Union, the European Economic Area, their member states, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, applicable to the processing of Personal Data including (where applicable), the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection, the UK Data Protection Act and the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data).
6.2 Security
We implement security procedures to help protect Your Information from security threats.
However, you understand that your use of the Service necessarily involves transmission of Your Information over networks that are not owned, operated or controlled by us, and we are not responsible for any of Your Information that is lost, altered, intercepted or stored across such networks.
We cannot guarantee that our security procedures will be error-free, that transmissions of Your Information will always be secure or that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat our security measures or those of our third party service providers.

Indemnification
10.1 By Cloudflare
Cloudflare will defend you against any third party claim brought against you, to the extent that such claim is based on an allegation that a Paid Service, when used as authorized under this Agreement, infringes a United States or European Union patent or registered copyright (a "Claim"), and we will indemnify you against any damages and costs (including reasonable legal fees) finally awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction attributable to such a Claim or agreed to settlement by Cloudflare.
If any portion of a Paid Service becomes, or in Cloudflareâs opinion is likely to become, the subject of an infringement claim, Cloudflare may, at Cloudflareâs option: (a) procure the right for you to continue using the Paid Service.
(b) replace the Paid Service with non-infringing services which do not materially impair the functionality of the Paid Service.
(c) modify the Paid Service so that it becomes non-infringing.
or (d) terminate the Paid Service and refund any pre-paid subscription fees covering the remainder of the Subscription Term, and upon such termination, you will immediately cease all use of the Paid Service.
Cloudflare will have no obligation under this Section 10 or otherwise with respect to any infringement claim based upon: (w) any use of a Paid Service not in accordance with this Agreement or the applicable Cloudflare documentation.
any use of a Paid Service in combination with third party products or services not supplied by Cloudflare.
or (z) any modification of a Paid Service by any person other than Cloudflare or its authorized agents.

17.
Dispute Resolution and Arbitration
17.1 Generally
In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Cloudflare in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Cloudflare agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with this Agreement will be resolved by binding arbitration.
Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.
Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts.
Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.
Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of this Agreement, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of this Agreement.
YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND CLOUDFLARE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
17.2 Exceptions
Notwithstanding Subsection 17.1, we both agree that nothing herein will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.
17.3 Arbitrator
Any arbitration between you and Cloudflare will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures ("AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA.
The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.
17.4 Notice.
Process
A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail ("Notice").
Cloudflare's address for Notice is: Cloudflare, Inc., 101 Townsend St., San Francisco, CA 94107.
The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.
and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand").
We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Cloudflare may commence an arbitration proceeding.
17.5 Fees
Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in San Francisco, CA provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.
(ii) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.
or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.
If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
In such case, you agree to reimburse Cloudflare for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.
Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.
The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitratorâs ruling on the merits.
17.6 No Class Actions
YOU AND CLOUDFLARE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
Further, unless both you and Cloudflare agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one personâs claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
17.7 Modifications
In the event that Cloudflare makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to Cloudflare's address for Notice), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Cloudflare's address for Notice, in which case your account with Cloudflare will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject will survive.
17.8 Enforceability
If Subsection 17.1 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 17 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 17 will be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 13 will govern any action arising out of or related to this Agreement.
18.
Consent to Electronic Communications
By using the Service, you consent to receiving certain electronic communications from us as further described in our Privacy Policy.
