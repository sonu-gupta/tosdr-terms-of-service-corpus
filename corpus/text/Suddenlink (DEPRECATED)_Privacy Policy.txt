A cookie is a small encrypted computer code added to a file on your computer as a record of your visit.

We may use clear GIFs to track visitor preferences or to gather aggregated information about visitor usage patterns.
We do not use clear GIFs to collect Usersâ PII.

For example, we collect your IP address, the name and location of your Internet service provider, the type and version of your browser, the length of time you visit the Website, your search queries on the Website, and the average number of pages you viewed.
We use this log information for systems administration purposes and for technical troubleshooting.
We may also use it to gather general demographic information about you, such as your general location.



Information Collected From Children. Our Services and Website are not directed at, or intended for use by, children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect PII from anyone under the age of 13.
Children should always get permission from a parent or guardian before sending personal information over the Internet.

You can find more information about protecting children's privacy by contacting the FTC or viewing its website at www.ftc.gov.




HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION. We use the Information we collect for legitimate business activities, including: to provide and improve our Services.
to communicate with you.
to generate De-identified Information, and for advertising, marketing and recommendations purposes


To Provide and Improve Our Services. We use the Information we collect, including PII, to conduct business activities such as account administration, service provisioning, operations, billings and collections, marketing, analytics, customer service, technical support, network performance management, and fraud prevention.
These purposes may specifically include: 
establishing your account;
measuring credit and payment risk;
facilitating billing and collections functions and obligations (including any reporting to credit bureaus or collection agencies to obtain payment for our billed products and services);
authenticating access to your account;
account administration;
service delivery and optimization;
maintenance and operations, including management of the network and devices supporting our service and our systems;
technical support;
hardware and software upgrades for devices and systems;
understanding the use of the Service;
improving our Website and Services and identifying and developing new features, products and services;
providing you with programming, services and advertising that are of enhanced value and interest to you;
customer service, including processing and responding to your inquiries and troubleshooting;
internal analytics and reporting;
protecting our rights, personnel and property;
enforcing our legal rights, including under the Residential Services Agreement or Commercial Services Agreement (as applicable).
and
complying with applicable law.



To Communicate With You. We use the Information we collect to deliver and personalize our communications with you.
For example, we may use the PII you provide us to inform you of Service updates or the status of a service request or outages, as well as to invite you to participate in a survey, to collect amounts you owe, or in connection with other activities related to the Services or your account.

To Generate De-identified Information. We may use Customersâ PII to generate De-identified Information that cannot be reasonably linked to the Customer individually.
Subject to Section 8 below, our collection, use, and disclosure of De-identified Information is subject to our discretion and is not subject to any of the restrictions in this Policy.
For example, we may use De-identified Information for purposes such as measurement of viewership of programming and advertising, creation of tuning and viewing cohorts or segmentations, providing targeted content for our services or facilitating delivery of relevant third party advertising/promotional messages through our Services and on third party websites and other platforms.
However, we do provide you with the choice to opt out of the use of your De-identified Information to facilitate Targeted Third Party Advertising (see Section 5.c below).

To Provide Advertising, Marketing and Recommendations. We use the Information we collect about Customers and their use of the Services and cable system to make program and content recommendations, to send promotional communications about the Services or other Altice product and service offerings, and for other First Party Advertising and Third Party Advertising purposes.
These promotional communications and advertisements may be directed to you because you subscribe to the Services, because of the way you use the Services, or because you live in a certain geographic area, or may be based on demographic and interest information that we collect or obtain from other sources.
For example, we may use Information to facilitate the display of First Party Advertising to you on other websites, mobile applications and devices.
When we do this, we may provide service providers with access to certain PII in order to facilitate the creation of de-identified audiences (for example, based on IP address, cookie ID, device ID or other persistent identifiers) and the placement of Targeted First Party Advertising.
If you are a Video or internet subscriber, we may also use these service providers to create similar audiences based in part on de-identified viewing or usage data and/or the IP address(es) we assign to facilitate the sending of Targeted Third Party Advertising that we think may be of interest to you.
Our sharing of information to facilitate Targeted Third Party Advertising is described in Sections 4.b and 4.c below.
You can opt out of certain marketing messages as outlined in Section 5 below.

CPNI Data. Our use of VoIP Customersâ CPNI data is limited as described in Section 7.b below.

Geolocation Data. We use service address, device and/or access point location data for a variety of purposes, including to facilitate emergency services, provide our services and our location-based applications and services.
Where we offer our own location-based applications, we provide you with notice and choice about whether specific location-tracking features available on your device are turned on.
Many types of wireless applications and services use device location data, including applications provided by other companies and wireless device operating systems.
When you are considering new third party applications or services, you should carefully review the location-based services' or application providers' privacy policies to learn how they collect and use your information.

Retention of Information. We generally keep some or all Customer and User Information for as long as necessary for the purpose(s) for which it was collected or other business, tax or legal purposes.
When information is no longer needed or required to be maintained, we destroy or de-identify it in accordance with our internal policies.
If you are a California resident ("CA Resident") you have the right to request the deletion of the personal information we collect from you subject to certain exceptions as described in Section 7 below.



WHEN AND WITH WHOM WE SHARE INFORMATION
 


General Sharing Policy. Except as set forth below, Suddenlink will not share or disclose Customersâ PII to a third party unless it is necessary for us to render our Services or conduct a legitimate business activity related to the Services we provide to you, or the Customer provides appropriate consent in advance.

Service Providers. We sometimes provide access to Information, including PII, to third party service providers to assist us in providing Services or for other legitimate business purposes, including those described in Section 3.a.
For example, we may provide access to certain Information to companies providing services to us, including installation and repair, billing, call center, sales and marketing, market research, fulfilment, mailings, data storage, data scrubbing, data analytics and processing, bill collection, auditing and accounting, credit reporting, and legal services.
We may also provide access to third party data service providers who assist us in facilitating or providing targeted advertising by generating De-identified Information based on your PII.
These Service Providers are authorized to use your PII only as necessary to provide these services on our behalf.
We may also disclose PII to credit reporting agencies.

Altice Affiliated Businesses. We may share Information, including PII, with Altice affiliates that assist us in providing Services, such as Altice Technical Services, or that offer products and services under other brands, such as Altice Mobile, Cheddar and Optimum.
We do this either to provide and improve our Services as described in Section 3.a above or to better enable those affiliates to provide their products and services to you.
For example, if you are an existing or potential Altice Mobile customer we may share account information in order to confirm your eligibility for that service and/or make it easier to provide that service to you.
We may also share your information with other Altice affiliates for First Party Marketing purposes, provided that any required consent (such as with respect to the use of CPNI data) is obtained.
 We may also share Customer and Website User Information, including PII, with a successor company or other Altice entities in the event of a merger, acquisition or sale of all, or components of, our business.
 Our affiliate a4 works with third party advertisers to run cross-platform (tv, computer, tablet, mobile device) Targeted Advertising campaigns.
We may share De-identified Information, including device IDs, IP addresses or other unique IDs, with a4 to facilitate the creation of audience segments to receive this Targeted Third Party Advertising and for other advertising and marketing purposes.

Account Owners and Users. We may disclose any information about a Customerâs account and use of the Services and their features to the primary account owner after appropriate authentication.
The primary account owner may also authorize other users to access information on the account, and that may include data about you and your use of the Services.

Mailing List Information. If you subscribe to a non-voice Service offered over our cable system (e.g., Video or Internet), we may rely on a special provision of law that allows us to disclose mailing-list information about you to marketing organizations, programmers and other businesses.
Mailing-list information includes your name, addresses, and the non-voice services to which you subscribe (for example, basic tier, HBO).
You can opt-out of our disclosure of mailing list information as described in Section 5.d below.

CPNI and Subscriber List Information. If you subscribe to our VoIP service, applicable regulations allow us to disclose subscriber list information.
For example, we may give your name, address, and number to organizations who publish phone directories or who provide 411 services or similar public services.
We may transmit your name and number so that the person you call can see such information on his or her Caller ID.
Certain procedures allow you to block transmission of Caller ID information.
You may contact us to obtain additional information about these procedures.
We may also transmit your name, number, and registered location to a public safety answering point ("PSAP") when you dial 911 for emergency services.
Disclosure of CPNI data is subject to additional specific limitations, as described in Section 7.b below.

Authorized Parties With Your Consent. We may disclose PII about you to third parties with your consent.
We may obtain your consent through a variety of channels, such as in writing, online, on your phone, when you agree to terms of service, in our stores, or implicitly, for example, when you purchase a product and ask that it be shipped to your home, thereby consenting to our disclosure of your name and address to a third party shipping company to complete delivery.

Third Parties for Marketing Purposes. We do not and will not sell, license or rent Customersâ or Website Usersâ PII to unaffiliated third parties without the required consent to do so.
We may provide De-identified Information (which may include information about viewing habits, geolocation and system interaction) to third party advertisers, programmers audience measurement and research firms to provide more relevant programming, advertising and features, to improve the Services, to provide you with information or offers about products or services we believe may be of interest to you, or to assist third parties with media, programming and content planning, and purchasing efforts.
We may also share De-identified Information or aggregate Information with third parties for other uses of their own provided they commit not to re-identify the information.

When Required by Law or to Protect Altice or Others.

SPECIAL RULES AND RIGHTS UNDER FEDERAL LAW


Cable Act and PII. The Cable Act imposes limitations with respect to the collection and disclosure of personally identifiable information by cable operators, unless you provide us consent to collect or disclose information in another fashion, such as by accepting this Privacy Policy as part of the sign-up process for our Services.
Generally speaking, cable operators may not use the cable system to collect personally identifiable information concerning subscribers without their prior consent except to obtain information necessary to render our cable service or other services to our subscribers or to detect unauthorized reception of cable communications.
In addition, subject to certain specified exceptions, cable operators generally may not disclose personally identifiable information without consent of the subscriber concerned.
Also, cable operators must take such actions as are necessary to prevent unauthorized access to such information by a person other than the subscriber or cable operator.
If we violate your rights, you may be entitled to bring a civil action in a federal court, which may award actual, liquidated, and punitive damages, fees and costs, and other remedies that may be available.
In addition, if anyone asks us to provide information about you, we may have to notify you, and you may have the right to appear in court.

Communications Act and CPNI. Under federal law, you have a right as a VoIP Customer, and we have a duty, to protect the confidentiality of your CPNI data.
We restrict access to your CPNI.
For example, call detail records, which contain information about the calls you make are available online.
In order to access call detail records online, you must have a Suddenlink ID and password.
All other CPNI is restricted by requiring a password and/or by requiring that you provide certain non-public verification information over the phone to confirm your identity.
A written request may also be used to obtain your CPNI.
You must send the written request to Suddenlink at 200 Jericho Quadrangle, Jericho, NY 11753, Attn.
Shared Services - CDR.
All requests will be verified.
 Altice also restricts the use of your telephone CPNI.
Unless we have your appropriate consent, Altice does not share your telephone CPNI with non-affiliates for marketing purposes.
We may, however, use telephone CPNI or share de-identified information to tailor your service and to market related Optimum Voice products and services to you.



YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS. The California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA), Cal.
Civ.
Code Â§Â§ 1798.100-1798.199, requires that "Businesses" (as defined in the CCPA) provide CA Residents with information regarding the personal information collected, disclosed and sold about them.
The CCPA definition of personal information ("CA Personal Information") is broader than the definition of PII in Section 1.i above and may include information we collect when you use the Services or visit the Website, such as IP addresses, cookie IDs, and device IDs, to the extent such information is reasonably capable of being associated with or linked to a particular consumer or household.
We consider ourselves to be a Business with respect to the CA Personal Information we collect from Subscribers who are CA Residents when they provide it to us, use our Services, or visit our Website as described in Section 2 above.
We also consider ourselves to be a Business with respect to certain licensed demographic data we collect from third parties (see Section 2.c) as well as information we collect from non-Customer Users of the Website (see Section 2.d).
The CCPA provides CA Residents the right to know about the CA Personal Information collected, disclosed or sold about them by us as a Business, the right to request that we delete their CA Personal Information (subject to certain exceptions), and the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by us for exercising any of these privacy rights.

We do not sell Customersâ or Website Usersâ CA Personal Information.

Right to Know and Deletion Requests. CA Residents have the right to request that we disclose the categories and/or specific information of CA Personal Information we have collected about them, the categories of sources of that information, the business or commercial purposes for which the information was collected, and the categories of third parties with whom it was shared ("Right to Know Requests").
CA Residents also have the right to request that we delete the CA Personal Information that we have collected from them subject to certain exceptions, such as maintaining the information to continue to provide our services ("Deletion Requests").
 We will only be able to honor Right to Know and Deletion Requests for CA Residents whose identities we can verify, which is limited to current or former Customers.
We have no reasonable way to verify the identity of a CA Resident Website User who is not a current or former Customer, as the CA Personal Information we collect about these Users as a Business is limited to the information automatically collected on the Website as described in Section 2.d.
 CA Residents who are existing or former Customers, or their authorized agents (see Section 8.d below), may submit Right to Know and Deletion Requests by using the online form (available here), or may contact us at 1-806-418-8888.


Authorized Agents. CA Residents may use an authorized agent to submit a Right to Know or Deletion Request on their behalf provided that the CA Resident gives the authorized agent written permission to do so, the authorized agent submits verifiable proof of such written permission and their identity to us, and the CA Resident subsequently verifies to us that permission has been provided.
In the event a request is received by an authorized agent, we will follow up with both the agent and CA Resident seeking additional information to verify identities and ensure that a signed Authorized Agent permission form (available here) has been completed and submitted.

CCPA Questions. If you are a CA Resident or authorized agent with questions regarding your rights under the CCPA you may contact us at CCPA@alticeusa.com or at the mailing address set forth in Section 9 below.

Shine the Light Law (Cal.
Civ.
Code Â§ 1798.83). A separate California law requires that we provide CA Residents with notice and choice with respect to the disclosure of their personal information to third parties for marketing purposes.
If you request it, we will provide you with a notice of your right to prevent sharing of your personal information as well as a cost-free means of doing so.
You may request such a notice by submitting a written request to customer.service@suddenlink.net specifying that you seek your "California Customer Choice Notice." Please allow thirty days for a response.



CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY. We may change this Policy at any time.
We will notify you of material changes by posting the revised Policy on the website.
We encourage you to periodically review the Policy to inform yourself of any changes.
The revised Policy will be effective on the date it is posted unless the revised notice states otherwise.
You understand and agree that, if you use the Mobile Service after the effective date of the updated Policy, Altice will consider your use as acceptance of the updated Policy.
