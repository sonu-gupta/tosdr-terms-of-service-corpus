This privacy policy (âpolicyâ) describes the types of information that Bible Study Fellowship (âBSFâ) may collect from you or that you may provide when you visit one of our websites, which may include the following domains and any subdomains, bsfinternational.org, mybsf.org, bsfonline.org, wordgo.org, runwordgo.org, or access or use any of our applications, mobile applications, software, services, or platforms, which may include BSF classes or groups, BSF Online, Word in the City, WordGo, the WordGo app, and the BSF app (each individually a âSiteâ, and collectively the âSitesâ), and explains BSFâs practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information.
This policy also applies to information collected when you communicate directly with BSF (e.g., by email, electronic text, in writing, or submitting physical forms).
By using any of the Sites or communicating with BSF, you acknowledge that you have read and understand this policy and that you agree to be bound by the terms of this policy.
If you do not agree to the terms of this policy, then you should not use the Sites or provide information to BSF.
This policy may change from time to time, as described more fully in the âChanges to This Policyâ section below.
Your continued use of any of the Sites, or if you continue to provide information to BSF, after BSF makes changes to this policy constitutes your agreement to the changes to the policy.

Information BSF May Collect About You

BSF may collect Personal Information and Non-Personal Information from you when you use a Site or communicate directly with BSF.

This policy refers to Personal Information and Non-Personal Information collectively as âInformation.â

Examples of the types of sensitive information that BSF may collect include your gender, religious beliefs or affiliation, or health information related to any special accommodations you may require.
While certain types of sensitive information may be implied by the collection of other personal information, BSFâs policy is to collect sensitive information directly from you and does not maintain sensitive information not collected directly from you, and only discloses your sensitive information for purposes that are directly related to the reason you provided BSF with such sensitive information in the first place and where you would reasonably expect BSF to disclose such information.
BSF will not disclose your sensitive information for any other purpose without your consent unless BSF is legally required to disclose it, or BSF believes disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of BSF or its affiliates and subsidiaries, members, participants, others, or you.
This policyâs terms regarding Data Processing and Storage, and Data Security also apply to your sensitive information.
