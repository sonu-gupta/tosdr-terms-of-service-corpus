Rewards Programs
A.
Overview.
 The Company may offer one or more rewards programs (âRewards Programsâ) under which you may have the opportunity to receive points (in the Swagbucks.com program, such points are called âSBâ, and in the MyPoints.com program, they are called âPointsâ) or other credits (collectively, âRewardsâ) related to your participation in or interaction with various advertising, content, shopping opportunities, special offers, surveys, coupons, location-based deals, and other Rewards opportunities (collectively, âOffersâ).
&nbsp.
Regardless of whether they are expressed as points or dollar amounts, Rewards have no cash, monetary, or other value and are only redeemable for gift cards or other prizes or redemption methods as may be offered by the Rewards Program from time to time (collectively, âRedemption Prizesâ), subject to these Terms and the Rewards Program redemption requirements at the time of redemption.  
B.
Suspension or Termination of your Participation.
 The Company may limit, suspend, or terminate your ability to participate in a Rewards Program in its sole and absolute discretion, and may suspend or void any Rewards or potential Rewards you may have received or accumulated in a Rewards Program but not yet successfully redeemed if we determine in our sole and absolute discretion that you have not complied with these Terms.
You agree to abide by the final and binding decisions of the Company regarding any Rewards Program and your participation in it.
We reserve the right to change, suspend, or cancel all or a portion of a Rewards Program, including any unredeemed Rewards, at any time, without prior notice or compensation to you.  
C.
Receiving Rewards.
 You may receive Rewards in a Rewards Program by participating in various Offers, as described in the applicable Rewards Program.
Subject to the other provisions of these Terms, the Company will deposit any Rewards for Offers that you choose to participate in and successfully complete into the account that you established when you joined the Rewards Program (the âAccountâ).
 Rewards are deemed successfully completed once you have fully and properly satisfied all of the requirements of the Offer in the manner specified in the Offer (including any time limitations or waiting periods for acceptance or completion of the Offer) and in compliance with these Terms, and the Company and/or its third-party Rewards Program partners are able to properly validate, track and record that you have done so.
 For avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not be responsible for, nor shall the Company be obligated to award Rewards to you for, any Offer that is not properly recorded, tracked, validated and/or deemed a successfully-completed Reward under the Companyâs and/or its third-party Rewards Program affiliatesâ policies, procedures and systems.
In some instances, the Companyâs third-party Rewards Program affiliates, rather than the Company, may make the final determination of whether an Offer has been successfully completed and thereby should result in a Reward.
Please be sure to review all applicable terms of Offers and Rewards before deciding whether or not you would like to participate. We also reserve our right to: (1) change or limit the Offers or Rewards available or your ability to participate in certain Offers or the Rewards Program itself, (2) change or limit the eligibility for or allowable frequency of Offers, and (3) change or limit the number or type of Rewards you can receive for a given Offer or during a given time period.
 All such changes or limitations shall apply to all past, present, or future Rewards, unless otherwise expressly stated. 

D.
Redeeming Rewards.
 Subject to the other provisions of these Terms, you may redeem accumulated Rewards in your Account for Redemption Prizes pursuant to the applicable Rewards Program redemption requirements at the time of redemption.
Supplies of Redemption Prizes may be limited.
Redemption Prizes may be awarded or redeemed on a first-come, first-serve and while-supplies-last basis.
If you attempt to redeem Rewards for a Redemption Prize and the Company determines that the Redemption Prize is unavailable, out of stock, or for whatever reason cannot be provided to you, the Company may, in its sole and absolute discretion, provide you with a Redemption Prize of equal or greater value.
No re-crediting, reversal, or refund of Rewards will be issued for any reason after Rewards have been successfully redeemed.
in other words, once you order and receive a Redemption Prize, you may not reverse or cancel the Redemption Prize transaction or return the Redemption Prize for a refund or re-crediting of Rewards to your Account.
The only way to use Rewards is to redeem them for such Redemption Prizes as the Company may elect to offer from time to time for the applicable Rewards Program.
 

E.
Verifying Identity and Eligibility.
 The Company also reserves the right to verify your identity to our complete satisfaction prior to crediting or allowing redemption of any Rewards, issuing or delivering any Redemption Prizes in any Rewards Program, or otherwise providing you with access to or any benefit associated with the Prodege Sites and Features, our Services, or your Account. We may do so by requestingâeither directly or indirectly via a third-party verification serviceâthat you provide a photocopy of your passport, driverâs license, or state ID card, by requiring you to verify the mobile phone number associated with your Account, or by such other proof of identity or eligibility as we may require.
Some of our Services or Redemption Prizes may have additional eligibility requirements and in that case the Company also reserves the right to determine or verify your eligibility using such methods as it deems appropriate. Failure or refusal to provide requested documentation or proof of identity or eligibility is grounds for denying access to or any benefit associated with the Prodege Sites and Features, our Services, or your Account.

F.
Delivery of Redemption Prizes.
 Redemption Prizes are generally digital and delivered electronically to the email address then associated with your Account or as otherwise provided in the applicable Rewards Program, but in some cases may be physical items mailed to the U.S.
or Canadian postal address, as applicable, associated with your Account.
Processing times may vary.
Where we are unable to deliver a Redemption Prize or it goes unclaimed for whatever reason, you hereby direct and authorize us, where possible, to cancel or reverse the redemption for that Redemption Prize and restore the associated Rewards to your Account in the applicable Rewards Program, so that you can attempt to redeem such Rewards again in the future.
provided, however, that we shall not be liable to you for any inability or failure to cancel or reverse the redemption and restore the associated Rewards to your Account. 

G.
Rewards Have No Monetary Value and Are Nontransferable.
 You agree and acknowledge that unredeemed Rewards in your Account have no cash, monetary, or other value, remain the sole property of the Company, and are only redeemable for such Redemption Prizes as the Company may elect to offer in the Rewards Program from time to time, subject to these Terms and the Rewards Program redemption requirements at the time of redemption, 

H.
Inactive Accounts.
 Any Account that has not been logged into and Rewards either received or redeemed for one (1) year or more may be deemed inactive and the Account closed.
We may also modify our inactive Account rules and policies in our Rewards Programs from time to time, and if your Account becomes inactive pursuant to such then-current rules or policies, we may close your Account accordingly, without any compensation or further obligation to you regarding the closed Account.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding these actions, or wish to request Account reactivation (subject to such terms, limitations and requirements as we may impose from time to time), please contact us as provided in Section 18 below.

I.
Rewards Expiration.  We may also adopt or modify our Rewards expiration rules and policies for any past, present, or future Rewards from time to time, and if your Rewards expire pursuant to such then-current rules or policies, we may remove such Rewards from your Account, without any compensation or further obligation to you regarding the expired Rewards.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding these actions, or wish to request re-crediting of the expired points to your Account (subject to such terms, limitations and requirements as we may impose from time to time), please contact us as provided in Section 18 below.

J.
Shopping Rewards.  For shopping Rewards, we reserve the right to request and verify receipts of completed purchases prior to or in connection with the awarding of Rewards for shopping Offers in order to verify with the applicable merchant that such purchases are valid. If you return any products or cancel any services for which you received Rewards, we reserve the right to deduct any associated Rewards from your Account.
If you received Rewards based upon photos or scans of purchase receipts or other materials (such as an itemized packing slip for online orders to verify that you have completed the purchase and received the items purchased), you must submit a legible photo or scan of the original valid receipt or other materials, which cannot have been altered in any way and must be from a purchase that you paid for personally.
 Failure or refusal to provide requested documentation or proof of purchase is grounds for denying any Rewards credit.

K.
Referral Program Rewards.
 From time to time, we may offer special bonuses or incentives as referral Rewards for you to refer others who successfully join and participate in our Rewards Programs, using a personal referral code or URL, which shall be governed by the current Referral Program terms for the applicable Rewards Program.
You agree to only provide us with email addresses or other personal information of persons for referral purposes with their knowledge and consent.
You shall not be eligible to earn referral Rewards if you invite other users who share the same Device, if you create multiple accounts in an effort to earn referral Rewards for inviting yourself, or if you otherwise violate these Terms or the applicable Referral Program terms.
If you cannot produce proof satisfactory to us that referrals have been made in accordance with these Terms and the Referral Program terms, we may terminate your Account, withhold or rescind any referral Rewards, reverse or correct Rewards balances in your Account, or take other remedial actions as we deem appropriate.4.
Sweepstakes, Contests and PromotionsAny sweepstakes, contests, or promotions (collectively, âPromotionsâ) that may be offered via any of the Prodege Sites and Features or our Services may be governed by Additional Terms, including but not limited to official rules, which may set out eligibility requirements, such as certain age or geographic area restrictions, terms and conditions, and details governing how your personal information may be used.
It is your responsibility to read all Additional Terms to determine whether or not you want to or are eligible to participate, enter or register in or for the Promotions.
By participating in a Promotion, you agree to comply with and abide by such Additional Terms and the decisions of the sponsor(s) thereof. 5.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages or the exclusion or limitation of liability for bodily injury, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you.
These Terms give you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
The disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations of liability under these Terms will not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.

C.

Binding Arbitration of all Disputes and Claims

A.
Binding Arbitration of All Disputes or Claims

. The parties agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between them (âDisputes or Claimsâ).
This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted.
It includes, but is not limited to: (1) Disputes or Claims related in any way to any Prodege Sites and Features or our Services, privacy, data security, collection, use and sharing, advertising, purchase or other transactions, Rewards crediting, maintenance or expiration, Account balances or closures, Promotions, or any emails, texts, or other communications with you.
(2) Disputes or Claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the transactions or relationship between 
you and us, whether based on 
warranty, contract, tort (including negligence
, whether active, passive or imputed), fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory
.
(3) Disputes or Claims that arose before your agreement to these Terms or any prior 
arbitration agreement.
(4) Disputes or Claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class.
and (5) Disputes or Claims that arose or may arise before or after your use, or the termination of your use, of any Prodege Sites and Features or our Services. 
Consistent with and without limiting the applicability of the foregoing, all Disputes or Claims, and all legal and equitable issues relating to or arising from any Disputes or Claims, and/or these Terms or arbitration provisions, or any other terms or agreements that incorporate the same by reference, are for the arbitrator (rather than a court) to decide, including without limitation all claims, disputes, or issues relating to formation, validity, conscionability, interpretation, scope, and enforceability. 
For purposes of these arbitration provisions, references to âweâ and âusâ include all entities included within the definition of âCompanyâ above, and each of their affiliates, and each such entityâs respective directors, managers, officers, employees, shareholders, members, agents, suppliers, and assignees (collectively, the âCompany Partiesâ).


B.
Providing Us an Opportunity to Informally Resolve Your Dispute. If you intend to seek arbitration, please first send to us, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (a âDispute Noticeâ).
Each Dispute Notice to us should be sent to our customer service address at: &nbsp.
Dispute Resolution, Prodege, LLC, P.O.
Box 70, Manhattan Beach, CA 90267, Attention: Legal Department.
The Dispute Notice should include: (1) your name, email address, telephone number and mailing address.
(2) the nature and basis of your Dispute(s) or Claim(s).
(3) identification or enclosure of all relevant documents and information.
and (4) a description of the specific relief that you seek from us.
Before you may pursue or participate in any Disputes or Claims in small claims court or in arbitration against us, after you send the Dispute Notice described above, you should allow us a reasonable opportunity (not less than thirty (30) days) to resolve your Disputes or Claims.
After we receive your Dispute Notice, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith with each other to try to resolve your Disputes or Claims without formal procedures. 



C.
Agreement to Participate in Binding Arbitration

.
If the parties do not reach an informal resolution of your Disputes or Claims within thirty (30) days after we receive your written Dispute Notice, you may pursue your Disputes or Claims in arbitration or, solely to the extent specifically provided below, in small claims court.
If the parties cannot reach an informal resolution to the Disputes or Claims within thirty (30) days after our receipt of your Dispute Notice, you may commence an arbitration proceeding by sending an arbitration demand (âArbitration Demandâ) to the following address: Prodege Dispute Resolution, Prodege, LLC, P.O.
Box 70, Manhattan Beach, CA 90267, Attention: Legal Department.
The parties agree to arbitrate any Disputes or Claims between them, except to the extent either party chooses to instead pursue the Disputes or Claims in small claims court as provided below.
Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.
Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts.
Arbitrators generally can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. 


D.
Arbitration Rules and Procedures. The American Arbitration Associationâs (âAAAâ) Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, the âAAA Rulesâ), as modified by these Rules, will govern the arbitration.
The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org, or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.
If your asserted Disputes or Claimsâcollectivelyâare for $10,000 or less (exclusive of any filing, administration, arbitrator, or attorneysâ fees or other fees or expenses), we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic or video hearing, or by an in-person hearing under the AAA Rules.
If your asserted Disputes or Claimsâindividually or in the aggregateâexceed $10,000 (exclusive of any filing, administration, arbitrator, or attorneysâ fees or other fees or expenses), the right to a hearing and the manner of hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
Furthermore, if AAA at the time the arbitration is filed has Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness for Consumer Arbitrations in effect which would be applicable to the matter in dispute, we agree to provide the benefit of such Minimum Standards to you to the extent they are more favorable than the comparable arbitration provisions set forth in these Terms.
provided, however, that in no event may such Minimum Standards contravene or restrict the application of subsection E below requiring individual arbitration and prohibiting class, representative or consolidated arbitration proceedings.
Unless the parties agree otherwise in writing, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county, province or other local jurisdiction in which you reside (except that, if you reside outside of the United States or Canada, any such hearings will take place in Los Angeles County, California).
One arbitrator, who is selected under the AAA Rules and who has expertise in consumer disputes in the Internet industry, will conduct the arbitration.
If no arbitrator possessing such expertise is available, then the arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator who is selected by the mutual written approval of the parties, or if the parties are unable to mutually approve the arbitrator, by the AAA.
Except as allowed under applicable law and the AAA Rules, the decisions of the arbitrator will be binding and conclusive on all parties.
Judgment upon any award of the arbitrator may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction.
These provisions will be specifically enforceable in any court.
Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, in any arbitration proceeding with Disputes or Claims exceeding $10,000, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
Unless otherwise provided herein, the AAA Rules will govern the payment of all arbitration fees.
The arbitrator may make any determinations and resolve any Disputes or Claims as to the payment and reimbursement of arbitration fees at any time during the proceeding and within fourteen (14) days after the arbitratorâs final ruling on the merits. 


E.
Individual Arbitration.
Waiver of Representative or Class Action

.
The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that partyâs individual claim.
Furthermore, these arbitration provisions shall not prevent any party from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. 


YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT:



ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.
NEITHER YOU NOR THE COMPANY SHALL BE A MEMBER IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING, AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTYâS INDIVIDUAL DISPUTES OR CLAIMS.


UNLESS BOTH PARTIES AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSONâS DISPUTES OR CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.


THE COMPANY DOES NOT CONSENT TO CLASS ARBITRATION.
ACCORDINGLY, IF THE ARBITRATOR OR A COURT REFUSES TO ENFORCE THE ABOVE PROVISIONS REGARDING CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS, THEN THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE SHALL BE UNENFORCEABLE AS TO YOU.
WHETHER ANY DISPUTES OR CLAIMS PROCEED IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION, YOU AND THE COMPANY HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.



F.
Limitations Period.  The parties must bring any Arbitration Demand or small claims action regarding Disputes or Claims within one (1) year after the events or circumstances upon which the Disputes or Claims are based originally arose, or the Disputes or Claims will be permanently barred by the statute of limitations.
To the extent the law applicable under the Governing Law section below makes this limitations period unenforceable with respect to any Disputes or Claims, then the statutes of limitations of the state whose laws govern the AAA Rules under the Governing Law section below shall apply. 

G.
Confidentiality.
 You and we agree to maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding and shall not disclose the fact of the arbitration, any documents exchanged as part of any discussions or mediation, proceedings of the arbitration, the arbitratorâs decision and the existence or amount of any award, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration (in which case anyone becoming privy to confidential information must undertake to preserve its confidentiality), or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a provisional remedy, a judicial challenge to an award or its enforcement, or unless otherwise required by law or court order.

H.
Changes to Arbitration Provisions.
We may make changes to these arbitration provisions from time to time.
You may reject any material changes by sending us written objection within thirty (30) days of the change to Prodege Dispute Resolution, Prodege, LLC, P.O.
Box 70, Manhattan Beach, CA 90267, Attention: Legal Department.
By rejecting any future material change, you are agreeing to arbitrate in accordance with the language of these provisions prior to such change.
If you do not send written objection to any change as provided above, you are agreeing to arbitration in accordance with the changed language of these provisions.
To the extent that an arbitrator (or court of relevant jurisdiction, if applicable) determines that applying any changes to these arbitration provisions to any Disputes or Claims relating to prior events or circumstances would render this an illusory or unenforceable contract or otherwise violate your legal rights, such changes shall be applicable on a prospective basis only, with respect to events or circumstances occurring after the effective date of such changes, and in that case any Disputes or Claims relating to such prior events or circumstances shall be arbitrated in accordance with the language of these provisions prior to such changes to the extent necessary to avoid these Terms being deemed illusory or unenforceable. 

I.
Small Claims Court Alternative. You may choose to pursue your Disputes or Claims in small claims court rather than by arbitration if your Disputes or Claims qualify for small claims court in a location where jurisdiction and venue over you and us is proper. 

J.
Excluded Disputes and Claims.
Injunctive Relief.
&nbsp.
Notwithstanding subsection A above, you or we may at any time bring suit in a court of competent jurisdiction against the other party in relation to (and are not required to arbitrate) claims based upon infringement or misuse of intellectual property and/or misappropriation of trade secrets.
 Furthermore, nothing shall be construed to preclude you or us from seeking injunctive relief in order to protect your or our rights pending an outcome of Disputes or Claims while in arbitration.

K.
Governing Law.
Federal Arbitration Act. Subject to the AAA Rules, any Disputes or Claims arising between you and us arising out of or related in any way to the Prodege Sites and Features or our Services, privacy, data security, collection, use and sharing, advertising, purchase or other transactions, Rewards crediting, maintenance, or expiration, Account balances or closures, Promotions, or any emails, texts, or other communications with you, or arising out of or relating to any aspect of the transactions or relationship between you and us, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence, whether active, passive or imputed), fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, will be governed by the internal laws of the state or province in which you reside (except that, if you reside outside of the United States and Canada, the internal laws of the State of California will govern), without regard to choice of law principles.
provided, however, that the relationship and transactions between you and us evidence a transaction in interstate commerce and the Federal Arbitration Act applies to and governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions. 
12.

In any event, if you used any of the Prodege Sites and Features or our Services pursuant to a prior version of these Terms that required a certain notice period to you prior to any changes being effective, any changes under these Terms will not be effective as to you until the previously-specified notice period has passed after the date of these Terms.14.

17.
MiscellaneousThe Companyâs failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed to be a waiver of such right or provision.

Accessibility Statement
Compliance status
We firmly believe that the internet should be available and accessible to anyone and are committed to providing a website that is accessible to the broadest possible audience, regardless of ability.
To fulfill this, we aim to adhere as strictly as possible to the World Wide Web Consortiumâs (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG 2.1) at the AA level.
These guidelines explain how to make web content accessible to people with a wide array of disabilities.
Complying with those guidelines helps us ensure that the website is accessible to blind people, people with motor impairments, visual impairment, cognitive disabilities, and more.
This website utilizes various technologies that are meant to make it as accessible as possible at all times.
We utilize an accessibility interface that allows persons with specific disabilities to adjust the websiteâs UI (user interface) and design it to their personal needs.
Additionally, the website utilizes an AI-based application that runs in the background and optimizes its accessibility level constantly.
This application remediates the websiteâs HTML, adapts its functionality and behavior for screen-readers used by blind users, and for keyboard functions used by individuals with motor impairments.
If you wish to contact the websiteâs owner please use the website's form
Screen-reader and keyboard navigation
Our website implements the ARIA attributes (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) technique, alongside various behavioral changes, to ensure blind users visiting with screen-readers can read, comprehend, and enjoy the websiteâs functions.
As soon as a user with a screen-reader enters your site, they immediately receive a prompt to enter the Screen-Reader Profile so they can browse and operate your site effectively.
Hereâs how our website covers some of the most important screen-reader requirements:


Screen-reader optimization: we run a process that learns the websiteâs components from top to bottom, to ensure ongoing compliance even when updating the website.
In this process, we provide screen-readers with meaningful data using the ARIA set of attributes.
For example, we provide accurate form labels.
descriptions for actionable icons (social media icons, search icons, cart icons, etc.).
validation guidance for form inputs.
element roles such as buttons, menus, modal dialogues (popups), and others. 
Additionally, the background process scans all of the websiteâs images.
It provides an accurate and meaningful image-object-recognition-based description as an ALT (alternate text) tag for images that are not described.
It will also extract texts embedded within the image using an OCR (optical character recognition) technology.
To turn on screen-reader adjustments at any time, users need only to press the Alt+1 keyboard combination.
Screen-reader users also get automatic announcements to turn the Screen-reader mode on as soon as they enter the website.
These adjustments are compatible with popular screen readers such as JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, and TalkBack.



Keyboard navigation optimization: The background process also adjusts the websiteâs HTML and adds various behaviors using JavaScript code to make the website operable by the keyboard.
This includes the ability to navigate the website using the Tab and Shift+Tab keys, operate dropdowns with the arrow keys, close them with Esc, trigger buttons and links using the Enter key, navigate between radio and checkbox elements using the arrow keys, and fill them in with the Spacebar or Enter key.
Additionally, keyboard users will find content-skip menus available at any time by clicking Alt+2, or as the first element of the site while navigating with the keyboard.
The background process also handles triggered popups by moving the keyboard focus towards them as soon as they appear, not allowing the focus to drift outside.
Users can also use shortcuts such as âMâ (menus), âHâ (headings), âFâ (forms), âBâ (buttons), and âGâ (graphics) to jump to specific elements.

Additional UI, design, and readability adjustments


Font adjustments â users can increase and decrease its size, change its family (type), adjust the spacing, alignment, line height, and more.

Color adjustments â users can select various color contrast profiles such as light, dark, inverted, and monochrome.
Additionally, users can swap color schemes of titles, texts, and backgrounds with over seven different coloring options.

Animations â epileptic users can stop all running animations with the click of a button.
Animations controlled by the interface include videos, GIFs, and CSS flashing transitions.

Content highlighting â users can choose to emphasize essential elements such as links and titles.
They can also choose to highlight focused or hovered elements only.

Audio muting â users with hearing devices may experience headaches or other issues due to automatic audio playing.
This option lets users mute the entire website instantly.

Cognitive disorders â we utilize a search engine linked to Wikipedia and Wiktionary, allowing people with cognitive disorders to decipher meanings of phrases, initials, slang, and others.

Additional functions 
â we allow users to change cursor color and size, use a printing mode, enable a virtual keyboard, and many other functions.

Assistive technology and browser compatibility
We aim to support as many browsers and assistive technologies as possible, so our users can choose the best fitting tools for them, with as few limitations as possible.
Therefore, we have worked very hard to be able to support all major systems that comprise over 95% of the user market share, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera and Microsoft Edge, JAWS, and NVDA (screen readers), both for Windows and MAC users.
Notes, comments, and feedback
Despite our very best efforts to allow anybody to adjust the website to their needs, there may still be pages or sections that are not fully accessible, are in the process of becoming accessible, or are lacking an adequate technological solution to make them accessible.
Still, we are continually improving our accessibility, adding, updating, improving its options and features, and developing and adopting new technologies.
All this is meant to reach the optimal level of accessibility following technological advancements.
