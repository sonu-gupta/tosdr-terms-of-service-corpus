Introduction This document (the âTermsâ) together with the applicable Privacy Policy (collectively the âAgreementâ) sets out the terms and conditions governing visits, access and use of the music service TIDAL by the end user (âyouâ).
The term âyouâ includes additional registered users whenever permitted under the applicable subscription, visitors, and others who access or use any of the Services.
The âServicesâ means the music service branded âTIDALâ, mobile and device applications and all services provided by TIDAL, TIDALâs affiliated entities or TIDALâs vendors, or other third parties with whom TIDAL contracts to provide the Services that are inherently related to the music service branded âTIDALâ.
These may include, but are not limited to websites and applications for desktops, tablets and mobile handsets, set-top boxes and stereo equipment.
The Services may also include your ability to edit certain Service Content (as that term is defined in Section 8, below) that is specifically cleared for such use (the âEditable Contentâ) and User content (as that term is defined in Section 9, below), and save such edited Editable Content and User content to your own playlist without the ability to share or otherwise reproduce, distribute, publicly perform, or publicly display such edited Editable Content and User content (the âEdit Functionalityâ).
Each instance of edited Editable Content or edited User content shall be deemed a âRemixâ hereunder.
The Services are provided by Aspiro AB (âTIDAL,â âweâ âusâ and/or âourâ).
You may contact us at: TIDAL â Customer Support, 540 W 26th Street, 8th Floor, New York, NY 10001, or by email at support@tidal.com.
The current Agreement will appear on our website with the effective date that the Terms and/or Privacy Policy were updated.
TIDAL may, in its discretion, make changes to the Agreement.
When we make material changes to the Agreement, weâll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by sending you an email.
Your continued use of the Services after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.
Please therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully.
If you do not wish to continue using the Services under the new version of the Agreement, you may terminate the Agreement by contacting us at support@tidal.com. 2.

Purchase, price information, payment terms, right of cancellation and refund policy In order take out a subscription to the Services or to make any purchase in connection with the Services, you must (a) have reached the age of 18 years or (b) be between the age of 13 and 17, and have express permission from your parent or guardian to use the Services.
 (a) Subscription.
Certain aspects of the Services provided by TIDAL, third parties, or both may require you to purchase a subscription for a period of time as specified during sign-up (collectively a âSubscriptionâ).
Your Subscription, which may start with a thirty (30) day free trial period, will automatically renew on a monthly or annual basis (as specified during your sign-up) unless you cancel your Subscription as provided in Sections 3(e) and 3(g), or we terminate your Subscription as provided in Section 18.
 (b) Bundles.
TIDAL may contract with a third party telecommunication provider to provide the Services to you through a bundle package together with other services provided by such third party provider.
The payment terms for such bundle package, as well as other terms and conditions governing your use of the bundle package, may differ from the terms set out in this Agreement.
You are responsible for reviewing such bundle terms or any other terms governing your use of the services provided by your telecommunication provider before agreeing to any bundle package and accessing the Service via such bundle package.
If you have purchased a bundle package, payment will be taken from you by your telecommunication provider.
Should you wish to cancel or terminate your subscription via such bundle package or obtain any further information in respect of payment methods, billing cycles, automatic renewals or refunds you must contact your provider.
Other than this sub-section (b), Section 3 of this Agreement does not apply to you if you have purchased the Services as part of a bundle package from your telecommunication provider or any other third party.
 (c) Promotion/Trials. TIDAL, vendors, or other third parties with whom we contract to provide the Services may offer special promotions/trials with differing conditions and limitations which may be subject to different terms from these Terms.
Any additional terms to these Terms will be disclosed at sign-up or in other communications made available to you prior to sign-up.
You are responsible for reviewing any additional terms governing your use of such special promotions or trials before accessing any special promotions or trials.
At the end of the free or promotional trial period, your subscription will automatically renew for further rolling subscription periods of such duration as set out in the product details when you signed up for the trial or promotion and you will start to pay for the subscription.
To avoid any charges, you must cancel before the end of the free trial.
You are entitled to only one free trial per lifetime.
Any attempt to utilize more than one free trial is an unauthorized use of the Services and/or Service Content and amounts to a breach of the Agreement.
If TIDAL determines, in its absolute discretion, that you have utilized more than one free trial, TIDAL reserves the right to terminate your access to the Services, Service Content, and/or the Agreement.
 (d) Shopping in the store. It is not necessary to buy a Subscription to make a purchase at the TIDAL Store.
To make a store purchase, you'll be prompted to sign in to your account.
If you do not have an account, create a free account and choose a username and password.
Upon completion of the Store purchase, the purchased music or album will appear in your account for download.
You can download store purchases on one device.
Once downloaded, your in-store purchase will no longer be available in your account.
All shopping in the store is final.
You are responsible for backing up each purchase in the TIDAL Store 
(e) Payment Methods.
In connection with any and all Subscriptions that you select to purchase you must provide TIDAL with a current, valid, accepted method of payment, which may change from time to time ("Payment Method").
All Subscription purchases are subject to this Agreement and any additional terms and conditions, including any fees, imposed by your financial services provider and/or mobile carrier, as applicable.
You are solely responsible for reviewing the terms of use, Privacy Policy or any other terms governing your use of the services provided by your financial services provider and/or mobile carrier.
By providing a Payment Method in connection with any Subscription, you hereby authorize TIDAL to debit the total cost of said Subscription and agree to be responsible for any foreign transaction charges associated with your Subscription purchase.
Should charges for which you are responsible fail at the time payment is required, you may be responsible for costs associated with TIDALâs efforts to collect amounts due in accordance with applicable laws.
You confirm and promise to us that all information you provide in connection with the purchase of a Subscription is true, accurate and complete.
The duration and cost of Subscriptions are set by TIDAL in its sole discretion.
When you purchase a Subscription, you will initially be charged at the rate applicable at the time of your initial agreement to subscribe.
If the price of the Subscription increases later, we will provide you with written notice before the end of the billing period in which the change is made.
If you do not accept the change to your Subscription, you will be entitled to terminate this Agreement.
 (f) Billing Cycle.
As indicated during sign-up, the fee for certain Subscriptions must be paid in a single upfront payment while other Subscriptions may allow payment on an installment basis.
If the Subscription fee is paid in a single upfront payment, the total Subscription fee is due and payable to TIDAL immediately upon sale and your Payment Method will be automatically billed at that time.
If the Subscription fee is paid on an installment basis, your Payment Method will automatically be billed at the beginning of each installment period as specified during sign-up.
 (g) Automatic Renewal.
In order to provide continuous service, you agree that TIDAL will automatically renew a Subscription on or about the date the Subscription expires.
Such renewal will be for the same duration of the original subscription term and will be billed at the non-discounted rate for the Subscription as of the date of your enrollment and according to your original billing cycle method (i.e.
either as a single upfront payment or an installment basis).
By enrolling in a Subscription, you agree that your Subscription will be subject to the above-described automatic renewals unless you cancel your Subscription in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
You also agree that the amount billed may be different if your original Subscription was purchased using a promotional/trial offer and you authorize TIDAL to charge your Payment Method for such varying amounts as indicated at the time of sign-up.
You agree that you are responsible for other charges, including any foreign transaction charges, that may be imposed by credit card providers, payment processors or other third parties in connection with your use of the Subscription.
Your Subscription will remain in effect and continue to renew automatically until it is cancelled.
IF YOUR ACCOUNT IS MANAGED THROUGH TIDAL (AND NOT THROUGH A THIRD PARTY) AND YOU WISH TO CANCEL YOUR AUTOMATIC SUBSCRIPTION RENEWAL, you may do so by visiting your account settings page (https://tidal.com/account), going to the section called âSubscriptionâ and clicking on âCancel my subscriptionâ.
TIDAL will make reasonable efforts to process cancellation requests within two business days from the receipt of the cancellation request.
All other cancellations are required to be made directly through the third party that manages your TIDAL Subscription.

 (h) Refund Policy.
We will not refund any fees paid to us, including any advance charge(s) or payment(s) for any subscription term for the Services, unless otherwise required by law or the terms of this Agreement.
 (i) Charge Backs.
If you dispute Subscription charges with your credit card company or financial institution, and TIDALâs investigation determines the charges were valid, we may, on reasonable written notice to you, charge to your TIDAL account the reasonable required cost of responding to your charge back request.
TIDALâs Privacy Policy details what information TIDAL may share with your financial institution as part of the investigation into disputed Subscription charges.
(j) Statutory Right to Cancel.

If you are a consumer resident in the European Union, then you may also have the right to cancel your Subscription without giving any reason, and ask for a refund within 14 (fourteen) days of purchasing such Subscription.
However, as explained below, this right is lost as soon as you download, stream, access or use any of the Service Content, or use any of the Services.
To cancel your Subscription in accordance with this section, you must inform us of your decision to cancel.
You can contact us by sending an e-mail to support@tidal.com.
Please make sure that you include the details of your subscription purchase so that we can identify it.
If you validly cancel your purchase in accordance with this section, we will refund the price you paid for your Subscription (if any).
We will make the reimbursement without undue delay, and not later than 14 days after the day on which we are informed about your decision to cancel the Subscription.
We will make the reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise.
in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of the reimbursement.
If you purchase a Subscription, you expressly accept that we start providing you the Services within your 14-day withdrawal period.
You acknowledge that by receiving or accessing the Services during this period, you will lose your statutory right to cancel the purchase.
These rights of withdrawal do not affect your legal rights. 4.
