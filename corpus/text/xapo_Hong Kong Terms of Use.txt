To build a better Xapo, weâre making several changes to our Terms of Use, in anticipation of our Gibraltar based banking &amp.
bitcoin services platform, under a subscription-based business model, charging our users a recurring fee to access our services.
We want you to stay with us and join Xapo in this new journey, but please do so after carefully reading our updated Terms of Use.

You may register a user account, access and use our Services as an individual or on behalf of a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, or business entity of any kind established under the laws of Hong Kong or a foreign jurisdiction other than the United States of America (collectively, âEntityâ).
If you are using our Services on behalf of an Entity, (a) all references to âyouâ or âuserâ throughout these Terms will include that Entity, (b) you confirm that you are authorized to accept these Terms on that Entityâs behalf, and (c) in the event you or the Entity violates these Terms, that Entity agrees to be jointly and severally liable to us.

THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE IN SECTION 22 GOVERNS RESOLUTION OF CERTAIN DISPUTES.

To create or maintain your Xapo Account, or enable functions on your Xapo Account, you will be required to provide Xapo with certain information and documentation, including, as applicable, the information and documentation associated with identity verification and other screening procedures.

Xapo may refuse to permit you to register a Xapo Account or limit the number of Xapo Accounts that an individual or Entity may establish at its sole discretion.

4.2.
Entities. Unless your Xapo Account is opened on behalf of an Entity, you will use the Services and your Xapo Account only for your own account and not on behalf of, or for the account of, any third party.

But, the first sentence of this Section 4.3 will continue to apply to any other Xapo Account password, and any suitable password issued to replace the compromised Xapo Account password.
#5.
SUSPENDED ACCOUNTS Xapo reserves the right in its sole discretion to temporarily or permanently suspend and block Xapo Accounts.
This account blocking or suspension may be a consequence of, among other cases considered reasonable on the sole discretion of Xapo, inconsistent information regarding your identity (, a pending compliance review, the request of a third party, the request and/or order of an authority, governmental body, regulator, justice entity, police, etc..
YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCESS YOUR FUNDS IF YOUR XAPO ACCOUNT IS SUSPENDED, BLOCKED OR IS OTHERWISE LIMITED.
In case the cause of the suspension is resolved, Xapo may require you to provide an external bitcoin wallet address in order to send you the available remaining funds in your Xapo Account, or may transfer funds to a third party upon an order of a competent regulator, justice entity, judge, court or other which is reasonable in the sole discretion of Xapo.
#
6.
IDENTITY VERIFICATION Xapo may, in its sole discretion, require identity verification and other screening procedures with respect to you or transactions associated with your Xapo Account.
These verification and screening procedures may include, without limitation, checking the information you provide against any list issued by any governmental or international authority prohibiting or limiting business activities or transactions with any persons.
You may be required to provide Xapo with certain personal information, including, but not limited to, your name, address, telephone number, email address, date of birth, taxpayer identification number, government identification number, photograph of your government-issued ID or other photographic proof of your identity, information regarding your business, and information regarding your bank account.
You hereby authorize Xapo, directly or through a third party, to make any inquiries Xapo considers necessary to verify your identity or protect against fraud, including but not limited to: (a) query identity information contained in public reports (e.g., your name, address, past addresses, or date of birth).
(b) query account information associated with your linked bank account (e.g., name or account balance).
and (c) take action Xapo reasonably deems necessary based on the results of such inquiries and reports.
You further authorize all third parties to which such inquiries or requests may be directed to fully respond to such inquiries or requests.
Xapo will have no liability or responsibility for any permanent or temporary inability to access or use any Services, including your inability to interact with service providers, as a result of any identity verification or other screening procedures.

RISK
DISCLOSURES.
ASSUMPTION OF RISKS.
RELEASE OF XAPO Receiving, storing and transferring Digital Currency, and use of other Services provided by Xapo, involves
significant risks and potential for financial losses, including without limitation the following:
The features, functions, characteristics, operation, use and other properties of any Digital Currency and the
software, networks, protocols, systems, and other technology (including, if applicable, any blockchain)
(âUnderlying Technologyâ) used to administer, create, issue, transfer, cancel, use or transact in any Digital
Currency may be complex, technical or difficult to understand or evaluate.
Any Digital Currency and its Underlying Technology may be vulnerable to attacks on the security, integrity or
operation of the Token or its Underlying Technology (âAttacksâ), including Attacks using computing power
sufficient to overwhelm the normal operation of a blockchain or other Underlying Technology.
Any Digital Currency or Underlying Technology may change or otherwise cease to operate as expected due to a
change made to the Underlying Technology, a change made using features or functions built into the Underlying
Technology or a change resulting from an Attack.
These changes may include, without limitation, a âforkâ or
ârollbackâ of a Digital Currency or blockchain.
Any Digital Currency may be cancelled, lost or double spent, or otherwise lose all or most of their value,
due to forks, rollbacks, Attacks, or failure of the Digital Currency to operate as intended.
Any Digital Currency may decrease in value or lose all of its value due to various factors including
discovery of wrongful conduct, market manipulation, changes to Digital Currency properties or perceived value
of Digital Currency properties, Attacks, suspension or cessation of support for a Digital Currency by Xapo or
other exchanges or service providers, and other factors outside the control of Xapo.
Any Digital Currency may decrease in value or lose all of its value due to legislative or regulatory
activity, or other government action.
Government regulation of Digital Currency is unsettled and rapidly
evolving.
Any Digital Currency may be lost if sent to the wrong address (for example but without limitation, if the
address is improperly formatted, contains errors, or is intended to be used for a different type of Digital
Currency).
The risks described in this Section 9 may result in loss of Digital Currency, decrease in or loss of all
value for Digital Currency, inability to access or transfer Digital Currency, inability to trade Digital
Currency, inability to receive financial benefits available to other Digital Currency holders, and other
financial losses to you.
You hereby assume, and agree that Xapo will have no responsibility or liability for
such risks.
You hereby irrevocably waive, release and discharge all claims, whether known or unknown to you,
against Xapo and its shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives related
to any of the risks set forth herein.
You represent and warrant that you have: (a) the necessary technical expertise and ability to review and
evaluate the security, integrity and operation of any Digital Currency that you decide to acquire.
and (b) the
knowledge, experience, understanding, professional advice and information to make your own evaluation of the
merits and risks of any Digital Currency.
You accept the risk of receiving, storing and transferring Digital
Currency through the Services, and are responsible for conducting your own independent analysis of the risks
specific to the Digital Currency and the Services.
#10.
USER CONTENT Our Services may allow you and other users to create, post, store and share content, including messages,
text, photos, videos, software and other materials (collectively, âUser Contentâ).
Except for the license you
grant below, you retain all rights in and to your User Content, as between you and Xapo.
You grant Xapo a perpetual, irrevocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, fully paid, and sublicensable
license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute,
publicly perform and display your User Content and any name, username or likeness provided in connection with
your User Content in all media formats and channels now known or later developed without compensation to you.

When you post or otherwise share User Content on or through our Services, you understand that your User
Content and any associated information (such as your username or profile photo) may be visible to others.
You may not create, post, store or share any User Content that violates these Terms or for which you do not have all the rights necessary to grant us the license described above.
You represent and warrant that your User Content, and our use of such content as permitted by these Terms, will not violate any rights of or cause injury to any person or entity.

#
11.
GENERAL SERVICE TERMS 
11.1.
Support for Bitcoin Only. The only Digital Currency supported
by Xapo is bitcoin.
If you want to store, transfer and/or use any Digital Currency other than bitcoin, you
cannot do it through the Xapo Services.
If you send or transfer to your Xapo Wallet or Vault any Digital
Currency that is not bitcoin, Xapo shall not be responsible for receiving or storing it in any way and you may
lose any right in connection to such Digital Currency or value without any right or claim to Xapo.


11.2.
The Xapo Services. Xapo provides a way to receive, transfer, store, and manage bitcoins, using our wallet service, which we call Xapo Wallet, and the Xapo deep cold storage service, which we call Xapo Vault.

11.2.1.
Bitcoin Management. To manage your bitcoins with Xapo, simply click on the respective transaction button after logging in.
You will be taken through a process that will display the relevant information to conduct the intended transaction.
You shall pay transactions with available funds in your Xapo Wallet and available payment methods provided by Xapo, depending on your location and some other factors.
It is personalized to each user and certain factors involved, so only specific payment options are shown for each order.
At the end of the process, the transaction shall be debited from or credited to the respective account of your Xapo Wallet.
Xapo does not charge fees for adding or withdrawing funds, but processing fees may apply depending on the payment method.
Your ability to fund or withdraw your Xapo Wallet may be subject to limits we may establish from time to time.
When funding or withdrawing your Xapo Wallet through wire transfer and/or any payment processor and/or payment methods, incoming or withdrawn funds can be sent from or to an account in your own name or in the name of a third party.
You are solely responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the information included in your transfer of funds, including account number, bank routing number, your Xapo-specific reference number and any other information requested by us.
Xapo cannot revoke or cancel a wire once it has been initiated by a bank.
You shall be solely responsible for all costs, losses, damages and liabilities arising from any reversal of funds initiated by Xapo as a result of your failing to comply with the provisions of this section.
Xapo reserves the right to delay or not process incoming or withdrawing wires and/or payment processor method for any reason, and where required by governmental, regulatory or law enforcement requirements.
Xapo is not liable for any act, omission, mistake, default, delay, negligence, misconduct or insolvency of any third party, including any bank, entity or person.
You acknowledge and agree that when you instruct Xapo to transfer funds between wallets, Xapo does an equivalent finance transaction in accordance with your instructions, incurring in a hedge for the risk of adverse price movements of bitcoin and/or the default currency to be transferred.
Therefore, you acknowledge and agree that the cancellation of a transfer of funds from one wallet to another is not neutral, and it may be subject to an adjustment equivalent to the difference between the prices involved in the entire transaction.
Xapo does not earn any profit from these eventual adjustments.

11.2.2.
Bitcoin/Fiat Denomination Service. In case the E-Money Services rendered by Xapo Bank (Gibraltar) Limited are available in your jurisdiction, the following
E-money Terms
will apply.
In case such E-money Services are not available in your jurisdiction, Xapo provides you our Bitcoin/Fiat Denomination Service.
You are solely responsible for determining whether the E- money Services rendered by Xapo Bank (Gibraltar) Limited are authorised in your jurisdiction according to local applicable laws and regulations and the E-money terms provided in the link above.

The Bitcoin Fiat Denomination Service (âFiat Accountsâ) is a wallet service that allows you to keep your Xapo Wallet balance in a default Fiat currency, locking the value of your bitcoins in the default Fiat currency, at a certain conversion rate agreed by you through the process of the relevant transaction.
Your Fiat Account will always hold bitcoins, displayed in the equivalent amount of the default Fiat currency locked by you upon conversion.
For the sake of clarity, Xapo will hold at all and any time in your Fiat Accounts bitcoins upon which you and Xapo agreed its value in the default Fiat currency.

11.2.3.
Paid Services. Xapo charges a recurring fee to allow you to access the Xapo Services.
Please review our current recurring fee here.
Xapo reserves the right to change the amount of fees, including but not limited to the amount of the recurring fee, and to charge additional fees, including but not limited to dormancy fees, services fees, maintenance fees, closing fees and penalty fees in connection with account inactivity and/or lack of response to Xapo notices when an action from you is required with reasonable prior notice, and we will provide you at least 30 days advance notice of any such changes and/or additional fees.
Xapo reserves the right to charge a reduced fee in case the available balance in your Xapo account is not enough to cover the entire applicable fee.
Xapo reserves the right to waive and/or reduce any fee at any time, with or without notice.


11.2.4.
Xapo Debit Card. Xapo currently is not offering Debit Card
services.
This section shall be duly updated as soon as the new Debit Card product is offered to our users.


11.2.5.
Other Fees. Please review carefully our
current processing fees here.



Outgoing transactions.
Outgoing bitcoin transactions from your Xapo Account to
another Xapo Account are not subject to any processing fee.
Outgoing bitcoin transactions from your Xapo
Account to a bitcoin address outside of Xapo are subject to a processing fee that you can review here:
Bitcoin Transaction Fees.


Incoming transactions.
Incoming bitcoin transactions to your Xapo Wallet and/or
Vault equal to or below a certain amount are subject to a special processing fee so as to cover the
transaction cost of the Bitcoin network.
This special processing fee shall be automatically deducted from
the respective transaction.
Please review our
current special processing fee here
.



11.2.6.
Xapo Bitcoin Reserve. Xapo maintains a proprietary reserve
of bitcoins (âBitcoin Reserveâ) that is designed to ease the impact of bitcoin losses that are a direct
consequence of certain incidents, as described below, and that are not related in any way with your own
actions, omissions or errors.
The Xapo Bitcoin Reserve is provided to you at no charge.

The Xapo Bitcoin Reserve is designed to cover direct and effective losses suffered by users as a result of
attacks of hackers to our systems, theft by any third party and/or Xapo employee from our systems or
facilities, break-ins at a physical location of our vaults, and/or our bankruptcy, which are not due to or
related to your acts, omissions or errors (âQualifying Lossesâ).
The Xapo Bitcoin Reserve does not cover cases of hacking of individualsâ and entitiesâ systems, devices and
personal accounts, such as phones, computers, email accounts, etc.
For example, a loss suffered as a result of
your failure to maintain adequate security, control or confidentiality of your Xapo Account information,
including any personal identification numbers (PINs), passwords, API keys or other codes associated with your
Xapo Account and any activity occurring within that Xapo Account, will not be considered a Qualifying Loss.

The Xapo Bitcoin Reserve is primarily designed to cover the loss of bitcoins stored by our users in the Xapo
Vault, our deep cold storage service that incorporates multiple layers of cryptographic security to help
secure your bitcoins.
These processes include multi-factor authentication and private key segmentation between
others.
The Xapo Bitcoin Reserve is also designed to cover bitcoins held by Xapo in âHot Storageâ (i.e., connected to
a network in order to meet the liquidity needs of Xapo Wallet users) and it is intended to hold an equal or
greater amount of bitcoins than the bitcoins held by Xapo in Hot Storage.
WHILE WE HAVE DESIGNED THE XAPO BITCOIN RESERVE TO HELP LESSEN THE IMPACT OF BITCOIN LOSSES THAT ARE OUTSIDE
OF OUR USERSâ CONTROL, WE DO NOT AND CANNOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE XAPO BITCOIN RESERVE WILL HAVE A
SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF BITCOINS TO COVER ANY OR ALL LOSSES SUFFERED BY OUR USERS IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES.
In the event of a Qualifying Loss, bitcoins stored by users in our Vault will have priority to be covered by
the Xapo Bitcoin Reserve.
Qualifying Losses by Xapo Wallet users shall only be covered by the Xapo Bitcoin
Reserve after the Qualifying Losses of Vault users have been covered, because bitcoins held in Xapo Wallets
are subject to a higher propensity for cyber-attack, and we reward users that take their own security
measures, including preferring our Vault Service.
In these cases, the Xapo Bitcoin Reserve shall cover the Qualifying Losses in the following priority order:

(i) Qualifying Losses stored in the Xapo Vault of users.
If the Xapo Bitcoin Reserve is not enough to cover
100% of Vault usersâ Qualifying Losses, it shall cover Vault usersâ losses on a pro rata basis, based upon the
total value of their Qualifying Losses in proportion to the total value of bitcoin lost by all Xapo users as a
result of the incident.
(ii) Qualifying Losses stored in the Xapo Wallet of our users.
If the Xapo Bitcoin Reserve is not enough to
cover 100% of Wallet usersâ Qualifying Losses, it shall cover Xapo Wallet usersâ losses on a pro rata basis,
based upon the total value of their Qualifying Losses in proportion to the total value of bitcoin lost by all
Xapo users as a result of the incident.
For avoidance of doubt, each Entity user is counted only once in the above calculations, regardless of how
many authorized persons use the Services on behalf of that Entity user.
The use of the Xapo Bitcoin Reserve is optional for our users.
As a condition to receiving any bitcoins
and/or funds from the coverage of the Xapo Bitcoin Reserve, you agree to (i) timely cooperate with Xapo upon
its request in connection with any coverage claim relating to your bitcoins, including by timely providing any
information or documentation that Xapo reasonably requests, and (ii) sign any documents, including but not
limited to a release of further claims against Xapo, that Xapo may require.

11.2.7.
Communications. All our communications with you will be in English.
Other languages may be used for convenience purposes only, but we do not warrant that we will use other languages other than English to communicate with you.


11.3.
Forks. If, as a consequence of a âforkâ (as such term is commonly known in the bitcoin industry), bitcoin holders are granted an equivalent or proportional amount of a new Digital Currency or values that are not bitcoin, Xapo shall not have any obligation whatsoever in connection to such new Digital Currency or value, provided, however, that Xapo may grant you, at its sole discretion, a reasonable term to withdraw such Digital Currency or value and transfer it to a third party.
If you choose not to withdraw the total balance of the Digital Currency or value within such term, Xapo reserves the right to automatically convert the total balance of such Digital Currency into bitcoin and credit it to your Xapo Wallet.
The above does not mean and shall not be interpreted in any way as an obligation of Xapo to provide any support or withdrawal option of any Digital Currency or value other than bitcoin.


11.4.
Continuity of Services. Our Services may evolve over time.
This means we may make changes, replace, or discontinue (temporarily or permanently) our Services at any time for any reason with or without notice.
In this case, you may be prevented from accessing or using our Services.
If, in our sole discretion, we decide to permanently discontinue our Services, we will provide you with notice via our website or mobile apps.


11.5.
Bitcoin Transactions. Xapo cannot and does not guarantee the
value of bitcoins.
You acknowledge and agree that the value of bitcoins is highly volatile and that buying,
selling, and holding bitcoins involves a high degree of risk.
Additionally, the bitcoin consensus network is
solely responsible for verifying and confirming proposed transactions that you submit via the Services, and
Xapo cannot and does not confirm, cancel, or reverse wallet-to- wallet transactions, other than confirmation
of the Bitcoin networkâs completion of a transaction.
The Bitcoin network is operated by a decentralized
network of independent third parties.
Once a transaction request has been submitted to the Bitcoin network via
the Services, the Bitcoin network will automatically complete or reject the request and you will not be able
to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction request.
You acknowledge and agree that Xapo is not responsible
for any errors or omissions that you make in connection with any bitcoin transaction initiated via the
Services.
The Services help you submit your bitcoin transaction request for confirmation to the Bitcoin
network.
However, Xapo has no control over the Bitcoin network and therefore cannot and does not ensure that
any transaction request you submit via the Services will be completed.
You acknowledge and agree that the
transaction requests you submit via the Services may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the
Bitcoin network.
When you complete a transaction request via the Services, you authorize us to submit your
transaction request to the Bitcoin network in accordance with the instructions you provide via the Services.

To increase the security of your bitcoins storage at Xapo, Xapo has designed high-level security measures to
the Services.
For that reason, Xapo bitcoin sending addresses are not designed to receive bitcoin for Xapo
users.
Therefore, Xapo cannot and does not guarantee that any bitcoin transaction reversed by a third party,
and/or bitcoins sent directly to any Xapo sending address, shall be received by the Xapo user intended to
receive such reversed transaction or bitcoins sent.

11.6.
Bitcoin Transactions.
Transmission Delays. Xapo Services
include several security measures and layers to increase the security of your bitcoins storage at Xapo.
For
this reason, transaction(s) to a bitcoin address outside Xapo for a significant amount of bitcoins, may take
longer than a standard transaction(s) of bitcoin.
You acknowledge and agree that a transaction(s) to a bitcoin
address outside of Xapo system for a significant amount of bitcoins may be delayed.

Before processing any transaction(s), Xapo reserves the right to take necessary time for the purpose of
verifying your identity, verifying your activity and conducting security and other internal procedures in
relation to your Xapo Account.

11.7.
Wallet Address and Private Key. When you create an Xapo
Account as an individual or Entity, the Services generate and store a cryptographic private and public key
pair that you may use to send and receive bitcoins via the Bitcoin network.
The public key generated by the
Services serves as your bitcoin wallet address, and may be shared with the Bitcoin network and with others to
complete bitcoin transactions.
The private key uniquely matches the wallet address and must be used in
connection with the wallet address to authorize the transfer of bitcoin from or to that wallet address.


11.8.
Custody of Bitcoins. Xapo is a custodian of any bitcoins
transferred to a Xapo Wallet or Xapo Vault.
Xapo does not obtain any legal or beneficial right, title or
interest in your bitcoins that you store in your Wallet and Vault.
Please note, however, that Xapo may give
you a small amount of bits in connection with your creation of an account with Xapo (bits are a fractional
amount of bitcoins equal to 0.000001 of one bitcoin), but unless and until you have verified your identity
with Xapo, you will not have a legal or beneficial right to these bits from Xapo and may be restricted in your
ability to utilize the Xapo Services.
Once you have verified your identity with Xapo and Xapo has determined
that your use of the Xapo Services complies with applicable laws, these will become your bits and Xapo will no
longer have any legal or beneficial right to these bits.


11.9.
Unacceptable Use or Conduct. You will not:


violate any law, regulation, contract, intellectual property or other third-party right, or commit a tort
while using the Services;
use the Services in any manner that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect Xapo or other Xapo users, or inhibit other users from fully enjoying the Services, or that could harm Xapo or damage, disable, overburden, or impair the functioning of the Services in any manner;
use the Services in a manner that could damage or harm Xapo, taking unlawful benefits as an outcome of a fraudulent transaction behavior;
use the Services to pay for, support, or otherwise engage in any illegal gambling activities, fraud,
money-laundering, or terrorist activities, or other illegal activities;
use any robot, spider, crawler, scraper, or other automated means or interface not provided by Xapo to
access the Services or to extract data;
use or attempt to use another userâs Xapo Account without authorization;
attempt to circumvent any content filtering techniques Xapo employs, or attempt to access any service or

#22.
ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES
AND GOVERNING LAW PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH US AND IT
LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF.
You and Xapo agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms or your use of our Services, except for
disputes in which either party seeks equitable and other relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights,
trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents.
ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR
FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL.
You and Xapo agree to notify each other in writing of any dispute within thirty (30)
days of when it arises.
Notice to Xapo shall be sent to legal@xapo.com.
You and Xapo further agree: (a) to
attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration.
(b) that any arbitration will occur in Hong
Kong.
(c) that arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules
of the Arbitration Ordinance 2011 of Hong Kong.
and (d) that the courts in Hong Kong have exclusive
jurisdiction over any appeals of an arbitration award and over any suit between the parties not subject to
arbitration.
Other than class procedures and remedies discussed below, the arbitrator has the authority to
grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court.
Any dispute between the parties will be governed
by these Terms and the laws of Hong Kong.
WHETHER THE DISPUTE IS HEARD IN ARBITRATION OR IN COURT, YOU AND XAPO WILL NOT COMMENCE AGAINST THE OTHER A
CLASS ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.
The arbitrator, Xapo, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and
awards, including, but not limited to, all information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the
arbitration or related to the dispute(s) therein.
The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate
rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary.
The duty of confidentiality
does not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on
the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial
challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required
by law or judicial decision.
Any claim arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services must be filed within one (1) year after
such claim arose.
otherwise, the claim is permanently barred, which means that you and Xapo will not have the
right to assert the claim.
If any portion of this Section 22 is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (a) the
unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms.
(b) severance of the unenforceable or
unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section 22 or the partiesâ ability
to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Section 22.
and (c) to
the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative
basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and
the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims
in arbitration.
Further, if any part of this Section 22 is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking
public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought
out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section 22 will be enforceable.
