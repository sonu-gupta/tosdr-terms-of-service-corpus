(ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorneyâs fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses.

Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing Company from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights.
