This Privacy Policy explains how Netflix Party may collect, use, and disclose information we obtain through the Service.
WHEN NETFLIX PARTY COLLECTS YOUR INFORMATION Installation. If you install the Netflix Party browser extension, you are assigned a unique identifier which is stored on our servers.
This identifier is used to authenticate and access synchronized watch parties, as well as in gathering anonymous usage statistics.

For example, we collect the information that you provide to us in connection with accessing a watch party.
We currently do not store your messages or chat history during watch parties as a way of respecting your online privacy.
Communications. If you contact us directly, we may receive additional information about you.
For example, when you contact us through our general email address, we may receive your name, email address, phone number, the contents of a message or attachments that you may send to us, and other information you choose to provide.
Cookies, Automatic Data Collection, and Related Technologies. The Service collects and stores information that is generated automatically as you use it, including your preferences and anonymous usage statistics.

Cookies are small text files placed on your computer browser when you visit a website.
Most browsers allow you to block and delete cookies.
However, if you do that, then the Service may not work properly.
We work with analytics providers who may use cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information about use of the Service and report on activities and trends.
These services may also collect information regarding the use of other websites, apps and online resources.
One of the service providers that we use for data analytics is Google Analytics.
If you do not want Google Analytics to collect and use information about your use of the Service, then you can install an opt-out in your web browser (https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).

We may also share your information within our group of companies.
With Your Consent. We may also disclose your information with your permission.
SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION We take steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Unfortunately, the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you provide to us.
DO NOT TRACK Some web browsers incorporate a âDo Not Trackâ feature.
Because there is not yet an accepted standard for how to respond to Do Not Track signals, our website does not currently respond to such signals.
By using the Service or providing information to us, you agree that we may communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the Service.
If we learn of a security systemâs breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically by posting a notice on the Service or sending an e-mail to you.

If we learn that we have collected any personal information from children under 13, then we will promptly take steps to delete such information and terminate the childâs account.
INTERNATIONAL USERS If you visit the Service from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use, then please note that you are agreeing to the transfer of your information to the United States and processing globally.
