Cookies and Similar Technologies
What are cookies?

Online Tracking Opt-Out Guide
Like many companies online, we may use services provided by Google, Facebook and other companies that use tracking technology.
These services rely on tracking technologies â such as cookies and web beacons â to collect directly from your device information about your browsing activities, your interactions with websites, and the device you are using to connect to the Internet.
There are a number of ways to opt out of having your online activity and device data collected through these services, which we have summarized below:


Blocking cookies in your browser.
Most browsers let you remove or reject cookies, including cookies used for interest-based advertising.
To do this, follow the instructions in your browser settings.
Many browsers accept cookies by default until you change your settings.
For more information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your device and how to manage and delete them, visit www.allaboutcookies.org.
Note: if you do not accept our cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of our Site.
For example, we may not be able to recognize your computer or mobile device and you may need to log in every time you visit our Site.

Blocking advertising ID use in your mobile settings.
Your mobile device settings may provide functionality to limit use of the advertising ID associated with your mobile device for interest-based advertising purposes.

Using privacy plug-ins or browsers.
You can block our websites from setting cookies used for interest-based ads by using a browser with privacy features, like Brave, or installing browser plugins like Privacy Badger, Ghostery or uBlock Origin, and configuring them to block third party cookies/trackers.

Platform opt-outs.

Digital advertising Alliance: http://optout.aboutads.info

We may use Flash cookies (which are also known as Flash Local Shared Object ( âLSOsâ)) on our Site to collect and store information about your use of our Site.

You can also control Flash LSOs by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel at this website and following the instructions.

Pixel tags
We may also use pixel tags (which are also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) on our Site to track the actions of users on our Site.
Unlike cookies, which are stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website, pixel tags are embedded invisibly on webpages.
Pixel tags measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile statistics about usage of the Site, so that we can manage our content more effectively.
