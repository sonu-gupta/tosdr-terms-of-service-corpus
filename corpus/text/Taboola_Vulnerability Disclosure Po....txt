Vulnerability Disclosure Policy
 Vulnerability Disclosure Policy Last Update: June 20th, 2022 Brand Promise
Taboola, Inc., together with its affiliates (âTaboolaâ, âweâ, âusâ, or âourâ) is committed to working
with security researchers to verify and address any potential vulnerabilities in our services that are
reported to us in accordance with this Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (âPolicyâ).
We hope to foster
an open partnership with the security community, and we recognize that the work the community
does is important in continuing to ensure the safety and security of our customers, users, and
partners.
We have developed this Policy to both reflect our corporate values and to uphold our legal
responsibility to good-faith security researchers that are providing us with their expertise and
security suggestions.
Program &amp.
Scope
We ask that all security researchers submit vulnerability reports about any of the following
(collectively, the âServicesâ):

Our website, www.taboola.com, the websites of our affiliates and subsidiaries (including Connexity and Skimlinks), or any Taboola website displaying our Privacy Policy
(collectively the âSitesâ)
Our content discovery platforms, feeds, widgets, analytics tools, and other technical
applications that we provide on third-party websites (collectively, the âContent Discovery
Platformâ)
The Taboola News suite of content-discovery tools available on mobile devices and
operating systems (including the Start line of products, collectively âTaboola Newsâ)

Legal Posture
We openly accept vulnerability reports for the Services, and Taboola will not engage in legal action
against individuals who submit vulnerability reports in accordance with this Policy.
We agree not to
pursue legal action against individuals who:

Engage in vulnerability testing within the scope of this Policy.
Engage in vulnerability testing involving only the Services.
Engage in vulnerability testing without affecting or harming Taboola or its customers, users,
or partners.
Adhere to the laws of their location and the location of Taboola.
For example, violating laws
that would only result in a claim by Taboola (and not a criminal claim) may be acceptable as
Taboola is authorizing the activity (reverse engineering or circumventing protective
measures) to improve the Services.
Refrain from disclosing vulnerability details to the public before a mutually agreed-upon
timeframe expires.

How to Report a Vulnerability
Please report the details of any suspected or detected vulnerabilities by submitting a vulnerability
