        By default, all campaigns and other assets that you create or upload to Roll20 are private.
However, if you invite players to join your game, or choose to share your campaigns with other Roll20 users, then they will have access to view those specific campaigns and any assets used in those campaigns.
Any assets that you upload to the Roll20 Marketplace will also be made public under the license that you select when the asset is submitted.
