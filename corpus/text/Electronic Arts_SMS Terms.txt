FOR RESIDENTS OF CERTAIN COUNTRIES, YOU AGREE TO THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER DESCRIBED IN SECTION 15 OF THE ELECTRONIC ARTS USER AGREEMENT, available at terms.ea.com.

EA and its subsidiaries (collectively, âEA,â âwe,â âus,â or âourâ) provides these SMS Terms and Conditions (the âSMS Termsâ), which govern the provision and delivery of text messages by us and/or our text message service providers to you.
We provide this text message service to: (1) provide you with information you requested from us and/or (2) inform you of our products or offers that may be of interest to you.

E-SIGN DISCLOSURE

You may withdraw your consent to the use of the electronic record by sending an email to the administrator for your territory listed at privacyadmin.ea.com with âRevoke Electronic Consentâ in the subject line.
To view and retain a copy of this disclosure or any information regarding your enrollment in this program, you will need (i) a device (such as a computer or mobile phone) with a web browser and Internet access and (ii) either a printer or storage space on such device.

COSTS OF SIGNING UP FOR OUR TEXT MESSAGES

We do not charge you for our text message program.
But message and data rates may apply, so depending on your plan with your wireless or other applicable provider, you may be charged by your carrier or other applicable provider.

FREQUENCY OF TEXT MESSAGES

The specific amount of text messages may vary depending on how you use our services and the types of text messages you registered to receive.
The number of text messages you receive may depend upon factors including how you use our services and whether you take steps to generate additional text messages from us (such as by sending a HELP request).

Cellular, NTelos, Cricket, O2, Vodafone, and Virgin Mobile.
The list of participating carriers may be changed at EAâs sole discretion without prior notice, and we are not responsible if a carrierâs coverage changes so that our text messages cannot be sent through that carrier.
The content is not compatible with all cell/mobile phone models.
We will not be liable for any delays in the receipt of any SMS messages or changes to the participating carriers as delivery is subject to effective transmission from your carrier with active participation at that time.
