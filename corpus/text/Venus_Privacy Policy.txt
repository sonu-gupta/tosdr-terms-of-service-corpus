This Policy applies when you access our websites and mobile applications, contact us by phone, email, and chat or connect with us in any other manner, including in our social media, APP and SMS channels.
We may change or add to this privacy policy, so we encourage you to review it periodically. Contents What information is collected?

 Automated Information Collection We may connect information collected automatically with information we already have about you in order to identify you as a Venus guest, and to improve your experience.
If we are able to identify you as a Venus guest we may, for example, link your activity on our website to your activity on one of our mobile applications.
This allows us to provide you with a personalized experience regardless of how you interact with us â online, mobile, on phone, etc.
In order to provide the best guest experience possible, we also use automated information collection technologies for reporting and analysis purposes.
We examine metrics such as how users are shop on our website, on our mobile applications, and on our phone system, the performance of our marketing efforts, and your response to those marketing efforts. Venus Automated Collection We and our service providers use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us or third parties that use our services.
This information helps us recognize repeat users, customize their website experience, store items in their cart between visits and make our marketing messages more relevant.
Examples of this information include but are not limited to pages you visit, ads you click on, type of browser/device/hardware, purchase information, IP based geographic location and search terms.
These technologies also enable us to prevent fraud or other harmful activities.
We may also allow third-party companies to place tags on our digital properties.
The tags may collect information from cookies placed by other third-party companies.
Our Privacy Policy does not cover these third-party companies.
Please contact these third party companies directly for more information about their privacy policy and your choices regarding the tags and the information collected by the tags. Cross-Context and Cross-Device Identification, Advertising, Personalization, and Advertising Attribution Cross-Context  We may merge data collected from our own websites and mobile apps.
Examples of the data collected include: cookie IDs, device Advertising IDs.
transactions and browsing history.
your interaction with our online and mobile advertisements, including advertisements we serve within our emails.
information about ads we serve, such as which ad was served, your interactions with the ads, and the URLs where the ads are served from marketing partners such as Google.
the email address we have on file for you.
any Registry information you have provided us.
demographic and other information regarding your likely commercial interests from third parties.
and telephone transaction data.
This combination of data enables us to see usersâ and Guestsâ web activity on Venus websites, app activity on Venus apps, and interactions with our online and mobile advertisements, to create a single set of information from all of the various contexts with which we or our partners interact with you, and to understand how well Venusâs advertisements perform in terms of translating to transactions online, in app, and on Venusâs phones.
It also helps us improve our usersâ and Guestsâ experience by delivering more personalized advertising, including email advertising, social media advertising, and paid search advertising, and helps us create more personalized online and in-app experiences.
 Cross-Device  We may also link your various devices so that content you see on one device can result in relevant advertising on another device.
This allows us to deliver more relevant and consistent advertising to you (for example, if you purchase a product on our website using your desktop, we are able to avoid showing you an advertisement on the same product on your tablet.
Instead, we may show you an ad on your tablet for complimentary products to the one you just purchased on our website).
We also measure the performance of such ads and deliver information on advertising performance to our advertising partners in aggregate form.

 Third-Party Automated Collection and Interest-Based Advertising Venus participates in interest-based advertising (IBA), also known as Online Behavioral Advertising.
We use third-party advertising companies to display ads tailored to your individual interests based on how you browse and shop online, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as ad delivery, reporting, attribution, analytics, and market research.
Venus adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) self-regulatory principles for IBA.
We allow third-party companies to collect certain information when you visit our websites or use our mobile applications.
This information is used to serve ads for Venus products or services when you visit our websites.
These companies use non-personally-identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over, hardware/software information, cookie and session ID) and personally identifiable information (e.g., static IP address) during your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you or advertising-related services, such as ad delivery, reporting, attribution, analytics, and market research.
These parties typically use a cookie, web beacon or other similar tracking technologies to collect this information. Our Do Not Track Policy Some browsers have a âdo not trackâ feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked.
At this time, we do not respond to browser âdo not trackâ signals, but we do provide you the option to opt out of interest-based advertising.
To learn more about IBA or to opt-out of this type of advertising, visit the Network Advertising Initiative website and the Digital Advertising Alliance website.
Options you select are browser- and device-specific. Mobile Location Information If you use a mobile device, your device may share location information (when you enable location services) with our websites, mobile applications, services, or our service providers.
We use this information to improve our services, and provide you more relevant and personalized advertisements, services, and promotions.
To manage how you share your deviceâs location settings, go to the Choices section of this privacy policy. User Experience Information In order to improve guest online and mobile shopping experiences, help with fraud identification, and assist our guest relations representatives in resolving issues guests may experience in completing online purchases, we use tools to monitor certain user experience information.
including login information, IP address, data regarding pages visited and ads clicked, specific actions taken on pages visited (e.g.
information entered during checkout process), browser and device information. Social Media Venus engages with guests on multiple social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest).
If you contact us on one of our social media platforms, request guest service via social media, or otherwise direct us to communicate with you via social media, we may contact you via direct message or use other social media tools to interact with you.
In these instances, your interactions with us are governed by this privacy policy as well as the privacy policy of the social media platform you use. Social Media Widgets Our sites and mobile applications include social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, Google Plus, Pinterest, and Twitter widgets.
These features may collect information about you such as your IP address and which page you are visiting on our site.
They may set a cookie or employ other tracking technologies to accomplish this.
Social media features and widgets may be hosted by a third party.
Your interactions with those features are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide them. Social Media Ads We may display Venus ads to you through social media platforms.
These ads are sent to groups of people who share traits such as likely commercial interests and demographics.
For example, we may have Venus guests who have expressed an interest in shopping for clothing, swimwear, shoes, etc.
See the policies of each social media platform for additional information about these types of ads. Information from Other Sources We may collect data that is publicly available online.
For example, information you submit in a public forum (e.g., a blog, chat room, or social network) may be used to personalize your experience.
You are responsible for the information you choose to post online.
We also obtain information provided by third parties.
For instance, we obtain demographic and other information from companies that can enhance our existing guest information to improve the accuracy and add to the information we have about our guests (e.g., adding address information).
This improves our ability to contact you and increases the relevance of our marketing by providing better product recommendations or special offers that may interest you. Internal Operations
