Effective Date November 16, 2020
Welcome to the network of interactive services provided by Showtime Networks Inc.
or its affiliates (collectively, "Provider," "Showtime Networks," "us," or "we").
These Terms of Use, including the "Disputes, Arbitration" provisions in Section 1 below, along with our Privacy Policy, Mobile Application End User License Agreement, Video Services and Social Networking Policy as applicable (collectively "Terms") govern your use of the websites, mobile and connected TV applications, features, products and services that include an authorized link to these Terms (collectively, the "Services").
Please review these Terms carefully before using the Services because they affect your rights.
By using any of the Services, you accept these Terms and agree to be legally bound by them.
Certain provisions of these Terms apply only to specified Services.
For example, special provisions applicable to the Showtime standalone streaming service (the "Streaming Service") are contained in Section 8, and special provisions applicable to Showtime Anytime are contained in Section 9.
If you are a user of either of those Services, those sections apply to you, in addition to other provisions of these Terms.
References to Services throughout these Terms include the Streaming Service and Showtime Anytime.
These Terms are effective as of the Effective Date above.
If you have not reviewed the Terms of Use applicable to a Service since the Effective Date, please review these updated Terms carefully before using any Service.
We may change these Terms in the future, so we encourage you to review periodically the Terms of Use applicable to each Service you use.
The most current version of the applicable Terms of Use (along with its effective date) will be linked from each of the Services.
If you do not agree with any changes to these Terms, your sole remedy is not to use the Services.
If you continue to use the Services after we change these Terms, you accept all changes.
1.
Disputes, Arbitration
IF YOU HAVE ANY DISPUTE WITH OR CLAIM AGAINST US OR ANY OF OUR AFFILIATES (A "CLAIM") ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE SERVICES OR THESE TERMS, AND THE CLAIM IS NOT RESOLVED BY CALLING OUR CUSTOMER CARE DEPARTMENT AT (877)4-SHOWTIME ((877)474-6984), YOU AND WE EACH AGREE TO RESOLVE SUCH DISPUTES THROUGH AN INDIVIDUAL BINDING ARBITRATION OR AN INDIVIDUAL ACTION IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT.
Class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted, and your Claim may not be consolidated with any other person's claim.
You and we agree that the U.S.
Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.
This Section 1 shall survive termination of these Terms or any subscription that you may have to any of the Services.
Before you commence an arbitration or file a small claims court action with respect to your Claim, you must first send to Provider a written notice of your claim ("Notice").
The Notice must (1) be sent by certified mail.
(2) be addressed to: Showtime Networks Inc., 1633 Broadway, New York, NY 10019, Attn: Legal Department.
(3) describe the nature of your Claim.
and (4) specify the damages or other relief you seek.
If we and you do not then resolve the Claim within 30 days after our receipt of your Notice is received, either you or we may commence an individual binding arbitration or file a small claims court action to resolve the Claim.
Any such arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association and be conducted in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules, including the Consumer-Related Disputes Supplementary Procedures, if applicable (the "Rules").
Contact information for the American Arbitration Association, as well as copies of the Rules and applicable forms, are available at http://www.adr.org.
In circumstances in which the Rules provide for an in-person hearing, such hearing will, at your request, take place in the U.S.
county (or parish) of your residence, or otherwise in Los Angeles, California.
For any non-frivolous Claim that does not exceed $50,000, Provider will pay all costs of the arbitration, and reimburse any filing fees you may be required to pay.
You will be responsible for your own legal fees.
If the arbitrator awards you damages that are greater than Provider's last written settlement offer communicated before commencement of the arbitration, Provider will pay you the greater of $1,000 or the amount of the award.

8.2 Device Requirements.
To see if the Streaming Service is available for your device see our Help Center.
8.3 Payment and Pricing.
By placing an order for the Streaming Service through an authorized third-party distributor or Provider (each a "Distributor") and providing a Payment Method to that Distributor, you are agreeing to pay a subscription fee and any applicable taxes and service fees ("Fees") for the Streaming Service on the payment cycle designated by the Distributor.
The Fees will be charged to your Payment Method at the beginning of your subscription (or, as described in Section 8.8, at the end of your Trial Period, where applicable), and thereafter on a recurring basis in accordance with your designated payment cycle, unless you cancel your subscription or your account or the Streaming Service is suspended or terminated pursuant to these Terms.
Billing policies are set by Distributors.
If you purchase a monthly subscription to the Streaming Service from Provider and your subscription begins after the 28th of a month, then in any subsequent month in which that day does not occur, we will charge your Payment Method on approximately the last day of such month.
For example, if you started your subscription on January 31st, your next payment date will be approximately February 28th.
If you do not purchase your subscription to the Streaming Service through Provider, you should confirm your Distributor's billing policies before subscribing to the Streaming Service.
The Fees charged to your Payment Method may vary from time to time due to changes in your subscription plan or applicable taxes, and you authorize your Distributor to charge your Payment Method for these amounts.
Each Distributor reserves the right to change the price for a subscription to the Streaming Service and will be responsible for communicating any price changes to you.
If you do not wish to accept a price change, you may cancel your Streaming Service subscription as described in Section 8.5.
YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL INTERNET ACCESS CHARGES.
PLEASE CHECK WITH YOUR INTERNET PROVIDER FOR INFORMATION ON POSSIBLE INTERNET DATA USAGE CHARGES.
8.4 No Refunds.
ALL FEES ARE NON-REFUNDABLE.

A Distributor may provide a credit, discount, or other consideration ("Credits") to certain subscribers in certain circumstances.
The amount and form of such Credits, and the decision to provide them, are at the Distributor's sole discretion.
The provision of Credits in one instance does not entitle you to Credits in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate Provider or any other Distributor to provide Credits in the future, under any circumstance.
8.5 Cancellation.
If you purchased your subscription to the Streaming Service from Provider, you can cancel your subscription at any time by going to the "Settings" feature of the Streaming Service's website or by contacting us at https://showtime.com/help.
If you purchased your subscription to the Streaming Service from another Distributor, you can cancel your subscription to the Streaming Service at any time through such Distributor's platform.
With respect to all Distributors, if you cancel your subscription, the cancellation will go into effect at the end of your then-current paid subscription period.
You will have continued access to the Streaming Service for the remainder of your paid subscription period, but YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE A REFUND OF ANY FEES PAID.
You must cancel your subscription before it renews for the next period to avoid paying the Fees for the next period.

(2) you authorize your Distributor to continue charging your Payment Method, as your Payment Method information may be updated as described above in this Section 8.6.
and (3) your Distributor may suspend or terminate your subscription.
Changing your Payment Method information may result in changes to your billing cycle.

From time to time, promotional codes may be available, including those provided as part of a third party promotion.
Promotional codes may be redeemed as described in the specifics of the promotion.
Promotional codes can only be used once, cannot be redeemed for cash, and may be combined with other offers, subject to certain restrictions as determined by Provider in its sole discretion.
If you received a promotional code through an offer by a third party, additional conditions may apply.
8.8.
Trial Period.
The Streaming Service may be offered to certain users on a free trial subscription basis for a limited time ("Trial Period").
Distributors are under no obligation to provide a Trial Period, and Trial Periods may not be available at all times.

The specific terms of the Trial Period will be stated in the marketing material describing the particular Trial Period.
Your subscription starts at the beginning of the Trial Period.
Unless otherwise specified, (1) you may only have one Trial Period before you must begin paying for the Streaming Service, and if you exceed this limit, your Distributor may charge your Payment Method for any period after the first Trial Period, or suspend your use of the Streaming Service, in its sole discretion.
(2) you must provide valid Payment Method information to use the Streaming Service during the Trial Period (although you will not be charged in connection with the Trial Period).
(3) if you do not cancel the Streaming Service by the end of your Trial Period, you authorize your Distributor to automatically charge your Payment Method for the subscription period that follows immediately after the end of your Trial Period.
(4) YOUR DISTRIBUTOR MAY NOT SEND YOU NOTICE THAT YOUR TRIAL PERIOD HAS ENDED OR THAT YOUR OBLIGATION TO PAY FOR YOUR SUBSCRIPTION HAS BEGUN.
and (5) IF YOU WISH TO AVOID CHARGES TO YOUR PAYMENT METHOD, YOU MUST CANCEL THE SUBSCRIPTION PRIOR TO THE END OF YOUR TRIAL PERIOD.

Billing for all mobile subscription services will be governed by the Mobile Features section of these Terms (Section 11) unless the terms of the subscription say otherwise.
We may offer trial subscriptions to paid Services for free or at special discounted prices.
Unless otherwise stated, these trial subscriptions will automatically become paying subscriptions at the current subscription rate if you do not cancel before the end of the trial period.
The Services may offer various products for sale ("Products").
You are responsible for any taxes imposed on the sale or use of Products, and applicable taxes will be added to the amount charged for Products purchased on through the Services.

Mobile Features
This Section 11 contains additional provisions that apply to Services designed for wireless devices ("Mobile Features").
Your wireless provider may charge for use of Mobile Features, including fees for receipt of text messages or data transmission.
In order to receive Mobile Features, your wireless provider may require you to subscribe to additional services, which may require additional fees.
These fees are not charged by us, and you should contact your wireless provider before you sign up for Mobile Features to determine what fees, if any, will be charged.
In addition, you agree that we may arrange for Mobile Features billing through your wireless provider and that your wireless provider may invoice you for the applicable fees or deduct them from your pre-paid balance.
You may not transfer or copy any Content from the wireless device on which you originally received Content to any other device, including, without limitation, any computer or another wireless device.
To cancel a Mobile Feature that involves a subscription fee, you must follow the instructions included in the terms and conditions applicable to that Mobile Feature.
otherwise, you will continue to incur subscription charges.
If you stop a subscription-based Mobile Feature in the middle of a billing cycle, you will not receive a refund for that billing cycle.
