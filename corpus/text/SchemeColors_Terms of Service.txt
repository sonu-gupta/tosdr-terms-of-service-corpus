The service and content of this web site has been provided as a courtesy.
How you use or how you perceive it is beyond the scope of support offered by us.
The service has been developed as an easy-to-use repository for color schemes and colors by our team â please refer the About Us page for details.
The list below describes briefly the content of the web site and how you use the content or the web site as a whole.
This list is not all-inclusive and may change with the changes being reflected on this page.

The content of the web site is developed for the RGB space.
This means color representation is primarily in hexadecimal and RGB codes.
How the color appears on your computer screen depends on several factors including, but not limited to, screen brightness, contrast ratio, gamma settings, light source/s in the surrounding environment etc.
CMYK color values/codes on the web site are auto-calculated from the hexadecimal (or RGB) value/code using well-known formulae.
These CMYK values may differ from the actual CMYK codes/values used in printing processes and technologies.
Color codes, values and names used by color systems and companies such as PantoneÂ®, RAL etc., unless stated otherwise, are closest translations of the hexadecimal and RGB codes.
Colors developed by paint companies do not translate well to the RGB space.
Please check the color cards/fan decks of those companies for the actual interpretation of the color.
Color names used on the web site may not be the correct interpretations of the color.
Colors and color schemes are subjective.
We do our best to ensure that the content is correct and up-to-date.
