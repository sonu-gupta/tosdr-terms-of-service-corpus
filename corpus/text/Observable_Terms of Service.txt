What Information Observable Does Not Collect

Although Observable does not request or intentionally collect any sensitive personal information, we realize that you might store this kind of information in your account, such as in a notebook.
If you store any sensitive personal information on our servers, you are consenting to our storage of that information on our servers, and you are responsible for complying with any regulatory controls regarding that data.
We do not intentionally collect User Personal Information that is stored in your notebooks or any other free-form content inputs.
Information in your notebooks belongs to you, and you are responsible for it, as well as for making sure that your content complies with our Terms of Service.
If your notebook has been published and is now public, anyone (including Observable employees) may view its contents.
If you have included private or sensitive information in your public notebook, such as email addresses, that information may be indexed by search engines or used by third parties.
In addition, while we do not generally search for content in your private notebooks, we may scan our servers for certain tokens or security signatures, or for known active malware.
3.
How We Share the Information We Collect
We do share User Personal Information with your permission, so we can perform services you have requested or communicate on your behalf.
For example, if you suggest a notebook to another Observable User, we will send them an email including your name and Observable login, and a link to your suggested notebook.
If you join a Team Account, the other members of the team will be able to view and edit any team notebooks you create.
We will respect your choices.
We do not share, sell, rent, or trade User Personal Information with third parties for their commercial purposes.

We do not disclose User Personal Information outside Observable, except in the situations listed in this section or when compelled to by law.

However, we do not sell this information to advertisers or marketers.
We may share User Personal Information with your permission, so we can perform services you have requested.
We may share User Personal Information with a limited number of third-party vendors who process it on our behalf to provide or improve our service, and who have agreed to privacy restrictions similar those in our Terms of Service.
Our vendors may perform services such as payment processing, sending email on our behalf, content delivery networking, error log analysis, and other similar services.
We may share User Personal Information if we are involved in a merger, sale, or acquisition.
If any such change of ownership happens, we will notify you on our website or by email before any transfer of your User Personal Information.
4.
Public Information on Observable
Much of Observable is public-facing.
If your content is public-facing, third parties may access and use it in compliance with our Terms of Service.
We do not sell that content.
it is yours.
However, we do allow third parties, such as internet archives, to compile public-facing Observable information.
Your Personal Information, associated with your content, may be gathered by third parties in these compilations of Observable data.
If you do not want your Personal Information to appear in third partiesâ compilations of Observable data, please do not make your Personal Information publicly available.
5.
Cookies
Observable uses cookies (and similar technologies, such as HTML5 localStorage) to keep you logged in, remember your preferences, and provide information for future development of Observable.
The cookies Observable sets are essential for the operation of the website or are used for performance or functionality.
By using the Website, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your computer or device.
If you disable your browser or deviceâs ability to accept cookies, you will not be able to log in or use the Service.
Certain pages on our site may set other third party cookies.
For example, we may embed content, such as videos, from another site that sets a cookie.
Or another userâs notebook may embed a third party video.
While we try to minimize these third party cookies, we canât always control what cookies this third party content sets.
6.
Tracking and analytics
We use a number of third party analytics and service providers to help us evaluate our usersâ use of Observable, compile statistical reports on activity, and improve our content and website performance.
In addition, we use our own internal analytics software to provide features and improve our service and performance.
We do not permit third parties other than our analytics and service providers to track our usersâ activity over time on Observable.
We do not track your online browsing activity on other online services.
E.
User-Generated Content

Short version:
You own the content you create, but you allow us certain rights, so that we can display and share the content you post.
You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service.
We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.

1.
Responsibility for User-Generated Content
You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service.
You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you or Team Users post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content.
We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.
2.
Observable May Remove Content
We do not pre-screen User-Generated Content, but we have the right (though not the obligation) to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any Observable terms or policies.
3.
Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants
You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content.
If youâre posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you and your Team Users are responsible for any Content you post.
that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post.
and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.
Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us â and other Observable Users â certain legal permissions, listed in Sections E.4 â E.6.
These license grants apply to Your Content.
If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting Observable the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required.
You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections E.4 â E.6.
The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.
4.
License Grant to Us
We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it.
You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.
This includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups.
show it to you and other users you choose to show it to.
parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers.
share it with other users you choose to share it with.
run it in a notebook environment.
and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.
We need these rights for both public and private notebooks because these rights are necessary for providing the Service.
This license does not grant Observable the right to sell Your Content or otherwise distribute or use it outside of our provision of the Service.
5.
License Grant to Other Users
Any User-Generated Content you or your Team Users post publicly may be viewed by others.
By publishing your notebooks, you agree to allow others to view, âimportâ and âforkâ your notebooks.
This means that others may load your published Content into notebooks they control, or make their own copies of your published Content in notebooks they control.
When you publish a notebook, you grant each User of Observable a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the Observable Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on Observable as permitted through Observableâs functionality (for example, through forking).
If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other Observable Users.
6.
Contributions Under a Notebook License
Whenever you make a suggestion to a notebook containing notice of a license, you license your suggestion under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license your suggestion under those terms.
If you have a separate agreement to license your contributions under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.
This style of collaboration is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community, where itâs commonly referred to by the shorthand âinbound=outboundâ.
7.
Moral Rights
You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution.
However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section E.4, but not otherwise.
To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant Observable the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.
F.
Private Notebooks

Short version:
You may have access to private notebooks.
We treat the content of private notebooks as confidential, and we only access it for support reasons, to fix errors in the Service, with your consent, or if required to for security reasons.

1.
Control of Private Notebooks.
User Accounts and Team Accounts may have private notebooks, which allow the User or Team to restrict access to Content.
2.
Confidentiality of Private Notebooks.
Observable considers the contents of private notebooks to be confidential to you or your team.
Observable will protect the contents of private notebooks from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.
3.
Access.
Observable employees may only access the content of your private notebooks in the following situations:

With your consent and knowledge, for support reasons.
If Observable accesses a private notebook for support reasons, we will ask for and obtain the notebook authorâs permission first.
When access is required for maintenance reasons, to fix an error in the Service, or to upgrade notebooks for a new version of the Service.
When access is required for security reasons, including to prevent abuse, and to maintain ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of Observableâs systems and Service.
When access is required for analytics reasons, to learn how Observable users are making use of the Service.

4.
Exclusions.
If we have reason to believe the contents of a private notebook are in violation of the law or of these Terms, we have the right to access, review, and remove them.
Additionally, we may be compelled by law to disclose User Personal Information or the contents of your private notebooks in response to a valid subpoena, court order, warrant, or similar government order, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect our property or rights, or those of third parties or the public at large.
In complying with court orders and similar legal processes, we strive for transparency.
When permitted, we will make a reasonable effort to notify users of any disclosure of their information, unless we are prohibited by law or court order from doing so, or in rare, exigent circumstances.
