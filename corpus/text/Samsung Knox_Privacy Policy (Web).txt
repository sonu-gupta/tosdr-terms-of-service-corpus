Cookies are small files that store information on your device.
They enable the entity that put the cookie on your device to recognize you across different websites, services, devices, and/or browsing sessions.
Cookies serve many useful purposes.
For example:

Cookies can remember your sign-in credentials so you donât have to enter those credentials each time you log on to a service.
Cookies help us and third parties understand which parts of our Business Services are the most popular because they help us to see which pages and features visitors are accessing and how much time they are spending on the pages.

Cookies help us and third parties understand which ads you have seen so that you donât receive the same ad each time you access the MSS Service.
Cookies help us and third parties provide you with relevant content and advertising by collecting information about your use of our Business Services and other websites and apps.
