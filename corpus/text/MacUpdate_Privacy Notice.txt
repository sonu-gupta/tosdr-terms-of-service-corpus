In the course of our operations, we may need to transfer your data outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) due to the international nature of Clarioâs work.
In case of data transfers outside of the EEA, we will use all appropriate safeguards such as standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission.9.
How do we handle your data?The security of your personal data is very important to us, and we do our best to protect it.
We have implemented a number of security features throughout the Services intended to help prevent unauthorized access to the data we process.

Data security. To protect your personal data, we restrict access to it to the Companyâs employees, contractors, and agents who need it to perform their job duties.
In addition, those who have access to personal data are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or have their contracts terminated if they fail to meet them.
We protect your data by using physical, technical, and administrative security measures to reduce the risks of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, and alteration.

We retain this data to protect our Company in disputes and proceedings, to comply with legal obligations, meet regulatory requirements, prevent fraud and abuse, enforce this agreement etc.
In addition, if you would like to use our Services again in the future, it is easier for us to perform remote assistance when we already know the specifics of your computer and how we have helped you before.
If you wish to terminate your account or request we no longer use your data to provide you with our Services, then contact support@macupdate.com.10.

California privacy rightsWe make these disclosures to those visiting our Websites who reside in California which supersede and replace any conflicting disclosures found elsewhere on our Websites as well as reflect your privacy rights granted by the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) with effect from January 1, 2020.

Opt-out of disclosure for direct marketing purposes. California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California residents to learn the identities of entities that received their personal data for marketing purposes and the categories of information disclosed.
You may request such information by contacting us by e-mail addressed to support@macupdate.com.
Please reference California Privacy Rights in your subject line.
You may also write to us at:

Please be aware this opt-out does not prohibit our disclosure of personal data for any purposes other than direct marketing.

Automatic gathering of information. We collect data you provide to us online, and through websites of unaffiliated third parties.

Automatic gathering of information by third parties. When you visit our Websites, third parties can collect personal data about your online activities over time and across different websites pertaining to your visit to or to the use of our and other websites.

Do-not-track requests. California residents visiting may request we do not automatically gather and track information pertaining to their online browsing movements across the internet.
Such requests are typically made through web browser settings that control signals or other mechanisms providing consumers with the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personal data about an individual consumer's online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services.
We currently do not have the ability to perform such tracking, but only track your interaction with our Services.
The CCPA has extended California residents' data protection rights.
However, we have already guaranteed all these rights and described them precisely in this Notice as well as a means of rights exercising.
Please refer below to investigate.

Right to be informed. Please find a list of personal data we collect about you and your activity, sources and business purposes of personal data collection, and third parties we may share your personal data with in the Section 3 - 7 of the Notice.

provide you with personal data we collected about you no more than twice in a 12-month period (categories and specific pieces of collected personal data, business purpose and sources of collection, categories of third parties personal data is shared with);
NOT provide you with personal data if we cannot verify your identity.
You shall provide us with sufficient information allowing us to verify you as the person about whom we collected personal data.
However, we do consider requests made through your Account sufficiently verified.
NOT transmit your personal data to another entity.

Also, please be aware we are allowed to maintain personal data after a deletion request is received as permitted by the CCPA (for instance, for the purposes of detection of security incidents, repair errors, compliance with legal obligations, transaction completion).

We want to highlight how Clario does not sell, rent, or trade your personal data to anyone.

Non-discrimination right.
We definitely will not discriminate (including, by denying Services, charging different prices for Services, providing different quality of Services) against you for exercising any of your CCPA data protection rights.12.
