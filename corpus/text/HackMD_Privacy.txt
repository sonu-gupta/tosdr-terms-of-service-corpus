 PrivacyHackMDâs privacy policy is pretty straightforward:

We donât ask for personal information unless we really need it.
We donât sell your personal information.
We log some basic data (IP address, browser user-agent, session cookie) about all visitors.
This information is typically discarded, but we occasionally use it for analytics and performance measurements.
For HackMD users, we may store personal information such as your Facebook, GitHub, Twitter, Dropbox, Google username and your e-mail address and profile informations.
If you delete your account, we will delete this information.
We use third party tools such as Google Analytics, Mixpanel.
Some information-sharing with these third parties is unavoidable.
For example, unless you use a privacy tool like Ghostery, Google will know your IP address, browser info, etc.
Website VisitorsLike most website operators, HackMD collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.
Our purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how visitors use our website.
From time to time, HackMD may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
HackMD also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged-in users.
HackMD only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.Gathering of Personally-Identifying InformationCertain visitors to our website choose to interact in ways that require HackMD to gather personally-identifying information.
The amount and type of information that HackMD gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.

In each case, HackMD collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitorâs interaction with HackMD.
HackMD does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.Aggregated StatisticsHackMD may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites.
HackMD may display this information publicly or provide it to others.
However, HackMD does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying InformationHackMD discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on behalf of HackMD or to provide services available at HackMDâs website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.
Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country.

HackMD will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.
Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, HackMD discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when HackMD believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of HackMD, third parties or the public at large.

We expect to keep this type of email to a minimum.
