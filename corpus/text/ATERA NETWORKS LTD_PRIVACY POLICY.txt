Some of our Services let you access your accounts and related information with other service providers.
We may use, process and transmit your Personal Data to render our Services, to contact you and allow others on your team to contact you through the Services, to tell you about new products and features, to respond to customer care and other inquiries, and to process and fulfill your transactions and other requests.
 
Services Information. Our core technology enables our enterprise customers to carry out virtual managed service provider (MSP) services, including managing IT infrastructure, managing software, offering technical support, and fully-managed hardware outsourcing, among other services.
 
Identifiable Information.&nbsp.
If you provide us with any personally identifiable information/personal data about an individual, you represent and warrant that (1) you have that personâs consent to do so.
(2) such person has given explicit consent (a) for us to collect, process, use and store such information as set forth in this Privacy Policy and any commercial agreement you have entered into with us, and (b) for any other ways you may use that information.
and (3) you are responsible for ensuring that your (and any of your personnel or representatives, if applicable) use, control, processing and treatment of such information and any of your legal policies relating thereto are in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations.
 
Usage Information. We collect information related to how you use the Services, including actions you take in your account, such as accessing and sharing files and reports.
This helps us provide you with additional features, and to personalize, monitor and improve the Services.
We also collect information from and about the devices you use to access the Services, such as IP addresses, the type of browser and device you use, the web page you visited before coming to our sites, and identifiers associated with your devices.
Your devices (depending on their settings) may also transmit location information to the Services.
 
Cookies and other technologies. We use technologies like cookies and pixels to provide, improve, protect and promote our Services.
For example, cookies help us with things like remembering your username for your next visit, understanding how you are interacting with our Services, and improving them based on that information.
You can set your browser to not accept cookies, but this may limit your ability to use the Services.
In addition, when visitors come to our site, third parties (such as AdRoll) may place cookies on your browser for targeted advertising purposes.
If you would like to opt out of receiving targeted advertising, please email privacy@atera.com
 
Choice. You can always opt not to disclose information to us, but keep in mind that some information may be needed to create an account or take advantage of some of our features.
 You may also be precluded from using certain features, tools and aspects of our Services if you elect not to provide us with certain information that we may request.
 
With Whom We Share Your Information
 
Other users. Our Services display information contained within your Personal Data like your name, team name, and email address to other users in places like your user profile.
When you register your account with an email address on a domain owned by your employer or organization, we may help your team members find you and your team by making some of your basic informationâlike your name, team name, and email addressâvisible to other users on the same domain.
This helps us show your teams you can join, and helps other users share files and folders with you.
 
Other applications. You or your team administrators can also give or direct us to give third parties access to your information and account â for example, via third party CRM platforms.
We may also share your Personal Data with third parties as requested or directed by you through the Services (e.g.
sharing contact information with a third-party conference calling service provider).
Please remember that such third partyâs use of your information will be governed by their privacy policies and terms and we are not responsible for their acts or omissions.
Similarly, this Privacy Policy does not reflect the privacy practices of how our customers may use information they collect using our Services (e.g.
to analyze and improve their sales team membersâ effectiveness in their sales discussions), and it is up to them to determine whether a non-disclosure agreement or other terms should be entered into with their prospects, customers, and other third parties with whom they may share information, however, we expect them to comply with all applicable laws.
ATERA does not monitor, review or specifically comment on its customerâs privacy policies or their compliance with their respective privacy policies.
 
Team Admins and Team Members. If you are a member of a team, your administrator may have the ability to access and control your team account, and your Personal Data may be shared with your other team members and others.
Please refer to your organizationâs internal policies if you have questions about this.
If you are not a team member but interact with a team member (e.g., by joining a shared folder or accessing reports shared by that user), members of that organization may be able to view the name, email address, IP address, and other information that was associated with your account at the time of that interaction.
 
Anonymized Data.
We may anonymize or aggregate your Personal Data so that you are not individually identified (âAnonymized Dataâ), and we may use such Anonymized Data to improve our Services.
We also may also provide Anonymized Data to our partners, who may use that information in an anonymized form to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience.
However, we will never disclose aggregate usage information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally as an individual except as required to perform the Services or as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.
 
Vendors.
Affiliates.
ATERA uses certain trusted third parties (for example, providers of datacenters, support tools and IT services) to help us provide, improve, protect, and promote our Services.
From time to time we may need to share your data with these parties.
We may also share your Personal Data with our affiliated entities and personnel globally.
These third parties will access your information only to perform tasks on our behalf in compliance with this Privacy Policy.
We may and our customers may share information as discussed above and throughout this Privacy Policy, but we wonât otherwise sell your Personal Data to advertisers or other third parties.

If you do not wish us to continue using your Personal Data in this manner, you can request that your account be deactivated by contacting us as specified in the âContact Usâ section.&nbsp.
Keep in mind, however, that by deactivating your account, your access to the Services may be suspended and terminated.
 
We will only process your Personal Data if we have a lawful basis for doing so.
Lawful bases for processing include consent, contractual necessity (i.e.
processing that is necessary for the performance of a contract with you, such as your user agreement with us that allows us to provide you with the Products) and our âlegitimate interestsâ or the legitimate interest of others (e.g.
our users),
 
We process Personal Data when you use our Services for purposes such as:

Please note that in some circumstances, ATERA may not be able to fully comply with your requests, or we may ask you to provide us with additional information in connection with your request, which may include providing us with more Personal Data if we need to verify your identity or the nature of your request.
In such situations, however, we will still respond to let you know of our decision.&nbsp.
To make any of the following requests, contact us using the contact details referred to in the âContact Usâ section of this policy.&nbsp.
Your rights consist of the following:
 

Access: You can request more information about the Personal Data we hold about you.
You can also request a copy of the Personal Data.

Legal Requests/Disclosures
 
We may access, preserve and disclose your information to third parties if we determine that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with the law, legal requests or court orders.
(b) protect any person from death or serious bodily injury.
(c) prevent fraud or abuse or address security or technical issues relating to our Services or our users.
or (d) protect and enforce our rights and the rights, property and safety of our users and others.
 
How We Store Your Information
 
Security. We have personnel and third parties dedicated to keeping your information secure and testing for vulnerabilities.
We also continue to work on features to keep your information safe in addition to things like Single Sign-On user authentication, and encryption of data in transit and at rest.
However, no means of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and while we endeavor to use commercially reasonable means to protect personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.&nbsp.
If you access our Services via a third-party CRM platform or Cloud calendar (GSuite, Outlook 365), you should also protect your account with secure account credentials and prevent unauthorized access to your account and personal information.
 
Retention.
Subject to the rights of users set forth above, weâll retain information for as long as we need it to provide you the Services or to comply with applicable law.
If you discontinue the service, this information can be deleted upon request.
But please note: (1) there might be some latency in deleting this information from our servers and back-up storage.
(2) we will not delete Anonymized Data and may continue to use it as describe in this Privacy Policy.
and (3) we may retain information if necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, manage security risks, or enforce our agreements.
 
International Transfers.
Standard Contractual Clauses
 
We are a global company with global operations.&nbsp.
As such, we may store your Personal Data in the European Economic Area (the âEEAâ) and in in other countries and territories.
To facilitate our global operations, we may transfer and access such information from around the world, including from other countries in which ATERA has operations.
Please note that these data transfer practices may vary based on customer location and the applicable Service being used.
 
We have taken appropriate safeguards to ensure that your Personal Data will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
For instance, we have implemented the European Commissionâs Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal data, which requires the protection of personal data processed from the European Economic Area in accordance with European Union data protection laws a copy of which can be obtained at:
 
https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32010D0087.
 
We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third party service providers and partners.
 
Accountability for Onward Transfers.
 
ATERA shall enter into contracts to ensure that any third party to whom Personal Data may be disclosed is aware of and adheres to the principles contained in this Privacy Policy and/or is otherwise compliant with applicable laws and regulations mandating an adequate level of privacy protection.
In all circumstances, ATERA shall ensure by contract that any such third party (a) is aware of the principles contained in this Privacy Policy.
(b) is subject to laws providing the same level of privacy protection as is required by these principles.
and (c) has contractual safeguards in place to protect the Personal Data.
We shall also, upon notice, take reasonable and appropriate steps to stop and remediate unauthorized processing by third parties.
 
ATERA is not required to identify the sources of personal data when such identification is not possible through reasonable efforts, or where the rights of persons other than the affected data subject would be violated.
If there are compelling grounds to doubt the legitimacy of a data subjectâs request for rectification, amendment or deletion of his or her Personal Data, we may require further justifications before performing the Data Subjectâs request.
We are not required to notify third parties to whom the Personal Data has been disclosed of any rectification, amendment or deletion when such notification involves a disproportionate effort or unreasonable burden.
 
Security
 
ATERA undertakes reasonable and appropriate administrative, technical and physical measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of Personal Data, whether in electronic or tangible, hard copy form.
We shall also take reasonable steps to protect Personal Data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.
 
Collection from Minors
 
ATERA does not knowingly collect personal information from minors who are under the age of 16 through the Services.
If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personally identifiable information without his/her consent, then he or she should contact ATERA as described below.
If we become aware that a child under the age of 16 has provided us with personally identifiable information, we will delete such information from our files.
Further, the Childrenâs Online Privacy Protection Act (âCOPPAâ) requires parental consent for collection of data from children younger than the age of 13 years old.
