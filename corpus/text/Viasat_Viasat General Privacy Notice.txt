Like many online services, we currently do not alter our practices when we ,receive a âDo Not Trackâ signal from a visitorâs browser.
,One way to potentially identify cookies on our website is to add the free Ghostery plug-in to your ,browser (www.ghostery.com) which according to Ghostery will display for you traditional, browser-,based cookies associated with the websites (but not mobile apps) you visit and privacy and opt-out ,policies and options of the parties operating those cookies.

Please beaware that, ,even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to ,receive other types of ads.
Opting out only means that those selected members should no longer deliver ,certain Interest-based Advertising to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted ,content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks).
Also, if your browsers are configured to reject ,cookies when you visit these opt-out webpages, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different ,device or web browser or use a non-browser-based method of access (e.g., mobile app), your NAI / DAA ,browser-based opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective.
We support the ad industryâs Self-,regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising ,(https://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/sites/aboutads/files/DAA_files/seven-principles-07-01-09.pdf) and ,expect that ad networks we directly engage to serve you Interest-based Advertising will do so as well, ,though we cannot guaranty their compliance.
