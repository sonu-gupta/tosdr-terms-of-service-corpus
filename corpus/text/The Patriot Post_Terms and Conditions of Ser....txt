Tax Deductibility.
When Mark Alexander launched The Patriot online in 1996, he decided to adopt a donor-support model in order to provide our publications and services to military personnel, students and those in the mission field, without requiring a subscription fee.
However, we do not have "501-c-3" tax exemption in order to prevent the IRS from dictating limits on the editorial content of our publications -- which would hinder our mission.
Nor do we accept commercial ads in order to prevent advertisers from influence our editorial content -- which, unfortunately, they do with virtually every other publication.
We operate like a C-4 or PAC, which is to say we are not able to provide you a tax deduction for your donation to The Patriot Annual Fund, unless your support qualifies as a professional or business expense.
Supporting The Patriot Post's mission and operation budgets is the most cost effective way to promote Liberty across the nation.
We also operate Patriot Foundation Trust, which is a 501c-3 tax exempt organization with the primary mission of providing program and academic grants to foster the proper understanding for our Republic's First Principles -- Liberty and Constitutional Rule of Law over the rule of men. 17.

A modification or waiver of a part of these Terms and Conditions will not constitute a waiver or modification of any other portion of these Terms and Conditions.
If for any reason any provision of these Terms and Conditions is found unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and the remainder of these Terms and Conditions will continue in full force and effect.
User agrees that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between User and the Company as a result of these Terms and Conditions or access and/or use of the Web sites.
