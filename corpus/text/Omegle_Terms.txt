You don't need an app to use Omegle on your phone or tablet! The web site works great on mobile.

Omegle (ohÂ·megÂ·ull)  is a great way to meet new friends, even while practicing social distancing.
When you
use Omegle, we pick someone else at random and let you talk one-on-one.
To help you stay safe, chats are anonymous unless you tell someone who you are (not suggested!), and you can stop a chat at any time.
Predators have been known to use Omegle, so please be careful.
If you prefer, you can add your interests, and Omegle will look for
someone who's into some of the same things as you instead of someone
completely random. By using Omegle, you accept the terms at the bottom.
You must be 18+ or 13+ with parental permission.
Video is monitored.
