Many browsers including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Google Chrome contain a "do not track" optional setting.
In general, when a "do not track" setting is active, the user's browser notifies websites that the user does not want the user's personally identifiable information about an individual consumer's online activities tracked over time and across different Web sites or online services.
Websites are not required to honor a do not track request and as required by amendments to the California Shine the Light law, we are informing you that we do not honor such requests.
