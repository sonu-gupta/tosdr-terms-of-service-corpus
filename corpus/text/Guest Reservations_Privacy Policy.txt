We may collect information from parents with their verified consent about reservation plans for their families.
If we learn and have actual knowledge of a child providing information through the Site, we will delete such information as soon as possible.

We will honor requests by a parent or guardian to review or delete information about their child. Security We use procedural and technical safeguards to protect your personal information against loss or theft as well as unauthorized access and disclosure to protect your privacy, including monitoring for intrusion attempts, encryption technology, âfirewalls,â Secure Socket Layers (SSL), and security audits and inspections.
We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access.

Our legitimate interests in using and disclosing your information are the purposes listed above.
 Disclosure of Your Information If you do not want us to share your personal information with these companies, contact us through our contact page or at the contact information listed below.
However, the following describes some of the ways that your personal information may be disclosed in the normal scope of business to provide you with the ability to order the third-party products and services offered through the Site.

Advertisers.
We aggregate (gather up data across all user accounts) personal information and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for their marketing and promotional purposes.
However, in these situations, we do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to identify you personally.
Certain information, such as your name, email address, and password are not disclosed to these third parties in a personally identifiable manner without your explicit consent.
We collect booking information via our forms that include the collection of personal and financial information.
Some of these transaction pages may not appear on guestreservations.com pages and we do not control the privacy of the information given on these pages.
Once the user submits the info, payment is made and verified, the booking is confirmed and removed from our inventory and passed on to the third-party vendor booking the travel.
The booking info then gets passed along to the third party for fulfillment.
We do collect payment and verify credit card info to complete the booking, but we act only as the booking agent.
The third party will receive the confirmation request from the guest for the reservation and then their privacy policy would be in effect.
We do not have any control over the third-party use of information or their privacy policies.
Guest Reservations is disclosing this information to users so that they have the option to not do business on the Site.
Because we do not control the privacy practices of these third parties, you should evaluate their practices before deciding to book with such lodging establishments.
We may share information with our service providers that is in aggregate form or as otherwise necessary to fulfill your requests.
We may from time to time contract with third parties to handle surveys on the site.
Upon completion of these projects, all information is returned to us.
These companies that act as our service providers are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.

Legal Requests.
Guest Reservations cooperates with law enforcement bodies, as well as other third parties, for law enforcement purposes, to protect intellectual property rights, and to help protect you and our other customers from bad actors.
Therefore, in response to a verified request by law enforcement or other government officials relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your name, city, state, telephone number, email address, and Customer ID history without a subpoena.
Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy and our ability to keep the community free from bad actors, we will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement or other government officials without a subpoena, court order, or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss or report suspected illegal activity.
If Guest Reservations is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.
We may also disclose your personal information to any other third party with your prior consent.
Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.
By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose personal information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the Site.
