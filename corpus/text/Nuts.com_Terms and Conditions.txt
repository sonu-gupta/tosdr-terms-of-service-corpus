Dispute Resolution Provisions The Agreement shall be treated as though it were executed and performed in New York, NY and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York (without regard to conflict of law principles).
The parties hereby agree to arbitrate all claims that may arise under the Agreement.
Without limiting the foregoing, should a dispute arise between the parties (including the Covered Parties) including, without limitation, any matter concerning the Site Offerings, the terms and conditions of the Agreement or the breach of same by any party hereto: (a) the parties agree to submit their dispute for resolution by arbitration before the American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ) in New York, NY, in accordance with the then current Commercial Arbitration rules of the AAA.
and (b) you agree to first commence a formal dispute proceeding by completing and submitting an Initial Dispute Notice which can be found here.
[PLEASE INSERT THIS LINKED DOCUMENT.
IF YOU PREFER, WE CAN DRAFT A SIMPLE FORM FOR YOU WHICH SHOULD NOT TAKE MORE THAN 15 MINUTES] We may choose to provide you with a final written settlement offer after receiving your Initial Dispute Notice (âFinal Settlement Offerâ).
If we provide you with a Final Settlement Offer and you do not accept it, or we cannot otherwise satisfactorily resolve your dispute and you wish to proceed, you must submit your dispute for resolution by arbitration before the AAA, in your county of residence, by filing a separate Demand for Arbitration, which is available here.
For claims of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) or less, you can choose whether the arbitration proceeds in person, by telephone or based only on submissions.
If the arbitrator awards you relief that is greater than our Final Settlement Offer, then we will pay all filing, administration and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration and, if you retained an attorney to represent you in connection with the arbitration, we will reimburse any reasonable attorneys' fees that your attorney accrued for investigating, preparing and pursuing the claim in arbitration.
Any award rendered shall be final and conclusive to the parties and a judgment thereon may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Although we may have a right to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses if we prevail in arbitration, we will not seek such an award from you unless the arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous.





 To the extent permitted by law, you agree that you will not bring, join or participate in any class action lawsuit as to any claim, dispute or controversy that you may have against the Covered Parties and/or their respective employees, officers, directors, members, representatives and/or assigns.
You agree to the entry of injunctive relief to stop such a lawsuit or to remove you as a participant in the suit.
You agree to pay the attorney's fees and court costs that any Covered Party incurs in seeking such relief.
This provision preventing you from bringing, joining or participating in class action lawsuits: (i) does not constitute a waiver of any of your rights or remedies to pursue a claim individually and not as a class action in binding arbitration as provided above.
and (ii) is an independent agreement.
You may opt-out of these dispute resolution provisions by providing written notice of your decision within thirty (30) days of the date that you first access the Site.

California Proposition 65 Warnings. Proposition 65, officially the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, is a law that requires warnings be provided to California consumers when they might be exposed to chemicals identified by California lawmakers as causing cancer or reproductive toxicity.
The warnings are intended to help California State consumers make informed decisions about their exposures to these chemicals from the products they use.
The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (âOEHHAâ) administers the Proposition 65 program and publishes the listed chemicals, which includes more than 850 chemicals.
In August 2016, OEHHA adopted new regulations, effective on August 30, 2018, which change the information required in Proposition 65 warnings.
We are providing the following warning for products linked to this page: 

WARNING: The Nuts.com Products contain chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm.
Without limiting the foregoing: 
 The nuts included in the Nuts.com Products may contain acrylamide.
This chemical is formed in certain plant-based foods, including nuts, during cooking or processing at high temperatures, such as frying, roasting, grilling, and baking.
Acrylamide a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer.
You can be exposed to acrylamide when you consume certain Nuts.com Products.
