The types of personal information we may collect include your name, display name, username, bio, email address, business information, your content, including your avatar image, photos, posts, responses, and series published by you, and any other information you choose to provide.
In some cases, we may also collect information you provide about others, such as when you purchase a Medium membership as a gift for someone.
We will use this information to fulfill your request and will not send communications to your contacts unrelated to your request, unless they separately consent to receive communications from us or otherwise engage with us.
We do not collect payment information through our Services.
We rely on third parties to process payments in connection with our Services.
Any information you provide to facilitate such a payment is subject to the third-party payment processorâs privacy policy, and we encourage you to review this policy before you provide any information to the payment processor.Information We Collect Automatically When You Interact with UsIn some instances, we automatically collect certain information, including:

Device and Usage Information: We collect information about how you access our Services, including data about the device and network you use, such as your hardware model, operating system version, mobile network, IP address, unique device identifiers, browser type, and app version.
We also collect information about your activity on our Services, such as access times, pages viewed, links clicked, and the page you visited before navigating to our Services.

Information Collected by Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies: We use tracking technologies, such as cookies and web beacons, to collect information about you.
Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help us improve our Services and your experience, see which areas and features of our Services are popular, and count visits.
Web beacons (also known as âpixel tagsâ or âclear GIFsâ) are electronic images that we use on our Services and in our emails to help deliver cookies, count visits, and understand usage.

For more information about cookies and how to disable them, see Your Choices below.
Information We Collect from Other SourcesWe obtain information from third-party sources.
For example, we may collect information about you from social networks, accounting services providers and data analytics providers.
Additionally, if you create or log into your Medium account through a third-party platform (such as Apple, Facebook, Google, or Twitter), we will have access to certain information from that platform, such as your name, lists of friends or followers, birthday, and profile picture, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such platform.Information We DeriveWe may derive information or draw inferences about you based on the information we collect.
For example, we may make inferences about your location based on your IP address or infer reading preferences based on your reading history.USE OF INFORMATIONWe use the information we collect to provide, maintain, and improve our Services, which includes publishing and distributing user-generated content, personalizing the posts you see and operating our metered paywall.
We also use the information we collect to:

Send you technical notices, security alerts, and support and administrative messages;

and
Carry out any other purpose described to you at the time the information was collected.
SHARING OF INFORMATIONWe share personal information in the following circumstances or as otherwise described in this policy:

We share personal information with other users of the Services.
For example, if you use our Services to publish content, post comments or send private notes, certain information about you will be visible to others, such as your name, photo, bio, other account information you may provide, and information about your activities on our Services (e.g., your followers and who you follow, recent posts, claps, highlights, and responses).
We share personal information with vendors, service providers, and consultants that need access to personal information in order to perform services for us, such as companies that assist us with web hosting, storage, and other infrastructure, analytics, payment processing, fraud prevention and security, customer service, communications, and marketing.
We may disclose personal information if we believe that disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, any applicable law or legal process, including lawful requests by public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
If we are going to disclose your personal information in response to legal process, we will give you notice so you can challenge it (for example by seeking court intervention), unless we are prohibited by law or believe doing so may endanger others or cause illegal conduct.
We will object to legal requests for information about users of our Services that we believe are improper.
We may share personal information if we believe that your actions are inconsistent with our user agreements or policies, if we believe that you have violated the law, or if we believe it is necessary to protect the rights, property, and safety of Medium, our users, the public, or others.
We share personal information with our lawyers and other professional advisors where necessary to obtain advice or otherwise protect and manage our business interests.
We may share personal information in connection with, or during negotiations concerning, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company.
Personal information is shared between and among Medium and our current and future parents, affiliates, and subsidiaries and other companies under common control and ownership.
We share personal information with your consent or at your direction.
We also share aggregated or de-identified information that cannot reasonably be used to identify you.
THIRD-PARTY EMBEDSMedium does not host some of the content displayed on our Services.
Users have the ability to post content that is actually hosted by a third party, but is embedded in our pages (an â

Embed

â).
When you interact with an Embed, it can send information about your interaction to the hosting third party just as if you were visiting the third partyâs site directly.
For example, when you load a Medium post page with a YouTube video Embed and watch the video, YouTube receives information about your activity, such as your IP address and how much of the video you watch.
Medium does not control what information third parties collect through Embeds or what they do with the information.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected through Embeds.
The privacy policy belonging to the third party hosting the Embed applies to any information the Embed collects, and we recommend you review that policy before interacting with the Embed.TRANSFER OF INFORMATION TO THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIESMedium is headquartered in the United States, and we have operations and service providers in the United States and other countries.
Therefore, we and our service providers may transfer your personal information to, or store or access it in, jurisdictions that may not provide levels of data protection that are equivalent to those of your home jurisdiction.
For example, we transfer personal data to Amazon Web Services, one of our service providers that processes personal information for us in various data center locations across the globe, including those listed here.
We will take steps to ensure that your personal information receives an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in which we process it.YOUR CHOICESAccount InformationYou may access, correct, delete and export your account information at any time by logging into the Services and navigating to the Settings page.
