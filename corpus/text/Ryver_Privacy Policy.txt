 Privacy Policy 
Last updated: January 7, 2019.

Ryver LLC, a Delaware corporation (âRyverâ or âweâ or âusâ or âourâ) is committed to the protection of your privacy.
We have established this privacy statement (the âStatementâ) as a means of disclosing to you how we collect, utilize, distribute, and protect your personal information.
This privacy statement covers both the Site www.ryver.com (the âSiteâ) and the services and applications (the âServiceâ) that Ryver LLC provides.
For the purposes of this Privacy Statement, âcustomerâ shall mean any past, current, or prospective customer of Ryver, including any visitor to the Site.
This Privacy Statement governs the manner in which Ryver collects, uses, maintains and discloses information collected from customers in connection with Ryverâs Site, services, and applications.
Ryver is committed to safeguarding the information its customers entrust to it.
Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our Terms of Service.
By accessing or using the Service, you agree to this Privacy Statement.
Collecting and Using Information
Ryver uses information we collect to operate, maintain, and provide you the features and functionality of the Service, to analyze how the Service is used, diagnose service or technical problems, maintain security, personalize content, remember information to help you efficiently access your account, monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns, and track Content and users as necessary to comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and other applicable laws.

Organization Owners: When a person signs up for a new Ryver organization, they are the Owner, or Primary Administrator, of that organization.
As an Organization Owner, we may send you service, technical, and other administrative emails, messages, and other types of communications  in lieu of communication by postal mail.
We may also contact you to inform you about changes in our Services, our Services offerings, and important Services-related notices, such as security and fraud notices.
In addition, we may need to contact you for invoicing, account management, and similar reasons, and we use account data to administer accounts and keep track of billing and payments.
These communications are considered part of the Services and you may not opt out of them.
Finally, we sometimes send emails about new product features, promotional communications, or other news about Ryver, which you can opt out of receiving by unsubscribing via a link provided in the email or by writing to us at privacy@ryver.com.

User Profiles: When a Member or Guest is invited to a Ryver organization, they fill out a user profile, which includes an email address, display name, and other optional information.
Ryver will use the email address for directly providing application services such as offline notifications.
Additionally, we may use the email address to send tips on using the product.
You can opt out of receiving these emails by unsubscribing via a link provided in the email or by writing to us at privacy@ryver.com.

Error Log Data: If you encounter an error in the Ryver application, we will provide a feedback form so you can report the problem to our customer support.
The error report includes the operating system, browser, device information, and records the action that was being performed at the time the error occurred.
This information is used to help diagnose and solve the customer problem.

Third Party Service Integration: Ryver connects to third party services such as Google Drive and Dropbox, to facilitate document attachments and Google Hangout integration.
Ryver connects to these services via OAuth, and does not directly capture or store your username or password for these external services.

Ryver Usage Metrics: Ryver tracks application usage and stores it in a metrics database, from which we create charts and spreadsheets for analysis, allowing us to understand what parts of the Ryver service are and are not being used, and to what extent.
Data tracked includes number of invites, number of teams created, number of chat messages, posts and comments, etc.
This data does NOT include actual content such as team names, message content, or user names.
Content

Your Content: When you post content into Ryver, that content is private to you and the other users in your Ryver organization.
Who exactly can see what content depends on the configuration of the teams and users in your organization.

Ryver Employees: We have taken steps at Ryver to ensure that your content remains private.
While we are a technology company providing a service, and certain employees need to have access to customer data stores, we minimize that access, even amongst the engineering staff.
By taking advantage of Amazonâs Identity and Access Management (IAM) configuration (https://aws.amazon.com/iam/), we ensure that most of the Ryver employees are unable to access customer content data stores.

Disclosure: As outlined in section 5 (Acceptable User of Ryver) in the Ryver Terms of Service, there may be certain cases where Ryver is required to access, remove, preserve, or disclose information as necessary to comply with legal obligations and/or protect our users.
As long as we are legally permitted, we will provide notice of any situation where accessing content becomes necessary.
We will also request permission before accessing content to provide customer support.
Cookies and Log Files
When you use the Service, we may send one or more âcookiesâ (a small data file) to your computer to uniquely identify your browser and assist Ryver to help you log in faster and improve your navigation through the Site.
A cookie may convey anonymous information to us about how you browse the Service.
A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser so that it can be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site.
Persistent cookies can be removed by following your browserâs directions.
A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser.
You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.
However, certain features of the Service may not function properly if you disable the ability to accept cookies.
Device Identifiers and Geo-Location Information
Ryver does not currently collect precise GPS information with our mobile client.
Should that change in the future, we will update our privacy policy, and take steps in the application to ensure that users are aware of such use of location information in order to provide our service.
Should we add such a feature in the future, please note that a device identifier or location data does not collect or share any personally identifiable information about you.
Third Party Analytics
Ryver may use third party analytics tools, such as Google Analytics, to help understand use of the Service or the Ryver web site.
Many of these tools collect the information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, including cookies, and your IP address.
These analytics tools also receive this information and their use of it is governed by their privacy policy or statement.
Third Party Website Remarketing
The Ryver web site may use third-party remarketing services to advertise on third-party websites (including Google, Facebook, and Twitter) to previous visitors to our site.
These 3rd party sites use tracking cookies to serve ads based on someoneâs past visits to our website.
This means we might continue to show ads to you across the Internet, specifically on the Google Content Network (GCN), Facebook, and Twitter.
As always, we respect your privacy, and we are not collecting any personally identifiable information through the use of Googleâs, Facebookâs, Twitterâs, or any other 3rd party remarketing system.
You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Preferences page (http://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/).
If you do not want Twitter to match your account to information shared by ad partners to tailor ads for you, you can uncheck the box next to âPromoted contentâ in your account settings at any time.
(Read More (https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170405) for details.) And, you can set preferences for how Facebook advertises to you by editing your privacy settings (https://www.facebook.com/help/155389304528852) on Facebook.
Protecting Information
Ryver makes diligent efforts to maintain accurate information on our customers.
Ryver has put stringent security procedures in place to protect such information collected about our customers.
We constantly monitor our systems, which are protected using industry-standard security measures.
Secure Sockets Layer (âSSLâ) connections are used to communicate to our system to protect customer information as well as encrypting vital information that customers input through the Site.
While Ryver cannot guarantee that the information submitted to, maintained on, or transmitted from our systems will be 100% secure, we take security very seriously and follow industry best practices.
We have also paid for third party security audits in the past, and will continue to do so in the future.

We will display your personal identifiable information in your profile page and elsewhere on the Service according to the preferences you set for your user account.
Any information you choose to provide should reflect how much you want others to know about you.

Ryver may share your personally identifiable information or certain content with other third parties for the purpose of providing the Service to you.

Ryver may share your information with a third party application with your consent, for example, when you choose to access our Service through such an application, and you provide that application with your Ryver login credentials.
Ryver is not responsible for what those third parties do with your information, so you should make sure you trust the application and that it has a privacy policy or statement acceptable to you.
