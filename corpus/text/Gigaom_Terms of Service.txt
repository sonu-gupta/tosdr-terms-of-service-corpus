13.
Dispute Resolution / Jurisdiction / Agreement to Arbitrate
13.1.In General.
Certain portions of this Section 13 are deemed to be a âwritten agreement to arbitrateâ pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act.
You and GigaOm agree that we intend that this Section 13 satisfies the âwritingâ requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act.
13.2.First â Try to Resolve Disputes and Excluded Disputes.
If any controversy, allegation, or claim arises out of or relates to the Services, the Content, your User Submissions, or this Agreement (collectively, âDisputeâ), or to any of GigaOmâs actual or alleged intellectual property rights (an âExcluded Disputeâ, which includes those actions set forth in Section 13.5 below) , then you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Dispute or Excluded Dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it.
Our notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us.
But if you have failed to provide us with this information or if such information is not current or accurate, then we have no obligation under this Section 13.2.
Your notice to us must be sent to:
GigaOm
3905 State Street #7-448
Santa Barbara, CA 93105-5107
For a period of 60 days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, GigaOm and you will engage in a good faith dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the Dispute or Excluded Dispute, though nothing will require either you or GigaOm to resolve the Dispute or Excluded Dispute on terms with respect to which you and GigaOm, in each partyâs sole discretion, are not comfortable.
13.3.Forums for Alternative Dispute Resolution.

Arbitration.If we cannot resolve a Dispute as set forth in Section 13.2 above within 60 days of receipt of the notice (or, where no notice address exists for you, after such Dispute arises), then either you or we may submit the Dispute to formal arbitration in accordance with this Section 13.3.
If we cannot resolve an Excluded Dispute as set forth in Section 13.2 above within 60 days of receipt of the notice (or, where no notice address exists for you, after such Excluded Dispute arises), then either you or we may submit the Excluded Dispute to formal arbitration only if you and GigaOm consent, in a writing signed by you and GigaOmâs General Counsel, to have that Excluded Dispute subject to arbitration.
In such a case (and only in such a case), that Excluded Dispute will be deemed a âDisputeâ for the remainder of this Section 13.3.
Upon expiration of the applicable 60-day period and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, a Dispute will be resolved solely by binding arbitration in accordance with the then current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ).
If the Dispute has a claimed value of not more than $250,000, then the arbitration will be heard and determined by a single neutral arbitrator who is a retired judge or a lawyer with not less than 10 yearsâ experience as a practicing member of the bar in the substantive practice area related to the Dispute, who will administer the proceedings in accordance with the AAAâs Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes.
If the Dispute has a claimed value of more than $250,000, or if GigaOm elects in its sole discretion to bear the costs of arbitration in excess of those that would occur for a proceeding before a single neutral arbitrator, then the arbitration will be heard and determined by a three member panel, with one member to be selected by each party and the third (who will be chair of the panel) selected by the two party appointed members or by the AAA in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules.
The arbitrator or arbitration panel, as the case may be, will apply applicable law and the provisions of this Agreement, will determine any Dispute according to the applicable law and facts based upon the record and no other basis, and will issue a reasoned award.
If you and GigaOm do not both consent to the arbitration of an Excluded Dispute as set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph of this Section 13.3.A, then this paragraph and the remainder of this Section 13.3 will not apply to the Excluded Dispute.
If a party properly submits the Dispute to the AAA for formal arbitration and the AAA is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within 60 days of the filing of a âdemand for arbitration,â then either party can elect to have the arbitration administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services Inc.
(âJAMSâ) using JAMSâ streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, or by any other arbitration administration service that you and a legal officer of GigaOm consents to in writing.
The substantive practice area requirements for the arbitrator and the $250,000 threshold for the number of arbitrators assigned to the Dispute set forth in the paragraph above for the AAA arbitration will also apply to any such arbitration under JAMS or another arbitration service.
You can obtain AAA and JAMS procedures, rules, and fee information as follows: AAA:

Nature, Limitations, and Location of Alternative Dispute Resolution.
In arbitration, as with a court, the arbitrator must honor the terms of this Agreement and can award the prevailing party damages and other relief (including attorneysâ fees).
However, WITH ARBITRATION (i) THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY, (ii) THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND ARBITRATION OUTCOME ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY RULES, AND (iii) JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATION OUTCOME IS LIMITED.
All parties to the arbitration will have the right, at their own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other advocate of their choosing.
If an in-person arbitration hearing is required, then it will be conducted in Austin, Texas.
but if the applicable arbitration rules or laws require the arbitration to be conducted in the âmetropolitan statistical areaâ (as defined by the U.S.
Census Bureau) where you are a resident at the time the Dispute is submitted to arbitration, GigaOm shall have the right to elect to proceed to arbitration in such location.
You and we will pay the administrative and arbitratorâs fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules.
but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require GigaOm to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this Section 13 to be enforceable, then GigaOm will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration.
Discovery will be permitted pursuant to the applicable arbitration rules.
The arbitratorâs decision must consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim of the Dispute, and must provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and any award (if any) is based.
Judgment on the arbitration decision and award (if any) may be entered in or by any court that has jurisdiction over the parties pursuant to Section 9 of the Federal Arbitration Act.

13.4.Limited Time to File Claims.
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU OR WE WANT TO ASSERT A DISPUTE (BUT NOT AN EXCLUDED DISPUTE) AGAINST THE OTHER, THEN YOU OR WE MUST COMMENCE IT (BY DELIVERY OF WRITTEN NOTICE AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 13.2 ABOVE, WHERE FEASIBLE) WITHIN 1 YEAR AFTER THE DISPUTE ARISES â OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED.
13.5.Injunctive Relief.
The foregoing provisions of this Section 13 will not apply to any legal action taken by GigaOm to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in connection with any loss, cost, or damage (or any potential loss, cost, or damage) relating to the Services, the Content, your User Submissions and/or GigaOmâs intellectual property rights (including such GigaOm may claim that may be in dispute), GigaOmâs operations, and/or GigaOmâs products or services.
13.6.Small Claims Matters Are Excluded from Arbitration Requirement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either of us may bring a qualifying claim of Disputes (but not Excluded Disputes) in small claims court.
13.7.No Class Action Matters.
Disputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be consolidated with any other arbitrations or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party.
But if, for any reason, any court with competent jurisdiction or any arbitrator selected pursuant to Section 13.3.A above holds that this restriction is unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement in Section 13.3 above to arbitrate will not apply and the Dispute must be brought exclusively in court pursuant to Section 13.8 below.
13.8.Federal and State Courts in Austin.
Except to the extent that arbitration is required in Section 13.3 above, and except as to the enforcement of any arbitration decision or award, any action or proceeding relating to any Dispute or Excluded Dispute may only be instituted in state or federal court in Austin, Texas.
