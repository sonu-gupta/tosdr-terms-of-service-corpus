We are subject to the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and will protect your personal data in accordance with the Australian Privacy Principles ("APPs").
The APPs govern how we collect and otherwise handle your personal data.
There are also international standards relating to personal data processing and use, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), to which DesignCrowd adheres.
Where DesignCrowd is referenced either by name or by "we", "us", "our" in this policy it is intended to be inclusive of both DesignCrowd and BrandCrowd.

Under the GDPR, âpersonal dataâ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (âdata subjectâ).
an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
