What Are âCookiesâ?
Cookies are small files with pieces of information, normally consisting of just letters and numbers, which websites use when users visit them.
Software on the usersâ devices (for example, a web browser) can store cookies and send them back to the website the next time they visit, to make a specific function of the website work and to provide information about the userâs activities on the website.


For What Purposes Are Cookies Being Used?
Cookies are used in numerous ways.
For example, when analyzing traffic to a website or tracking usersâ browsing behavior.
Cookies are widely used as they allow a website to recognize a userâs device.
Cookies and other similar technologies help websites to remember the visitors and their activities, for example, the userâs login details, or the goods users wish to buy when they add goods to their online basket or proceed to the checkout on an internet shopping website.


What Are âSessionâ and âPersistentâ Cookies?
âSession Cookiesâ are removed from your device once you close your browser session.
âPersistent Cookiesâ last for longer periods on your device â after you close your browser session.
A user can delete previously set persistent cookies manually or configure the browser settings to delete cookies, as further described below.


What Are âFirst-partyâ and âThird-partyâ Cookies?
First-party cookies are set directly by the website that the user is visiting.
For the purpose of this Policy, these are cookies that are set directly by this Website.
Third-party cookies are set by a domain other than the one visited by the user.
For the purpose of this Policy, these are cookies that are set by service providers of this Website.


What Are âSimilar Technologiesâ?
Functions usually performed by a cookie can be achieved by other means.
This could include, for example, using certain characteristics to identify devices so that visits to a website can be analyzed.
Any technology that stores or accesses information on the userâs device is relevant for this purpose, and therefore it includes, for example, HTML5 local storage, Local Shared Objects and fingerprinting techniques.
Additionally, technologies like scripts, tracking pixels and plugins, wherever these are used â are also considered as similar technologies.
