As such, CDN takes reasonable steps to maintain the security, integrity and privacy of this information.

 For example, we and our service providers may collect limited information about the configuration of your computer or other device through which you visit our site, including the type of browser software you use, the operating system youâre running, the resolution of your computer monitor, the Web site that referred you, the type of mobile device youâre using to access our site (for example, iPad, iPhone, BlackBerry, Android device, tablet, etc.), and your IP address.
 (Your IP address is a numerical address that is used by computers connected to the Internet to identify your computer so that data â such as the Web pages you want to view â can be transmitted to you.
 We also use IP address information for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes.)  We use this information to make our site as useful as we can for as many users as possible.


Cookies and Pixel Tags


We may use âcookies,â a standard feature found in browser software, to enhance your experience on the site.
 Cookies are small files that your Web browser places on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes.
 We also may use pixel tags (sometimes referred to as âclear GIFsâ or âWeb beaconsâ) to collect non-personally identifying information about how our visitors use our site.
 By showing how and when visitors and registered users use the site, cookies and pixel tags help us deliver more relevant content to users, identify how many unique users visit our site and various pages within our site, and anonymously track user interests, trends and patterns.&nbsp.
For example, we may use these technologies to collect aggregate information about the time visitors spend on each page of our site, the number of visits made to each page or section of our site, and the content that visitors select and copy using the standard copy and paste tool provided in standard Web browsers.
 Providers of web analytics services may use cookies and pixel tags to gather this sort of information on our behalf.
 And Advertisers that display ads or other promotional messages (âAdsâ) on our site (and their providers of ad serving and other advertising services) may use cookies and pixel tags of their own in connection with Ads displayed on our site, as described below under the heading âData Collected in Connection with Ads.â
Providers of email transmission services use pixel tags to record whether an email is opened and whether you click on any of the links in the email, as described below under the heading âData Collected in Connection with Emails.â
We also may use cookies to record certain preferences that you enter or set while using the site.&nbsp.
For example, if you are a registered user and you opt to have the site âremember you,â weâll use cookies to automatically store your log-in information so that you wonât have to re-enter it the next time you visit.
The help function on most Web browsers contains information on how to set your browser to notify you before accepting a cookie or to disable cookies entirely.&nbsp.
However, if you donât accept cookies, you wonât be able to take advantage of various features on our site that are available to other visitors.

Data Collected in Connection with Emails


Email newsletters you elect to receive from us are transmitted through Mailchimp from The Rocket Science Group LLC.
Mailchimp uses pixel tag technology to determine whether an email has been opened.
In addition, when you click on any link in an email newsletter or marketing message you have elected to receive, Mailchimp recognizes that fact.
This information is used in the aggregate to measure the rate at which emails are opened and various links are clicked, to measure user interests and traffic patterns, and to improve the content of the email newsletters and the services and features offered through the email newsletter and marketing messages.
Because some of this information is linked to individual email addresses, it is personally identifiable.
You can view Mailchimpâs privacy policy at https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/.


Data Collected in Connection with Ads


Advertisers that display Ads on our site (and other advertising services) may use cookies and pixel tags of their own to record your Web browserâs interaction with a given Ad.&nbsp.
This technique allows the Advertiser (and its providers of ad serving and other advertising services) to track how Ads are displayed, and which are clicked on, and to limit the number of times a given Ad is shown to you.&nbsp.
The use of cookies and pixel tags may also enable these Advertisers (and their providers of ad serving and other advertising services) to serve ads to our users based on their perceived interests as gleaned from their visits to this and other Web sites.&nbsp.
For example, DoubleClick, a provider of ad serving and other advertising services, may set cookies in connection with Ads displayed on our Web site through our relationship with Google.&nbsp.
