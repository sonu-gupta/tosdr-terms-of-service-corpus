Purposes of Data Processing, Legal Bases and Legitimate Interests Pursued by skatedeluxe GmbH Or a Third Party, as well as Categories of Recipient
3.1.
Accessing our Website
When you visit our website, the browser used on your device automatically sends information to the server of our website and temporarily stores it in a so-called log file.
We have no influence over this.
The following information is also recorded without any action on your part and is stored until automated deletion:

the IP address of the requesting Internet-enabled device
the date and time of access
the website from which access initiated (HTTP referer)
the browser you use and, if applicable, the operating system of your Internet-capable device and the name of your access provider

Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR provides the legal basis for processing the IP address.
Our legitimate interest derives from the purposes of data collection listed below.
At this juncture, we would like to point out that from the data collected, no direct conclusions about your identity can be made nor are they drawn by us.
The IP address of your device and the other data listed above are used by us for the following purposes:

ensuring a smooth connection setup
ensuring comfortable use of our website
evaluating system security and stability

The data is stored for a period of 30 days and then automatically deleted.
We also use cookies, tracking tools, targeting techniques and social media plug-ins for our website.
The exact procedures and how your data is used for that will be described and explained in more detail below in section 3.4.
3.2.
Execution, Conclusion, or Termination of a Contract
The scope of activity of skatedeluxe GmbH is the remote selling of goods and services.
In this context, we process the data required for the execution, conclusion, or termination of a contract with you.
Which includes:

First Name, Last Name
Billing and Delivery Address
Email Address
Billing and payment data
Date of Birth, if applicable
Telephone Number, if necessary

The legal basis for this is Article 6 (1) (b) GDPR, i.e.
You provide us with the data based on the contractual relationship between us.
To process your email address, we are also obligated to send an electronic order confirmation due to a requirement in the Civil Code (BGB) (see Article 6 (1) (c) GDPR).
Insofar as we do not use your contact data for advertising purposes (see point 3.3.), we store the data collected for the execution of the contract until the expiration of the statutory or, if applicable, contractual warranty and guarantee rights.
After expiration of this period, we retain information of our contractual relationship as required by commercial and tax law for the statutory periods.
For this period (usually ten years from the conclusion of the contract), the data will be reprocessed in the event of a review by the tax authorities. In order to process the purchase agreement, the following data processing is necessary:
If you have selected a payment method other than Pay-In-Advance or Cash on Delivery, we pass on the required payment data to a payment service provider whom we commission.
We will forward details of your delivery address to a logistics company commissioned by us for the purpose of completing the purchase agreement.
3.3.
Data Processing for Advertising Purposes
The following statements pertain to the processing of personal data for advertising purposes.
The GDPR declares such data processing on the basis of Article 6 (1) (f) as fundamentally conceivable and as a legitimate interest.
The duration of data storage for advertising purposes is not subject to any rigid principles and is based on the question of whether the storage is required for the promotional approach.
In 3.3.4., you can read about the procedure in the case of your opposition.
3.3.1.

Online Presence and Website Optimisation
3.4.1.
Cookies â General Informationâ¨
On our website we utilise so-called Cookies.
To the extent these cookies contain personal data, their use will comply with Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR, as our interest in optimising our website is considered to be justified.
Cookies are small files that your browser automatically creates and that are stored on your device (laptop, tablet, smartphone, etc.) when you visit our site.
Cookies do not damage your device and do not contain viruses, Trojans or other malicious software.
A cookie contains information that is related to the device that you are using.
However, this does not mean that we are directly made aware of your identity.

On the one hand the use of cookies serves to enhance your visit to our website.
For example, we use so-called âsession cookiesâ to recognise that you have already visited individual pages on our website or that youâve already logged in to your customer account.
The session cookies are automatically deleted once youâve left our site.
Similarly, we also use temporary cookies that are stored on your device for a specified period of time.
If you visit our website again, it will automatically recognise that you have visited the site before and will implement any input or settings you previously applied, so that you donât have to enter them all again.
If you have a customer account with skatedeluxe and you are logged in, the information stored in cookies will be assigned to your customer account and saved.

We also use cookies to statistically record the use of our website and evaluate it for the purpose of optimising our product range and services, and to display information tailored to you.
When you visit our website, this type of cookie allows us to automatically identify that you have visited us before.
They are automatically deleted after a defined period of time.
Most browsers allow cookies automatically.
However, you can configure your browser so that no cookies are stored on your computer or so that a notice always appears before a new cookie is stored.
However, disabling cookies completely may mean that you wonât be able to use all the features of our website.
The storage period of cookies depends on their intended purpose and is not the same for everyone.
3.4.2.
Piwik
To analyse the visitor traffic on our website we use the open source tool Piwik.
With the help of a cookie stored on your device information about usage of our website will be transferred to our server and stored there.
Thus there is no data transfer to third parties or third countries.
Your IP address is anonymized immediately, so that no conclusions about you as a user are possible at all.
The data collected about you will be used to analyze and improve our website.
If you donât want us to collect and process details of your visit for statistical purposes, simply set the switch below to "ACTIVE".
In this case, the Piwik opt-out cookie is set.
Please bear in mind that your browser has to accept third party cookies to opt-out.
In case you delete browser cookies regularly, you have to opt-out anew after every deletion. Aktiv Inaktiv  
Your visit of this website is currently tracked by Piwik web analytics.
Set the switch to "ACTIVE" and your visit will no longer be tracked.
3.4.3.
Google Analytics / Universal Analytics
For the purpose of the needs-oriented design and continuous optimisation of our site, we use Google Analytics on the basis of Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR.
It is a web analysis service provided by Google Ireland Limited ("Google"), a company registered and operated under Irish law (register number: 368047), located in Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
In this context, pseudonymised usage profiles are created and cookies are used.
The information generated by the cookie about your usage of this website such as

Browser Type / Version,
Operating System being used,
Referrer-URL (the page you were previously on),
Host name of the connected device (IP-Address),
Time of the server request

are transmitted to Google servers.
Google operates servers around the world therefore your data may also be processed on servers outside of the EU, for example on Google LLC servers in the USA. In compliance with the EU Privacy Policy, Google has been certified in accordance with the Privacy Shield Agreement between the EU and USA and Switzerland and the USA. 
The information is used to evaluate the usage of the website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide other services related to website and internet usage for the purposes of market research and tailor-made website design.
This information may also be transferred to third parties if required by law or if those third parties are processing the data on Googleâs behalf.
Your IP address will never be merged with other data from Google.
The IP addresses are rendered anonymous, so that identification and assignment is not possible (so-called IP masking).
We use Google Analytics including the features of Universal Analytics.
Universal Analytics allows us to analyse the activities on our pages across devices (so-called cross-device tracking, for example, when you access via laptop and later via a tablet).
This is made possible by assigning a pseudonymous user ID to a user.
This kind of allocation occurs, for example, when you register for a customer account or when you sign into your customer account.
However, no personal information is forwarded to Google.
Adding additional features to Google Analytics with Universal Analytics does not entail any limitation or reduction of data protection measures such as IP masking or the browser add-on.
You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on the browser software.
Weâd like to point out, however, that if you elect this option, not all of the features of this website may be fully available to you.
You may also prevent the collection of data generated by the cookie and relevant to your use of the website (including your IP address) and the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing this browser add-on.
As an alternative to the browser add-on, especially for browsers on mobile devices, you can prevent Google Analytics from capturing cookies by setting the switch to "ACTIVE". Active Inactive  
An opt-out cookie will be set which prevents the future collection of your data when you visit our website.
The opt-out Cookie is only valid in this browser and only for our website and is stored on your device.
If you delete the cookies in this browser, youâll have to reset the opt-out Cookie.
For more information about privacy in connection with Google Analytics, please visit the Google Analytics website.
3.4.4.
Targeting
The targeting measures we employ listed below are implemented pursuant to Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR.
By employing these targeting measures, we strive to make sure that only advertising oriented to your actual or perceived interests is displayed on your devices, because we do not want to bother you with uninteresting ads.
3.4.4.1.
Onsite-Targeting
On our website, cookies are used to collect and evaluate information for ad optimisation.
This data may contain, for example, information about which of our products you are interested in.
The collection and evaluation are done exclusively pseudonymously and does not allow us to identify you.
More particularly, the information is not merged with personal information.
Using information about your past user behaviour, we can show you offers on our site that are specifically geared towards your interests.
The Onsite Targeting Cookies are automatically deleted after 30 days.
3.4.4.2.
Re-Targeting
We also use re-targeting technologies from Criteo GmbH and Google LLC.
(Google AdSense).
This allows us to make our online products and services more interesting for you.
To that end, a Cookie is set, with which data about your interests is collected using pseudonyms.
Based on this information, you will be shown advertisements of our offers on the websites of our partners, specifically based on your interests.
No sensitive personal information will be stored, and no user profiles will be merged with personally identifiable information about you.
The re-targeting cookies are stored for a period of 30 days and then automatically deleted.
3.4.4.3.
Facebook Pixel
On our website, we employ Facebook Pixel in the non-expanded form.
This is a JavaScript, i.e.
a program code that your browser can interpret to help us understand what we do on our site, and to show you interest-driven product information.
Details about how it works are available on the Facebook website.
The pixel acts as a so-called pseudonym, which means the use of a pixel does not result in any direct association with your person.
You have the opportunity to object to this by setting the switch to "ACTIVE". Active Inactive  
An Opt-Out Cookie is set to ensure that no Facebook pixel is set when this website is accessed.
If you use multiple browsers, youâll have to install an Opt-Out Cookie for each browser individually.
3.4.4.4.
Objection / Opt-Out Opportunity
In addition to the deactivation methods described above, you can generally prevent the aforementioned targeting technologies by setting a corresponding cookie in your browser (see point 3.4.1).
In addition, you have the option to deactivate preference-based advertising with the help of the Preference Manager available here. 3.4.5.
Social-Media-Plug-ins
As permitted by Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR, we use social media Plug-ins on our website from the social networks Facebook and Twitter to raise brand awareness.
This underlying commercial purpose is regarded as a legitimate interest in accordance with the GDPR.
Our compliance with data protection guidelines ensures liability by their respective providers.
We integrate these plug-ins by means of the so-called two-click method to best protect visitors of our website.
3.4.5.1.
Facebook
Our website uses plug-ins from the social network Facebook, which is provided by Facebook Inc.
The Facebook plug-ins are denoted by the Facebook logo with the addition of "like" or "share".
If you activate such a plug-in (first click), your browser establishes a direct connection to the Facebook servers.
The content of the plug-in is transmitted by Facebook directly to your browser and is integrated into the page.
Through this integration, Facebook receives the information that your browser has accessed that corresponding page of our website, even if you do not have a Facebook profile or are currently not logged in to Facebook.
This information (including your IP address) will be sent from your browser directly to a Facebook server in the U.S.
and stored there.
If you are logged into Facebook, Facebook can immediately assign your visit to our website to your Facebook profile. If you interact with the plug-ins, for example by clicking the "Like" button (second click), this information will also be sent directly to a Facebook server and stored there.
The information will also be posted on your Facebook profile and displayed to your Facebook friends.
For the purpose and scope of the data collection and the further processing and use of that data by Facebook, as well as your rights related thereto and settings options to protect your privacy, you can refer to Facebookâs privacy policy. If you do not want Facebook to directly associate the information gathered from your visit to our website with your Facebook profile, you must log out of Facebook before visiting our website.
3.4.5.2.
Twitter
Our website also includes the plug-in for the short message network Twitter Inc.
The Twitter plug-in ("tweet" button) is denoted by the Twitter logo (a white bird on a blue background) and the word "tweet".
When you visit a page on our website that contains such a plug-in, a direct connection is established between your browser and the Twitter server.
Twitter receives the information that you, with your IP Address, have visited our site.
If you click the Twitter button while logged in to your Twitter account, you can link the contents of our pages to your Twitter profile.
This allows Twitter to associate your visit to our pages with your account.
We would like to point out that we, as the provider of the website pages, are not aware of the content of the transmitted data and their use by Twitter.
More information can be found here.
If you do not want Twitter to associate your visit to our pages, please log out of your Twitter account.
3.5.
Customer Account
In order to provide you with the greatest possible ease while shopping, we offer you the option to permanently store your personal data in a password-protected customer account.
The creation of a customer account is voluntary and is contingent on your consent in accordance with Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR.
After setting up a customer account, no repeated data entry is necessary.
You can also view and change the data stored in your customer account at any time.
In addition to the data requested from you while placing an order, you must provide a self-chosen password in order to set up a customer account.
This, together with your email address, will be used to access your customer account.
Please treat your personal access data confidentially and, in particular, do not make it accessible to unauthorized third parties.
We cannot accept liability for misused passwords provided we are not responsible for the misuse.
Please note that after leaving our website, you will remain logged in unless you actively log out.
You have the option to delete your customer account at any time.
Please note, however, that this does not mean that the data in the customer account shall be deleted, as we are bound by statutory retention periods.
3.6.

This simplifies the registration process and you donât have to remember any additional login data.
Processing takes place in accordance with Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR.
After pressing the appropriate button you will be forwarded to Facebook, Google or Twitter.
If you are not logged in, please log in and confirm, that skatedeluxe is allowed to get access to your personal data.

Google: surname, forename, e-mail-address, Google-ID
Twitter: e-mail-address, Twitter ID

What happens after my account was connected?

3.12.
Application / Application Procedure
skatedeluxe collects and processes the personal data of applicants for the purpose of carrying out the application process.
Processing takes place in accordance with Article 6 (1) (b) GDPR.
The process can also be performed electronically.
This applies, in particular, if an applicant submits the corresponding application documents to us via email or cloud link.
Should skatedeluxe enter into a contract of employment with an applicant, the transmitted data will be stored for the purpose of implementing the employment relationship in compliance with legal requirements.
If we do not enter into a contract of employment with the applicant, the application documents will be automatically deleted two months after the notification of declination, provided that deletion does not conflict with any other legitimate interests of the person responsible for the processing.
In that sense, an example of legitimate interest would be to meet the burden of proof in proceedings pursuant to the General Act on Equal Treatment (Allgemeinen Gleichbehandlungsgesetz (AGG)).
Should we foresee the possibility to hire an applicant at a later date, we will ask for the applicantâs permission to save the application documents for future contact, beyond the aforementioned retention period.
Of course, the applicant can revoke consent to our retaining of the application documents at any time by sending an email to jobs@skatedeluxe.com or using the contact details under Section 2.

and 3.7., we do not disclose your data to recipients based outside the European Union or the European Economic Area.
The processes mentioned under points 3.4.5., 3.6.
and 3.7.
cause a transmission of data to be made to the servers of contractors appointed or used by us.
These servers are located in the U.S..
The transmission of data takes place in compliance with the principles of the âPrivacy Shieldâ, as well as on the basis of the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs).

You have the right to information about your personal data stored by us in accordance with Art.
15 GDPR.
In particular, you are entitled to information about processing purposes, the category of personal information, the categories of recipients to whom your information has been disclosed, the projected retention period of your data, and the source of your data, if not collected directly from you.
You have the right to rectification, i.e.
the right to correct inaccurate data or to complete correct, yet incomplete, data in accordance with Art.
16 GDPR.
You have the right to erase your personal data stored by us in accordance with.
Art.
17 GDPR, except insofar as required by statutory and/or contractual retention periods.
Other statutory obligations and/or rights for further storage are also to be observed.
You have the right to restrict the processing of your data in accordance with Art.
18 GDPR, provided that (1) the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of the personal data, and instead request the restriction of their use, (2) the person responsible for the data no longer needs it, but you need it for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, or (3) you have objected to processing in accordance with Art.
21 GDPR.
You have the right to data portability in accordance with Art.
20 GDPR, i.e.
You have the right to receive selected data concerning yourself, which you have provided to us, in a commonly-used, machine-readable format or to request to have the personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another.
You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
As a rule, you can contact the supervisory authority of your place of residence or work, or of our company headquarters.

5.2.
Right to Object

Under the conditions of Article 21 (1) GDPR, data processing can be objected to for reasons related to the concerned personâs particular situation.

The aforementioned general right to object applies to all processing purposes described in this Privacy Policy, which are handled on the basis of Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR.
Unlike the special right to object to data processing for commercial purposes (see point 3.3.4.), according to the GDPR, we are only obligated to execute such a general objection if you can provide us with reasons of overriding importance (e.g.
possible threat to life or health).
Furthermore, it is possible to contact the supervisory authority responsible for skatedeluxe GmbH or our data protection officer (see Section 2).
6.
Data Security Measures
All of the personal data that you share with us, including your payment details, is transmitted via the general, commonly used and secure standard SSL (Secure Socket Layer).
SSL is a secure and proven Standard, which is also used in online banking, for example.
You can recognise a secure SSL connection by, among other things, the added âsâ on the http (i.e.
âhttpsâ) in the address bar of your browser and a padlock icon, which, depending on the browser, used is also typically located near the address bar.
Of course, we take the appropriate technical and organisational security measures to protect your personal data against manipulation, partial or complete loss, and against unauthorized access by third parties.
Our security measures are continuously improved in line with technological developments.
