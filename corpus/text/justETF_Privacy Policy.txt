&nbsp.
Cookies and right to object for direct marketing purposes
"Cookies" are small files that are stored on users' computers.
Different information can be stored within the cookies.
A cookie is primarily used to store the information about a user (or the device on which the cookie is stored) during or after his visit to an online offer.
Temporary cookies, or "session cookies" or "transient cookies", are cookies that are deleted after a user leaves an online service and closes his browser.
In such a cookie, e.g.
the contents of a shopping cart in an online shop or a login status are saved.
The term "permanent" or "persistent" refers to cookies that remain stored even after the browser has been closed.
Thus, e.g.
the login status will be saved if users visit it after several days.
Likewise, in such a cookie the interests of the users can be stored, which are used for measurement of reach or marketing purposes.
A "third-party cookie" refers to cookies that are offered by providers other than the person responsible for providing the online offer (otherwise, if only their cookies are called "first-party cookies").

We can use temporary and permanent cookies and clarify this in the context of our privacy policy.

If you do not want cookies stored on your computer, you will be asked to disable the corresponding option in the system settings of your browser.
Saved cookies can be deleted in the system settings of the browser.
The exclusion of cookies can lead to functional restrictions of our online offering.

A general objection to the use of cookies used for online marketing purposes can be done with a variety of services, especially in the case of tracking, via the US website https://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or the EU site https://www.youronlinechoices.com/.
The same result can be achieved by switching cookies off in the settings of the browser.
Again, the exclusion of cookies can lead to functional restrictions of our online offering.

&nbsp.
Automatic collection of personal data
When you access our websites, your browser automatically transmits certain data for technical reasons.
The following data are stored separately from any other data you may transmit to us:
&nbsp.

Date and time of access

The data entered during registration will be used for the purpose of using the user account and its purpose.

Users will be informed via email about relevant information regarding their user account, e.g.
technical changes, portfolio reports and portfolio alert notifications.

If users have terminated their user account, their data will be deleted with respect to the user account, subject to a statutory retention requirement.
It is the responsibility of the users to secure their data upon termination before the end of the contract.
We are entitled to irretrievably delete all user data stored during the term of the contract.

Newsletter
With the following information, we inform you about the content of our newsletter as well as the registration, sending and statistical evaluation procedures as well as your right of objection.
By subscribing to our newsletter, you agree to the receipt and the procedures described.

Content of the newsletter: We send newsletters, emails and other electronic notifications with advertising information (hereinafter "newsletter") only with the consent of the recipient or legal permission.
Insofar as the content of a newsletter is concretely described, they are authoritative for the consent of the users.
Among others, our newsletter contains information about our services and us.

Double opt-in and logging: Registration for our newsletter is done in a so-called double-opt-in procedure.
You receive an email asking you to confirm your registration after you registered (e.g.
at www.justetf.com/newsletter).
This confirmation is necessary so that nobody can register with external email addresses.
The registration for the newsletter will be logged in order to prove the registration process according to the legal requirements.
This includes saving the registration and confirmation times.
Likewise, changes to your data stored with the newsletter service provider will be logged.

Sign-up credentials: To sign up for the newsletter, it is sufficient to provide your email address.
Optionally, we ask you to give a surname and first name for a personal salutation.

The sending of the newsletter and the associated performance measurement are based on the consent of the recipients acc.

f GDPR in combination with Art.

The logging of the registration process is based on our legitimate interests in accordance with Art.
6 (1) lit.
f GDPR.
Our interest lies in the use of a user-friendly and secure newsletter system, which serves both our business interests and the expectations of the users and also allows us to prove our consent.

Termination / Revocation: You can terminate the receipt of our newsletter at any time, i.e.
revoke your consent.
A link to cancel the newsletter can be found at the end of each newsletter.
We may save the email addresses for up to three years on the basis of our legitimate interests before we delete them in order to provide evidence of prior consent.
The processing of this data is limited to the purpose of a possible defence against claims.
An individual request for cancellation is possible at any time, provided that at the same time the former existence of consent is confirmed.

The newsletter is sent by the newsletter service provider CleverReach GmbH &amp.
Co.
KG, MÃ¼hlenstrasse 43, 26180 Rastede, Germany.
The privacy policy of the shipping service provider can be viewed here: https://www.cleverreach.com/de/datenschutz/.
The newsletter service provider is used based on our legitimate interests acc.
Art.
6 (1) lit.
f GDPR and a contract processing agreement acc.
Art.
28 (3) sentence 1 GDPR.

The newsletter service provider may use the data of the recipients in pseudonymous form, i.e.
without assignment to a user, to optimise or improve their own services, e.g.
for the technical optimisation of sending and the presentation of newsletters or for statistical purposes.
However, the shipping service provider does not use the data of our newsletter recipients to address them themselves or to pass the data on to third parties.

The newsletters contain a so-called "web beacon", i.e.
a pixel-sized file that is retrieved from our server when opening the newsletter or from the server of the newsletter service provider.
This request will collect technical information, such as information about the browser and your system, as well as your IP address and time of retrieval.

This information is used to improve the technical performance of services based on technical data or audience and their reading habits, based on their locations (which can be determined using the IP address) or access times.
Statistical surveys also include determining if the newsletters are opened, when they will be opened and which links will be clicked.
For technical reasons, this information can be assigned to the individual newsletter recipients.
However, it is neither our goal nor that of the newsletter service provider to observe individual users.
The evaluations serve us much more to recognise the reading habits of our users and to adapt our content to them or to send different content according to the interests of our users.

A separate revocation of the performance measurement is unfortunately not possible, in this case, the entire newsletter subscription must be terminated.

&nbsp.
Contact form and other forms of getting in touch with us
When you contact us (e.g.
by contact form, email, telephone or via social media), we will process the contact request based on the received data in accordance with.
Art.
6 (1) lit.
f GDPR.
User information can be stored in a customer relationship management system ("CRM System") or comparable software.

We delete the requests if they are no longer required.
We check the necessity every six months.
furthermore, the legal archiving obligations apply.

&nbsp.
Participation in affiliate programs
Within our online offer, we rely on our legitimate interests (i.e., interest in the analysis, optimisation and economic operation of our online offering) acc.
Art.
6 (1) lit.
f GDPR industry-standard tracking measures, as far as these are necessary for the operation of the affiliate system.
Below we give clarification about the technical background.

The services offered by our contractual partners can also be advertised and linked to other websites (so-called affiliate links or after-buy systems, if, for example, links or services of third parties are offered after the conclusion of a contract).
The operators of the respective websites receive a commission if users follow the affiliate links and then take advantage of the offers.

In summary, our online offering requires us to be able to keep track of whether users who are interested in products/services advertised in our online offering through affiliate links.
For this, the affiliate links are supplemented by certain values that are part of the link or set otherwise, e.g.
in a cookie.
The values include in particular the source website (referrer), time, an online identifier of the operator of the website on which the affiliate link was located, an online identifier of the respective offer, an online identifier of the user, as well as tracking specific values such as ad ID, affiliate ID, and categorisations.

The user IDs used by us are pseudonymous values.

Google AdWords and conversion tracking
We use the services of Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, ("Google") on the basis of our legitimate interests (i.e.
interest in the analysis, optimisation and economic operation of our online service within the meaning of Art.
6 (1) lit.
f GDPR).

Google is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement, which provides a guarantee to comply with European privacy legislation (https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active).

We use Google's online AdWords marketing tool "AdWords" to place ads on the Google advertising network (e.g., in search results, in videos, on websites, etc.) so that they are displayed to users who have a suspected interest in the ads.
This allows us to more specifically display ads for and within our online offering so that we only present ads to users that potentially match their interests.
âRemarketingâ in this regard is targeted advertising of a product to a user in which he has previously shown an interest on a different website.

For this purpose, Google executes a code to set (re)marketing tags (invisible graphics or code also known as âweb beaconsâ on our website or any other website that belongs to the Google Advertising Network.

With their help, the user is provided with an individual cookie, i.e.
a small file is saved (instead of cookies, comparable technologies can also be used).
In this file is noted which websites the user visited, in which content he is interested and what offers the user has clicked, as well as technical information about the browser and operating system, referring websites, visit time and other information on the use of the online offering.

Furthermore, we receive an individual "conversion cookie".
The information obtained through the cookie is used by Google to generate conversion statistics for us.
We only receive the anonymous total number of users who clicked on our ad and were redirected to a conversion tracking tag page.
We do not receive any information that personally identifies users.

The data of the users are pseudonym processed within the Google advertising network.
That means, Google does not store and process the name or email address of the users but links the cookie data to pseudonymous user profiles.
From the perspective of Google, the ads are not managed and displayed to a specifically identified person, but to the cookie owner, regardless of who that cookie owner is.
This does not apply if a user has explicitly allowed Google to process the data without this pseudonymisation.
The information collected about users is transmitted to Google and stored on Google's servers in the United States.

For more information about Google's data usage, settings and withdrawal options, please read Google's privacy policy (https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads) and Google's ads settings options (https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated).

With the help of the Facebook pixel, Facebook is able to designate you as a visitor to our online offer as a target group for the presentation of advertisements (so-called "Facebook ads").
Accordingly, we use the Facebook Pixel to display the Facebook ads only to those Facebook users who have also shown an interest in our online offering or certain features (e.g.
interests in certain topics or products that have been visited by them), which we transmit to Facebook (so-called "Custom Audiences").
With the help of the Facebook pixel, we also want to make sure that our Facebook ads are in line with the potential interest of users and are not annoying.
With the help of the Facebook pixel, we can also understand the effectiveness of the Facebook ads for statistical and market research purposes, in which we see whether users were redirected to our website after clicking on a Facebook ad (so-called "conversion").

Privacy Policy of Facebook: The processing of the data by Facebook is within the scope of the data usage policy of Facebook.
For general tips on how to display Facebook ads, see data usage policy of Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/policy.php).

Purpose: The use of Facebook Pixel as well as the storage of "conversion cookies" is based on Art.
6 para.
1 lit.
f DSGVO.
We have a legitimate interest in analysing user behaviour in order to optimise both our website and our advertising.

Data processing contract: For the processing of the data in which Facebook acts as a data processor, we have a data processing contract with Facebook, in which we commit Facebook to protect the data of our customers and not to pass them on to third parties.

Objections: While we have legitimate interests in using the Facebook Pixel and storing "conversion cookies", we offer opt-out options.
You may object to the capture by the Facebook Pixel and use of your data to display Facebook ads.
To set which types of ads you see within Facebook, you can go to the page set up by Facebook and follow the instructions for the usage-based advertising settings (https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/?entry_product=ad_settings_screen#_=_).
The settings are platform-independent which means that they are adopted for all devices, such as desktop computers or mobile devices.

&nbsp.
Share content via social media buttons
We do not use plugins from social networks on our website such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn and Xing.
Our content sharing buttons are implemented via so-called deep links, which only pass on data to the respective network operators when you use them.

Only when you click on such a button, various data are transmitted to the respective social network.
This may include: the date and time of the visit to the site, the URL of the site on which the visitor is located, the URL of the site the visitor previously visited, the browser used, the operating system used and the IP address of the visitor.

If you are logged in parallel to the respective social network (Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn or Xing) while visiting our page, it is not excluded that the provider assigns the visit to your network account.
If you click on a social media button (e.g.
clicking the "Like" button, submit a comment), this information is also transmitted directly from your browser to the respective social network and stored there if necessary.
The purpose and scope of the data collection and the further processing and use of the data by the networks can be found in the privacy policies of Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn and Xing.

Disclosure of data
Basically, a transfer of your personal data without your express prior consent only takes place in the following cases:
&nbsp.

If it serves investigations of illegal use of the platform or is required to pursue legal claims, personal data may be shared with law enforcement agencies and third-party victims.
Such transfer of data will be made only where there is specific evidence for illegal or abusive conduct.
Data may further be shared where it serves the enforcement of terms of use or other contractual agreements.
justETF is furthermore legally obliged to disclose certain information to certain public entities upon request.
Such entities include law enforcement agencies that investigate administrative offences subject to fines and tax authorities.
 The disclosure of this data is based on our legitimate interest in the fight against abuse, the prosecution of criminal offences and the protection, assertion and enforcement of claims and that your rights and interests in the protection of your personal data do not predominate, Art.
6 (1) lit.
f GDPR.  
We rely on contracted external companies and external service providers ("contract processors") to provide our services.
In such cases, personal data will be shared with these processors to allow them to be further processed.
These processors are carefully selected and regularly reviewed by us to ensure your privacy is maintained.
The processors may only use the data for the purposes specified by us and, in addition, contractually oblige us to treat your data exclusively in accordance with this privacy policy and German data protection laws.  
As our business evolves, the structure of justETF GmbH may change, for instance by a change in legal form or creation, acquisition or sale of subsidiaries, branches or parts of a company.
In the course of such transactions, customer data will be transferred together with the relevant part of the company being transferred.
In each case of a transfer of personal data to third parties to the extent described above, justETF will ensure that such transfer is made in accordance with this privacy policy and applicable data protection law.
 Any disclosure of personal data is justified by the fact that we have a legitimate interest in adapting our corporate form as required by economic and legal circumstances and do not outweigh your rights and interests in the protection of your personal data, Art.
6 (1) lit.
f GDPR.

&nbsp.
Change of purpose
Processing of your personal data for purposes other than those described will only take place if a legal provision allows this or if you have consented to the changed purpose of the data processing.
In the event of further processing for purposes other than those for which the data was originally collected, we will inform you of these other purposes before further processing and provide you with all other relevant information.

&nbsp.
Deletion of your data
We will delete or anonymise your personal data as soon as it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which we collected or used it in accordance with the preceding paragraphs.
As a rule, we store your personal data for the duration of the use or contractual relationship via the website.

When you delete your user account, your profile will be completely and permanently deleted.

After the expiration of these periods the data will be deleted, as far as these data are not needed longer because of legal storage periods, for the criminal prosecution or for the protection, assertion or enforcement of legal claims.
In this case, they will be locked.
The data is then no longer available for further use.

&nbsp.
Changes to privacy policy
justETF reserves the right to modify this privacy policy.
The current version of the privacy policy is always accessible at www.justetf.com/dataprivacy.
