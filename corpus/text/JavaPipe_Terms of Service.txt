As a convenience to you, and not as a binding commitment, we may notify you via an email message or via your account when renewal fees are due.
Should these fees go unpaid, your Services will expire or be cancelled.
Payment must be made by credit card or such other method as we may allow or require from time to time.
If you select automatic renewal of the Service(s), we may attempt to renew the Service(s) a reasonable time before expiration, provided your credit card or other billing information is available and up to date.
You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to keep your billing information up to date and that we are not required to, but that we may, contact you to update this information in the event that an attempted transaction is not processed successfully.
*Please note: for certain TLDs, the automatic renewal option is not available.ACCOUNT CONTACT INFORMATION AND DOMAIN NAME WHOIS INFORMATION:As further consideration for the Service(s), you agree to provide certain current, complete and accurate information about you, both with respect to your account information and with respect to the WHOIS information for your domain name(s).
You agree to maintain and update this information as needed to keep it current, complete and accurate.
With respect to you, the administrative, technical, and billing contacts for your domain name registration(s) and other Service(s), you must submit the following: name, postal address, e-mail address, voice telephone number, and where available, fax number.
You agree that the type of information you are required to provide may change and you understand that, if you do not provide the newly required information, your registration or and/or other Service(s) may be suspended or terminated or may not be renewed.
Not providing requested information may prevent you from obtaining all Service(s).
You may provide information regarding the name-servers assigned to your domain name(s) and, if we are providing name-server services to you, the DNS settings for the domain name.
If you do not provide complete name-server information, or if you purchase âName Onlyâ Services, you agree that we may supply this information (and point your domain name to a website of our choosing) until such time as you elect to supply the name-server information or until such time as you elect to upgrade from âName Onlyâ Services.YOUR OBLIGATIONS AND REPRESENTATIONS RELATING TO THE ACCOUNT AND WHOIS CONTACT INFORMATION:In the event that, in registering a domain name or obtaining other Service(s), you provide information about or on behalf of a third party, you represent that you have (a) provided notice to that third party of the disclosure and use of that partyâs information as set forth in this Agreement, and (b) that you have obtained the third partyâs express consent to the disclosure and use of that partyâs information as set forth in this Agreement.
By registering a domain name or applying for other Service(s) you also represent that the statements in your application are true and you also represent that the domain name is not being registered or the Services being procured for any unlawful purpose.
You acknowledge that providing inaccurate information or failing to update information promptly will constitute a material breach of this Agreement and will be sufficient basis for suspension or termination of Services to you.
You further agree that your failure to respond for over ten (10) calendar days to inquiries by us concerning the accuracy of account and WHOIS contact information shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement and will be sufficient basis for suspension or termination of Service(s) to you.
As indicated elsewhere in this Agreement, you understand that it is important for you to regularly monitor email sent to the email address associated with your account and WHOIS contact information because, among other reasons, if a dispute arises regarding a domain name(s) or other Service(s), you may loose your rights to the domain name(s) or your right to receive the Service(s) if you do not respond appropriately to an email sent in conjunction therewith.ACCESSING YOUR ACCOUNT AND AN IMPORTANT LIMITATION OF OUR LIABILITY:In order to change any of your account or domain name WHOIS information, you must access your account with your Primary Service Provider (if any), or your account with us.
Please safeguard your account login identifier and password from any unauthorized use.
You agree that any person in possession of you account login identifier and password will have the ability and your authorization to modify your account and domain name information.
We will take reasonable precautions to protect the information we obtain from you from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction of that information and that such reasonable precautions include procedures for releasing account access information to parties who claim to have lost account access information.
You agree that, if we take reasonable precautions in relation thereto, that IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE IF SUCH REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS DO NOT PREVENT THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OR MISUSE OF YOUR ACCOUNT IDENTIFIER OR PASSWORD AND THAT, EVEN IF WE FAIL TO TAKE REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS, THAT OUR LIABILITY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL BE LIMITED BY THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY PROVISION FOUND BELOW IN THIS AGREEMENT.
If you contact us alleging that a third party has unauthorized access to your account or domain names, you agree that we may charge you administrative fees of $50 (US dollars) per hour for our time spent in relation to the matter, regardless of whether or not we return control over the account and/or domain names to you.TRANSFERS:You agree that transfer of your domain name(s) services shall be governed by ICANNâs transfer policy, available at http://www.icann.org/transfers/, as this policy may be modified from time to time.
You agree that we may place a âRegistrar Lockâ on your domain name services and that this will prevent your domain name services from being transferred without your authorization, though we are not required to do so.
By allowing your domain name services to remain locked, you provide express objection to any and all transfer requests until the lock is removed.
To transfer your domain name(s) you should first login to your account to lock or unlock your domain name(s) and/or to obtain the EPP âAuthCodeâ which is required to transfer domain services in an EPP registry (such as .org).
Only the registrant and the administrative contacts listed in the WHOIS information may approve or deny a transfer request.
Without limitation, domain name services may not be transferred within 60 days of initial registration, within 60 days of a transfer, if there is a dispute regarding the identity of the domain name registrant, if you are bankrupt, or if you fail to pay fees when due.
We will follow the procedures for both gaining and loosing registrars as outlined in ICANNâs transfer policies.
Transfer requests typically take five business days to be processed.
A transfer will not be processed if, during this time, the domain name registration services expire in which event you may need to reinstate the transfer request.
You may be required to resubmit a transfer request if there is a communication failure or other problem at either our end or at the registry.
AS A CONSEQUENCE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ASSUME ALL RISK FOR FAILURE OF A TRANSFER IF THE TRANSFER PROCESS IS INITIATED CLOSE TO THE END OF A REGISTRATION TERM.PRIVACY POLICY:You agree and consent that we will make available the domain name registration information you provide or that we otherwise maintain to the following parties: ICANN, the registry administrator(s), and to other third parties as ICANN and applicable laws may require or permit (including through web-based and other on-line WHOIS lookup systems), whether during or after the term of your domain name registration services of the domain name.
You hereby irrevocably waive any and all claims and causes of action you may have arising from such disclosure or use of such information.
Additionally, you acknowledge that ICANN may establish or modify the guidelines, limits and/or requirements that relate to the amount and type of information that we may or must make available to the public or to private entities, and the manner in which such information is made available.
Information regarding ICANNâs guidelines and requirements regarding WHOIS can be found at http://www.icann.org/registrars/wmrp.htm, http://www.icann.org/registrars/wdrp.htm, and elsewhere on the ICANN website at http://www.icann.org/index.html.
You agree that we may make publicly available, or directly available to third parties, some, or all, of the information you provide, for purposes of inspection (such as through our WHOIS service) or for targeted marketing and other purposes as required or permitted by applicable laws.
One of the ways that we may make some or all of the information you provide available to the public or third parties is by way of bulk WHOIS data access provided to third parties who enter into a bulk WHOIS data access agreement with us.AFTER EXPIRATION OF THE TERM OF A DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATION:Immediately after the expiration of the term of domain name registration services and before deletion of the domain name in the applicable registryâs database, you acknowledge that we may direct the domain name to name-servers and IP address(es) designated by us, including, without limitation, to no IP address or to IP address(es) which host a parking page or a commercial search engine that may display advertisements, and you acknowledge that we may either leave your WHOIS information intact or that we may change the contact information in the WHOIS output for the expired domain name so that you are no longer the listed registrant of the expired domain name.
Reactivation Period Process.
For a period of approximately 30 days after expiration of the term of domain name registration services, you acknowledge that we may provide a procedure by which expired domain name registration services may be renewed.
You acknowledge and agree that we may, but are not obligated to, offer this process, called the âreactivation period.â You acknowledge that you assume all risks and all consequences if you wait until close to or after the expiration of the original term of domain name registration services to attempt to renew the domain name registration services.
You acknowledge that we, for any reason and in our sole discretion, may choose not to offer a reactivation period and that we shall not be liable therefore.
You acknowledge that reactivation period renewal processes, if any, may involve additional fees which we and your Primary Service Provider may determine.
You acknowledge and agree that we may make expired domain name services(s) available to third parties, that we may auction off the rights to expired domain name services (the auction beginning close to the end or after the end of the reactivation period), and/or that expired domain name registration services may be re-registered to any party at any time.
After the reactivation period, you agree that we may either (i) discontinue the domain name registration services at any time thereafter, (ii) that we may pay the registryâs registration fee or otherwise provide for the registration services to be continued, or, (iii) if we auctioned the domain name services to a third party, that we may transfer the domain name registration services to such third party.
In the case of (i), above, you acknowledge that certain registry administrators may provide procedures by which discontinued domain name registration services may nonetheless be renewed.
You acknowledge and agree that we may, but are not obligated to, participate in this process, typically called the âRedemption Grace Periodâ (âRGPâ).
You acknowledge that we, for any reason and in our sole discretion, may choose not to participate in the RGP process with respect to any or all of your domain name registration services and that we shall not be liable therefore.
If available, RGP typically ends between 30 and 42 days after the end of the reactivation period of the domain name services, as the reactivation period applied to you.
The typical RGP fee is $160 plus any registration fees.
You agree that we are not obliged to contact you to alert you that the domain name registration services are being discontinued.
In the case of (ii), above, you acknowledge that we may then set the name-servers and the DNS settings for the domain name services, that we set the DNS to point to no IP address or to IP address(es) which host parking page(s) or a commercial search engine that may display paid advertisements, and you acknowledge that we may change the contact information in the WHOIS output for the expired domain name so that you are no longer the listed registrant of the expired domain name.
You acknowledge that we do not have to pay you any of the proceeds, if any, we may earn as a result.
You agree that we are not obliged to contact you to alert you that the domain name registration services are being continued.
In this case, the domain name will be designated as being in the extended redemption grace period (âERGPâ), and you will be allowed to assume, during the first 120 days of the then extant registration term, complete management of the domain name services, including the right to control the DNS settings, provided that you pay a fee of $160 (US dollars) plus any registration fees.
After the end of the 120-day period, if you do not exercise your rights under this provision, you agree that you have abandoned the domain name services, and relinquish all rights and use of the domain name services.
In the case of (iii), above, the third party who won the auction for the domain name services will control the domain name services, including control over the WHOIS information and the DNS settings.
You may recover the domain name registration services for a period of up to 42 days after the end of the reactivation period, as such reactivation period applied to you.
You agree that we are not obliged to contact you to alert you that the domain name registration services are or were auctioned.
You acknowledge that we do not have to pay you any of the proceeds, if any, we may earn as a result of such an auction.
To exercise your rights to recover auctioned domain name services, you must contact us and provide us with a certified letter addressed to âExpiration Recoveryâ and including documents setting forth your identity and address, which identity and address must be the same as that of the registrant as it was listed in the WHOIS information for the domain name services prior to expiration, a copy of a commonly accepted (in the United States) picture ID (such as a drivers license or passport) which supports your identity and address claim, a front and back photocopy of your credit card and you must a statement authorizing payment of the reinstatement fee to such credit card, which is $160 plus any registration fees.
In doing so, you must provide us with sufficient time to allow us to receive and evaluate your documents and to contact the auction winner prior to the end of 30 days after the end of the reactivation period of the domain name services.LIMITATION OF LIABILITY:YOU AGREE THAT WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY (1) SUSPENSION OR LOSS OF THE SERVICE(S), INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATION SERVICES, (2) USE OF THE SERVICE(S), INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATION SERVICES, (3) INTERRUPTION OF OUR SERVICES OR INTERRUPTION OF YOUR BUSINESS, (4) ACCESS DELAYS OR ACCESS INTERRUPTIONS TO OUR WEB SITE(S) OR SERVICE(S) OR DELAYS OR ACCESS INTERRUPTIONS YOU EXPERIENCE IN RELATION TO A DOMAIN NAME REGISTERED WITH US.

IN NO EVENT SHALL OUR OR YOUR PRIMARY SERVICE PROVIDERâS MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID BY YOU FOR REGISTRATION OF THE DOMAIN NAME, BUT IN NO EVENT GREATER THAN FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS ($400.00 US Dollars).
BECAUSE SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, IN SUCH STATES, OUR AND/OR YOUR PRIMARY SERVICE PROVIDERâS LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.INDEMNITY:With respect to ICANN, the registry operators, us, and your Primary Service Provider, as well as the contractors, agents, employees, officers, directors, shareholders, and affiliates of such parties, you agree to release, indemnify, and hold such parties harmless from all liabilities, claims and expenses, including attorneyâs fees and court costs, for third party claims relating to or arising under this Agreement, the Service(s) provided hereunder, or your use of the Service(s), including, without limitation, infringement by you, or by anyone else using the Service(s) we provide to you, of any intellectual property or other proprietary right of any person or entity, or from the violation of any of our operating rules or policies relating to the Service(s) provided.
When we may be involved in a suit involving a third party and which is related to our Service(s) to you under this Agreement, we may seek written assurances from you in which you promise to indemnify and hold us harmless from the costs and liabilities described in this paragraph.
Such written assurances may include, in our sole discretion, the posting of a performance bond(s) or other guarantees reasonably calculated to guarantee payment.
Your failure to provide such assurances may be considered by us to be a breach of this Agreement by you and may, in our sole discretion, result in loss of your right to control the disposition of domain name services for which you are the registrant and in relation to which we are the registrar of record.
This indemnification is in addition to any indemnification required under the UDRP.
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES: YOU REPRESENT THAT, TO THE BEST OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE AND BELIEF, NEITHER THE REGISTRATION OF A DOMAIN NAME NOR THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY USED NOR THE USE OF OTHER OF THE SERVICE(S) INFRINGES THE LEGAL RIGHTS OF A THIRD PARTY.
