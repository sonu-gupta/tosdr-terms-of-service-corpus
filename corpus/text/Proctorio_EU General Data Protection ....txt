The EU General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") came into force across the European Union on May 25, 2018, and brought significant changes to data protection law.
Based on privacy by design and taking a risk-based approach, GDPR is designed to meet the requirements of the digital age.
The 21st Century brings with it broader use of technology, new definitions of what constitutes personal data, and a vast increase in cross-border processing.
GDPR aims to standardize data protection laws and processing across the EU.
affording individuals stronger, more consistent rights to access and control their personal information. Our Commitment
Proctorio is committed to ensuring the security and protection of the personal information that we process, and to provide a compliant and consistent approach to data protection.
We have always had a robust and effective data protection program in place that exceeds existing laws and abides by the most robust data protection principles.
We hereby recognize our obligations and support the demands of GDPR.
Proctorio is dedicated to safeguarding the personal information under our remit and in developing a data protection regime that is effective, fit for purpose and demonstrates an understanding of, and appreciation for GDPR.
We have developed and implemented of data protection roles, policies, procedures, controls and measures to ensure maximum and ongoing compliance. How We Comply with GDPR
Proctorio has a high level of data protection and security across our organisation.
We perform and continue to perform the following:

We carry out strict due diligence checks with all recipients of personal information to assess and verify that they have appropriate safeguards in place to protect the information, ensure enforceable data subject rights and have effective legal remedies for data subjects where applicable.

Subject Access Request (SAR) â we have revised our SAR procedures to accommodate the revised 30-day time frame for providing the requested information and for making this provision free of charge.
Our procedures detail how to verify the data subject, what steps to take for processing an access request, what exemptions apply and a suite of response templates to ensure that communications with data subjects are compliant, consistent and adequate.

Legal Basis for Processing â we reviewed all processing activities to identify the legal basis for processing and ensuring that each basis is appropriate for the related activity.
Where applicable, we also maintain records of our processing activities, ensuring that our obligations under Article 30 of GDPR and Schedule 1 of the Data Protection Bill are met.

Privacy Notice/Policy â we have revised our Privacy Notices to comply with GDPR, ensuring that all individuals whose personal information we process have been informed of why we need it, how it is used, what their rights are, who the information is disclosed to and what safeguarding measures are in place to protect their information.

Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA) â where we process personal information that is considered high risk, involves large scale processing or includes special category/criminal conviction data.
we have developed stringent procedures and assessment templates for carrying out impact assessments that comply fully with GDPRâs Article 35 requirements.
We have implemented documentation processes that record each assessment, allow us to rate the risk posed by the processing activity and implement mitigating measures to reduce the risk posed to the data subjects.

Processor Agreements â where we use any third-party to process personal information on our behalf (i.e.
Payroll, Recruitment, Hosting, etc.), we have drafted compliant Processor Agreements and due diligence procedures for ensuring that they (as well as we), meet and understand their/our GDPR obligations.
These measures include initial and ongoing reviews of the service provided, the necessity of the processing activity, the technical and organizational measures in place and compliance with GDPR.

Special Categories Data â where we obtain and process any special category information, we do so in compliance with the Article 9 requirements and have high-level encryptions and protections on all such data.
