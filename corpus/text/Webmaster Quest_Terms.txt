Your site can have a maximum of one popup window because they are annoying for users of the service.
Note sites also cannot generate additional popups once a popup is closed.

Preferably don't have any popup windows on your site at all.
That makes your visitors more happy.
Note often people will leave a site just by seeing a popup window.

The one popup include any popups on the site, popups, popins and exit ads.
And new window opened without the user clicking anything is a popup.
Even if opened in the same browser window.
