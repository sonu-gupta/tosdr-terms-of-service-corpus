Some Services, including but not limited to the BitTorrent Wallet, may also be subject to a subscription or other agreement, posted guidelines, rules, or terms of service (âAdditional Termsâ), which may be included in these General Terms, or in the specific Service you access.
If there is any conflict between the General Terms and the Additional Terms, the Additional Terms take precedence in relation to that Service.
The General Terms and any applicable Additional Terms and all other documents incorporated by reference in these General Terms are referred to herein as the âTerms.â

In these General Terms, âMaterialsâ means any content made available or enabled by BitTorrent, you, or other Users, and includes, without limitation, any (i) information, data, documents, images, photographs, graphics, audio, videos, or webcasts, (ii) products, and (iii) BitTorrent software code and associated documentation (âSoftwareâ).
âBitTorrent Materialsâ means those Materials that are made available through the Services specifically by BitTorrent or its licensors, while Materials made available or enabled by you or other Users are referred to herein as âUser Content.â

You may not use the Services if you are prohibited by Law (as defined below in Section 2(d)) from receiving or using the Services.
Also, unless expressly stated in the Additional Terms for any given Service, you may not use the Services unless you are fully able and competent to enter into the conditions, obligations, representations and other terms of these General Terms and are either of legal age to form a binding contract with BitTorrent, possess legal parental or guardian consent, or are an emancipated minor.
In particular, unless expressly stated in the Additional Terms for any given Service, you must be over the age of 13 to use our Services and acknowledge that these Services were not intended for children under 13.
Additionally, if you are under the age of 18, you must have your parent or legal guardian review these Terms and accept them on your behalf.
Parents and legal guardians are responsible for the acts of their children using the Services.

BitTorrent makes certain Services and Materials available only if you have paid a fee or have created a BitTorrent ID and password or other log-in ID and password (collectively, âAccount Informationâ).
You agree that your Account Information will always be complete, accurate, and up-to-date.
It is your responsibility to keep your Account Information confidential at all times, and you are solely responsible for all activity that occurs to your Account Information when you are logged in to your account.
If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your account or Account Information, or any other breach of security, you agree to notify BitTorrent immediately.
You may not use another personâs Account Information, create an account for anyone other than yourself, or sell, rent, lease, share or provide access to your Account Information to anyone else.
BitTorrent may require that you change your Account Information or certain parts of your Account Information at any time for any reason.

BitTorrent may change the Terms from time to time at its sole discretion, including by imposing a charge for access to or use of a Service.
If such changes are made, BitTorrent will make the updated copy of the General Terms available at www.bittorrent.com/legal/terms-of-use, with any new Additional Terms made available to you from within or through the affected Service.
Where required by law, BitTorrent may require you to provide consent to the updated Terms in a specified manner before further use of the Services is permitted.
Otherwise, your continued use of any affected Service constitutes your acceptance of the changes.
Your use of the Services is subject to the most current version of the Terms posted on or through the affected Service at the time of such use.
Please regularly check www.bittorrent.com/legal/terms-of-use to view the then-current General Terms and check each Service you use for the then-current Additional Terms.
If you donât agree to be bound by the changes, you may not use the Services anymore.
Because our Services are evolving over time, we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Services, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.

Services and Materials provided by third parties are governed by separate agreements accompanying such Services and Materials.
See Section 10 for more details.

Unless expressly agreed to by BitTorrent in writing elsewhere, BitTorrent has no obligation to store any User Content that you upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available through your use of the Services.&nbsp.
BitTorrent has no responsibility or liability for the deletion or accuracy of any Materials, including your User Content, the failure to store, transmit or receive transmission of Materials, or the security, privacy, storage, or transmission of other communications originating with or involving use of the Services.
Certain Services may enable you to specify the level at which such Services restrict access to your User Content.
You are solely responsible for your User Content.

In some cases, you may remove your User Content by deleting it within the Services.
When you delete User Content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer.
However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others) but also, prior to your deletion on the Services, copies of such deleted User Content may have been downloaded by anyone else who was a member of that group to which you posted such User Content and/or forwarded by any member of such group to anyone else.




 Use of Software 
Any Software that is made available via the Services or otherwise by BitTorrent is the property of BitTorrent and its suppliers.
If the Software made available via the Services is accompanied by license terms, then use of such Software is governed by the terms of such license agreement that accompanies or is included with the Software, or by the license agreement expressly stated on the hyperlinks referenced in the Software.
Some license terms are available for review in the Serviceâs End User License Agreement (âEULAâ).
Other license terms may only be posted with the Software downloads or at the web page where the Software can be accessed.
You shall not use, download or install any Software that is accompanied by or includes a EULA unless you agree to the terms of such EULA.
Any copying or redistribution of the Software is prohibited, including any copying or redistribution of the Software to any other server or location, redistribution or use on a service bureau basis.

For clarity, your use of the Software is also subject to the disclaimers and limitations in Sections 13 and 15 below and your compliance with the export control provisions of Section 18.

The Software may automatically download and install updates from BitTorrent from time to time.
These updates are designed to improve, enhance and further develop the Services and may take the form of bug fixes, enhanced functions, new Software modules and completely new versions.
You agree to receive such updates (and permit BitTorrent to deliver these to you with or without your knowledge) as part of your use of the Services.

Some Services involve collaboration and file-sharing services among other Users or a specific group in conjunction with such collaboration and file-sharing.
The User Content that you or other Users share with other Users through the Services shall be referred to as âShared Group Content.â While some Services offer functionality to limit another Userâs use of your Shared Group Content, such limitations are not guaranteed and it is your sole responsibility to determine what limitations, if any, are placed on Shared Group Content that you distribute.
You agree that BitTorrent has no liability of any kind should other Users use, modify, destroy, corrupt, copy or distribute your Shared Group Content in violation of the limitations that you may impose on its use.
Further, it is your sole responsibility to determine what limitations are placed on your use of another Userâs Shared Group Content, including by looking at a given Serviceâs functionality and Additional Terms along with any additional restrictions placed by such User on your use of their Shared Group Content.

The rights granted to you in BitTorrent Materials as specified above are not applicable to the design, layout, or look and feel of any Services.
Such elements of the Services are protected by Intellectual Property Rights and may not be copied or imitated in whole or in part.

and (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.

The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the âAAA Rulesâ) then in effect, except as modified by these Terms.
The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.

The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement.

Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules, and we wonât seek to recover the administration and arbitrator fees we are responsible for paying, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous.
If we prevail in arbitration, weâll pay all of our attorneysâ fees and costs and wonât seek to recover them from you.
If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneysâ fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.

To the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration.
The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.

YOU AND BITTORRENT AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.

If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.

With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 20(h) of our Terms, if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of the Terms will still apply.
