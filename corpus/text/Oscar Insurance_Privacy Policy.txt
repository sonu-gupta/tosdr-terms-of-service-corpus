âcookiesâ and âtagsâYou should also be aware that when you use our Services, we collect certain âusage data,â such as the number of visitors we receive or what pages are visited most often.
This data helps us to analyze and improve the usefulness of the information of our Services.We may also collect, or receive from third parties, information based on your IP address that provides us your geolocation data in order to identify relevant markets for users down to a ZIP code level of detail and to provide a better mobile experience.
We do not store, sell, disclose or use this data to serve advertisements.Like most commercial website owners, we may use what is known as âcookieâ technology.
A âcookieâ is an element of data that a website can send to your browser when you link to that website.
It is not a computer program and has no ability to read data residing on your computer or instruct it to perform any step or function.
By assigning a unique data element to each visitor, the website is able to recognize repeat users, track usage patterns and better serve you when you return to that site.
Our cookies do not extract other personal information about you, such as your name or address.
You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your deviceâs acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features.
We may also use what is known as âclient-side page tagging,â which uses code on each page to write certain information about the page and the visitor to a log when a page is rendered by your web browser.
This technique is also commonly used on commercial websites.
âTaggingâ does result in a JavaScript program running on your computer, but it is limited to providing information about the page that you are requesting and the configuration of your browser.
It will not read any of your data files, or execute any additional programs.
It does not extract any personal information about you, such as your name or address.
You can prevent tagging by disabling JavaScript in your browser, but that may prevent you from using all of our Siteâs functions.
Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the âDo Not Trackâ signal, we do not currently respond to browser âDo Not Trackâ signals.How do we share Personal Information?We do not rent or sell your Personal Information in personally identifiable form to anyone.
