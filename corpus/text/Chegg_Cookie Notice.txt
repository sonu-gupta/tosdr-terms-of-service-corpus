 What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons or embedded scripts? 

 Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website.
We as well as our affiliate program partners, service providers, and other third parties may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs").
These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Website and track their online movements.
This allows us to monitor the traffic patterns of users within our Website, to understand whether you have come to our Website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, and help improve the overall quality and experience of our Services.
We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' Personal Information.
In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.

 An Embedded Script: is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Services, such as the links you click on.
The code is temporarily downloaded onto your computer or other device from our server or a third-party service provider and is deactivated or deleted when you disconnect from the Services.

Do you serve targeted advertising?
