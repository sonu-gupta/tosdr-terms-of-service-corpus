2.
OUR CLIENTS

(b) âQueriersâ are companies who generate data on their own or receive data from another party with a Universal LeadiD and/or other identifiers (âIdentifiersâ) and desire to verify and/or append certain attributes to the Identifiers by querying our network.

4.
JORNAYAâS SERVICES 

(a)  The two main elements of our Services are:

âCreateâ is the process by which a Publisher implementing the Script on its Publisher Platform facilitates the capture of certain information through each unique consumer event (âEventâ) on a Publisher Platform.
 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, as a Publisher, you may utilize Create on your Publisher Platform(s).
 Your Create Script is unique to you and you agree that you will not share it with, or transfer it  to, any other party.
For added clarity, your partners, providers or affiliates must each maintain their own account(s) with Jornaya.
âQueryâ is the process by which an Identifier(s) (which you have acquired on your own or through other sources, and subject to proper usage rights for which you are solely responsible) is queried in real-time or in batch to provide certain information about the Event (as defined above).

(b) For our Services, the main data sets are:


Event Data .
 EVENT DATA IS NOT MADE PUBLIC AND IS SUBJECT TO PROTECTION AT ALL TIMES IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR PRIVACY POLICIES.
  Our Platform facilitates the capture of data from Events (as defined above) which include, but are not limited to, lead history information, the URL where a consumer event occurred, Publisherâs account number, Publisher name, referrer URL, and information that is entered by website visitors/end users of Publisher Platforms (âConsumerâ) (âEvent Dataâ).
 Event Data is not exposed, except back to the original creator of the Event (âCreatorâ) or with the permission of the Creator.

Contributed Data .
 You may provide to Jornaya additional information in your possession, such as conversion data, or Consumer information and/or Identifiers, through a Query or batch file (âContributed Dataâ).
 You are solely responsible for securing and maintaining proper usage rights of any Contributed Data provided to Jornaya.
Contributed Data is not exposed without the permission of the party  who contributed it.

Derived Data .
 For any Querier utilizing the Services to perform a Query, certain âDerived Dataâ may be returned as requested by a Querier.
 Derived Data are derived from, but do NOT include or expose, Event Data or Contributed Data.
 Derived Data may be (i) related to an Event associated with a Universal LeadiD (for example, Lead Age, Data Integrity, TCPA Disclosure Match Status, Lead Origin, and Lead Velocity).
(ii) related to a Consumer associated with a Universal LeadiD.
or (iii) associated with any aspects of Contributed Data (as defined above).
 Full descriptions of available Derived Data are listed within the secure area of our Site (âClient Portalâ).
 If you are the Creator of a Universal LeadiD that is part of a Query, you may block certain Derived Data elements from being shared with that Querier within your settings in the Client Portal.

Predictive Insights .
A Querier utilizing the Services to perform a Query may request certain âPredictive Insightsâ.
 These Predictive Insights utilize Jornayaâs proprietary technology for analyzing, transforming and/or aggregating the above mentioned data sets in anonymized form to provide certain scores, indicators and/or reports based on a Clientâs criteria to help better predict and identify consumer intent or other trends.


5.
PROTECTIONS AND ASSURANCES 

(a)  Control Over Access to Data.
 As part of the Services, you have certain control over access to data as applicable.
 You may:

decide whether or not, and where to place the Jornaya Script on your platform(s) to facilitate or limit the capture of Event Data;
decide not to implement specific HTML tags within your implementation (for example, TCPA disclosure tags);
share or not share Contributed Data.
and
decide with whom to share a Universal LeadiD.
 For the purpose of clarity, if you do not wish for a party to perform a Query on Universal LeadiDs that you have created, in order to limit that partyâs access to associated Derived Data, you can choose to not share Universal LeadiDs with that (or any) party.

(b) Aggregate Reporting.
 Jornaya may provide insights from the data sets referenced above in anonymous, aggregated formats, provided that the data shall not disclose or expose Event Data, including but not limited to, a Clientâs name, referral URLs, or other information which may help to identify a Client or otherwise allow a third party to reasonably determine that any information or data came from a specific Client as part of the aggregation.
(c)  No Ranking or Scoring of Publishers.
 Jornaya will not provide services or reports that rank or score a Publisher(s) or Publisher Platform(s).
(d) Non-Compete.
  Jornaya is not in the business of (nor do we intend to enter into) (i) buying, selling or aggregating leads, or (ii) retargeting consumers.
both in a manner that directly competes with our Clients during the term of this Agreement.
 In the event of any change in this respect, we will notify you in writing via email, and you may terminate the Agreement upon written notice to us, subject to Section 13 (Termination).
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, Jornaya will not use any data resulting from this Agreement to directly compete with a Client.

(c)  Each partyâs indemnity obligations are contingent on the following:

the indemnifying party is promptly notified in writing of the Claim (the delay of which shall relieve the indemnifying party of its indemnification obligations strictly to the extent such delay actually prejudices the defense of such Claim);
the indemnifying party has sole control of the defense and any negotiations for its settlement, except that the indemnified party shall not be required to make an admission of fault or liability or pay any amount not fully reimbursed by the indemnifying party;
the indemnified party provides the indemnifying party all reasonable assistance, information, and authority necessary to perform the above.

the indemnified party has the right to participate in the defense of the Claim at its own expense and with counsel of its own choosing.

(d) If the indemnifying party refuses to undertake the defense of a Claim tendered by the indemnified party under this section or so delays in undertaking the defense of such a Claim as to reasonably risk prejudice to the indemnified party, the indemnified party shall be permitted to undertake the defense and/or settlement of such Claim itself, within its full discretion, and shall be entitled to full reimbursement and indemnification from the indemnifying party relating to the Claim if it is ultimately determined that such indemnifying party had an obligation of defense relating to such Claim under this section.
