During calls with our customer support team, live listening may be done or calls may be recorded for quality and reference purposes which includes the usage of the recordings for the handling of claims, training and fraud detection purposes.
If you would prefer that your call was not recorded, you can opt out by stating this, or by hanging up.

If you have not finalized a reservation online, we may send you a reminder to continue with your reservation.
We believe that this additional service is useful to you because it allows you to carry on with a reservation without having to search for the accommodation again or fill in all the reservation details from scratch.
These reminders are one-time only communications and reservation information used for such reminders will be deleted from our systems in accordance with our data retention policy detailed below.
Please note that the confirmation emails and text messages sent after your booking are not marketing messages.

You will continue to receive them, even if you have opted out of our marketing messages.
Similarly, opting into receiving Price Alerts will not affect any other choices you have made regarding receiving communications from us.
If you elect to receive Price Alerts, you will be able to opt out of receiving the same by clicking on the âturn off price alertsâ or a similar message found in the Price Alert sent to you.

If you have selected a Mix and Save offer but look to have only finalized part of the offer (e.g.
only finalized the booking for one but not both rooms), we may send you an email confirming you selected Mix and Save and to remind you to complete all bookings for your selected Mix and Save offer.
This message is part of the Mix and Save booking process confirming your selection and in case you have overlooked completing all bookings.
In addition to this, we may also send you a pre-check in email reminding you about changing rooms during your stay at the accommodation.
As mentioned above, if you are completing the booking for another person who will stay at the reserved accommodation, you also have the option to insert the guestâs email address for the purpose that the guest will receive the reservation confirmation and a separate invitation to complete a guest review.
