Our General Philosophy Quality Logo ProductsÂ® takes privacy seriously and does everything it can to safeguard it.
This Privacy Notice ("Notice") will tell you what personal information ("PI") we collect from you, how we use it, when we use your information to contact you, under which circumstances we may disclose it to any third party, and your choices regarding any of your personal information that is disclosed to us.
Because no online system can ever be guaranteed to be 100% secure, 100% of the time, we ask that if you have any concerns or complaints that your PI held by Quality Logo ProductsÂ® could have been compromised, or someone could have discovered your personal details held by us, please contact us immediately.
Our contact information is below at the end of this Notice. 2.
What Information Will Quality Logo ProductsÂ® Collect About Me? When you contact us, either via phone, email, or through our website, we have to collect some personal information about you in order to fulfill your request or fill any order you may place with us.
Usually the information we need is your name, email address, postal address, phone, as well as information collected about the goods and services we provide to you.
We indirectly collect your credit card information for purposes of placing and fulfilling the order through a third party credit card processing company, but we never see, transmit or store your credit card data.
If you visit our website and do not place an order, we collect your IP address for logging/debugging purposes only.
 The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, Cal.
Civ.
Code Â§Â§ 1798.100 et seq.
(CCPA) ensure consumers can exercise their rights to: (1) request information about what information the business collects and what it does with the information.
(2) request that the business delete any personal information collected.
and (3) not be discriminated against.


Section 1798.110(c) requires, "pursuant to Section 1798.130(a)(5)(B)," that a business that collects personal information about a consumer disclose:


 The categories of personal information it has collected about the consumer.

 The categories of sources from which the personal information is collected.

 The business or commercial purpose of collecting or selling personal information.

 The categories of third parties with whom the business shares personal information.

 The specific pieces of personal information the business has collected about the consumer.





 The categories of "personal information" that Quality Logo ProductsÂ® collects include: 


First and/or Last Name
Address
IP Address
Email Address
Telephone Number
Products or Services Purchased
Internet or other electronic network activity such as browsing history, and info regarding a consumer's interaction with the website
Audio (phone calls to our facility)

 Transfer of information from Quality Logo ProductsÂ® to 3rd parties only occurs if an individual completes an order.
 3.
How Quality Logo ProductsÂ® Will Use Your Personal Information We ensure that we have accurate information so that we may communicate with you and keep you apprised of developments as we provide our goods/services to you. 4.
How Long Will Quality Logo ProductsÂ® Keep My Information? We will hold your PI on our systems for as long as it takes to fulfill your order or otherwise fulfill any request made by you, and to comply with legal requirements.
Legally, we need to hold a limited amount of your PI for a period of 7 years. 5.
Can I Delete My Data? You can always ask for your information to be deleted.
However, please understand that if it is less than 7 years old, we may be legally required to keep it (see Section 4 above).
Deleting the data Quality Logo ProductsÂ® holds about you will erase any PI we have about you.
Any data we have pertaining to you after we delete your PI will be made anonymous, so no one will be able to identify that it is your data. 6.
Right Not to Be Subject to Discrimination Should you exercise any of your privacy rights as a California Consumer, we will not discriminate against you by offering you different pricing or products, or by providing you with a different level or quality of services, based solely upon your request.
However, in some circumstances, for example where you have requested or consented to our services that use your PI to provide the service, we may not be able to provide a service if you choose to delete your PI. 7.
Can I Find Out What Information Quality Logo ProductsÂ® Holds About Me? You have the right to request a copy of the PI that Quality Logo ProductsÂ® holds about you, and if any information is wrong, we will correct it for you.
We require you to confirm your identity with 2 pieces of approved identification such as a passport, drivers' license, birth certificate, or Social Security Card.
Please address requests and questions about this or any other question about this Privacy Notice to Quality Logo ProductsÂ® by contacting us using the contact details at the end of this Notice. 8.
When Will Quality Logo ProductsÂ® Contact Me? Quality Logo ProductsÂ® may contact you:

In relation to any order you initiated with us, or any communication we receive from you or any other parties involved in the service we provide for you.
For example, we use your name, email and postal address to contact you regarding your order.
 In relation to any financial questions or issues.
For example, if your check bounces, we likely will contact you so we can collect an alternate form of payment.
Also, if you would like to use a credit card to pay for your order, we will email you a link to a pay page just after you have placed the order.
For legal reporting, research, and marketing purposes.

 9.
How Will I Be Contacted for Marketing Purposes? Quality Logo ProductsÂ® will only send you marketing emails or contact you where you have agreed to this by giving us your consent.
We may personalize the message content based upon any information you have provided to us.
If you want to stop all personalized messages from Quality Logo ProductsÂ®, including targeted marketing messages, you can contact us at any time and instruct us to stop.
We will, of course, stop. 10.
Will Quality Logo ProductsÂ® Share My Personal Info with Anyone Else? We will keep your information within Quality Logo ProductsÂ® except where disclosure is required or permitted by law (for example, to government bodies and law enforcement agencies), where sharing is required to fulfill your order, or where you have consented to us sharing your information with other parties involved in the service we provide to you.
We may provide Facebook and Google with certain information for marketing purposes.
However, Google and Facebook then anonymize the data (so no one can identify you from this data).
Then, Google and Facebook help us out by providing us a customer list of the anonymized data we can use to market other interesting products to our own customers using Google and Facebook.
Generally, we will use your information within Quality Logo ProductsÂ® and will only share it outside Quality Logo ProductsÂ® where you have requested it via a data portability request, or given your consent.
Quality Logo ProductsÂ® requires all third parties to comply strictly with its instructions, and that they do not use your PI for their own business or marketing purposes.
They may only use your information for reasons associated with the goods or services we provide for you.
 We have never, and will never, sell any categories of customer personal information.
