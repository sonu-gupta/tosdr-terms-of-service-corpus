 Simple speak introduction for Terms of Service Youâre busy.
We get it.
So weâve summed up our Terms of Service in a few simple sentences.
They donât replace the official legal stuff, but they will give you an idea of whatâs in there.
Any questions or concerns â please contact us.
Here are the headlines (imagine them with a clock bonging in the background if you like):

You have to be 16 to use our tools.
Your content is yours â you own it, and you are responsible for it.
Weâll only do whatâs needed for our services to work properly...
...unless you are doing something illegal, in which case we can block and/or delete your stuff, and suspend your accounts.
We may make changes to our terms, service and/or fees from time to time.
If you have an account and donât like something we change, you can always cancel at any time.
And we should mention that you use our service at your own risk.
we are not liable for any damages if things go wrong.

And thatâs it.

WeTransfer File Sharing 

WeTransfer File Sharing allows you to share your Content with others.


To share your Content you need to upload it and provide us with (a limited number of) email addresses of recipient(s) (âemail transferâ) or choose to distribute a download link yourself (âlink transferâ).
If you use link transfer you will not be informed of any downloads by others.


WeTransfer File Sharing provides the possibility to share Content up to a maximum total capacity.
Uploaded Content is stored on WeTransferâs servers for a limited period of time after which the ability to download expires.
Depending on the transfer type some limitations apply, which you can find here.


After the expiry period WeTransfer will permanently delete the uploaded files.
These files will not be available nor retrievable anymore.


The basic functionality of WeTransfer file sharing is (currently) free from registration and charge.


We also offer âWeTransfer Proâ, a paid subscription version that - compared to the free version - offers you a set of premium services and different subscription terms..
You can find more information here.


If you have a WeTransfer Pro subscription, we offer âPro Passâ.
With Pro Pass you can unlock Collect Pro and Paste Pro.
You can find more information here.


WeTransfer reserves the right to automatically delete all Content uploaded with WeTransfer Pro and still available on our servers, 28 days after your WeTransfer Pro subscription has ended.


WeTransfer treats Content as confidential and does not control the use of download links, regardless of whether they are originally distributed by us or by you.
Recipients can forward the links and allow others to use them.
You are solely responsible for the Content you upload and share.



WePresent

Although care and attention is devoted to the content of our (online) magazine, WeTransfer cannot warrant that it is always complete and accurate.
WeTransfer disclaims any liability in relation to the use of such content.



Collect 

Collect allows you to store, organize, share and receive Content from multiple sources using the Collect Services.


The basic functionality of Collect is (currently) free from registration and charge.
The Content you use, share or receive in the Collect application will be stored on your device and/or on our servers.

The Content you create with Paper will be stored on your device and not on our servers.
Your Content may be lost if you remove your Content from the Paper Services, if you remove the Paper Services from your device or if you lose your device.
If you choose to export any Content and share it with others, it may be stored elsewhere.


The basic functionality of Paper (âPaper Basicâ) is (currently) free from registration and charge.


We also offer âPaper Proâ, a paid subscription service that - compared to Paper Basic - offers you a set of premium services.
You can find more information here.


When your Paper (Pro) subscription is linked to your Apple ID, you are also allowed to store your Paper Content in the iCloud or to synchronize the Paper Content on your device(s) through your iCloud account.

Payment conditions 

If you use a paid subscription Service, the initial subscription term starts once the fees due have been paid in full.


We may introduce or change the fees for the Services from time to time, for which we will give you advance notice.
If you have a fixed term and price subscription, that price will remain in force for the fixed term.
If you do not agree with the price change, you must cancel your subscription and stop using the Services by the end of the then-current Service term.
If you continue to use the Services after the price change goes into effect, you agree to pay the changed price.
Fee introductions will require your prior consent and registration.


Depending on the payment method you choose, the issuer of the payment method may charge you certain fees relating to the processing of your payment.


You can change your payment method in your account settings of the respective Service or by contacting our Help Center.


WeTransfer may suspend or cancel the Services to you if a payment is not successfully settled (for instance in case of insufficient funds, expiration of credit cards, a change in payment details or otherwise).
Suspension or cancellation of the Services for non-payment can result in a loss of access to and use of your account and your Content.


If you subscribe and pay us through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, the terms of Apple or Google may also apply.



Term and cancellation of a subscription 

The initial subscription term varies depending on your choice and/or the Service it applies to.


You have the right to cancel your subscription during the first 14 days, unless you start using the Service during this period whereby you waive your right to cancel.


The subscription period will be renewed automatically for the selected subscription period, unless you have cancelled your subscription on time (before the last day of your subscription).


In case of cancellation you will continue to have access to the Services until the end of your paid subscription period.
For instance: if the commencement date of your monthly subscription is 2 February and you cancel your subscription on 17 October, you will continue to have access until 2 November.


Pro Pass is linked to your WeTransfer Pro subscription.
So if you cancel your subscription you will lose access to Paste Pro and Collect Pro.


Cancellation does not give you any right to reimbursement of (part of) the subscription fee, unless local mandatory consumer law obliges to do so.


In case your subscription is automatically renewed for a period of more than three (3) months, you will have the right to cancel the subscription at any time after such renewal with a cancellation term of one (1) month.
In case of cancellation based on this clause you may request reimbursement of part of the subscription fee.
This means that you pay for the period until the cancellation enters into force, based on the standard monthly fee for the respective Service.


Upon cancellation or if a payment is not successfully settled (for instance due to expiration or insufficient funds), your account will be deactivated after the end of your subscription period.
You will then not have access to your personal data, address book and any Content stored using the Service(s).
You can reactivate your subscription at any time in your account settings by making payment within four weeks after deactivation.
Your subscription will then be renewed as from the day of reactivation.


If you do not reactivate your subscription within the term set out above, any of your Content stored using the Service(s) and any of your information, including your personal content, settings, address book and any files stored for transfer may have been automatically and permanently deleted from our servers.


If you subscribe through the Apple App Store, the terms of Apple may apply to the term and cancellation of your subscription instead of the terms in this clause.
