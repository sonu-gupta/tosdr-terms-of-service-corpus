         Protecting Your Privacy When it comes to the companies you trust, no one has to be more trustworthy than your financial institution.
At USE Credit Union, our goal is to preserve and protect not only your finances, but your financial information as well.

By reading our privacy documents youâll learn what information must be shared out of necessity to manage your accounts and what information sharing you have the right to control.

 Branch Security Keeping you and our staff safe is our highest concern.
Simply asking everyone to remove their hats, sunglasses and hoodies while visiting a branch has been proven to deter criminals and prevent robberies, fraud and identity theft.
We understand there may be special circumstances in which you may not be comfortable removing these items in public.
Our friendly staff will make sure youâre as comfortable as possible and accommodate special requests on a case-by-case basis.
Removing your hats, sunglasses and hoodies makes us all safer.
Your cooperation not only helps deter would-be criminals but also makes it easier for law enforcement to identify the bad guys when necessary.
