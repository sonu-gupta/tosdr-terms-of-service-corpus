Though we employ industry standard measures to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose Personal Data when required by law or when we have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process that we receive or to protect our interests or the safety of others.
In addition, we may provide Personal Data to employees, consultants or other business or persons for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf.

We may use your Personal Data to operate, improve, understand and personalize our Services.Voluntary DisclosureAny Personal Data or content that you voluntarily disclose in public areas becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by other users for any reason.
Your profile pages (âProfileâ) and any online classrooms you participate in are typically publicly available.
You have the ability to change your account settings to limit access to your profile, and may delete content you post to public classrooms.
If you need assistance with controlling your account privacy settings or with deleting content, please contact us at help@skillshare.com.
Removal of posted content does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information (e.g., some content may be âinvisibleâ to other users but remain on our servers in some form).
