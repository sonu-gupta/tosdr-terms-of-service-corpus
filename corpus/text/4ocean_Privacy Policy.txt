Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site.
Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates.
For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site.
If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our
site.
The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site.
Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.
Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers).
However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.

These include when you have given your consent, which you may withdraw at any time using your account settings.

We partner with four other third parties, such as SpringBot, CookieBot, Bazaarvoice and Formstack to provide specific services.
When the user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services.

Security
This website takes every precaution to protect our usersâ information.
When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.
When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is
encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL.
While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Google Chrome and Microsoft Internet
Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just âsurfingâ.
To learn more about SSL, follow this link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security.
.
 
While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line.
All of our usersâ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.
Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.
Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk.
When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information.
Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.
Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customersâ information is protected.

 
Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage.
If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an
email to info@4Ocean.com.
 
N.
Special Offers
New and established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and our newsletter.
Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications.
Please see our choice and opt-out in letter Q below.
 
O.
Site and Service Updates
We also send the user site and service announcement updates.
Users are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service.
We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regard to issues relating to their account via email or phone.
 
P.
Your Rights to Access and Control Your Personal Data.
We give you access and control of your personal data as described in this Privacy Policy.
If you live
in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, and Switzerland (the âDesignated Countriesâ), you
have a number of legal rights with respect to your information,

4ocean does not sell or share your Personal Information with third-party companies for their direct marketing purposes without your consent.
 
T.
International Data Transfers
 
We will rely on multiple legal bases to lawfully transfer personal data around the world.
These include
your consent, the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield, and EU Commission approved model contractual clauses, which require certain privacy and security protections.
You may obtain copies of the model contractual clauses by contacting us.
4ocean complies with the Privacy Shield principles regarding the collection, use, sharing, and retention of personal information as described in our Privacy Shield certifications.
 
4ocean is subject to the oversight of the US Federal Trade Commission and remains responsible for
personal information that we transfer to others who process it on our behalf as described in the How
Information Is Shared section.
If you have a complaint about our Privacy Shield compliance,
please contact us.

body, the International Centre for Dispute ResolutionÂ® at http://go.adr.org/privacyshield.html.

Please note that the countries where we operate may have privacy and data protection laws that
differ from, and are potentially less protective than, the laws of your country.
You agree to this risk
when you create a 4ocean's account and click âI agreeâ to data transfers, irrespective of which
country you live in.
If you later wish to withdraw your consent, you can delete your information as
described in the Privacy Policy.

Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials from our partners may opt-out of receiving these communications by clicking the opt-out, unsubscribe button, or email us at info@4Ocean.com or by sending a written request to:

We do this, so our users can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not.

 
V.
Notification of Changes
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Website, so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email.
Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner.
We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under
which the information was collected.
