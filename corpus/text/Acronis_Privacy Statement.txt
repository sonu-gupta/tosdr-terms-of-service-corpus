Information we receive from others

We receive information about you from others, including our vendors, service providers, resellers and other business partners.
We also receive information about you from the third parties that help us operate the Services, such as for fraud detection, digital forensics, marketing services (such as when we acquire information on potential leads) and similar functions.

Information collected when you use the Services

When you use the Services, we collect information about which features you use and how you use them and information about the computer, tablet or mobile telephone ("Device") that you use to access the Services (collectively, "Usage Data").
Usage Data is personal data under certain privacy laws.
Acronis collects the following Usage Data:

integrations.
how often you use the Services and in which circumstances.

features you use and the results of their operations.
information about disabled features.
and information about errors and crashes and activities which led to them.

Service operation information: Depending on the Services you use, we collect information that is necessary to provide such Services and that forms an integral part of such Services.
For example, we collect the list of software installed on your machine, together with version and manufacturer information as part of providing you vulnerability assessment and patch management functionality of certain Services.
As another example, we collect information about names of potentially malicious files together with their hashes and full paths to such files or blocked website URLs as part of providing you antivirus and URL filtering functionality of certain Services.

Acronisâs servers automatically collect and store in logs your search queries, Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type and language, time zones, date and time of your request and referral URLs and certain cookies that identify your browser or Acronis account.

We may link personal data and Usage Data or different types of Usage Data.
We also may link personal data that we collect with publicly-available personal data, such as personal data available in public databases.
If the linked information directly or indirectly identifies an individual natural person, we will treat it as personal data.

Voice data

We do not keep and process your voice data.
However, some of our products have voice control options available.
If you decide to use them, with your permission, we activate the built-in extension of your Google Chrome browser, which captures your voice via your microphone and transfers it to Google for recognition.
As a result, we receive only a text version of your voice commands, which we do not keep and use only for current command execution.
Since your voice data is processed by Google, the purposes and the ways that Google processes your data may vary depending on your Google account settings (if any) and preferences.
To understand how Google processes your data, including voice data, please carefully read the Google privacy policy (https://policies.google.com/privacy).

Acronis Customer Experience Program

Acronis collects certain information through the Acronis Customer Experience Program ("CEP").
Unless you consent to Acronis processing your personal data as part of CEP, Acronis will only collect pseudonymized Usage Data as part of CEP.
Acronis gathers such pseudonymized Usage Data to improve Acronis products and services.
Acronis achieves the pseudonymization by associating such data with a randomly generated number (pseudonym) instead of the personal ID associated with your Acronis account.
Acronis cannot identify you by the pseudonym without you providing additional information to Acronis for identification purposes.
If you consent to Acronis processing your personal data as part of CEP, Acronis will connect your personal data to your CEP Usage Data.
The personal data Acronis connects to your CEP Usage Data is limited to your Acronis account ID and account information.
As in this case Acronis links personal data and Usage Data, Acronis treats the CEP Usage Data linked to your personal data as personal data.
Your consent to Acronis processing your personal data as part of CEP allows Acronis to provide you more specific feedback and guidance about Acronis products, services, and features operation.
You can consent to Acronis processing your personal data as part of CEP by checking the corresponding box in the product settings.

How We Use Data Collection Technology

Our Statement On Do Not Track Signals

Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome) incorporate a "Do Not Track" ("DNT") or similar feature that signals to websites that a user does not want to have his or her online activity and behavior tracked.
If a website that responds to a particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain personal data about the browserâs user.
Not all browsers offer a DNT option, and DNT signals are not yet uniform.
For this reason, many website operators, including Acronis, do not respond to DNT signals.7.

In CCPA, California residents are referred as "consumers" and we refer to them in this California Privacy Notice as "California Consumers" and "Personal Information" means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular California Consumer or household.

Your California Consumer Privacy Rights

CCPA offers California Consumers the following key privacy rights:

(In CCPA, "sale" means transferring or making available Personal Information to third parties for monetary or other valuable consideration.)
