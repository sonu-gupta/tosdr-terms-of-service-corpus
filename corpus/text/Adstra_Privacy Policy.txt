WHAT ADSTRA DOES





Adstra operates a data management business for its clients for terrestrial (e.g., direct mail) and digital advertising technology (the âTechnologyâ) enabling marketers to target advertising based upon our proprietary composite of multiple intent signals of users and to recognize devices that you may use to connect to the Internet such as computers, mobile devices, tablets, smart TVs, game consoles and any other device that enables data collection and exchange (all referred to as âScreensâ) for the purpose of sequential targeting, interest-based advertising, cross-screen attribution, and optimization of digital advertising.
We help advertisers, advertising networks, online merchants and websites (our âClientsâ) do a better job at engaging with their customers and prospects (their âUsersâ).
This Privacy Policy covers the data collected by Adstraâs Technology as well as the information collected on www.adstradata.com (the âWebsiteâ).&nbsp.
Adstra is a member of a number of industry associations that govern the policies around online consumer privacy and digital advertising, including the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA).
We comply with Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (OBA) and Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB).







PRIVACY BY DESIGN







Our philosophy on privacy follows the framework of Privacy by Design.
We integrate privacy in strategy, product development, and more.
We can protect consumer privacy AND provide relevant advertising, which benefits everyone involved, especially advertisers, consumers, and small business websites and mobile applications. Ensuring the protection of privacy throughout the entire lifecycle of the data is of the utmost importance, and we are careful to protect privacy as data is collected, used, and destroyed responsibly.




We constantly strive to maintain unparalleled visibility with consumers.
We provide transparency and choice through our website, encourage the same practice throughout the Internet, and utilize AdChoices on each banner advertisement and through AppChoices for providing choice and tailoring ads to consumersâ interests.&nbsp.
We respect consumer privacy and give consumers the ability to opt out of interest-based advertising (âIBAâ).







INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE







We collect information from your use of our Technology.
When you visit any website, mobile site, app or other digital media property where our Technology is enabled (âClient Sitesâ), we may collect information about your interaction with, and the content on, that Client Site.
The information collected via the Technology is put into a âsnapshotâ and is sent to our servers each time a User visits a Client Site.
Our servers use the information to create a unique ID for every Screen that our technology is able to recognize within a reasonable probability.
Our Technology uses machine learning to perceive common characteristics between multiple Screens (e.g., common IP address) to infer the likelihood that two Screens belong to the same household.
By inferring these types of relationships, we can help our Clients understand how Screens might be related so Clients can deliver advertising and content personalized to their Users based on User interests gathered across multiple Screens.
Adstra may use non-PII that it has collected or that it obtains from third parties to create data segments and intent profiles, based upon User interactions with our Clients as well as other User behavior, such as the websites visited and mobile applications used by a User.




Adstra licenses the data collected as described herein to third parties in connection with our business, including to our Clients, our partners and other third parties (collectively our âBusiness Partnersâ).
This shared information may include non-PII information about your particular Screen (e.g., hardware make and model), its operating system, advertising identifiers (such as Apple IDFA or AAID), IP address, carrier identifiers and other connectivity information, browser version, precise geolocation information, and cookies.
This information may be categorized to create audience segments with common interests, intent or other characteristics, but does not include PII.
We may also share aggregated, non-PII with our Business Partners, such as aggregated reports derived in part from the information we have collected.
The information we share may also be combined with third party data to provide an even broader service to our Clients and Business Partners.
We may disclose information collected from the Website and through the Technology we have if we have a good-faith belief that the disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with the law, legal process or an enforceable government request.
to enforce applicable terms of use for our services.
to detect, prevent or otherwise address illegal activity, fraud, or security issues.
or to protect the property or safety of our users, Adstra, or the public as required or permitted by law.
We may also make both PII and non-PII available to subsidiaries and affiliated companies that are under common ownership or control within the Adstra family.




We may transfer information, including PII, to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change.
If Adstra is involved in any such transaction, you will be notified via prominent notice on our Website of any change in ownership or uses of your information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your information.




We also provide information to third parties who provide services to Adstra in connection with operating and maintaining the Website and the Technology.
These service providers are prohibited from using the information we provide for purposes other than performing services for Adstra .
In addition, we may share aggregated information with Business Partners and the general public, such as usage statistics or demographic trends regarding how you and others may interact with the Website and/or Technology.







INFORMATION SECURITY







The security of your information is important to us.
Adstra has implemented reasonable security measures to protect the information, both during transmission and once it is received, including without limitation, use of firewalls, application controls and encryption.
No method of electronic storage or transmission over the Internet is 100% secure.
So while Adstra strives to use commercially reasonable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee complete security.

If we are made aware that we have received PII from someone under the age of 13, we will use reasonable efforts to remove that information from our records.







SELF-REGULATION &amp.
VOLUNTARY COMPLIANCE







Our industry has a rigorous voluntary self-regulatory regime, and we are active members of industry groups such as the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB), Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) and Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (DAAC) who promulgate codes of conduct to which their members must adhere.
These codes impose requirements on participating companies such as transparency and choice around the use of data for IBA and require regular audits of member privacy practices.




Adstra is an active member of these and other groups, and where Adstra engages in activities regulated by these programs, we support the DAA Self-Regulatory Principles and the DAAC Self-Regulatory Principles.
