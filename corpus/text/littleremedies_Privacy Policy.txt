Note that Google offers a Google Analytics browser add-on (designed to be compatible only with certain browsers) to provide Site visitors the ability to prevent their data from being collected and used by Google Analytics.
That add-on may be obtained here: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en.
and other privacy controls are available here: www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html. Interest-Based Advertising We may work with third party advertising companies that gather information about your visits to the Site and elsewhere on the Internet.

Once you click the link, you may choose to opt-out of such advertising from all participating advertising companies or only advertising provided by specific advertising companies.
If you opt-out of this type of advertising, you will still see advertising on the Internet and advertising from Prestige Consumer Healthcare, but those ads may not be tailored to your Site usage and may be less relevant to you.
Other than as described herein, Prestige Consumer Healthcare does not track your activity over time and across different websites or online services except as among the related websites that constitute the Prestige Consumer Healthcare Site and as otherwise described herein. Do Not Track The Do Not Track ("DNT") privacy preference, which is offered by some web browsers (http://donottrack.us/), allows you to opt-out of tracking by websites and online services.
