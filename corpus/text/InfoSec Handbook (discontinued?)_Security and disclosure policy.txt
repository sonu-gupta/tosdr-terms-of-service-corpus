This page is about our security and disclosure policy.
Have a look at our privacy policy, if you are looking for privacy-related topics.Security contact
We provide a security.txt file for structured security contact information.
See our contact page for contact details and our OpenPGP key.
For us, security and privacy take top priorityâ No logging by default â â Minimal data processing
We decided to choose the best protection for your personal data: We simply do not collect it.
You donât have to trust us, because you keep your data.
By default, we do not log anything, and we concluded a data processing agreement according to Article 28 GDPR with our server provider (see our privacy policy).
We do not track you, and we do not set any cookies.
â Single-purpose server â â No databases
For security, we provide our website using a dedicated virtual server.
There arenât any other public services on this server (e.g., no database server, no mail server, no messaging server).
â Security monitoring â â Strong authentication â â Defined processes
We permanently monitor our server to check for modified files and login attempts.
Two-factor authentication is needed to access our server.
The core of our server is a hardened Linux installation.
Hardening means that we removed unnecessary packages and applied strict configuration at the kernel level.
Finally, we implemented processes to ensure the installation of security updates within a narrow time frame and quick reaction to reported potential security vulnerabilities.
â 100% static content â â No CMS, PHP, or JavaScript â â No 3rd party content
Our website consists of 100% static content.
There is no content management system (CMS) installed, and there is no dynamically-served content like PHP or JavaScript.
We do not embed any third-party content, and all links to third-party websites are visually marked.
If you navigate to other websites from the InfoSec Handbook, the new browser tab runs in a separate process in your web browser, and we strip any Referrer information.
â 100% transparency â â Available on archive.org â â No hidden changes
You find all changes on InfoSec Handbook on codeberg.orgexternal link.
Our commits are cryptographically signed.
When we update our content, we add a small changelog to the bottom of the post, listing the most significant changes.
Moreover, our website is listed on archive.orgexternal link.
This way, you can go back in history and check our changes.Disclosure policyDid you find a potential security vulnerability? You find our security-related contact details above.
We wonât take legal action against you as a penetration tester if you observe the law, and we wonât publish your identity by default.
Besides, we run a bug bounty program to ensure the highest level of security and privacy.
Everyone is eligible to participate in the program as described by this policy.Disclosure processWe are big fans of âcoordinated disclosure.â Due to this, we stay with the following process:1.
You start to test for security vulnerabilitiesFirst of all, thanks for helping us to improve the security of the InfoSec Handbook.
Please look at the scope and observe the testing requirements.
If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.2.
You send us a private reportYou privately report a potential security vulnerability.
Use the communication channels mentioned above.
Use our OpenPGP key, and provide your OpenPGP key!

You may submit your report anonymously.
however, we canât get in touch with you in this case.3.
We check your report and you get our feedbackWe check your initial report.
Depending on our investigation, we either:

fix the vulnerability and get in touch with you regarding your bug bounty and coordinated disclosure, or
get in touch with you to request additional information, or
inform you about the ineligibility of your report.

Expect our initial feedback within 5 days.4.
We wait for your feedbackAfter sending our feedback to you, we wait up to 30 days for your response.5.
We publish information about your reportThe final step of the coordinated disclosure process can be:

We agree on coordinated disclosure of the fixed vulnerability.
Upon request, we add your name to our Acknowledgments section.
We publish information regarding an invalid vulnerability to inform future testers.
Scope and possible bug bountiesThe disclosure policy on this page is valid for the following domain names (and underlying servers):Domain nameEligible for bug bountieshttps://infosec-handbook.eu/yesAll other domains operated by usnoThe following bounties are only a guideline.
We include the actual bug bounty in our responses.
If all testing requirements were met, we offer the following bounties:Type of vulnerabilityBug bounty up toSecurity-relevant configuration weaknessAcknowledgmentInformation leakage (except personal data)â¬75Code injection (e.g., HTML, JS)â¬100Unauthorized access (user-level)â¬100Remote Code Execution (RCE)â¬150Leakage of personal dataâ¬175Unauthorized access (root-level)â¬175Out-of-scope are vulnerabilities of software that we donât use, vulnerabilities that require physical access to our servers, and recently disclosed 0-day vulnerabilities.
If you report out-of-scope vulnerabilities, you may still be eligible to be listed below.
Bug bounties can only be paid via bank wire transfer (EU countries only) or Stellar Lumens (XLM).
There may exist additional legal regulations and requirements regarding payments and bug bounties in your country.Testing requirements and code of conductPlease observe our testing requirements and code of conduct:1.
Check whether you are the first reporterYou must be the first reporter of a potential vulnerability.
Please go to our issue trackerexternal link BEFORE reporting anything, and check whether somebody already reported the potential vulnerability.2.
Check the scopeThe reported vulnerability and the domain name must be in scope.3.
Provide a reportPlease include the following in your report:

A brief description of the security vulnerability (Which software is affected? What is the issue?)
A brief description of risks originating from the security vulnerability (What are risks for our website?)
A step-by-step guide that allows us to reproduce the issue

If necessary, add screenshots or proof of concept code.4.
Do not act unprofessionally
Do not randomly attack our server with automated tools.
Flooding our servers with millions of requests or executing random attacks neither is something a professional penetration tester does nor something that we want to see.
Do not leak, manipulate, or destroy any data on our servers.
Do not publish anything regarding a confirmed and unpatched vulnerability without our prior permission.
Do not use abusive language, act criminally, or impersonate us.
Do not demand a bug bounty, or try to press us for money.
