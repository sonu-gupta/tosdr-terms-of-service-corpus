 Privacy Your privacy is very important to us.
Any information that you provide to Wakelet and which we collect about you is subject to our Privacy Policy, which governs our collection and use of your information.

You acknowledge through your use of Wakelet that you have read and understood the terms of our Privacy Policy and agree with how we will use your information to provide Wakelet to you.
 Changes to Service We have the right to withdraw or revise Wakelet, and any service or material we provide on Wakelet, in our sole discretion and without notice, this will usually be to reflect our Registered Usersâ and Usersâ needs, our business priorities and developments of Wakelet.

We will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of Wakelet is unavailable at any time or for any period.
At any time we may restrict access to some parts of the site, or the entire site, to Users and Registered Users. Accessing Wakelet And Account Security You are responsible for:


Making all arrangements necessary for you to have access to Wakelet.


Ensuring that all persons who access Wakelet through your Internet connection are aware of these Terms and comply with them.


By using Wakelet, whether as a Registered User or as a User, you represent and warrant that: (a) all required registration information you submit as part of the Wakelet registration process is truthful and accurate.
(b) you will maintain the accuracy of this information.
(c) unless you are part of a Sponsored Group, you are thirteen (13) years of age or older if a User or Registered Individual and you are eighteen (18) years of age or older if you are a Group Registered user.
and (d) your use of Wakelet does not violate any applicable law or regulation.
Your Wakelet account may be deleted without notification if we have reason to believe that you do not meet these eligibility requirements.
When you sign up to become a Registered User of Wakelet, you will be asked to choose a username and a password for your account, or Wakelet may assign a password to you that you may change.
Alternatively we may allow you to use a third-party account and authorisation service (for example, Facebook and Google) in order to use Wakelet, and by using a third-party authorization service you are agreeing to that third partyâs terms of use, privacy policy and any other agreement between you and them.
You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password, you must treat such information as confidential, and you should not disclose it to any other person or entity.

Unless you are a Group Registered User and have agreed to and comply with these Terms in full, you also acknowledge that your account is personal to you and agree not to provide any other person with access to Wakelet or portions of it using your user name, password or other security information.
For the avoidance of doubt, where you are a Group Registered User you should not share your username or password with any other person but we may permit you to allow other individuals access to Wakelet using your account, strictly in accordance with these Terms.
We encourage you to use "strong" passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account.
Wakelet cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above.
You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized access to or use of your user name or password or any other breach of security.
You also agree to ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session.
Subject to the foregoing, you should use particular caution when accessing your account from a public or shared computer so that others are not able to view or record your password or other personal information.
We have the right to disable any user name, password or other identifier, whether chosen by you or provided by us, at any time in our sole discretion for any or no reason, including if, in our opinion, you have violated any provision of these Terms.
If we do disable your account, you shall not create another account without our permission. Can children use Wakelet? Of course, but Wakelet is not currently directed to children and we expect that use by children will only be done with the guidance, supervision and consent of their parents, guardians and/or authorized school officials.
Further, we rely on parents and guardians to ensure minors only use the Service if they can understand their rights and responsibilities as stated in these Terms and our Privacy Policy.
In the United States, if you are the sponsor of a Sponsored Group (the âSponsorâ), including a School that is using Wakelet, that includes children under the age of 13, you (or your school) assumes the responsibility for complying with the U.S.
Childrenâs Online Privacy Protection Act (âCOPPAâ) and, to the extent applicable, The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (âFERPAâ).
This means that the Sponsor must notify parents/guardians of the information to be collected and obtain parental/guardian consent before collecting and sharing with the Service the personal information of children under the age of 13 in order to establish an account or use the Service.
Schools may under appropriate circumstances provide such consent on behalf of parents/guardians.
For more information on complying with COPPA, see the Federal Trade Commissionâs website at http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/coppafaqs.shtm.
If you are outside of the United States, please ensure that you are complying with any laws applicable to you before submitting any childâs personal information or permitting any child to submit personal information to us.
If a school outside the United States wants to enable its students to use Wakelet, Wakelet will work with such schools on case by case basis to ensure compliance with any applicable laws regarding the collection of information from minors.
