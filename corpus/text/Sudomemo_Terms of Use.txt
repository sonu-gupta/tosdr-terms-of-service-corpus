1.
Flipnotes and other content posted to Sudomemo may be used by Team Sudomemo at any time for purposes such as promotions or demonstrations.
2.

Each user is solely responsible for:
(i) Interactions and exchanges of information with other users from their username.

Therefore, users have the responsibility to make sure that other persons connecting to and using Sudomemo with their system/username are aware of the rules.
