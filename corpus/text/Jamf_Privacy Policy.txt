 Privacy Policy Your privacy is important to JAMF Software, LLC.
As a result, weâve developed this Privacy Policy that covers how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your information.
Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy practices and let us know if you have any questions.

A.
Overview

JAMF Software, LLC and its Affiliates (herein collectively âJamfâ) makes reasonable efforts to protect the privacy of your personal information.
This Privacy Policy was created to demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices.
This Privacy Policy covers Jamfâs use of personal information that we collect in the normal course of our business, when you use our corporate websites or applications, and when you otherwise interact with us, including when you attend events hosted or attended by Jamf and when you contact us for customer support (collectively, the âServicesâ).
In addition to covering how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your information, this policy also discloses our purpose and lawful basis for processing your information, and your related rights.
Our legal basis for collecting and using personal information will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
In most cases, the lawful basis will be that the processing (i) is necessary for our legitimate interests in carrying out our business with you, including direct marketing, provided those interests are not outweighed by your rights and interests, or (ii) is necessary to perform a contract with you.
Where processing is based on your consent, we will identify the processing purposes and provide you with relevant information to make the processing fair and transparent.
If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place.
Our Services are not directed to anyone under the age of 16, and Jamf does not knowingly solicit or collect information from anyone under 16 years of age.
If you are a parent or guardian and believe we may have collected information about a child, please contact us at privacy@jamf.com.
Jamf may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
In the event we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by email or by posting the revised policy on our corporate website (https://www.jamf.com/privacy-policy/).
When we update this Privacy Policy, we will note the date the most recent revision was posted below, at the end of the policy.
Any revisions will become effective upon (7) calendar days following such posting on our corporate website.

Use of Cookies. We may collect various forms of information such as entry and exit points for our websites (i.e., referring URLs or domain names), website traffic statistics, operating system and browser type (collectively âTraffic Dataâ).

Sharing of Personal Information &amp.
Accountability for Onward Transfer

From time to time, Jamf may engage third-party business partners, vendors, or sub-processors to perform functions such as sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, data storage, processing credit card payments, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), and providing customer service.
Such companies shall only use your information for those purposes required to perform their functions.
Additionally, Jamf may share your information, without your prior consent, in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, or transfer of assets.
When information is shared, Jamf will ascertain that any third parties are obligated to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required under this policy.
Should Jamf transfer information outside of a local jurisdiction, it shall only be done with adequate protections in place and in compliance with applicable laws and standards.
Jamf may share your information if we have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) protect and defend the rights or property of Jamf, (ii) enforce this Privacy Policy or the Servicesâ terms and conditions of access and use agreement, (iii) participate in dispute resolution pursuant to this Privacy Policy, (iv) protect the interests of other users of the Services or any other person, or (v) operate or conduct maintenance and repair of the Services or equipment.
Jamf may be required to disclose an individual's information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
Jamf shall remain liable under applicable law and relevant contract obligations for it subprocessors', if they process your information in a manner inconsistent with applicable law and contract obligations, unless Jamf proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

F: Internation Data Transfer

Your personal information might be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are a resident.
These countries may have data protection and privacy laws that are different than the laws of your home country.
Jamf only transfers personal information to other countries in accordance with applicable data protection and privacy laws, provided there are legally adequate protections in place for the personal information.
A list of Jamfsâ global offices is available here.
If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA) and your personal information is transferred outside of the EEA, we will:

Process it in a territory which the European Commission has determined provides an adequate level of protection for personal information.
or
Otherwise implement appropriate safeguards to protect your personal information, including by Standard Contractual Clauses or another lawful transfer mechanism approved by the European Commission.

Jamf and Wandera, Inc.
comply with the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S.
Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States.
Jamf and Wandera, Inc.
have certified to the U.S.
Department of Commerce that we adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles.
If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.
To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.
Additionally, our organization commits to cooperate with EU data protection authorities (DPAs) and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) and comply with the advice given by such authorities with regard to human resources data transferred from the EU and Switzerland in the context of the employment relationship.
Jamf will continue to adhere to the Privacy Shield frameworks and Principles even though the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) determined in July 2020 that the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield framework is no longer an adequate transfer mechanism for the transfer of EU personal information to the U.S.
Jamf has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus.
If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit http://www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers for more information and to file a complaint.
Under certain circumstances, individuals may invoke binding arbitration.

G.
Protection of Information

Taking into account the risks involved in the processing and nature of information and to prevent loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction and while maintaining data accuracy, Jamf has put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial policies and procedures to safeguard the information Jamf collects.
Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology.
However, the safety and security of your information also depends on you.
Where you have chosen or we have given you a username and password for access to certain parts of the Services, you are responsible for keeping the username and password confidential.
Although we do our best to protect the information, we cannot and do not guarantee the security of your information.
For more information on how we protect information, see https://www.jamf.com/trust-center/.

H.
Retention

Jamf will only retain your information in an identifiable form for as long as it serves the purposes for which it was collected.

I.
Other Limits to Your Privacy 

The Services may contain links to other non-Jamf websites.
Jamf is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.
Jamf has no control over the use of such websites, and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose any information on these websites.

J.
Choice 

We seek to provide you with choices regarding the information you provide to us.

We will try to comply with your request(s) as soon as reasonably practicable.
Please note that if you opt-out of receiving marketing-related emails from us, we may still send you important operational or administrative messages.

K.
Access and Correction

You have the right to access the personal information we hold about you.
You may access your information that Jamf holds by contacting us via Section M below.
You have the right to correct, amend, or delete that information where it is inaccurate, or has been processed in violation of applicable privacy laws, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individualâs privacy in the case in question, or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated.
To protect your privacy and security, Jamf may also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before making corrections to or deleting your account.
Jamf processes some personal information solely on behalf of its customers in the course of delivering Services.
This personal information is processed to accomplish the business purposes of the customer to whom the Services are provided, and often, Jamf will not have a direct relationship with the subject of this personal information.
In these cases, Jamf recommends first contacting the organization to which your personal information was originally provided with any data privacy questions.
The organization can contact Jamf if escalation of your query is necessary.

L.
Regulatory Oversight

For this Privacy Policy and its content, Jamf is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
