16.
Disputes.
Mandatory Arbitration.

Most disagreements can be resolved informally and efficiently by contacting our Member Services &amp.
Support at norton.com/support.
If you are a U.S.
visitor of the Website:
a.  &nbsp.
You and NortonLifeLock agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to your access to and use of the Website (a âClaimâ) will be determined by binding arbitration or small claims court, instead of in courts of general jurisdiction.

b.  &nbsp.
Small Claims Court.
Either of us can seek to have a Claim resolved in small claims court if all the requirements of the small claims court are satisfied, including any limitations on jurisdiction and the amount at issue in the dispute.
Either of us may seek to have a Claim resolved in small claims court in your county of residence or in the Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara.
c.   &nbsp.
Arbitration.
Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.
Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts.
Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.
You agree that the U.S.
Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision, and that you and NortonLifeLock are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.
This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms of Use.
d.  &nbsp.
Notice of Claim. If you elect to seek arbitration, you must first send to NortonLifeLock, by certified mail, a written Notice of Your Claim ("Notice of Claim").
The Notice of Claim to NortonLifeLock should be addressed to: General Counsel, NortonLifeLock Inc., 60 Rio Salado Pkwy #1000, Tempe AZ 85281, and should be prominently captioned âNOTICE OF CLAIM.â The Notice of Claim should include both the mailing address and email address You would like NortonLifeLock to use to contact you.
If NortonLifeLock elects to seek arbitration, it will send, by certified mail, a written Notice of Claim to the address you provide to us in your Notice of Claim.
A Notice of Claim, whether sent by you or by NortonLifeLock, must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.
(b) set forth the specific amount of damages or other relief sought ("Demand").
and (c) whether you reject any subsequent modification of this Section by NortonLifeLock.
e.  &nbsp.
Arbitration Proceedings.
If we do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice of Claim is received, you or NortonLifeLock may commence an arbitration proceeding (or, alternatively, file a claim in small claims court).
You may download or copy a form of notice and a form to initiate arbitration at www.adr.org.
The arbitration will be governed by the Consumer or Commercial Arbitration Rules, as appropriate, of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") (collectively, the "AAA Rules"), as modified by these Terms of Use, and will be administered by the AAA.
The AAA Rules and Forms are available online at www.adr.org.
The arbitrator is bound by these Terms of Use.
All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision.
Unless NortonLifeLock and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of either your residence or of the mailing address you provided in your Notice of Claim.
If your claim is for U.S.
$10,000 or less, NortonLifeLock agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely based on documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.
If your claim exceeds U.S.
$10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
Regardless of the way the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
If the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of our last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected (or if we did not make a settlement offer before an arbitrator was selected), then We will pay you, in addition to the award, either U.S.
$500 or 10% of the amount awarded, whichever is greater.
f.    &nbsp.
Injunctive and Declaratory Relief.
Except as provided in Section 16(b) above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by you or NortonLifeLock and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.
To the extent that you or NortonLifeLock prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration.
The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.        
g.  &nbsp.
Arbitration Fees.
Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
You are required to pay AAAâs initial filing fee but NortonLifeLock will reimburse you for this filing fee at the conclusion of the arbitration to the extent it exceeded the fee for filing a complaint in a federal or state court in your county of residence or in Santa Clara County, California.
NortonLifeLock will not seek to recover the administration and arbitrator fees we are responsible for paying under the AAA Rules or these Terms of Use, unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
h.  &nbsp.
Class Action Waiver.
YOU AND WE AGREE THAT WE EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
If you have elected arbitration, unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims with your claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 16 (Disputes.
Mandatory Arbitration) shall be null and void.
i.    &nbsp.
Changes.
If we change this Section 16 after the date you first accepted these Terms, and you have not otherwise affirmatively agreed to such changes, you may reject any such change by so stating within Your Notice of Claim.
By failing to reject any changes to this Section 16 in Your Notice of Claim, you agree to resolve any Claim between you and us in accordance with the terms of the dispute resolution section in effect as of the date of Your Notice of Claim.    

17.
Entire Agreement and Applicable Law

Except as otherwise required herein or by law, these terms are governed by the laws of the State of California, United States of America.
If any term in these Terms of Use is found by competent judicial authority to be unenforceable in any respect, the validity of the remainder of these Terms of Use will be unaffected, provided that such unenforceability does not materially affect the partiesâ rights under these Terms of Use.
