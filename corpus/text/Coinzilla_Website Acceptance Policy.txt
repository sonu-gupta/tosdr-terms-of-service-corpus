Being a finance &amp.

The website traffic should not be incentivized with rewards for the user's presence or any other activity done by them on the site.


The website should not be involved in any illicit activity that may harm the user's well-being or inflict any financial loss by promoting shady, insecure, spam, or fake projects.
