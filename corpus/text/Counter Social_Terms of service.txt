Terms of service We believe that everyone should have the power to create and share ideas and information instantly, without barriers.
In order to protect the experience and safety of people who use CounterSocial, there are some limitations on the type of content and behavior that we allow.
These limitations are set forth in the CounterSocial Rules below.
The CounterSocial Rules and Privacy Policy, collectively make up the "CounterSocial User Agreement" that governs a user's access to and use of CounterSocial's services.
All individuals accessing or using CounterSocialâs services must adhere to the policies set forth in the CounterSocial Rules.
Failure to do so may result in CounterSocial taking one or more of the following enforcement actions: requiring you to delete prohibited content before you can again create new posts and interact with other CounterSocial users.
temporarily limiting your ability to create posts or interact with other CounterSocial users.
asking you to verify account ownership with a phone number or email address.
or permanently suspending your account(s).
If you attempt to evade a permanent suspension by creating new accounts, we will suspend your new accounts.
Please note that we may need to change these Rules from time to time and reserve the right to do so.
The most current version is always available here.
The policies set forth in these CounterSocial Rules govern organic content on our platform.
We reserve the right to suspend accounts or take other appropriate action when someoneâs brand or trademark, including business name and/or logo, is used in a manner that may mislead or confuse others about your brand affiliation.
Copyright Images uploaded to CounterSocial servers may be automatically water-marked with the server address, however all rights including the legal copyright of any user uploaded image and or content remain solely and wholly with the owner of the image and or content.
We will respond to clear and complete notices of alleged copyright infringement.
Graphic violence and adult content We consider graphic violence to be any form of gory media related to death, serious injury, violence, or surgical procedures.
We consider adult content to be any media that is pornographic and/or may be intended to cause sexual arousal.
CounterSocial allows some forms of graphic violence and/or adult content in toots marked as containing sensitive media.
However, you may not use such content in your profile or header images.
Additionally, CounterSocial may sometimes require you to remove excessively graphic violence out of respect for the deceased and their families if we receive a request from their family or an authorized representative.
unlawful use You may not use our service for any unlawful purposes or in furtherance of illegal activities.
By using CounterSocial, you agree to comply with all applicable laws governing your online conduct and content.
research use You may not use our service for any form of research purposes without official written prior permission from CounterSocial, and a further OPT IN from any CounterSocial users whose content you include within said research.
account verification Currently, CounterSocial PRO users are automatically classified as 'verified' by default.
This is because PRO accounts are paid accounts and therefore a payment method and details have been provided.
However, CounterSocial reserves the right to swift action, without notification, ranging from verification declassification to the permabanning of users attempting to pose as, pass themselves off as, or otherwise fraudulently abuse the verification badge for the purposes of impersonating other users or company brands by name.
PRO users may request for their own verified user status to be removed if they so wish.
misuse of countersocial badges You may not use CounterSocial badges, unless provided by CounterSocial.
Accounts using unauthorized badges as part of their profile photos, header photos, display names, or in any way that falsely implies affiliation with CounterSocial or authorization from CounterSocial to display these badges, may be suspended.
misuse of usernames Selling usernames: You may not buy or sell CounterSocial usernames.
Username squatting: You may not engage in username squatting.
Some of the factors we take into consideration when determining whether conduct is username squatting include: the number of accounts created.
the creation of accounts for the purpose of preventing others from using those account names.
the creation of accounts for the purpose of selling those accounts.
and the use of third-party content feeds to update and maintain accounts under the names of those third parties.
Please note that CounterSocial may also remove accounts that are inactive for more than six months.
abusive behavior We believe in freedom of expression and open dialogue, but that means little as an underlying philosophy if voices are silenced because people are afraid to speak up.
In order to ensure that people feel safe expressing diverse opinions and beliefs, we prohibit behavior that crosses the line into abuse, including behavior that harasses, intimidates, or uses fear to silence another userâs voice.
Context matters when evaluating for abusive behavior and determining appropriate enforcement actions.
Factors we may take into consideration include, but are not limited to whether: the behavior is targeted at an individual or group of people.
the report has been filed by the target of the abuse or a bystander.
the behavior is newsworthy and in the legitimate public interest.
violence and physical harm You may not make specific threats of violence or wish for the serious physical harm, death, or disease of an individual or group of people.
This includes, but is not limited to, threatening or promoting terrorism.
suicide or self harm You may not promote or encourage suicide or self-harm.
When we receive reports that a person is threatening suicide or self-harm, we may take a number of steps to assist them, such as reaching out to that person and providing resources such as contact information for our mental health partners.
child sexual exploitation You may not promote child sexual exploitation of ANY kind.
CounterSocial is committed to providing no safe haven for abusers and exploiters of children.
All images uploaded to CounterSocial, whether in a public or private context, are hashed en-route to us.
Then transparently and automagically, that hash is compared to multiple National Media Exploitation Center (NMEC) databases of known Child Sex Abuse Material (CSAM) hashes.
This happens at our infrastructure edge - BEFORE any image lands on CounterSocials' at-rest encrypted storage systems.
If a positive hash-match is discovered CounterSocial administrators will be alerted, in realtime, and neccessary actions will be taken to lock the offending account, preserve evidence, and notify the appropriate law enforcement agencies.
No ifs.
No buts.
No exceptions, no mercy.
PRIVACY NOTE to users: At NO TIME are your images being 'viewed' or 'looked' at.
They are simply being 'hashed' and that hash then compared to NMEC CSAM hash databases.
abuse and hateful conduct You may not engage in the targeted harassment of someone, or incite other people to do so.
We consider abusive behavior an attempt to harass, intimidate, or silence someone elseâs voice.
unwanted sexual advances You may not direct abuse at someone by sending unwanted sexual content, objectifying them in a sexually explicit manner, or otherwise engaging in sexual misconduct.
hateful conduct You may not promote violence against, threaten, or harass other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease.
private information and intimate media You may not publish or post other people's private information without their express authorization and permission.
Definitions of private information may vary depending on local laws.
Read more about our private information policy.
Intimate media: You may not post or share intimate photos or videos of someone that were produced or distributed without their consent.
threats to expose or hack You may not threaten to expose someoneâs private information or intimate media.
You also may not threaten to hack or break into someoneâs digital information.

if a large number of people have blocked you in response to high volumes of untargeted, unsolicited, or duplicative content or engagements from your account.
if a large number of spam complaints have been filed against you.
if you post duplicative or substantially similar content, replies, or mentions over multiple accounts or multiple duplicate updates on one account, or create duplicate or substantially similar accounts.
