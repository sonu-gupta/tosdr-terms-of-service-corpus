We want a world that encourages trust, adventure and intercultural connections.
For that to happen through Trustroots we have written down some basic rules that apply to everyone.
Please respect these rules:

Be friendly and know when to stop messaging someone.
We have no tolerance for abusive members.
We have no tolerance for spam, ads and other objectionable content.
Be a human being: write messages specifically for their recipient.
Respect copyrights: stay within your rights if you want to share other people's texts and images - check their legal status!
Make your own profile.
One person, one profile â use your alias or real name.
but never impersonate someone else, real or imaginary.
Be yourself, helpful, kind, responsible.
Be respectful of others and restrain from any kind of abusive behaviour.

If you ignore these rules, we might stop our services for you without further notice.
We try to keep our rules simple and we value transparency.
We'll update these rules as needed.
