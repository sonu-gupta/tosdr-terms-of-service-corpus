         EVE Online - End User License Agreement
 ESRB Notice: Game Experience May Change During Online Play
 Thank you for your interest in EVE, interactive online game ("EVE" or the "Game").
EVE is offered by CCP hf.
("CCP"), a company based in Reykjavik, Iceland dedicated to the creation of next generation games.
EVE is a multiplayer role playing game that allows the simultaneous participation of players around the world, interacting in the same game environment.
You may play EVE using CCP's proprietary software (the "Software").
 Using the Software allows you to log into CCPâs client system (the âSystemâ) and interact within the game environment created by CCP.
To play EVE, CCP requires that you review and agree to the following terms and conditions of this End User License Agreement (âEULAâ).
 This EULA describes the terms and conditions under which you may (i) use the Software.
(ii) subscribe to, access and use EVE Online, and (iii) access the System.
CCP may amend this EULA from time to time by posting an amended version at http://community.eveonline.com/support/policies/eve-eula-en/.
If you accept this EULA, the then-current version of this EULA shall apply each time you access the System or play EVE.
 By clicking the "ACCEPT" button below (or if you bypass or otherwise disable the "ACCEPT" button, and still access or otherwise use the Software, the System or the Game), you accept the terms and conditions in the EULA.
If you do not accept the terms and conditions in the EULA, you must click the "DECLINE" button, discontinue use of the Software and not access the System or use EVE Online.
If you are the original purchaser of a boxed version of the Software on CD-ROM, you should contact the retailer for a refund.
CCP does not manufacture or distribute the box version of the Game and is not responsible for refunding any fees relating thereto.

 REQUIREMENTS TO PLAY  To play EVE, you must: (i) download a copy of the Software.
(ii) establish a valid account within the Game (an "Account").
(iii) obtain and maintain your own Internet access (Internet access is required to play EVE.
CCP is not responsible for your access to the Internet).
and (iv) comply with the EULA.

 YOUR ACCOUNT  You may establish more than one Account for each copy of the Software licensed.
You are however not allowed to play EVE by using more than one Account at the same time, unless you pay a subscription fee for each of the Accounts you intend to use for that purpose. A.
Establishing a New Account  Upon establishing a new Account, you will be entitled to play EVE.
Once you have established an account, you will have an option to pay a subscription fee, which will allow you to enjoy additional features in EVE. 
 Only an individual, natural person who is an adult or, in the discretion of such an adult, his or her minor child, may establish an Account.
You are responsible and liable for all activities conducted through your Account, regardless of who conducts those activities.
 You may not share your Account with anyone, or allow anyone other than you personally (or your minor child, if you have registered an Account on behalf of your minor child) to access or use your Account.
Joint or shared ownership or use of an Account by more than one user is prohibited.
 Accounts may not be used for business purposes.
Access to the System and playing EVE is intended for your personal entertainment, enjoyment and recreation, and not for corporate, business, commercial or income-seeking activities.
Business entities and anyone who is acting for or on behalf of a business or for business purposes may not establish an Account, access the System or play EVE.
 Accessing the System or using the Game for commercial, business or income-seeking purposes is strictly prohibited. B.
Passwords and Names  You will be asked to select a password during the registration process ("Password").
You may not disclose your Password to anyone or allow anyone to use your Password to access the System or play EVE.
You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Password and for any damage, harm, lost or deleted characters, etc.
resulting from your disclosure, or allowing the disclosure, of any Password, or from use by any person of your Password.
You may not obtain, attempt to obtain, use or attempt to use the password of anyone else.
You are responsible for remembering your Account information and Password.
 You will be assigned a login name and a character name during the registration and character creation process.
You may not allow anyone to use your login name or character name to access the System or play EVE.
No player may use the character name of another player to impersonate or falsely represent his or her identity.
You may not obtain, attempt to obtain, use or attempt to use the login name or character name of anyone else.
 You are encouraged to use a pseudonym, but you may not choose a name that violates anyone's trademarks, publicity rights or other rights.
Acceptance of a pseudonym by the System does not mean that your chosen pseudonym does not violate anyone's rights.
You are responsible for any liability incurred by yourself, CCP or anyone else due to the pseudonym you choose.
CCP retains the right to reject any pseudonym it determines, in its sole discretion, is unlawful, indecent, obscene or otherwise violates standards of good taste. C.
Children (1) Responsibility for Account  Minor children may not establish an Account without the consent of a parent or guardian.
If the user of EVE is a minor, a parent or guardian must complete the registration process to establish an Account, in which case the parent or guardian takes full responsibility for all obligations under the EULA and for all activities of the child using the Account.
If you are a parent or guardian, you may permit one child to use an Account instead of you (in which case you may not use that Account).
 If you establish an Account, you represent that you are an adult and are either accepting the EULA on behalf of yourself or on behalf of your child, in which latter case you agree to the EULA with regard to your child and represent that you are also personally bound by the EULA. (2) Game Rating  EVE has a "TEEN" rating.
 Parents may find it inappropriate for use by children under the age of thirteen (13). D.
Inappropriate Conduct / Communication.
 CCP may establish Rules of Conduct (discussed below) for players accessing the System and may, but is not obligated to, monitor and take action regarding inappropriate conduct.
Nonetheless, it is possible that at any time there may be language or other material accessible on or through the System that you may consider inappropriate or offensive to some users.
You acknowledge that other players may transmit communications or content, or access to content, that you may consider inappropriate or objectionable.
CCP does not, as a matter of policy, prescreen the communications or content transmitted by each player and is in no way responsible for the communications and content transmitted by players of the Game.

 ACCOUNT TRANSFER / CHARACTER TRANSFER  You are not permitted to transfer your Account to another person.
If you wish to discontinue your Account please refer to section 5.
of this EULA.
You may transfer a character from your Account to another account, either belonging to you or another person.
This transfer option is available from the EVE Online Account Management web site https://secure.eveonline.com/ and is subject to fees and the following limitations: You may not offer to transfer characters except your own, or act as a "broker" or intermediary (for compensation or otherwise) for anyone wishing to transfer or obtain characters.
The transferee will obtain all rights to your character in a single transaction, and you will retain absolutely no control or rights over the characters, items or attributes of that character.
You may not transfer any characters whose attributes are, in whole or in part, developed, or which own items, objects or currency obtained or acquired, in violation of the EULA.
 Any character transfers or attempted transfers not in accordance with the foregoing terms is prohibited and void, and shall not be binding on CCP.
A transfer or attempted transfer of a character is entirely at the risk of the parties to such transaction.
CCP is not liable to any person (whether transferor, transferee or otherwise) for any acts, omissions, statements, representations, defaults or liabilities of the parties in connection with such a transaction.

 FEES AND PAYMENT TERMS  You are not required to pay a fee to play EVE.
 You may however be required to pay a download fee and/or a subscription fee to access and use certain features of EVE, which would otherwise be unavailable.

If you do not wish to pay any such fees or cancel your paid subscription, the features available to you while playing EVE will be limited.
 You are responsible for reviewing the fees section of the Game for changes in fees or payment terms.
If a fee is unacceptable to you, you may either decide not to pay it, and enjoy a more limited gameplay, or terminate the EULA and close your Account as described in the termination section below.

 CONDUCT A.
Specifically Restricted Conduct  Your continued access to the System and license to play the Game is subject to proper conduct.
Without limiting CCP's rights to control the Game environment, and the conduct of the players within that environment, CCP prohibits the following practices that CCP has determined detract from the overall user experience of the users playing the Game.

 You may not take any action that imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on the System.
 You may not use your own or third-party software to modify any content appearing within the Game environment or change how the Game is played.
 You may not use your own or any third-party software, macros or other stored rapid keystrokes or other patterns of play that facilitate acquisition of items, currency, objects, character attributes, rank or status at an accelerated rate when compared with ordinary Game play.
You may not rewrite or modify the user interface or otherwise manipulate data in any way to acquire items, currency, objects, character attributes or beneficial actions not actually acquired or achieved in the Game.
 You may not use the Software, or any information accessible through the System, to bypass the System login architecture or create or provide any other means through which the System may be accessed and/or the Game may be played by others, as, for example, through server emulators.
 You may not submit any content to any chat room or other public forum within the Game that is harassing, abusive, threatening, harmful, obscene, libelous or defamatory, encourages conduct that could constitute a criminal offense or give rise to civil liabilities, or is unlawful in any other way, including without limitation the submission of content that infringes on a third-partyâs intellectual property rights.
 You may not engage in any conduct that results in an Account containing items, objects, currency, character attributes, rank, or status that are inappropriate for the level or rank of the character contained in the Account, including without limitation arranging, making or accepting transfers of items to a character without adequate consideration, thereby augmenting or aggregating items in an Account and increasing its value for an Account sale.
 B.
Selling Items and Objects  You may not transfer, sell or auction, or buy or accept any offer to transfer, sell or auction (or offer to do any of the foregoing), any content appearing within the Game environment, including without limitation characters, character attributes, items, currency, and objects, other than via a permitted Character Transfer as described in section 3 above.
You may not encourage or induce any other person to participate in such a prohibited transaction.
You may not use, transfer or assign any game assets for games of chance operated by third parties.
The buying, selling or auctioning (or any attempt at doing so) of characters, character attributes, items, currency, or objects, whether through online auctions, newsgroups, postings on message boards or any other means is prohibited by the EULA and a violation of CCP's proprietary rights in the Game. C.

The foregoing assignment and license in this paragraph shall not include User Content (defined below). C.

 You hereby grant CCP an exclusive, perpetual, worldwide, irrevocable, assignable, royalty-free license, fully sub-licensable through multiple tiers, to exercise all intellectual property and other rights, in and to all or any part of your User Content, in any medium now known or hereafter developed.
 Violation of CCP's proprietary rights is a material breach of the EULA, in the event of which CCP may suspend your Account, terminate the EULA and take whatever additional action CCP deems appropriate under the circumstance.
The foregoing is without prejudice to or waiver of any and all of CCP's other rights and remedies, all of which are expressly reserved, survive termination, and are cumulative.
