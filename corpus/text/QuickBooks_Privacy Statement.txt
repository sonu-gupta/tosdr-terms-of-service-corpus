 You deserve transparency into our data use Our privacy statement spells out exactly what we do with your data after you share it with us.
It has all the details about what we collect, who we share it with, and how we use it.
FranÃ§ais FranÃ§ais (Canada) EspaÃ±ol PortuguÃªs Intuit Global Privacy Statement Last Updated: December 3, 2020
 See previous Privacy Statements Introduction and overview Intuit leverages technology responsibly to power prosperity around the world, and we believe that everyone has a right to privacy.
At Intuit, we view privacy as a key part of the value that we deliver to our customers.
Intuitâs Data Stewardship Principles were developed to describe Intuitâs values regarding the data our customers entrust to us.
Scope of this Privacy Statement and our role As a financial services and technology company, weâre providing this Global Privacy Statement (which weâll refer to as âPrivacy Statementâ) to explain how we collect, use, and share information when you interact with us and our offerings, services and experiences.
This Privacy Statement is global in nature, meaning that it is applicable to all websites and offerings in the Intuit group companies, and it describes our privacy practices when we process:
a) Personal information for the purposes of preparing a tax return or in connection with the preparation of a tax return (collectively, âTax Preparation Informationâ) as part of providing TurboTax tax preparation services;
b) Personal information for the purposes of providing the benefits of the Intuit platform, which is collectively, all of Intuitâs services, sites, experiences and software (including through our mobile applications and desktop applications) by Intuit Inc.
and its affiliates and subsidiaries other than Tax Preparation Information (the âIntuit Platformâ).
and/or
c) Personal information as necessary to manage, run and improve our business.
Intuit Inc.
determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal information (âInformation Controllerâ).
Intuit Inc.
may share your personal data with other Intuit group companies to process as joint controllers for the purposes set out in this Privacy Statement.
If you have any questions about the processing of your personal data, please contact us in the section âHow to Contact Usâ below.

This Privacy Statement does not apply where Intuit processes personal information as a service provider on behalf of a customer or entity who acts as the Information Controller, for example, the customers of our professional tax software products.
When we act as a service provider, the privacy statement of the relevant Information Controller and our agreements with such business or entity will govern our processing of personal information.
In certain circumstances, there may be more than one Information Controller processing your information.
For example, your employer or a financial partner may also act as an Information Controller.
In these situations, we act as an independent Information Controller over our processing activities â meaning that we make determinations over how your personal information will be processed independently from the other Information Controller.
The other Information Controller may have their own obligations under applicable information privacy law, and you may need to speak with the other Information Controller directly for questions on how they process your personal information. The Intuit Platform The Intuit Platform and your information When we say âplatformâ we mean that when you choose to share data with us, or bring over information from third parties (like a bank or loan provider), we use that data together, not just within the individual offering(s) youâre using.
This means your bookkeeping details from QuickBooks, budgets from Mint, and recommendations from Credit Karma all live together.

The personal information we use in this centralized way is all the information that Intuit knows about you.
It includes your credentials.
your name and contact details.
payment information.
information about your activities, your interests and preferences.
insights about your finances or your business.
the content you place in our Platform.
and information we have collected about you from third-party sources. Organizational account information Some experiences and services within the Intuit Platform allow you to interact with an organization (such as your employer).
If you are granted access to an organization or household account (for example, a business's account in QuickBooks), the owner of the organization or a designated administrator may control and administer details of your account, for example, by deciding your access rights.
making decisions about your personal information (such as details about your payroll).
or requiring you to take certain actions (for example, use location tracking to clock in for a shift).
If your access rights are amended by the owner or designated administrator, then you may lose access to the information that is in the control of the organization.
Your use of the Intuit Platform as part of an organizationâs account may be subject to the organizationâs policies, which may be different from this Statement.
We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of other organizations, and you should consider both the organization's policies and whether you are comfortable enabling the organization with access to your information prior to connecting to their services.
Information we collect Information we receive from you The personal information that we receive about you depends on the context of your interactions with Intuit, how you configure your account and the choices that you make, including your privacy settings.
Personal information that you provide may also depend upon what services or experiences you use, your location and applicable law.
Learn more about the personal information we collect, how we use it, and your rights.

Information from cookies and other technologies.

These identifiers may include facial recognition information, voiceprints and key-stroke information, as well as mathematical representations of your biometric identifier, such as the template maintained for comparison.
We use Biometric Information to identify and authenticate you, and for security and similar purposes.
We share Biometric Information with third-party service providers who assist with our information technology, security and fraud programs, our professional advisors, and as required by law or regulation.
Intuit does not sell your Biometric Information.
When we collect Biometric Information, you will receive a specific notice and consent request at the time of that collection.
You are not required to consent to the collection of Biometric Information in order to use our services, although some functionality may not be available if you decline and you may withdraw your consent at any time.
Intuit will retain Biometric Information until the purposes for which it was collected have been satisfied or three years from your or your organizational account managerâs last interaction with Intuit, whichever comes first.

You may also be able to input or process information about others, for example, if you are an account administrator.
If you input information about others into our platform, you must only do so if you have first received the appropriate rights and permissions to do so, including by getting advanced written consent, if required by applicable law.

For example, if you connect a point of sale application to your account, we may receive details of your businessâs sales records.



Supplemental information and identity verification providers. Service providers who help us verify your identity, the specifics of your business and/or supplement the information you have provided and ensure the accuracy of your information.
