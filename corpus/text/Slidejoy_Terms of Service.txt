and may even be converted into charitable contributions.

operating rules, policies and procedures that may be published from time to
time through the Services by Slidejoy (collectively, the âAgreementâ).

 5.
END USER ACCOUNTS If you sign up for the
Services, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your account, and
you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account.
You
must not use another personâs Slidejoy account or share your password with
another person.
When creating your account, you must provide accurate, complete
and non-misleading information.
You agree to immediately notify Slidejoy of any
unauthorized uses of your account or login credentials or any other breaches of
security.
Slidejoy will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you,
including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or
omissions.
Our current policy limits you to the creation of only one Slidejoy
account per mobile device.

Account features differ
depending on whether they are held by End Users (each, an âEnd User Accountâ)
or Advertisers (each, an âAdvertiser Accountâ).
Special features and terms and
conditions pertaining to End User Accounts and Advertiser Accounts are set
forth in Section 5 and Section 6, respectively.


A.



Slidejoy Application

When you download the Slidejoy Application,
you will be prompted to register for an End User Account, and Slidejoy may then
begin displaying Ad Content on the lockscreen of your mobile phone.
After that,
all of your interactions with Slidejoy will be recorded, stored in our servers,
and associated with your End User Account.
Among other things, your End User
Account will keep track of your Carats, your Carat redemption options, and your
Carat redemption history.
YOU WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO ACCRUE, RECEIVE AND STORE
CARATS WHEN SIGNED INTO YOUR END USER ACCOUNT.
From time to time, at Slidejoyâs
sole and absolute discretion, you may have the option to redeem your Carats for
cash or other benefits.

There is more than one way to
receive Carats using the Slidejoy Application.
The simplest way is by engaging
with Slidejoy by moving the lockscreen unlock slider (i) to the right to
unlock your phone, or (ii) to the left to engage with the Ad Content.
For
example, if you slide left to watch a video advertisement, you may receive Carats,
or if you use a coupon provided through the Application, you may receive Carats.
However, please note that in each case, you will have the opportunity to
receive the 
same number of Carats 
by
sliding right to simply unlock your screen.
The reason is that Slidejoy aims for
honest interactions and discourages disingenuous interactions intended for the
sole purpose of generating Carats.
While you are not prohibited from sliding
left every time Ad Content is displayed on your lockscreen, Slidejoyâs
proprietary smart algorithm is optimized to screen for abuse and will
automatically decrease the number of Carats offered to End Users who attempt to
abuse the system.
Therefore over time, you may find that sliding left too much
will result in a reduced opportunity to receive Carats.
To avoid these
consequences, Slidejoy recommends that you use your smartphone or mobile device
as you normally do and that you engage only with Ad Content that genuinely
interests you.


B.



Flappy Kings Application

When you download the Flappy
Kings Application, you may either begin playing immediately or you will be
prompted to register for an End User Account.
If you register for an End User
Account, all of your interactions with Slidejoy will be recorded, stored in our
servers, and associated with your End User Account.
The Flappy Kings
Application will allow you to acquire Coins, which you can then use to enter Tournaments
or Sweepstakes to win Carats.
Though you may use the Flappy Kings Application
without an End User Account, YOU WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO ACCRUE, RECEIVE AND STORE
COINS AND CARATS WHEN SIGNED INTO YOUR END USER ACCOUNT.
FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF
DOUBT, PRIZES RECEIVED FROM A TOURNAMENT OR SWEEPSTAKES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN BY
A SUBSEQUENT PRIZE IF YOU DO NOT SIGN UP FOR AN END USER ACCOUNT BEFORE THE
RESULTS OF THE SECOND TOURNAMENT OR SWEEPSTAKES ARE POSTED.
Among other things,
your End User Account will keep track of your Coins and Carats, your Carat
redemption options, and your Carat redemption history.
From time to time, at
Slidejoyâs sole and absolute discretion, you may have the option to redeem your
Carats for cash or other benefits.

There is more than one way to
receive Coins using the Flappy Kings Application.
You can accrue Coins while
playing Flappy Kings, or you can watch Ad Content on the Main Menu of the
Flappy Kings Application.
You may only use Coins to participate
in Tournaments or Sweepstakes, as defined below.

i.    &nbsp.
Tournaments
You may enter contests of skill
(âTournamentsâ) on the Flappy Kings Application to try to earn Carats.
You may
be required to enter a Tournament using Coins that you have acquired using the Flappy
Kings Application.
End Users with the highest points at the end of a Tournament
period are the winners.
Tournament Official Rules can be found here: https://www.getslidejoy.com/terms#tournament.
 By participating, you agree to
these Tournament Official Rules, including any Specific Tournament Terms.
ii.   &nbsp.
Sweepstakes
You may also enter games of
chance (âSweepstakesâ) on the Flappy Kings Application to try to win Carats.
You may enter a Sweepstakes (i) via the Flappy Kings Application using Coins
that you have acquired using the Flappy Kings Application, or (ii) by submitting
a 3 X 5 postcard for free entry.
At the end of a Sweepstakes period, a winner
will be drawn at random.
Sweepstakes Official Rules can be found here: https://www.getslidejoy.com/terms#sweepstake.
By participating, you agree to these Sweepstakes Official Rules, including any
Specific Sweepstakes Terms.

C.



Applications Generally

Whether you are using the
Slidejoy Application or the Flappy Kings Application, or both, your Coin and
Carat balance (âRewardsâ) will be reflected in your End User Account.
If you
use both Applications to acquire Rewards, your End User Account will reflect
the entire balance of Rewards from both Applications.
Depending on the current
value of a Carat, which will be determined at Slidejoyâs sole and absolute
discretion, you may, from time to time, redeem them for cash, products and
services, and or convert them into charitable contributions.

Rewards obtained via the
Applications are provided to you under a limited, personal, revocable,
non-transferable, non-sublicenseable license.
Rewards may not be transferred or
resold in any manner, including, without limitation, by means of any direct
sale or auction service.
You have no property interest, right or title in or to
any such Rewards appearing or originating in the Applications, or any other
attributes associated with use of Slidejoy or its Applications.
Any Reward
balance shown in your account does not constitute a real-world balance or
reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a measurement of the extent
of your license.


PLEASE
NOTE THAT SLIDEJOY DOES NOT AND CANNOT PROMISE OR GUARANTEE THAT YOU WILL
RECEIVE ANY NUMBER OF REWARDS OR THAT YOU WILL RECEIVE ANY AMOUNT OF AD CONTENT
IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, OR ANY AMOUNT OF VALUE, MONETARY
OR OTHERWISE, WHEN YOU REDEEM YOUR CARATS.
Slidejoyâs ability to provide Rewards depends on whether, and how much, Slidejoy gets paid by the relevant Advertiser, and due to the complex nature of its relationships with Advertisers, whether Slidejoy gets paid, and how much, may vary over time.
We will, in our sole and absolute discretion, determine and communicate the availability and exchange rate of Rewards, which may be modified at any time.
The availability and exchange rate for Rewards may vary for a variety of reasons, such as non-payment by Advertisers or changes in our arrangements with Advertisers or in applicable laws and regulations.
You must comply with any individual Reward limitations as indicated by Slidejoy (or Advertiserâs terms or website).
We reserve the right to cancel, restrict or terminate Rewards at any time for any reason.
All redemptions are subject to this Agreement and any third-party terms associated with Advertisers.

As noted, each time you receive
Rewards, we place the Rewards in your End User Account.
Your ability to receive
and redeem Rewards is conditioned on your compliance with the Agreement.
You
may access your End User Account to modify your account settings or to review
your Reward balances and Carat redemption choices.
You may log in by entering
your username and password with the Applications or through the Site.

You may log into your End User
Account to redeem your accumulated Carats.
While we reserve the right to modify
when and how you can redeem Carats at any time in our sole and absolute
discretion, as of the âLast Updatedâ date of this Agreement set forth below
(the âEffective Dateâ), you can redeem your Carats by visiting the area of your
End User Account interface (accessible through the Application) called the Exchange
View (the âExchange Viewâ).

While in Exchange View, you may
redeem your Carats pursuant to one of the redemption methods then available to
you.
As of the Effective Date, End Users may have a choice to exchange their Carats
to donate to various nonprofit organizations directly in the app (âHero Modeâ)
or receive a cash payout through PayPal or another third party payment provider
we may make available to you for redemption purposes from time to time (âNormal
Modeâ).
From time to time, Carats may also be redeemable for gift cards, products,
services and other special offers.

When using the Slidejoy
Application, your Carat balance will be updated on the first of each month (each
such date, a âPay Dayâ), and the updated balance will include Carats up until
the last day of the previous month.
For example, February Carats earned
through the Slidejoy Application will be eligible for redemption on March 1.
When
using the Flappy Kings Application, any Carats earned will be immediately
redeemable.
For both Applications, however, the Carats
remain the property of Slidejoy, not you, at all times.

You may close your End User
Account at any time by logging in and adjusting the appropriate settings.
We
will ask that you use Rewards prior to closing your Slidejoy Account.
If your
End User Account is closed and you fail to properly or completely use your Rewards
before such time, you will no longer be able to use or redeem them.
In addition, your End User
Account will be terminated after three (3) months of inactivity.
We also reserve
the right to terminate your End User Account at any time for breach of this
Agreement.
You will no longer be able to use any Rewards in your End User
Account after termination.
We may do this without prior notice, but may attempt
to notify you afterward where feasible.
 6.
ADVERTISER ACCOUNTS Advertisers may access details
pertaining to the performance of advertising campaigns managed by Slidejoy in
connection with the Services by logging into their Advertiser Account and
utilizing Slidejoyâs proprietary tracking and reporting system.

to use any of the information accessed or obtained through your Advertiser
Account except for internal business purposes in connection with this
agreement.

Advertisersâ use of the
Services is subject to all of the terms and conditions in their respective

This Agreement (including the Advertising Agreement, if applicable,
the Privacy Policy and all other Slidejoy operating policies, rules and
procedures posted on the Site or Applications or made available through the
Services from time to time) constitutes the entire agreement between Slidejoy

Except as provided in the next
paragraph with respect to requests for injunctive relief relating to a breach

shall be resolved by final and binding arbitration.
Such arbitration shall take

rules) to any interpretation or enforcement of this Agreement.
In order to keep
hearing costs down, hearings may, at your request, be conducted telephonically

In addition, in the event that you prevail at the
hearing, and the amount awarded to you by the arbitrator is greater than
Slidejoyâs last written settlement offer to you, Slidejoy agrees to pay twice
the amount of your reasonable attorneyâs fees and costs, and a minimum award of
five hundred dollars ($500).

action for injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction.

you (and Slidejoy) waive the right to bring any claim or dispute related to
this Agreement as a class action, consolidated, multi-district or collective
action, or private attorney general action.
You also agree not to participate
in any class action, consolidated, multi-district or collective action, or
private attorney general action regarding any claim or dispute related to this
Agreement.

If Slidejoy prevails in any
arbitration or proceeding to enforce the Agreement or arising out of your
access to or use of the Services, it shall be entitled to recover, in addition
to all other available legal and equitable relief, its legal costs, including
reasonable attorneysâ fees.
If any part of the Agreement is held invalid or
unenforceable, that part will be reformed to reflect the partiesâ original
intent, and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect.
The
provisions of the Agreement are severable, and if any portion is adjudged
invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining
portions will remain valid, enforceable and in effect.
Any waiver by either
party of any term or condition of the Agreement or any breach thereof shall be in
writing, executed by the party to be charged, and any such waiver, in any one
instance, will not waive such term or condition in any other instance or any
subsequent breach thereof.
The Agreement is not assignable by you, except by
operation of law.
Slidejoy may assign its rights under the Agreement without
condition.
The Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of
the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
