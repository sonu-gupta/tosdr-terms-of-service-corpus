Data Collection:

We collect no information ourselves on you.
However as our site uses Google Analytics, Google Ads and Facebook Connect your viewing history may be collected by them.

Data Storage:


Members details are stored in a database on the server, as well as on offsite backups.
Offsite backups are encrypted and only stored for a small period of time as needed.
Passwords are not stored as plaintext, they are hashed and salted for security so that in the event of a data breach they are unusable.
