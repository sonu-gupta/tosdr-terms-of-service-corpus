MANDATORY ARBITRATION FOR U.S.
USERS - CLASS ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION, AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER

PLEASE REVIEW AS THIS AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO OBTAIN RELIEF OR DAMAGES THROUGH COURT ACTION OR AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS.


ARBITRATION. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US (WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DISPUTE INVOLVES A THIRD PARTY) WITH REGARD TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH US (INCLUDING DISPUTES RELATED TO THIS USER AGREEMENT, YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, AND/OR RIGHTS OF PRIVACY AND/OR PUBLICITY), WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY BY BINDING ARBITRATION, EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY ASSERT CLAIMS IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT IF YOUR CLAIMS QUALIFY.
YOU AND WE EACH AGREE THAT CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ARBITRATIONS, AS WELL AS CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS, ARE NOT PERMITTED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, AND THAT YOU AND WE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR CLASS ARBITRATION.

You and we each agree that you and we are further waiving our respective rights to sue or go to court to assert or defend our rights under this User Agreement.
You and we each agree that the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.
For all disputes, whether pursued in small claims court or arbitration, you must first give us an opportunity to resolve your claim by sending a written description of your claim to:
BuzzFeed, Inc.

 ATTN: Office of the General Counsel  111 E.
18th St  New York, NY 10003 
We each agree to negotiate your claim in good faith.
If we are unable to resolve the claim within 60 days after we receive your written description, you may pursue your claim in arbitration.
We each agree that if you fail to timely pay amounts due, we may assign your account for collection, and the collection agency may pursue, in small claims court, claims limited strictly to the collection of the past due amounts and any interest or cost of collection permitted by law or this User Agreement.

Either you or BuzzFeed may start arbitration proceedings. You must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to us at the address listed above.
The dispute will be arbitrated by a neutral arbitrator mutually agreeable to both of us.
If we cannot agree on the selection of an arbitrator within 30 days of the date that the request for arbitration was received by us, the dispute will be arbitrated by JAMS arbitration services.
The arbitrator will use the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, subject to the JAMS Consumer Arbitration Minimum Standards (collectively, the âJAMS Rulesâ), unless any such rules are inapplicable to the dispute by their terms or by governing law, or unless we agree to use a different set of rules.
Payment of the partiesâ costs and fees owed to JAMS and the arbitrator will be determined by the JAMS Rules and fee schedule, where applicable, and in such case will be subject to any limitations on the costs and fees owed to you as provided in the JAMS Rules.
The JAMS Rules are available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling 1-800-352-JAMS.
An arbitrator may award (on an individual basis) any relief that would be available in a court, including injunctive or declaratory relief and attorneysâ fees.

Severability. If a court or arbitrator determines in an action between you and us that any of the provisions or prohibitions contained above is unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Mandatory Arbitration for U.S.
Users section will be null and void.
This Mandatory Arbitration for U.S.
