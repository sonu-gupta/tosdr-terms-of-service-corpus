MISCELLANEOUS MATTERSA.&nbsp.
Arbitration Agreement.
Class Waiver.
Waiver of Trial by Jury.
Please read this Section (âArbitration Agreementâ) carefully.
It is part of your contract with Company and affects your rights.
It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.



Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.&nbsp.
All claims and disputes in connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service provided by Company that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement.&nbsp.
This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and Company, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.

Arbitration Rules.&nbsp.
The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute resolution provision.&nbsp.
Arbitration shall be initiated through JAMS, Inc. (formerly Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services), an established alternative dispute resolution provider (âADR Providerâ) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section.&nbsp.
If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider.&nbsp.
The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of this arbitration, including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms (âArbitration Rulesâ).&nbsp.
The JAMS rules governing the arbitration are available online at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 1-800-352-5267.&nbsp.
The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator.&nbsp.
Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S.
Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief.&nbsp.
For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S.
Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules.&nbsp.
Any hearing will be held in a location within one hundred (100) miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States (in which case hearing will be held in the capital of your country), and unless the parties agree otherwise.&nbsp.
Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

Additional Rules for Non-appearance Based Arbitration.&nbsp.
If non-appearance arbitration is elected as provided above, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions.
the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration.&nbsp.
The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties.

Authority of Arbitrator.&nbsp.
The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.&nbsp.
The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim.&nbsp.
The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the Arbitration Rules, and the Terms.&nbsp.
The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.&nbsp.
The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.&nbsp.
The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Company.

Waiver of Jury Trial.&nbsp.
THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement.&nbsp.
Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court.&nbsp.
In the event any litigation should arise between you and Company in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, or under paragraph 11 of this Arbitration Agreement, YOU AND COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.

Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.&nbsp.
ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.&nbsp.
In the event that this subparagraph is deemed invalid or unenforceable neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration and instead claims and disputes shall be resolved in a court located in Santa Clara County, California.

Confidentiality.&nbsp.
No part of the procedures shall be open to the public or the media.&nbsp.
All evidence discovered or submitted at the hearing is confidential and may not be disclosed, except by written agreement of the parties, pursuant to court order or unless required by law.&nbsp.
This Paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Arbitration Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.

Severability.&nbsp.
If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.

Survival of Agreement.&nbsp.
This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company.

Small Claims Court.&nbsp.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Company may bring an individual action in small claims court.

Courts.&nbsp.
In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California, for such purpose.
B.&nbsp.
Governing LawThese Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that may require the application of the law of another jurisdiction.C.&nbsp.
Modifications to TermsWe may change these Terms from time to time.&nbsp.
