This document outlines some (but not all) of the ways we secure data sent to us.

Our clients image data and meta-data is stored only on equipment TinEye owns and controls.
TinEye does not store client image data or meta-data on 3rd party cloud services.
TinEye manages two data centers, both in Toronto, Canada.
One within our headquarters, the second is an off-site dedicated data center.
All storage and processing of client data is done in these two data centers.
Our data centers are physically secure and are only accessible by TinEye staff.
Client data is kept in separate user accounts to prevent corruption or overlap.
All API calls and user account pages are encrypted using TLS.
All account passwords are hashed.
We do not know what your passwords are.
All employees are required to sign a non-disclosure agreement that requires them to treat client data as confidential.
All data storage media (hard drives and solid-state drives) is securely wiped of data or physically destroyed at end of life.
