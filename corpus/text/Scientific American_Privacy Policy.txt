The plugins can be identified by one of Facebookâs logos (white âfâ on blue tile or a âthumps-upâ-sign) or by the additional text âFacebook Social Pluginâ.
The list of Facebook Social Plugins and their appearance can be accessed via: http://developers.facebook.com/plugins. 
If a user visits one of the websites using such a plugin, the userâs browser directly connects to Facebookâs servers.
The plugin and its content are made available directly on Facebookâs servers and included in the website by the userâs browser. 
Due to the integration of the plugin Facebook collects the information that a user is visiting the corresponding website.
If the user is logged in on Facebook at the moment he or she visits the website, Facebook may be able to connect the visit on the website to the userâs Facebook account.
If the user interacts with the plugin â for example if he or she presses the like button or comments on something â the userâs browser transmits this information to Facebook.
Facebook stores this information.
If a user is not a member of Facebook, Facebook may collect and store the userâs IP-address.

The button enables the user to share an article or a website of this homepage on Twitter or to follow the provider on Twitter.

The Twitter-button and its content are loaded directly from Twitterâs servers and included in the website by  the userâs browser.

Where enabled on the journal Springer Nature authors are provided with access to a private author dashboard upon submission to the journal which provides granular insight into the status of their manuscript as it progresses through the peer-review process, and a place where authors can improve their manuscript via free and paid for services offered by Research Square, should they wish. 
Where offered during submission, authors will be able to opt in to the In Review service which posts their manuscript as a permanent, public,  preprint on the Research Square platform.
The preprint will be published under a CC-BY license. 
To be able to offer both services, Springer Nature will send Research Square R&D LLC data on the authorâs manuscript and status updates as it progresses through the peer-review process.
The data transferred includes: manuscript metadata (title, authors (names, email addresses, corresponding author details) subject areas, keywords, funding information).
manuscript, figure, table and supplementary information files (but not cover letters and any other files explicitly indicated to be for use of editorial staff only) of initial submissions only for hybrid and subscription titles, and all versions for Open Access titles.
notification and date of key stages in the peer-review process.
These stages include but are not limited to: passing of initial checks, manuscript assignment to an editor, peer reviewers invited, peer reviewers agreed, peer review reports returned, editorial decision.
For journals that operate an open or transparent peer review model for all submitted manuscripts, the reviewer reports (but not reviewer identities) are also passed to Research Square.
For these titles only the reviewer reports are posted in the private author dashboard and never publicly. 
Research Square uses this data to populate the peer review timeline in the private author dashboard, and surface free and paid for services that are appropriate to the author depending on where their manuscript is within the peer-review process.
If authors have opted in for the In Review service during submission this data will be used to post the manuscript as a public preprint and populate the public peer review timeline (if offered).
