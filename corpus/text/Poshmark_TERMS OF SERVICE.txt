Risks, No Warranty. You assume certain risks in using a marketplace service such as Poshmark.
Poshmark is not involved with, nor provides a warranty for, any transaction between Buyer and Seller, nor has title to any Items, and is not the Buyer or Seller in any transaction.
You as a Buyer and/or Seller assume, agreement, and understand You bear all of the risks in selling or purchasing of items on the Service.

Fees.  Registering for the Service is free, however, Poshmark charges certain fees for various transactions through Your use of the Service as set forth in the Fee Policy.
All amounts are quoted in US dollars unless otherwise stated.

Prohibited items. 
Poshmark prohibits the listing or sale of any Item that is illegal to sell under any applicable law, statute, ordinance, or regulation, including, without limitation, Items listed in our Prohibited Items Policy.Poshmark prohibits the listing or sale of counterfeit items.Please refer to our Posh Authenticate policy for further information.


Sellers. You agree that You have all rights necessary to sell the Items you make available, and will describe such Items truthfully, accurately, and completely.

Buyers. You are solely responsible for reading and reviewing the Item listing before making an offer or purchasing.
The contract to purchase is between You and the Seller, not Poshmark.

Purchases. Buyers may offer to purchase Items from Sellers, and once accepted, this is considered a purchase, and a binding contract.
Upon purchasing an Item, a Buyer is obligated to remit payment for the Item to Poshmark including any shipping or additional fees listed.
Poshmark is not an auctioneer, nor is it a Seller or carrier.
Service includes pricing, listing, and shipping assistance, but Poshmark is not a Buyer or Seller of Items.
Poshmark may delay any Purchase for purposes of fraud detection or to protect users from other illegal or wrongful activities.
All Purchases are final, with no returns, refunds, cancellations, or retractions allowed, except where (a) Buyer cancels an order within three (3) hours of purchase, or (b) the Purchase is cancelled where explicitly permitted by Poshmark or where applicable, a Seller.

Shipping. 
Poshmark will provide Seller with a prepaid shipping label to send the Item to the Buyer (Poshmark reserves the right to discontinue providing Labels to any or all users at any time and for any reason).
Seller must then deliver Item to Buyer.
Seller must ship Item within three (3) days of receipt of the label, if Seller does not ship the Item We will notify Seller and provide a set amount of time for shipping before the order will be cancelled.
When using a label Seller must only use label to ship applicable item, is fully responsible for contents of parcel, comply with all terms and comply with all conditions of the shipping carrier.
Title transfers to Buyer upon shipment.
If an Item is lost, damaged, late, or arrives not as expected to Buyer, Buyer must report issue to Poshmark three (3) days after delivery.
Once Buyer confirms receipt and acceptance of Item, either by affirmatively notifying Poshmark or failing to notify Poshmark within three (3) days of delivery (as determined by tracking information), Poshmark will credit Sellerâs account with amount equal to Purchase price, minus taxes, Poshmarkâs commission, and any applicable fees (the âFundsâ) set forth in our  Fee Policy. Funds may be redeemed by Seller through Poshmarkâs permitted third party payment provider(s), or used by the Seller to purchase items listed by other Sellers through the Service.


Taxes. Purchased items may be subject to applicable taxes in your jurisdiction, which Poshmark will collect from Buyers on behalf of Sellers where obligated to do so, and in the event taxes are collected and Poshmark is legally obligated to do so, remit such taxes to applicable taxing authorities on behalf of Sellers.
Note that taxes are not included in the listed price for Items, but will be displayed before confirmation of purchase.
Sellers registered for GST/HST and/or QST in Canada must designate Poshmark as your billing agent. Use of credits may modify taxes that apply to a Buyerâs order.
Taxes may be estimated based on offers made on Items, but are subject to change if final sale price is different than original offer.
Taxes are based on several factors, including price, location, and state, local, federal, or other applicable rates at time of purchase.
Although we may assess taxes upon purchase or sale You are ultimately responsible for the verification and reporting of any and all applicable taxes to the appropriate tax authorities, including instances where Poshmark does not collect taxes on your behalf.

Payments. Buyers may pay for Items using payment methods approved by Poshmark, and Poshmark will receive payment from Buyer on behalf of Seller.
By submitting payment information to Poshmark You authorize Poshmark to store that information and with your confirmation, charge You for any Items purchased.

Fee Modifications.
