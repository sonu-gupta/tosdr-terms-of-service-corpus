Arbitration Agreement, Class Action Waiver and Mediation.


Purpose. This Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver (âArbitration Agreementâ) facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any disputes that may arise between you and BigCommerce.
For the purpose of this Arbitration Agreement, âBigCommerceâ means BigCommerce, Inc., a Texas corporation, and each of its parents, subsidiaries, and affiliated companies, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents.
This Arbitration Agreement applies to these Terms and any other agreement you may have with BigCommerce.

 Arbitration is a form of private dispute resolution in which parties to a contract agree to submit their disputes and potential disputes to a neutral third person (called an arbitrator) for a binding decision, instead of having such dispute(s) decided in a lawsuit, in court, by a judge or jury trial.
You have the right to opt-out of this Arbitration Agreement (as explained below), which means you would retain your right to litigate your disputes in a court, either before a judge or jury.

 Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully.
It provides that all disputes between you and BigCommerce will be resolved by binding arbitration.
Arbitration replaces the right to go to court.
In the absence of this Arbitration Agreement, you may otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions).
Entering into this Arbitration Agreement constitutes a waiver of your right to litigate claims in court and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury.
There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.
The arbitrator must follow this Arbitration Agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorneyâs fees, if otherwise authorized by applicable law).

 The term âDisputeâ means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and BigCommerce regarding any aspect of your relationship with BigCommerce, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, negligence, gross negligence or reckless behavior), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Arbitration Agreement (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below).
âDisputeâ is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced.


WE EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.


Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution. For all Disputes you must first give BigCommerce an opportunity to resolve the Dispute.
You must commence this process by mailing written notification to:

Legal Department BigCommerce, Inc. 11305 Four Points Drive Building II, Third Floor Austin, TX 78726

 That written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) a written description of the Dispute, and (4) a description of the specific relief you seek.
If BigCommerce does not resolve the Dispute to your satisfaction within 45 days after it receives your written notification, you may pursue your Dispute in arbitration.

Arbitration Procedures. If this Arbitration Agreement applies and the Dispute is not resolved as provided above (âPre-Arbitration Claim Resolutionâ) either you or BigCommerce may initiate arbitration proceedings.
The American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ), www.adr.org, or JAMS, www.jamsadr.com, will arbitrate all Disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator.
The arbitration will be commenced as an individual arbitration, and will in no event be commenced as a representative or class arbitration.
All issues will be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this Arbitration Agreement.

 For arbitration before the AAA, the AAAâs Commercial Arbitration Rules and the AAAâs Optional Rules For Emergency Measures Of Protection will apply.
The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
For arbitration before JAMS, the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp.
Procedures and the JAMS Recommended Arbitration Discovery Protocols For Domestic, Commercial Cases will apply.
The JAMS rules are available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling 1-800-352-5267.
This Arbitration Agreement governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules.
Under no circumstances will class action, representative action, or collective action procedures or rules apply to the arbitration.

 Because your contract with BigCommerce, these Terms, and this Arbitration Agreement concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (âFAAâ), if applicable, governs the arbitrability of all Disputes.
However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.

Exclusions from Arbitration/Right to Opt Out. Notwithstanding the above, you or BigCommerce may choose to pursue a Dispute in court and not by arbitration if (a) the Dispute qualifies, it may be initiated in small claims court or equivalent in the applicable jurisdiction.
or (b) YOU OPT-OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THIS AGREEMENT (the âOpt-Out Deadlineâ).
You may opt out of this Provision by mailing written notification to

Legal Department BigCommerce, Inc. 11305 Four Points Drive Building II, Third Floor Austin, TX 78726

 Your written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, and (3) a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with BigCommerce through arbitration.
Your decision to opt-out of this Arbitration Provision will have no adverse effect on your relationship with BigCommerce.
Any opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and you must pursue your Dispute in arbitration or small claims court.

Arbitration Award. The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding.
The arbitratorâs award will be in writing, will be signed by the arbitrator, and will include a determination of all the questions submitted to the arbitrator the decision of which is necessary in order to determine the controversy.
Such award by the arbitrator will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by law, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.

Location of Arbitration. You may initiate arbitration in the federal judicial district that includes your address that you provide in your written notification of Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution.
In the event that BigCommerce initiates an arbitration, it may only do so in the federal judicial district that includes your address that you provide in your written notification of Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution or the billing address for your account.

Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs. BigCommerce will pay all arbitration filing fees and arbitratorâs costs and expenses upon your written request given prior to the commencement of the arbitration.
You are responsible for all additional fees and costs that you incur in the arbitration, including, but not limited to, attorneys or expert witnesses.
Fees and costs may be awarded by the arbitrator as provided pursuant to applicable law.
In addition to any rights to recover fees and costs under applicable law, if you provide notice and negotiate in good faith with BigCommerce as provided in the âPre-Arbitration Dispute Resolutionâ Section and the arbitrator concludes that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover from BigCommerce your actual and reasonable attorneyâs fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator.

Class Action Waiver. The parties agree that the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one personâs claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, representative action, consolidated action or private attorney general action) unless both you and BigCommerce specifically agree in writing to do so following initiation of the arbitration.
Neither you, nor any other user of the Services, can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, representative, consolidated or private attorney general proceeding without having complied with the opt-out requirements above.

Limitation of Procedural Rights. You understand and agree that, by entering into this Arbitration Agreement, you and BigCommerce are each agreeing to arbitration instead of the right to a trial before a judge or jury in a public court.
In the absence of this Arbitration Agreement, you and BigCommerce might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring Disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions).
You give up those rights, to the extent permitted by applicable law.
Other rights that you would have if you went to court, such as the right to appeal and to certain types of discovery, may be more limited in arbitration.
The right to appellate review of an arbitratorâs decision is much more limited than in court, and in general an arbitratorâs decision may not be appealed for errors of fact or law.

Severability. If any clause within this Arbitration Agreement (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Arbitration Agreement, and the remainder of this Arbitration Agreement will be given full force and effect.
If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then this entire Arbitration Agreement will be unenforceable, and the Dispute will be decided by a court.

Continuation. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your contract with BigCommerce and your use of the Services.






Anti-Corruption, Export and Sanctions Compliance.With respect to these Terms, you represent, warrant, and covenant that you:
 have not and will not violate, or cause any party to be in violation of, any applicable anti-bribery or anti-corruption law (including, but not limited to, the U.S.

201, the U.S.
Travel Act, or the UK Bribery Act 2010), anti-kickback laws, anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing laws, sanctions, embargoes, export controls, import controls, anti-fraud laws, or any other applicable law, regulation, or order (collectively, âApplicable ABAC Lawsâ);

government, the European Union, Interpol, the United Nations, the World Bank, or any other public international organization (each such list, a âSanctions Listâ).
(c) an entity that is 50% or more owned, individually or in the aggregate, directly or indirectly, by, is controlled by (including without limitation by virtue of such person being a director or owning voting shares or interests), or acts, directly or indirectly, for or on behalf of, any person or entity on a Sanctions List.

 A violation of the foregoing representations, warranties, or covenants will constitute a material breach of these Terms, and, in the event of such a violation, BigCommerce may, at its sole option, terminate these Terms for cause and without further liability or obligation on the part of BigCommerce.
Any such breach will entitle BigCommerce to seek to be indemnified by you and/or obtain injunctive and other emergency or equitable relief, in addition to any other remedies which may be available under applicable laws.






CGA Terms.

Your continued use of the Website or Services following notice of the Changes (or posting of the Terms incorporating the Changes in the event your email address is no longer valid, is blocked, or is otherwise not able to receive the notice) will mean that you accept and agree to the Changes.

or (iv) independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information.


Requests for Confidential Information. A Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information pursuant to a valid court order or order of an authorized government agency, provided that (if not legally prohibited) the Receiving Party has given the Disclosing Party prompt notice so that the Disclosing Party will have an opportunity to defend, limit or protect against such disclosure and the Receiving Party limits such disclosure to only that Confidential Information subject to the applicable order.


Survival. The terms of this Section will survive for as long as the Confidential Information remains confidential.

Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their respective successors and permitted assigns.
