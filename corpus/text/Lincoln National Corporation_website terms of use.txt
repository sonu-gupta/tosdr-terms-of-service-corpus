Cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements Certain statements on this website and certain oral statements made on LFG's behalf may contain information that includes or is a "forward-looking statement" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ("PSLRA").
A forward-looking statement is a statement that does not strictly relate to a historical fact.
A forward-looking statement includes any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate or imply future results, performance or achievements, and may contain words like: "believe", "anticipate", "expect", "estimate", "project", "will", "shall" and other words or phrases with similar meaning.
LFG claims the protection afforded by the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by the PSLRA.

Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the results contained in the forward-looking statements.
These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, legislative and regulatory changes and legal and regulatory proceedings, including changes to statutory reserves and/or risk-based capital requirements.
prolonged low interest rates or a sudden change in interest rates.
sudden or prolonged declines in the equity markets.
deviation in actual experience regarding future persistency, mortality, morbidity, interest rates or equity market returns from Lincoln's assumptions used in pricing its products and in establishing related insurance reserves.
elevated impairments on investments and intangible assets.
ratings downgrades.
and deterioration in general economic or business conditions.
These risks and uncertainties, as well as others, are described in our Forms 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Moreover, we operate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment.
New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors.
Further, it is not possible to assess the impact of all risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.
Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undo reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Stock price information on this website We do not generate the information regarding Lincoln National Corporation stock prices for this website.
