In these Terms, "we", "us", "our" and "KAYAK" refers to KAYAK Software Corporation, and "you" and "your" refers to you, the user of Our Website.

THESE TERMS INCLUDE AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND A WAIVER OF YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE LAWSUIT.
We may modify these Terms for any reasonâat any timeâby posting a new version on Our Website.

Your continued use of Our Website following the posting of modified Terms will be subject to the Terms in effect at the time of your use.

We Do Not Sell Travel Products Our Website is a travel search engine.
KAYAK does not provide, own or control any of the travel services and products that you can access through Our Website, such as flights, accommodations, rental cars, packages, or travel insurance (the âTravel Productsâ).
The Travel Products are owned, controlled or made available by third parties (the âTravel Providersâ) either directly (e.g., airline) or as an agent (e.g., online travel agency).
The Travel Providers are responsible for the Travel Products.
The Travel Providerâs terms and privacy policies apply to your booking so you must agree to and understand those terms.
Furthermore, the terms of the actual travel provider (airline, hotel, tour operator, etc.) apply to your travel, so you must also agree to and understand those terms.
Your interaction with any Travel Provider accessed through Our Website is at your own risk.
KAYAK does not bear any responsibility should anything go wrong with your booking or during your travel.
The display on Our Website of a Travel Product or Travel Provider does notâin any wayâimply, suggest, or constitute a recommendation by KAYAK of that Travel Product or Travel Provider, or any sponsorship or approval of KAYAK by such Travel Provider, or any affiliation between such Travel Provider and KAYAK.

KAYAK hosts content, including prices, made available by or obtained from Travel Providers.
KAYAK is in no way responsible for the accuracy, timeliness or completeness of such content.
Since KAYAK has no control over the Travel Products and does not verify the content uploaded by the Travel Providers, it is not possible for us to guarantee the prices displayed on Our Website.
Prices change constantly and additional charges (e.g., payment fees, services charges, checked-in luggage fees, local taxes and fees) may apply, so you should always check whether the price asked for a booking is the one you expected.
More details here.
Some Travel Products may also be sold in another currency than the one preset or chosen by you for the display of the search results.
Our currency conversion is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon as accurate or real-time.
actual rates may vary, and your payment provider (e.g., your credit card company) may charge conversion fees and apply another dateâs currency rate.
 2.
Booking through KAYAK If you make a booking through Our Website for Travel Products, that booking is made with the Travel Provider named on the booking page and Our Website only acts as a user interface.
Accordingly, KAYAK has no responsibility for the booking or the Travel Product because KAYAK has no involvement in creating the description of the Travel Product, in defining the price and any fees, or in providing the Travel Products that you book.
If you have any issues or disputes with your booking and/or the Travel Product, you agree to address and resolve these with the Travel Provider and not with us. 3.

CLAIMS INCLUDE CLAIMS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING INTENTIONAL TORT), FRAUD, AGENCY, YOUR OR THE COMPANYâS NEGLIGENCE, STATUTORY OR REGULATORY PROVISIONS, OR ANY OTHER SOURCE OF LAW.

The Notice to Company must be sent to legal@kayak.com.
The Notice shall describe the nature and basis of the claim or disputes and the specific relief sought.
If you and the Company cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may commence arbitration.

Similarly, an arbitration award and any judgment confirming it apply only to that specific case.
it cannot be used in any other case except to enforce the award itself.
To reduce the time and expense of the arbitration, the arbitrator will not provide a statement of reasons for his or her award unless requested to do so by all parties.
TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU WILL NOT AGREE TO ACT AS A REPRESENTATIVE OR A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR IN ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, OR PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS OF CLAIMANTS IN ANY LAWSUIT AGAINST COMPANY IN ANY COURT, OR IN ARBITRATION, WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIMS.
