Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes and Choice of Law.

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY â IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS.
IT CONTAINS PROCEDURES FOR MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER. 

Binding Arbitration
.

The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement arising out of or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement directly through good-faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party initiating arbitration.
 If you and Cinnamon are unable to resolve a dispute through informal negotiations, You and Cinnamon agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms through final and binding arbitration, except to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate Cinnamonâs intellectual property rights (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights), or except those disputes expressly excluded below.
Under such circumstances Cinnamon may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Cinnamon Service, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) or to address other exigent circumstances without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described herein.
Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. 

Arbitration Rules.
The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute resolution provision.
Arbitration shall be initiated through JAMS.
Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be referred to and finally determined by arbitration in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures in front of one arbitrator.
If there is a conflict between JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in these Terms, the rules set forth in this Terms will govern.
The JAMS Rules and instructions for how to initiate an arbitration are available from JAMS at https://jamsadr.com or 1-800-352-5267.
The determination of whether a dispute is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather than an arbitrator.
Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the JAMS Rules.
Each party will bear their own costs of arbitration unless the arbitrator directs that bearing such costs would be an undue burden and, in that case, we will pay for your portion of the arbitration administrative costs (but not your attorneysâ fees) less than seventy-five thousand ($75,000) dollars.
The arbitration may be conducted in person in the United States in San Francisco, California, by provisions through the submission of documents, by phone or online.
The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Cinnamon, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.
The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim.
The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the Arbitration Rules, and the Agreement.
The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.
The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.
The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Cinnamon.
Unless otherwise required by law, you and Cinnamon will each pay your own attorneysâ fees.
Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you and the Company may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

Waiver of Class Actions

YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PURSUE AN ACTION ON A CLASS-WIDE BASIS AGAINST US.
ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES BROUGHT BY USER WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS.
CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER USER.
CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTIONS, AND CONSOLIDATION WITH OTHER ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT ALLOWED.
If, however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor Company is entitled to arbitration.
instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in this Agreement.

Waiver of Jury Trial. 

THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration.
Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court.
In the event any litigation should arise between you and Cinnamon in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND CINNAMON WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY IN DECIDING TO ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, AND HAVE EITHER DONE SO OR KNOWINGLY ELECTED NOT TO DO SO.

Parties, Legal Notices, Governing Law and Jurisdiction 

All claims arising out of or relating to these terms or the Service will be governed by California law, except Californiaâs conflict of laws rules, and will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of San Francisco, California, USA.
You and Cinnamon consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.
