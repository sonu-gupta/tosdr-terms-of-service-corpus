How We Use Personal Data We Collect
The personal data we collect may come directly from you or we may obtain it from other sources, such as our service providers and resellers.
We want you to understand the types of personal data we process and if we do not obtain your personal data directly from you, the source we used, and the specific data collected.
We collect personal data for these reasons: to process the purchase of a product or service.
to provision the product or service to you.
and for the legitimate interests of us.
We use no more than the minimum amount of personal data needed for the processing.
We also use personal data only when the processing is necessary for our or our third partyâs legitimate interests.
When our use of your personal data is based on the legitimate interests of us and is compatible with the provision of service, you have the right to object.
In some cases, you may exercise your right to object directly, for example you may unsubscribe to email marketing messages or you may choose to turn off data use in the applicable product settings.
in other cases you may notify us here: support@ccleaner.com and we will investigate the grounds relating to your particular situation.
Avast is a global business and we have operations and personnel around the world who process personal data.
We have standard contractual clauses in place among its affiliates which govern the transfer and use of personal data.
In the following sections, we explain the personal data we collect.
Please be mindful that some of the categories may collect the same personal data. B.
Choice You can make certain choices about how your data is used by us.
For example, if you have purchased a product or service from us, you will be able to choose how data collected from you is used.
This choice is made in the relevant product settings.
Please note, if you purchased a product from us and in your product settings you do not see one or more of these choices, it means your collected data is not being used in that particular category.
The choices are:


Cross-product direct marketing: â when we offer you another product from a company within our group.
Cross-product development â when we collect data from one product and use it for the development of another product.
Third Party Ads â when we offer any third-party products.
Third party analytics â when we share your data with a third party for analytics, such as purchase optimization, crash reporting, and trend analytics.
Note, all free users and paid customers can choose to turn off this feature.



 C.
Billing Data Paid Products and Services for your personal computer
When you purchase "premium" or pay for products or services for your personal computer, the billing is handled by a third-party service provider.
The service provider is acting as our agent.
thus, you will be making your purchase from the service provider directly, and not from us.
If you purchase a "premium" or paid product or service, we, through our third-party service providers, will collect your name, email address, credit card number, and in certain circumstances, your billing address and your phone number (collectively âBilling Dataâ).
Your Billing Data will be retained for as long as is necessary to complete payment, including any renewal periods.

Your Billing Data is collected by our third-party service providers only where necessary for the purposes of processing or refunding your payments, or so that they can communicate with you.
Your Billing Data may also be retained for legal reasons, for example, taxation.
The third-party service provider may transmit your Billing Data (excluding credit card number) to us.
We use the Billing Data to create a record of its software installations or service requests.
We may process and store the Billing Data we receive, to verify your registration or license status, to contact you about the status of your account, or for renewal of your subscription, if applicable.
We process the Billing Data as necessary for the provision of the contract and service.

In all cases where your credit card number is processed by a third-party service provider, we have determined that the service provider follows data privacy and security procedures that we deem adequate.
Some of these third-party service providers are subject to the enhanced data privacy rules of the European Union.
Others have self-certified annually to comply with the EU-US Privacy Shield or the Swiss-US Privacy Shield.

In all cases such third-party service providers have executed agreements with us promising not to use your personal data for their own marketing purposes, and not to share this information with other parties for their unrestricted use.
We store your Billing Data separately from your Service Data (defined below).
We may change service providers as we carry out our business.
In that case, your Billing Data will be transferred from one service provider to another.
When this happens, you will be informed of such transfer.
Paid Products and Services for your mobile device
When you purchase "premium" or pay for products or services for your mobile device, the billing is handled by a third-party app store, such as Google Play and Apple iTunes.
You will be making your purchase from the third party app store directly, and not from us.
Your Billing Data is collected by the third party app store and your Billing Data is not shared with us.
Paid Products and Services for your business
When you purchase "premium" or pay for products or services for your business, the billing is handled by our reseller or distributor.
You will be making your purchase from the reseller or distributor directly, and not from us.
Your Billing Data is collected by the reseller or distributor.
Your Billing Data, excluding your credit card number, may be shared with us.
We use the Billing Data to create a record of the software installations.
We may process and store the Billing Data we receive, to verify your registration or license status.
But, generally, we will not contact you.
Your reseller or distributor will contact you about the status of your account, or for renewal of your subscription.
We process the Billing Data as necessary for the provision of the contract and service.
The handling of your Billing Data (excluding your credit card number) shared with us by the service provider, reseller, or distributor will be governed by this Privacy Policy and the End User License Agreement applicable to the product or service from us.
Your Billing Data inclusive of your credit card number collected by the service provider, reseller, distributor, or third party app store to process your payment and renewal will be governed by any privacy policy or terms of service published by the applicable third-party service provider, reseller, distributor, or the third party app store.
In some instances, we change resellers or distributors as we carry out our business.
In that case, your Billing Data will be transferred from one reseller or distributor to another.
When this happens, you will be informed of such transfer.
What about Free Products?
You are not required to disclose Billing Data to download our free products and services for your PC and mobile device, which includes free AntiVirus, free mobile security, and free CCLeaner for desktop.
However, our free CCLeaner cloud product does require you provide your name and email address to register for the product.
 D.
Support We directly or through our third party technical support service provider(s) collect your name, email address, phone number(s), home or work address, or other information by which we may identify you while providing technical support.
We need this data for verification and to communicate with you about your support request.
In cases where you request individual support or assistance we may ask you to provide information about your device or computer, your means of accessing the Internet, or information about your internet service provider.
To provide the technical support we also collect data that may include your email address, IP Address, information about your hardware and software, the URLs of sites you have visited, files stored on your computer (including potentially dangerous or infected files), email messages (whether stored on your computer or elsewhere), information regarding senders and receivers of email messages, and the like.
If you request support, we may offer you the option of accepting a remote session in which we take control of your device or computer in order to help you resolve the issue.

Information collected while providing the support will not be used for secondary purposes, other than, we may use your email address to send you information about other us products or services.
If you contact us for support, we may suggest that you upgrade or update products or services.
Information and data connected to provision of support will be retained by us to have a history of support requests and for support research purposes. E.
Marketing When we collect your email address, we may market our other products and services to you.
You may choose to unsubscribe from future email marketing by following the instructions in the email.
Generally, we do not serve third party ads in its products for the personal computer.
We may serve third party ads in our products for mobile devices.

To be able to offer you our services for free, we show third party ads within your mobile apps through popular ad networks, which are listed below.
We display an AdChoices logo on top of every ad.
You can tap the icon to learn more about the ad network.
To enable the ad, we embed a third-party software development kit (SDK) for these ads.
The SDK code is provided by third party ad agencies or networks.
Data of our mobile users remain anonymous to us and to the third party ad agencies.
However, the ad agenciesâ SDK code will collect data to tailor ads to you, such as the third-party apps you installed on your device, your Android advertising identifier, your IP Address, your device's operating system details and MAC address, and other statistical and technical information.
You can find more information in each networkâs privacy policy, the link to which we are also including in the overview below.  Ad Network

 F.
Online Identifiers GUID
The GUID is a randomly generated number that we assign to each installation of software.
For paid customers of products and services for your personal computer, the GUID is connected to your Billing Data.
For free users of products and services for your personal computer and your mobile deice, and for paid customers of business and mobile products and services, as there is no Billing Data collected by us, the us GUID is disconnected from personal data.
The GUID is used for many purposes, which will be described in this Privacy Policy.

Please note that not all of our websites use all of these cookies.

We may partner with a third party either to display advertising on our site or to manage our advertising on this site and other sites.
Our third party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests.
By continuing to browse our websites, you are aware of the use of cookies, as described in this Privacy Policy.
If you do not wish to allow the use of cookies, you can disable them through your browser settings.
We do note, however, that not all browsers across all platforms may support this functionality.
Furthermore, if you disable cookies, our websites may not function properly or your access to our websites and their features may be affected or restricted.
IP Address
We collect your IP Address to provision your product or service.
We also use the IP Address with mobile products to serve ads.
We strive to replace your IP Address within sixty days of collecting it with your city and country or we hash your IP Address. G.
In-Product Messaging We sometimes communicate with you using a technique known as "in-product messaging." In-product messaging may be used in the following scenarios:


when your license is about to expire;
when you update or upgrade an us program.

when a virus database is updated.

when you visit an infected webpage.

when a monthly security report is prepared for you.
or 
in other cases where user communication is necessary for provision of our products or services.




We also use in-product messaging to notify you of different products or upgrades to existing products and services.
Data used for in-product messaging is connected to the GUID for in-product messaging to function.
For free users, this data remains anonymous and for paid customers, the data is pseudonymized.
Billing Data is however not used for in-product messaging.
In-product messaging also permits your computer or device to transmit information to our servers including technical data, virus definitions, security, and technical information about your hardware.

The data may be used to offer you a discount on a new product based on your past purchases.
Data is also used for analytical and statistical purposes, product updates, quality control, and in-product and feature design.
Premium or paid customers can manage In-product messaging for marketing purposes in the applicable product settings.
 H.
Service Data
Service Data is collected from your use of our websites, products, and services.
Service Data is used primarily to provision the products or services.
Service Data is also used for the compatible and legitimate uses of research, to compile statistics, analytics, aggregated reporting, product development, In-product messaging, and direct marketing.
Before Service Data is used for secondary purposes, us pseudonymizes or anonymizes the Service Data.

For all Service Data, we practice âdata minimizationâ, which means we limit our collection and retention of your data to only what is necessary, adequate and relevant to achieve our processing purpose.

Below we list our products and the Service Data that each collects.
There may be other products (current or future) that require us to collect certain types of personal data to enable full product functionality.
We will always inform you prior to collecting any such information, usually in the terms of service or end user license agreement (EULA) or the privacy notice applicable to the product or service.
Personal data collected as part of Service Data is necessary to the provision of the product functionality.
When personal data is no longer needed we limit or stop using it in line with the minimization principle.
For example, your email, the URLs of websites you have visited, your files, are scanned for malware detection and protection.
then we remove your email address and other personal data or we hash any identifiers turning the Service Data into pseudonymized or anonymized data for paid users and anonymized data for free users before we re-use the Service Data for research, analytics, statistics, reporting, cross-product development, in-product messaging, and marketing.
The primary processing of Service Data will be to perform the contract to provision the product or service to you.
The secondary processing of Service Data will be as compatible for the legitimate interests of us to provide you the benefits of research, analytics, cross-product development, and cross-product in-product messaging.
If we need to process your Service Data for a purpose that requires consent, we will notify you separately of this and the general rules of providing and withdrawing consent shall apply.

Website Log Files
We collect the information in the form of server log files that tell us generally about the visitors to our site, which may include general geographic regions, length of visits, the webpages you request, the URLs of the site you were viewing before clicking on our websites, your IP Address, cookies, the type of web browser and operating system you are using, click-stream data and so forth.
If a user downloads a product from our website, we connect the installation GUID with the userâs website log.
We use this information to fulfil our legitimate interests, which are to analyse overall trends, administer our webpages, track usersâ use of the webpages, help us improve our website(s), and to better understand the usersâ experience on our website(s) when downloading and activating our products.
Device and Network Information
We may collect information about the computer or device you are using, our products and services running on it, and, depending on the type of device it is, what operating systems you are using, device settings, application identifiers (AI), hardware identifiers or universally unique identifiers (UUID), software identifiers, IP Address, location data, cookie IDs, and crash data (through the use of either our own analytical tools or tolls provided by third parties, such as Crashlytics or Firebase).
Device and network data is connected to the installation GUID.
We also use your device and network data for in-product-messaging and cross-product development.
Premium or paid customers can manage in-product messaging for marketing purposes and cross-product development in the applicable product settings.
We collect information in the form of statistics through our own or third-party analytics about which apps have been installed or uninstalled, how they are used, the number of active users, and the impact apps have on device performance and battery consumption (collectively, âAppInfoâ).
From this we study device and network behaviour, purchasing history and trends to measure the relative success of our products over time (in other words, serve our legitimate interests).
Analytics and Crash Reporting
We use analytical tools, including third party analytical tools, which allow us to, among other things, identify potential performance or security issues with our products, improve their stability and function, understand how you use our products, and websites, so that we can optimize and improve your user experience, as well as evaluate and improve our campaigns.
While we generally prefer using our own analytical tools, we sometimes need to partner with other parties, which have developed and provide us with their own tools and expertise.
Below, we list these partners, their tools which we use, as well as additional information on where and how we use them.

Google
Our apps use Google Analytics to allow us to understand how our users use and interact with our products and how to improve our products.
Where our apps use Google Analytics for Apps or the Google Analytics for Firebase SDKs, Google Analytics collects an app-instance identifier â a randomly generated number that identifies a unique installation of an app.
Whenever a user resets their Advertising Identifier (Advertising ID on Android, and ID for Advertisers on iOS), the app-instance identifier is also reset.
Where our apps have implemented Google Analytics with other Google Advertising products, like AdWords, additional advertising identifiers may be collected.
Google Analytics also collects Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to provide and protect the security of the service, and to give us a sense of which country, state, or city in the world our users come from (also known as "IP geolocation").
We do implement measures and best practices in order to avoid sending personal data when collecting Analytics Data such as: Safeguarding our data, IP Anonymization, IP masking, data retention, user deletion and access management.

Firebase Analytics is a service that helps us understand our users and how they use apps including information about interactions with the user's mobile applications.
Firebase Analytics uses identifiers for advertising on mobile applications (for example, Android Advertising ID and Identifier for Advertisers for iOS - IDFA), and we will collect the AAID and IDFA for these above-mentioned purposes.
Users who wish to opt-out of the AAID and IDFA advertisement tracking can do so through device advertising settings for mobile apps within your device and users who wish to avoid tracking by Firebase Analytics can opt-out in application settings.
Data collected will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers globally.

Logentries is a cloud-based repository where we send multiple logs from our desktop apps to logentries such as activations and installer logs and update check pings.
This allows us to search the logs and run queries on the data for the purposes of tracking errors, fixing bugs and resolving technical issues, as well as compiling generic statistics on, e.g., user, install or activation count and understanding how you use our products.
We also log parameters from a device to check if they are eligible for certain installer offers, such as Chrome or Avast.
This tool uses unique identifiers of the installation and device.
These unique identifiers contain IP addresses, but we hash this data and do not keep it in its original form as soon as possible (usually within 30 days) when data gets stored.

CCleaner Cloud
SolarWinds (Loggly)
Loggly is a cloud-based repository where we send errors logs from CCleaner Cloud so that we can search, filter and query the data and receive alerts.
 Loggly is used to display error messages from our log files.
We gather error messages from each agent log file and send them to Loggly, which analyzes it.
 
We use this tool to find common errors in our applications, identify new errors which may occur, determine our business performance and identify geographical areas in which we can improve.
Each entry in Loggly has a computer ID, but it does not contain any information which can personally identify you.

Avast Android CleanUp, AVG Cleaner, AVG Cleaner for Xperia, and CCleaner for Android (Piriform)
Avast Android CleanUp, AVG Cleaner, AVG Cleaner for Xperia, and CCleaner for Android (Piriform) access your device storage to delete data that is not in use.
You will be asked to allow your Android operating system to access your device storage.
The feature sees whatâs in your device, for example the apps and files you have downloaded, ranging from your music playlist to photos.
However, everything takes place locally on your device and nothing is transmitted to our servers.

Since we do not collect or store any personal data, any data collected is anonymous.
We also offer you a Cloud service connection for you to back up your files so nothing important gets deleted.
You may sign-in to Google Drive, Dropbox or Microsoft OneDrive directly from CleanUp.
This feature is optional.
If you use this feature, you will be storing your files with a third party and thus this is subject to the third partyâs terms of service and privacy policy. I.
Account Data There are a variety of accounts you can create with us.
Account data is the data you give when you open an account or request a service from us and may including your name, address, email address, phone number, photo, date of birth, gender, and interests (collectively, âAccount Dataâ).
Account Data may include the same data as in your Billing Data (such as name and email), but Account Data is not connected to your credit card number and, except in a few instances described below, is not connected to your Service Data.
We process this data in order to provide you with the relevant account. Examples of Accounts and Services Avast and AVG Accounts
Accounts are tools which permit you to register multiple products using a single registration and authentication system.
If you use these Accounts, you will be asked to provide your email address directly or indirectly via social media login.
This is used for authentication.
Opening an account is voluntary.
For paid and trial customers, there is the convenience of managing your licenses and seeing your connected devices in the account portal.
Once you delete your account, your Account Data will be deleted, but this will not delete other records of your name or your email address stored at us.

Some products may require you to establish an Avast Account for the provision of the service or to provide the product functionality.

"Refer A Friend"
There may be times when we post a "refer a friend" link that allows a site visitor to send a message to a friend about an Avast product or service.
We will never request that our users provide a friend's phone number or other contact information.
We do not have any record of the email address that you use to send the message.
It is up to the friend to install.
Sometimes the friend referral takes place when you install a product.
When the friend installs, we collect the GUIDs and information that your two installations are connected.
This concludes the description of personal data collected by us when you purchase products and services or when you register for an account or request services.

Live Events and Competitions Aside from interacting with you by way of your use or purchase of our products and services, us may collect your personal data from you directly, when we attend trade shows or when you participate in our promotional events or competitions.
When you interact with us at trade shows and provide us with your personal data on a business card or through other means (for instance, through registering for an event we are holding at such trade show), we will be processing your personal data for the purposes of building and expanding our database of existing or prospective business partners.
We will use this contact information in order to communicate with you about possible business partnerships or other similar opportunities, and to promote our brand across the industry (serve our legitimate interests).
Live events and competitions held and organized by us generally require that you register first.
To complete a registration, you provide us with your name, your e-mail address and other relevant information, which is marked as âRequiredâ (this could, for instance, include information about your technical background, if you are registering for one of our competitions).
We may also take photos or videos of the competition.

Provision of live event(s) and competition(s) data is voluntary.
However, if you do not provide us with the information marked in the form as âRequiredâ, you will not be able to participate.

Avast will process the âRequiredâ as well as other voluntary information in order to assess your application, register you for the event and to communicate with you about it.
We may use your image in photos or videos on our website or as part of our general promotion and marketing efforts.
We will also use your email address to communicate with you about new us events and about other products and services from us.
Some of our competitions are carried out through social media or networks.
In that case, the privacy policy of that particular social network will apply.
