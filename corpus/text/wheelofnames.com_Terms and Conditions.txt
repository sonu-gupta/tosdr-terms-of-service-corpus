 Why do I see ads on wheelofnames.com?  We show ads on wheelofnames.com to keep the site running and pay for hosting, testing tools, analytics, among other things.
 Can I pay or donate to get rid of the ads?  We do not take any form of payments or donations from users.
This includes paying to remove ads.
Instead, we allow you to remove ads for the duration of your session with the Close ad button, or enter fullscreen mode where they do not appear.
 Can I use an adblocker on wheelofnames.com?  Feel free to use an adblocker on the site.
However, we have received reports that adblockers occassionally interfere with saving and opening wheels.
If you encounter these issues whilst using an adblocker, try disabling it temporarily.
 Can I change how long the wheel spins?  Yes.
Click 
 Customize and a dialog box will come up where you can set the spin time.
 Can I change the text in the winner pop-up window to something else?  Yes.
Click 
 Customize and a dialog box will come up where you can set what the message in this pop-up will be.
 Can I change the size of the text?  Sorry, the app does not support this.
Instead, the text is rendered as large as possible while still fitting inside the wheel.
In other words, the shorter your entries are, the larger the text will be.
 How can I display more than one wheel running at the same time?  Create two browser windows side-by-side and point them both to wheelofnames.com.
 I made a lot of settings changes, how do I save all of them for next time?  Your settings (like colors and sounds) are saved on your device.
When you reopen the web page on the same device, the settings you last used are loaded again.

 To make sure you don't lose your settings, or to use them on another device, click 
 Save and give your wheel a name.
 When I remove a winning name from the wheel, does it get removed from my saved wheel as well?  No, it doesnât.
For example, letâs say you save a wheel of dishes as âComfort foodâ: Pasta, Hamburger, Noodles.
You open âComfort foodâ, spin and Pasta comes up the winner.
If you click âRemove winnerâ, Pasta will disappear from the wheel.
But if you click 
 Open to open âComfort foodâ again, the wheel will reappear with all dishes, including Pasta.
 Can I advertise on Wheel of Names?  Please submit the Feedback form and we can talk.
 Can you customize the app for my organization?  No, but I would be interested in hearing what customization youâd like.
Please submit the Feedback form.
If enough people request something, I will build it for all users and everyone wins.
 Is the website for sale?  No, I run it as a hobby project.
I don't want to lose my hobby :-)  Is it open-source?  Yes it is! Check it out here.

 You can follow the detailed instructions in the README file to set up a Google Cloud Platform account and host the app yourself.
You are also free to make any modifications you want.
If you'd like to contribute your code back to the project, please read the CONTRIBUTING file.

 Are the instructions too daunting? Remember that you can always: 

Embed wheelofnames.com in your website.
Create a wheel with no textbox, toolbar, and buttons by clicking 
 Share followed by Continue, and then selecting "They should only be able to spin the wheel".

The wheel can display up to 1000 names at one time.
We added this limit, as the names become too small to read if more are displayed.
If you enter more than 1000 names in the text box, new names are randomly picked from the text box and put on the wheel as it spins.
The result is that all names in the text box have the same chance of winning, even if only 1000 are displayed on the wheel at any one time.

 Also, note that if you want to put thousands of names on the wheel, importing them from a Google Sheet (click More, then Link Google Spreadsheet) is faster than pasting them into the textbox.
But both approaches work.
 Can the wheel display non-Latin characters?  Yes, just enter the characters you want in the text box.
See here for a wheel showing the word for water in Arabic, Chinese, Hindi, Korean, Latin, Russian, Thai and Vietnamese.
 Can the wheel display symbols instead of text?  Yes, you can copy special characters like smileys from other websites and paste them into the text box.
They will then appear on the wheel.
See this wheel for an example.
Emojipedia is a great place to find characters to copy.
 Can the wheel display images instead of text?  Yes, click the 
 Add image button and you can upload an image.
If you write text next to the image in the text box, that text will appear on top of the image.

 Images with uniform background color work the best.
Each slice with an image gets the same background color as the image.
Some example wheels: 

Yes, no, maybe
Cartoon monsters
Gaming icons


 Is there a mobile app?  No, but the wheel has been optimized to run well on most mobile phones and tablets.
As a matter of fact, about half of the people who use the wheel do so from mobile phones or tablets.

Yes, insert this HTML in your web page:  <iframe src="https://wheelofnames.com/abc-123" width="100%" height="800"&gt.
</iframe&gt.
 Replace the link with the one given to you when you clicked the Share button.
You may want to experiment with the values of width and height to get a good fit.
 Can I embed the wheel in Google Sites?  Yes, by doing this: 

In the Insert panel, click Embed.
Click By URL in the window that pops up.
Enter https://wheelofnames.com (or the link to a shared wheel that you have created) in the textbox.
Click Whole page and then Insert.
Click Publish to make the page available to your users.
 Can I embed the wheel in a slide presentation?  Depends on which presentation software you are using: 

Google Slides: Not possible.
Prezi: Not possible.
Powerpoint: Potential solution.
Keynote: Potential solution.
 How can I stream the wheel in OBS?  To stream the wheel with OBS, you can either use a Window Capture or Browser source.
We recommed using Window Capture as it is easiest to set up.
just select your browser window that you have Wheel of Names open in.

 To use a browser source, you must input https://wheelofnames.com into the source field.
You must then open the context menu of the browser source (right click) and click 'Interact' to be able to close the cookie banner and advertisement, and spin the wheel.

 If you wish to key out the background of the page, you must first create the wheel in your ordinary browser, change the background color, and save or share it.
Then input the shared wheel link in the browser source or open your saved wheel.
From there, you can add a chroma key filter on the source and choose the same rgb or hex value as the page background.
 How do I use the wheel when Iâm not online?  If you have a modern browser, you will be able to enter wheelofnames.com in the address field and use the app even if you are offline.

 You do need to be online to save or share wheels, or to get users from Twitter or a Google spreadsheet.
 I want to raffle off a prize among those of my attendees who fill out my survey.
How do I do this?  Create your survey in Google Forms.
Include one question where you ask the attendee to identify themselves, for example by first name and last name initial.
Click Responses and then click the green spreadsheet icon.
This creates a new spreadsheet where all responses will be recorded.
Share the link to your form among your attendees.
Form links are long, so you may want to use a URL shortener, like bit.ly, to create a link that users can enter by hand.

 Once your attendees start submitting the form, go to wheelofnames.com and click More then 
 Link Google Spreadsheet.
After logging in you will be able to pick which of your Google spreadsheets to read data from, and which tab and column in that spreadsheet.
The wheel and the spreadsheet are now linked, and as new form submissions are made, they will appear in the wheel automatically.
If you remove a winner from the wheel, the link to the spreadsheet is broken and it won't be automatically updated if the spreadsheet changes.
 Is the wheel really random?  Yes, it is.
When you click the wheel, it accelerates for exactly one second, then it is set to a random rotation between 0 and 360 degrees, and finally it decelerates to a stop.
The setting of a random rotation is not visible to the naked eye as it happens when the wheel is spinning quite fast.

 Is the random rotation truly random? Yes, itâs quite random, within the limits of what computers can do.
The random number is created by the random number generator built into your browserâs Javascript engine.
 But I spun the wheel ten times and one entry came up more often than the others!  The wheel doesn't have memory, so past outcomes do not affect future results.
In this way it works like a coin toss.
If you toss a coin ten times, there is no guarantee that you will get exactly five heads and five tails.
As a matter of fact, there is only a 24.6% chance that you will get that outcome.

 If you spin the wheel several times, duplicate results are more common than your intuition might tell you.
If you have 10 entries on a wheel and spin it 5 times, there is a 70% chance that at least one entry will come up more than once.
 When I click 
 Shuffle is the shuffle really random?  Yes, the shuffle is random.
It uses the Durstenfeld algorithm, a computer-optimized variant of the FisherâYates shuffle.

 Because the shuffle is random, there is no guarantee that all items move.
For example, if you have 5 items in the textbox and you shuffle them, 20% of the time the first item will remain in first place.
The same would be true if you manually shuffled a deck of five cards in a truly random way.
 Can I rig the wheel?  No, but you can skew the odds by creating multiple entries with the same name.
For example, if youâd like âAppleâ to come up twice as often as âBananaâ, enter âAppleâ on two separate lines in the text box, and âBananaâ only on one.
 Can I change the names/items in my saved wheels?  Yes, edit the wheel, click 
 Save at the top of the screen and pick the name of the wheel you want to overwrite in the dropdown box that appears.
 Can I access my saved wheels from multiple devices?  Yes, you can access all of your saved wheels if you log in as the same user on the other device.
 Can I delete a previously saved wheel?  Yes, click 
 Open and then click 
 Delete for the wheel that you want to delete.
 How do I run an event where others can see me spinning the wheel live?  You have two options: 

 Record video from your screen and publish the video file on the event date and time.
Use one of the screen recording software packages listed on this page.

 If your event will run on Facebook, you can stream video from your screen to your audience.
You can read more about Facebook video streaming here.



 Can I record a video of spinning the wheel and then post it on my website/blog/social media?  You can use any screen capture software to record your screen when you spin the wheel.
You can read more about which screen recorder to pick, depending on your operating system: 

Android
Chromebook
MacOS
iOS
Windows


 Can I share a wheel that I have built?  Yes, click 
 Share and a link is created.
You can use email, social media, etc to share that link.
Anyone who uses the link will see the wheel just the way it looks to you, including names, colors, and sound settings.
 Can I turn off the sound effects?  Yes.
Click 
 Customize and a dialog box will appear where you can turn on or off the ticking sound made by the wheel, as well as the cheers sound effect played when the wheel stops.
 Can I change the sound effects or music to my own?  Sorry, the app does not support this.
You can of course play music from another app or web page while you spin the wheel.
 What are the sound effects?  Some of the sound effects were downloaded under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.
They have been recorded by: 

Tick: Notification 2_2 by Joao_Janz
Cheers: Small Crowd Applause Sound by Yannick Lemieux



 The other sound effects and music tracks have been licensed from various online music websites.
