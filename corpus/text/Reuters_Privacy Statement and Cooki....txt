 Thomson Reuters supplemental Privacy Statement for California consumers under CCPA DO NOT SELL MY PERSONAL INFORMATION Introduction
As a global company, our business proudly serves certain natural persons residing in the State of California (each, a âconsumerâ).
This Supplemental Privacy Statement for California Consumers under CCPA (âCalifornia Statementâ) explains rights that California consumers may have under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (âCCPAâ).
When we use the term âpersonal informationâ in this supplemental California Statement, we are using that term as CCPA defines it, which CCPA generally defines âpersonal informationâ to mean information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.
However, personal information does not include publicly available, deidentified, or aggregate consumer information (which are all defined in CCPA).
Notably, the definition of âpersonal informationâ also does not apply to the collection of personal information from job applicants, employees â whether you are our employee or any employee of the entity arranging access to our Services for you, business owners, directors, officers, medical staff, or contractors.
Categories of personal information we collect, the sources of that information, purposes for why we collect it, who we share it with, and whether we sell that personal information
Where we act as a âbusinessâ under CCPA (meaning we determine the manner and reasons for why we process your personal information), we may be required to disclose additional information regarding the categories of personal information we collect, the sources where we obtain that information, the purposes for why we collect that information, who we share that information with, as well as whether we sell that personal information â all of which depends on the specific Service.
Accordingly, weâve provided additional Service-specific information for subject Services on our website located at tr.com/privacy-information.
Your privacy rights
If you are a resident of California and are not a job applicant, employee/contractor, or employee/contractor of another company interacting with us in your job role, you have the right to request what information we collect, use, and disclose.
You also have the right to request that we delete your information.
To make a request, you can contact us through our Data Subject Rights Portal or at 1-866-633-7656.
Provide us enough information to verify your identify.
We will use information you provide to us to verify your request.
If we cannot initially verify your identity, we may request additional information to complete the verification process, such as, for example, a copy of your driverâs license and/or a recent utility or credit card bill.
You can designate an agent to make a request on your behalf by either: (1) having your agent send us a letter, signed by you, certifying that the agent is acting on your behalf and showing proof that they are registered with the California Secretary of State.
or (2) by you and the agent executing and sending us a notarized power of attorney stating that the agent is authorized to act on your behalf.&nbsp.
Please note that we may still require you to verify your identity before we process a request submitted by your agent.
California residents also have certain rights regarding the sale of personal information.
California residents have the right to opt out of the sale of their personal information by clicking the following link âDo Not Sell My Personal Informationâ or by clicking the button above.

We will not discriminate against you because you have exercised any of your privacy rights under the CCPA.

They are widely used to ârememberâ you and your preferences, either for a single visit (through a âsession cookieâ) or for multiple repeat visits (using a âpersistent cookieâ).
They ensure a consistent and efficient experience for visitors, and perform essential functions such as allowing users to register and remain logged in.
Cookies may be set by the site that you are visiting (known as âfirst party cookiesâ), or by third parties, such as those who serve content or provide advertising or analytics services on the website (âthird party cookiesâ).
Both websites and HTML emails may also contain other tracking technologies such as âweb beaconsâ or âpixels.â These are typically small transparent images that provide us with statistics, for similar purposes as cookies.
They are often used in conjunction with cookies, though they are not stored on your computer in the same way as cookies.
As a result, if you disable cookies, web beacons may still load, but their functionality will be restricted.

Flash cookies, also known as local shared objects, are designed to support browser content supported by AdobeÂ® Flash.
They are usually used to enable ads and video content on websites.
Like other cookies, they will store information on your device, some of which will be specific to the Flash-enabled content.

Generally, we do not currently respond to, or take any action with respect to web browser "do not track" signals or other mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personal information about an individualâs online activities over time and across third party websites or online services.
However, in some instances our third party service providers who integrate within our Services do honor Do Not Track signals.


Consent for Advertising Cookies on Our Sites


You may see a âcookie bannerâ on our websites.
If you are visiting one of our Services from the EU/EEA, then we do not set, or allow our ad partners to set, cookies that are used to show you targeted ads before you click to accept.
When you consent in this manner, we and our advertising partners may set advertising cookies on the site or other Service you are visiting and on other of our websites, dashboards, and services.
Weâll display the banner to you periodically, just in case you change your mind.

You may choose not to receive future marketing or advertising emails from us by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of each marketing or advertising email that you receive from us.
Alternatively, you may send us an opt-out request specifying your communications preferences to privacy.issues@thomsonreuters.com.

Interest-Based Advertising Notice





What is Interest-Based Advertising?

Interest-based advertising, sometimes referred to as âtargeted advertisingâ, âonline behavioral advertisingâ, and âpersonalized advertisingâ, allows us to deliver personalized and/or targeted advertising to individuals that are tailored to individual interests, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as ad delivery, reporting, attribution, analytics, and market research.
We serve interest-based advertising using information you make available to us when you interact with our Services and other sites, content, or products or services, which may be supplemented by third parties as discussed below.
We deliver interest-based advertising on Thomson Reutersâs owned and operated sites, on unaffiliated sites, and through our Services.
Like other online advertising networks, we use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to enable us to learn about what ads you are served, what ads you click, and other actions you take on our sites, on other sites, and sometimes offline (collectively, âAd Statsâ).
This allows us to provide you with more useful and relevant ads.
We allow third party companies to collect certain information when you visit our websites or use our Services.
Third party advertisers and other third parties (including ad networks, ad delivery or ad serving companies, and other service providers they may use) may also collect information about your Ad Stats, in which they may use that information to assume that users who interact with or click on a personalized ad or content are part of the group that the ad or content is directed towards.
Also, some third parties may provide us with information about you (such as the sites where you have been shown ads, your Ad Stats, and/or demographic information) from offline and online sources that we may use to provide you more relevant and useful advertising.
Advertisers or ad companies working on their behalf sometimes use technology to serve the ads that appear on our sites or Services directly to your browser.
They automatically receive your IP address and/or information from cookies when this happens.
They may also use third party cookies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize ad content.
We do not have access to or control over third party cookies or other features that advertisers and third party sites may use, and the privacy practices of these advertisers and third party websites are not covered by this Privacy Statement.
Please contact them directly for more information about their privacy practices.

How do I Opt-out of Interest-Based Advertising?

You may choose not to receive interest-based advertising.
Please note that, even if you opt-out of receiving interest-based advertising, you will still receive advertisements and marketing materials, but they will not be personalized to you specifically.
For some of our vendors that participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), you can exercise your online advertising choices for those vendors to opt-out of interest-based advertising at http://optout.aboutads.info.
 You may also opt out of receiving interest-based ads from many sites through the Network Advertising Initiative's (NAI) Opt Out Tool (http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices) and in the EU at http://www.youronlinechoices.com/.

How Do I Opt-Out of Advertising on Mobile Devices?

Mobile devices have an advertising identifier that gives companies the ability to serve targeted ads to a specific mobile device.
Depending on your specific device, you may be able to limit advertising or reset the advertising identifier within your mobile device privacy settings.
Another tool you can use to control advertising on your mobile device is the AppChoices App: http://youradchoices.com/appchoices.
You may also choose to turn off the deviceâs location tracking on your mobile device depending on your specific device.
Please note that some of the options described in the paragraphs above that you select are browser-specific or device-specific, so you may need to opt-out again if you delete cookies, use a different device, or change browsers.
