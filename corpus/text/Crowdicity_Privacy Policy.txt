Where we rely on legitimate interest as a ground for processing your personal information, we carry out a âbalancing testâ to ensure that our processing is necessary and that your fundamental rights of privacy are not outweighed by our legitimate interests, before we go ahead with such processing.
We keep a record of these balancing tests.
You have a right to the information contained in these balancing tests on request, and can find out more by contacting us using the details below.
