Information that is requested from users and/or made available to us will be used in accordance with this policy.
What kinds of information are we collecting?

When registering, you will be asked to provide a username, email address and region.
Additionally, there are other forms of information that you may choose to share with our community, such as giveaways, discussions, comments, and polls.

At times, we may collect or log data on how you are using our service, such as pages you are visiting, actions you are performing, the date you registered, and when you were last online.

How will we use this information?



To provide and personalize our service


We will display your username and avatar throughout our service, and next to content that you choose to share.
An overview of your account and activity will be used for your user profile.
The region you choose during registration will give you access to the appropriate region restricted giveaways.
Information that we collect regarding your Steam account will be used to help personalize our service.
For example, you have the option to only display giveaways corresponding to games on your Steam wishlist, or the option to view giveaways which are exclusively available to your Steam groups.
Playtime data will be used to help recommend giveaways that might be of interest to you, and other users.
We may also use your information to administrate our service, and during communications with our staff to help resolve support tickets.
If you link your Patreon account, we will use your pledge information to apply the appropriate rewards to your account.




Safety and integrity


We analyze Steam, usage, and device information to ensure the integrity and security of our service, and to prevent users from registering more than one account.
We will use your Steam information to provide appropriate restrictions when necessary.
This data helps to ensure that you do not enter to win games which you already own on Steam.
It also allows you to only enter downloadable content (DLC) giveaways when you own the appropriate base game.
If giveaways are only available to particular Steam groups, we use your Steam information to know whether or not you have access to view those giveaways.
We temporarily store server logs about user activity to help us identify abuse.




Communication


We may use your information as a means of communicating with you regarding our service, or to contact you if you choose to opt in to marketing related email notifications.
The email address you provide will be used for service notifications, to inform you when you need to send a gift, or when you have won a giveaway.
It will also be used to facilitate communication between giveaway creators and giveaway winners.




Aggregate information


At times we will aggregate non-personal information, such as demographics or usage statistics.




Analytics


User activity and device information is used to assess how our business is performing, and to provide insights into how we can improve our service.
We also use information about your activity to generate statistics for you, such as your probability of winning per day, your contributions over time, or how your Steam account compares to other users.




Advertising


Usage and device information is used to help show personalized advertising, or relevant sponsored content.



How is this information shared?



Account information


We will share your username and avatar publicly to identify you within our community.
An overview of your account which includes the date you registered, when you were last online, and a summary of your activity will also be publicly available.

Information you provide


If you choose to share giveaways, discussions, comments, or polls with our community, they will be publicly available.
Possible restrictions may be applied, such as limiting a giveaway to a particular Steam group.
If you attach keys to your giveaways, those keys will be shared with the winners of your giveaways.




Administration


Our staff will be able to access your information to help administrate our service, identify abuse, or resolve support tickets.
