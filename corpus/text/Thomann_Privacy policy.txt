The decisions of the organiser in all matters pertaining to this prize draw are final and binding.

General conditions

The organiser reserves the right to end the prize draw at their own discretion at any time without advance notice.
This option is of particular use to the organiser in cases where the normal execution of the prize draw cannot be guaranteed due to technical or legal reasons.
In this case, the organiser reserves the right to draw the winner of the prize from amongst the eligible participants who had participated prior to the time of termination.

The organiser also reserves the right, at their own discretion, to exclude persons from participation:
 (a) for manipulation associated with access to or execution of the prize draw; (b) for violations of these Conditions of Participation; (c) for unfair conduct; (d) for incorrect or misleading statements associated with participation in this prize draw.

Should a person attempt to compromise the legitimate operation of the prize draw, e.g.
using technical aids, this may present a violation of criminal or civil law.
Should a person attempt such a thing, the organiser reserves the right to seek damages through legal means and withdraw or demand the return of prizes.
The failure to enforce any provision in these official Conditions of Participation shall not constitute the organiserâs waiver of that provision.

Data protection

The participant agrees that the organiser shall store all data required for the execution of the prize draw for the duration of the prize draw.
In the case of a win, the organiser reserves the right to publish the given names and surnames (shortened to initials) of the winner along with their place of residence on the www.thomann.de website, in the newsletter and/or on social media channels (Facebook, Twitter, Google).
The participant may object to their data being published after being notified of the win at any time by email to marketing@thomann.de, or by post to the organiserâs address provided in this section.

The organiser has assigned services necessary for the execution and settlement of the prize draw in part to third parties (cooperation partners).
Participantsâ data shall be stored by the cooperation partner/s for the purposes of executing and settling the prize draw for the duration of the prize draw.
All data shall be deleted after the end and settlement of the prize draw.

By participating in this prize draw, the participant agrees to the use of their data by third parties for the stated purposes and, in particular, transmission of their data to third parties by the organiser.


The participants may revoke their permission for their data to be used at any time.
By revoking this permission, the participant withdraws their participation in the prize draw.
Furthermore, through the German Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz, BDSG), the participant has the guaranteed rights to information and â provided that the legal requirements for such action have been met (cf.
Â§ 35 BDSG) â correction, blocking or deletion of collected data.

The stated rights can be exercised by sending a notification via post to: 
 Thomann GmbH c/o Data Privacy Officer Hans-Thomann-StraÃe 1 96138 Burgebrach Germany

The organiser undertakes to protect the privacy of the participants and ensures that the data shall be used pursuant to the German Federal Data Protection Act, the German Telemedia Act, European Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC and EU directive 02/58/EC.
In this context, particular reference is made to the organiserâs general data protection provisions.

Liability

With the fulfilment or handover of the prize to the participant, the organiser shall be released from all obligations, insofar as the organiser, depending on the nature of the prize draw, has any legal obligation towards the participant.

Warranty claims on winnings that are provided by cooperation partners for the prize draw shall be asserted exclusively against the cooperation partners.

According to legal provisions, the organiser shall assume liability in the case of fraudulent intent, wilful intent or gross negligence.
Damages caused by the organiser as a result of ordinary negligence shall only be compensated if there is breach of a material obligation, the breach of which jeopardises the achievement of the purpose of the contract and/or the fulfilment of which is necessary for the execution and settlement of the prize draw and on the fulfilment of which the participants may regularly depend (cardinal obligation).

The organiser assumes no liability for the insolvency of a cooperation partner or the consequences this may have on the execution and settlement of the prize draw.
The decisions of the organiser in all matters pertaining to the relevant prize draw are final and binding.
The organiser reserves the right to correct printing errors or mechanical errors.

The organiser accepts no responsibility for lost, damaged, illegible, incomplete or late registrations, regardless of whether this is due to delay in delivery or incompleteness due to system errors.
Furthermore, the organiser accepts no responsibility for registration that is not received or not fully received due to circumstances of force majeure, such as traffic congestion, unauthorised intervention by third parties, malfunctions of computer and telecommunications systems or inaccurate or failed recording of incoming data transfers.
Proof of transfer is not deemed to be proof of receipt by the organiser.
The winner is personally responsible for all applicable taxes, duties and fees not specified in these Conditions of Participation.

Other

All decisions are final.
The laws of the Federal Republic of Germany are exclusively applicable to the exclusion of referral provisions under German international private law.
Should the participant also be the consumer, this only applies to the extent that they do not lose the protection of binding legal provisions of their state of usual residence.
Should individual provisions of these Conditions of Participation be or become invalid, the validity of the remaining provisions shall remain unaffected by this.

 Privacy Policy 
 Privacy Policy This Privacy Notice describes how Thomann GmbH (hereinafter also referred to as âMusikhaus Thomannâ) processes and protects according to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the relevant German data protection laws, in particular the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG), the data you provide us with when using our website.
The security of personal data such as name, address, telephone number or email, is a serious and important concern for our company.
Therefore, we conduct our online activities in compliance with the respective statutory provisions relating to data protection and data security.
Below, you can find the information we process.





Responsible authority, contact person for queries or exercising your rights as a data subject, contact

The responsible authority within the meaning of the data protection regulations for all data processing through the Musikhaus Thomann website is:

Thomann GmbH, Hans-Thomann-Strasse 1, 96138 Burgebrach, Germany

In the event of any questions, comments, complaints or to exercise your rights as a data subject in connection with our Privacy Notice and the processing of your personal data by Musikhaus Thomannâs websites, you can contact Musikhaus Thomannâs Data Protection Officer directly by email (privacy@thomann.de).
They will gladly take care of your data protection concerns.





Personal data / types of use

As a principle, the protection of your personal data is of highest priority for Musikhaus Thomann.
You decide whether or not you wish to make such data known to us, for example in the course of any registration, survey or the like.
Such information on your part is relevant for your enquiry, but you provide it on a voluntary basis.
An exception to this rule is when prior consent cannot be obtained for practical reasons and the processing of data is permitted by law.


Legal basis for the processing of personal data

If we obtain the consent of the data subject to process their personal data, Article 6(1)(a) GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing of personal data.
When processing personal data necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, Article 6(1)(b) GDPR shall serve as the legal basis.
This also applies to any processing required to perform pre-contractual measures.
If processing of personal data is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which Musikhaus Thomann is subject, Article 6(1)(c) GDPR shall serve as the legal basis.
In the event that the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person necessitate the processing of personal data, Article 6 (1)(d) GDPR shall serve as the legal basis.
If processing is necessary to safeguard the legitimate interests of our company or of a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject, Article 6(1)(f) GDPR shall serve as the legal basis for processing.
The legal basis for and more information about data processing using cookies on our website can be found in the section on cookies.


Data deletion and storage duration

The data subjectâs personal data will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose of storage ceases to apply.
Data may be stored beyond this if provisions have been made for this by the European or national legislator in Union regulations, laws or other rules to which the controller is subject.
Data will also be blocked or deleted if a storage period prescribed by the standards mentioned above expires, unless there is a need for further storage of the data for the conclusion or fulfilment of a contract.





Exchange of data / contractual relationships with partners / third parties

In addition to the types of use described above, Musikhaus Thomann will transfer your data to third parties that are involved in the processing of your order or that participate in contracts.
For example, if you place an order via our website, we will transmit your order information to Musikhaus Thomannâs partner companies and contractors who process and deliver your order to you.
Data will only be transmitted to the extent required in order to fulfil or deliver your order or to process an enquiry.
The legal basis for this is the fulfilment of the contract concluded with you (e.g.
for orders) or the initiation of a contract (Article 6(1)(b) GDPR).
We will also transmit personal data to third parties where we are required to do so by law.
The legal basis in this instance is Article 6(1)(c) GDPR.


Data automatically collected on our website / usage data

This involves code snippets that are usually only 1x1 pixel in size and can identify and detect your browser via the browser ID â your browserâs individual âfingerprintâ.
These enable the service provider to see how many users have accessed the pixel and if and when an email has been opened or a website has been visited.
You can use tools such as webwasher, bugnosys and AdBlock to prevent web bugs on our website.
We will not use web bugs to secretly collect your personal data or share such data with third parties and marketing platforms without your express consent.

Google Tag Manager

We use Google Tag Manager to manage âwebsite tagsâ.
Tags are small code elements on our website that run upon certain interactions with the website and send measured data to the third party programs used (e.g.
Google Analytics).
The Tag Manager itself does not use cookies and does not collect any personal data.
The Tag Manager triggers other tags that collect data and place cookies under certain circumstances (e.g.
the third party programs used).
The Tag Manager does not access this data.


Embedding and use of links to social media (Facebook, Instagram, etc.)

Links to external social network services such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter are embedded on our website, in particular in the areas displaying our products.
The responsibility for the internet services of these social network services lies solely with their operators.
Below you will find further information, categorised according to the corresponding social network service.

Data is only transmitted if you are logged into your user account of the corresponding social media service.
You can then link to or share content from our websites directly using the social media service, or you can watch the videos that are on our YouTube channel.
Under certain circumstances, the social media service may thus ascertain which content you have viewed on our website.
The responsibility for the social media services linked to by Musikhaus Thomann lies exclusively with:

 Facebook Inc., 1601 S.
California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA, for Facebook and its website;

Facebook remarketing

On our websites, we use the âVanilla Custom Audiences Pixelâ, a service provided by Facebook Inc., 1601 S.
California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (âFacebookâ).
With the help of this service we can reach our customers directly through the Facebook network by showing âFacebook adsâ to visitors of our website when they visit the social network Facebook.
To this end we have implemented the Facebook âremarketing pixelâ.
This involves code snippets that are able to identify your browser via the browser ID â your browserâs individual fingerprint â and detect that you visited our website and what exactly you viewed there.
A direct connection to the Facebook servers is made when you visit our website.
Facebook is able to identify you using your browser-ID, as this is linked to other data saved to your Facebook user account.
Facebook then shows customised advertisements that are matched to your needs on your Facebook timeline or in another place on Facebook.
We at Thomann are not able to personally identify you via the Facebook pixel, because we do not save any personal data other than your browser ID using the Facebook remarketing pixel. More information about Facebook Custom Audiences, the particulars of data processing using this service and Facebookâs data policy can be found at https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/.

Statutory right of withdrawal

is a company based in the USA.
It cannot be excluded that the data collected by Facebook will also be sent to the USA.
However, Facebook Inc.
has submitted to and been certified in accordance with the Privacy Shield agreement concluded between the European Union and the USA.
Facebook consequently undertakes to comply with the standards and provisions laid out in European data protection law.

Google Ads Conversion Tracking

Our website utilises the Google Ads Conversion Tracking function.
The provider of this service is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland (âGoogleâ).
If you click on an Ads advertisement placed by Google, a âconversion tracking cookieâ will be stored on your computer.
This cookie is valid for 30 days and does not contain data that would allow us to identify you personally.
Conversion tracking allows us and Google to identify the Ads advertisements you have clicked on and whether you were forwarded to our website via an advertisement, if you visit our website and the cookie is still valid.
Google provides us with our own cookie, which is different from the cookies of other customers of this Google service, so that we can only implement a reach assessment with regard to our own cookies, and not across all websites of customers of the Google Ads service.
The cookie enables us to compile our own conversion statistics on customers that visit our website through Ads advertisements.

Statutory right of withdrawal


You can find out how to withdraw your consent given using our cookie pop-up in the section Withdrawal of consent to the use of cookies and other identifiers/tags.

DoubleClick and Google Ads Remarketing or âSimilar Audiencesâ

Our website utilises the DoubleClick Remarketing Pixel and Google Ads Remarketing or âSimilar Audiencesâ.
The provider of both services is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland (âGoogleâ).
Using these services, we can show you advertisements associated with our online shop (e.g.
interesting product offers) on the websites of other service providers that also use these Google services (âpartnersâ in the Google Display network).
Furthermore, we can use Google Ads Remarketing to place a message on the websites of other providers in the Google Display Network reminding you to complete your order if you have recently abandoned an order on our online shop.
This requires the use of cookie technology.
To this end, Google stores a small file containing a sequence of numbers (âcookie IDâ) in your browser to identify you as a visitor to our website and collect other anonymous data about the use of our website.
The cookie ID is stored by us and used only to explicitly identify your browser and not to identify you as a person.
These services are not used to collect or store your personal data.
We use Google Remarketing across multiple devices.
This means, for example, that if you begin making a purchase from our online shop using your smartphone and complete it on your laptop, we can reach you with the abovementioned personalised advertisements on the other device you use.
However, this will only happen if you have given Google your consent for Google to link your web and app browsing history with your Google account, and for information from your Google account to be used to personalise the advertisements you see online.
In this instance, Google uses the data of this logged-in user together with Google analytics data to define and create audience lists for Remarketing across multiple devices.
Google Analytics collects this userâs Google-authenticated IDs to support this function.
This data from Google is temporarily linked with our Google Analytics data to create our audiences.
Please check the privacy settings in your Google account to prevent Google linking your web and app browsing history with your Google account.
No personal data will be transmitted to Google for the purpose of displaying a message reminding you of an abandoned order on our online shop.
Only the fact that you wanted to place an order on our online shop under the collected cookie ID and abandoned this order, as well as the total price of the intended order, will be transmitted to Google for this purpose (âshopping cart transferâ).

Bing Ads

Our website utilises âBing Adsâ remarketing technology.
The provider of this service is the Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399, USA (âMicrosoftâ).
If you access our website via a Microsoft Bing advertisement, Microsoft places a cookie on your computer (âconversion cookieâ).
This enables Microsoft and Bing Ads customers to identify that the advertisement has been clicked and a user has been forwarded to our website.
In this way, it is possible to address you once again with targeted product recommendations and interest-based advertising on Microsoftâs websites and the websites of other âBing Adsâ customers. The information collected using the conversion cookie serves to create conversion statistics.
We learn the total number of users who have clicked on a Microsoft Bing advertisement and thus been forwarded to our website.
Other anonymous data (e.g.
the number of page views and the length of time spent on the website) is also collected.
We do not receive information that would allow us to identify users personally.

Statutory right of withdrawal


You can find out how to withdraw your consent given using our cookie pop-up in the section Withdrawal of consent to the use of cookies and other identifiers/tags.


The Microsoft Corporation is based in the USA.
It cannot be excluded that the data collected by Microsoft will also be sent to the USA.
However, the Microsoft Corporation has submitted to and been certified in accordance with the Privacy Shield agreement concluded between the European Union and the USA.

Adform

Our website utilises services for the purposes of retargeting and conversion tracking.
The provider of these services is Adform A/S, Wildersgade 10B, 1.
sal.
1408 Copenhagen, Denmark (âAdformâ).
Using the Ad Serving service, we can show you advertisements associated with our online shop (e.g.
interesting product offers) on the websites of other service providers that also use Adform.
Ad Serving and the integrated conversion tracking function also enable us and Adform to identify the advertisements you have clicked on and whether you were forwarded to our website via an advertisement, if you visit our website.
To this end we have implemented the Adform pixel as an identifier.
This involves code snippets that are able to identify your browser via the browser ID â your browserâs individual fingerprint â and detect that you visited our website and what exactly you viewed there.
A direct connection to the Adform servers is made via the pixel when you visit our website.
Adform processes the data collected by the pixel in order to provide the abovementioned services.
We at Thomann are not able to personally identify you via the Adform pixel, because we do not save personal data other than your browser ID using the Adform pixel.

Statutory right of withdrawal


You can find out how to withdraw your consent given using our cookie pop-up in the section Withdrawal of consent to the use of cookies and other identifiers/tags.

Embedded YouTube videos

When you visit a website into which YouTube videos are embedded, Google receives information that you have accessed this website.
The data mentioned in the above section (âusage dataâ) is also transmitted.
This happens regardless of whether Google provides a user account that you can log into or whether no user account exists.
If you are logged into your Google account, your data will be directly associated with your account.
If you do not wish data to be associated with your Google profile, you must log out prior to visiting websites into which YouTube videos are embedded.
Google stores this data as a user profile and uses it for purposes of advertising, market research and/or demand-led configuration of its website.
Such evaluation takes place (even for users who are not logged in) for the purposes of demand-oriented advertising.
You can find more information in the Google Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy.
The legal basis for the use of YouTube videos on our website is our legitimate interest (Article 6(1)(1)(f) GDPR) in the demand-oriented, visually optimised presentation of our website, above all through the use of videos.

Right to object


You have the right to object to the creation of these user profiles, whereby you must contact Google in order to exercise this right.
You can use the privacy settings in your Google account to determine how Google can use your data for advertising or other purposes.
This includes settings determining the display of advertisements (âadsâ).






Classified ads

You can place classified ads on our website free of charge.
To this end, we collect your name, address and email address in a registration form.
These details will then be saved in our system and used for creating the classified ad.
Either your name or a pseudonym, as well as your country, city, postal code and email address will be published in the classified ad.
In addition, information regarding the description of the equipment, pictures uploaded by you and your telephone number (optional) will be part of the published classified ad.
The legal basis for the data processing is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.
This is to enable interested parties to contact you, and to prevent fraud.
Additionally, we compare the data provided by you for the placement of the classified ad with our customer database.
This is to correct any false customer data, and to assign the classified ad to a customer account (if you are already a customer of Musikhaus Thomann).
This enables you to comfortably administrate your classified ad via the regular Customer Centre log-in.
The data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary for the purpose of its collection.
This is the case for data collected during the registration process if the registration for our website is cancelled or modified.
As a user, you have the option to cancel your registration at any time.
The data stored about you can be modified at any time via customer support.
You must make a request to us for your customer account to be deleted.
To do this, contact our customer support (for example, using the contact details of your personal contacts shown on the left in your customer account).
Your personal data will only be blocked before deletion in individual cases if deletion prevents legal retention requirements or official orders.

Right to information
 If you have exercised your right of rectification, deletion or restriction of processing against the controller, the controller is obliged to notify all recipients to whom your personal data has been disclosed of this rectification or deletion of data or restriction of processing, unless this proves to be impossible or involves a disproportionate effort.

Right to object
