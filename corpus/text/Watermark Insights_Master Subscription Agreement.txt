BY AGREEING TO A DOCUMENT INCORPORATING THIS MASTER SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT (MSA), WATERMARK AND ORGANIZATION AGREE THAT THESE TERMS SHALL GOVERN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PARTIES AS TO ANY SERVICES PROVIDED OR TO BE PROVIDED TO ORGANIZATION AS SET FORTH IN SUCH ORDER FORM.
AS TO ANY PARTICULAR ORDER FORM, THE ORDER FORM AND THESE TERMS TOGETHER CONSTITUTE THE AGREEMENT OF THE PARTIES AND ARE REFERRED TO COLLECTIVELY HEREIN AS THE âAGREEMENT.â IN THE EVENT OF ANY CONFLICT BETWEEN THE ORDER FORM AND THESE TERMS, THESE TERMS SHALL PREVAIL UNLESS THE ORDER FORM EXPRESSLY PROVIDES IT IS MODIFYING THESE TERMS WITH RESPECT TO SUCH AGREEMENT.
1.
The Service

1.1 Introduction. Watermark owns the rights in and to an educational tools website, the URL address of which is www.watermarkinsights.com, and related technology as described in the Order Form, and Watermark has agreed to provide: (i) access to certain of such technologies to Organization (âSubscription Serviceâ).
and (ii) if applicable, Professional Services, including Implementation (âProfessional Serviceâ), as indicated in the Order Form, and which may be updated by the parties from time to time to add or remove additional Subscription or Professional Services (collectively, âthe Serviceâ).
Organization wishes to enter into this Agreement with Watermark to enable its employees, and, as applicable, its administrators, faculty and students (âEnd Usersâ) to make use of the Service.

1.2 Subscription. Subject to and conditioned on Organizationâs payment of the fees for Subscription Services and compliance with all other terms and conditions of this Agreement, Watermark grants to Organization a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable right to access and use the Subscription Service solely for the purpose of enabling access and use of the Service by its End Users during the Term of this Agreement, and in accordance with the Order Form.

1.3 Customer Restrictions and Responsibilities. Organization is solely responsible for (i) the content of Organization Data.
and (ii) its use of the Services, including by and between its End Users.
Each End Userâs access to the Subscription Service is conditioned upon the End Userâs acceptance of the Terms of Service (âToSâ).
provided that Watermark agrees that Organization and its employees shall be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement and therefore Watermark waives compliance by Organization and its employees with any conflicting provisions of the ToS.
Watermark shall make the accounts available to Organization, and Organization shall be responsible for providing the access codes to its End Users and informing them that they may register for the Subscription Service.
Organization shall be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the access codes.
Organization shall not, directly or indirectly: (a) attempt to gain access to Watermarkâs software code for any purpose, including without limitation, to modify, disassemble, de-compile, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to determine the source code or protocols from the object code of the Service or knowingly permit or encourage any third party to do so.
(b) use the Service in any manner to provide service bureau, time-sharing or other computer services to third parties.
(c) use the Service in any manner to assist or take part in the development, marketing, or sale of a product potentially competitive with the Service.
(d) remove or modify any proprietary marking or restrictive legends placed on the Subscription Service.
or (e) use the Service, or allow the transfer, transmission, export, or re-export of the Service or portion thereof in violation of any applicable law, including, without limitation, export control laws or regulations administered by a government agency of competent jurisdiction.
Organization shall: (a) provide access to Organizationâs premises and such other facilities as may reasonably be required for purposes of performing the Service.
(b) respond promptly to any Watermark request to provide direction, information, approvals, authorizations or decisions that are reasonably necessary for Watermark to perform Services in accordance with the requirements of any Order Form.
and (c) provide such information as Watermark may reasonably request, in order to carry out the Services, in a timely matter, and ensure that it is complete and accurate in all respects.
If Watermarkâs performance of its obligations under the Agreement is prevented or delayed by any act or omission of Organization or its agents, subcontractors, consultants or employees, Watermark shall not be deemed in breach of its obligations under this Agreement or any Order Form or otherwise liable for any costs, charges or losses sustained or incurred by Organization, in each case, to the extent arising directly or indirectly from such prevention or delay.

1.4 Watermark Responsibilities. In the event that End Users will be paying for their accounts directly, Watermark shall inform Organization when Organization may advise its End Users to begin purchasing accounts and self-registering on the Subscription Service.
Watermark shall: (a) provide support as specified in any Order Form.
and (b) perform the Service using personnel of required skill, experience and qualifications and in a professional and workmanlike manner in accordance with generally recognized industry standards for similar services and shall devote adequate resources to meet its obligations under this Agreement.

1.5 Service Availability. Watermark shall endeavor to ensure that the Subscription Service is available, except for scheduled downtime for maintenance or in the event of a force majeure event (as defined in Section 9).
In the event of unexpected downtime, Watermarkâs sole obligation will be to use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve the issue as soon as reasonably practicable under the circumstances.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Watermark may temporarily suspend Organizationâs and any End Userâs access to any portion or all of the Subscription Service if: (i) Watermark reasonably determines that (A) there is a threat or attack on any of Watermarkâs IP.
(B) Organizationâs or any End Userâs use of Watermarkâs IP disrupts or poses a security risk to Watermarkâs IP or to any other customer or vendor of Watermark.
(C) Organization, or any End User, is using Watermarkâs IP for fraudulent or illegal activities.
(D) subject to applicable law, Organization has ceased to continue its business in the ordinary course, made an assignment for the benefit of creditors or similar disposition of its assets, or become the subject of any bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, or similar proceeding.
or (E) Watermarkâs provision of the Subscription Service to Organization or any End User is enjoined or otherwise prohibited by applicable law, or threatened to be enjoined or prohibited.
or (ii) any vendor of Watermark has suspended or terminated Watermarkâs access to or use of any third- party or products required to enable Organization to access the Subscription Service.
(any such suspension described in subclause (i), or (ii), a âService Suspensionâ).
Watermark shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide written notice of any Service Suspension to Organization and to provide updates regarding resumption of access to the Subscription Service following any Service Suspension.
Watermark shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resume providing access to the Subscription Service as soon as reasonably possible after the event giving rise to the Service Suspension is cured.

1.6 Additional Terms for Professional Services. If either party wishes to change the scope or performance of any applicable Professional Services, it shall submit details of the requested change to the other party in writing.

(ii) any necessary variations to the fees and other charges arising from the change.
(iii) the likely effect of the change on the Professional Services.
and (iv) any other impact the change might have on the performance of the Agreement.
Promptly after receipt of the written estimate, the parties shall negotiate and agree in writing on the terms of such change (a âChange Orderâ).
In addition to any other responsibilities or duties described in this Agreement, the following is a list of obligations for which Organization is responsible, conditions on Watermarkâs performance, and assumptions upon which Watermark has relied in agreeing to perform the Professional Services (if any Organization obligations are unfulfilled or inaccurate, Change Orders and increased fees may be required in order to proceed): (i) Organization holds primary responsibility for data quality of sufficient standards in order to meet Organization goals.
(ii) Organization will provide all data, systems and connectivity necessary for Watermark to perform its obligations.

(iv) all data is assumed to be in a usable state which does not require additional aggregations or manipulations within Watermark.
and (v) Organization will not require any additional security, policy or onboarding requirements of Watermark personnel in order to kick off or continue performance of the Services.

âCohort Implementationâ shall mean implementation for Subscription Service upgrades with waived fees in conjunction with Organization participation in a Watermark cohort.

Neither party shall be bound by any Change Order unless mutually agreed upon in writing.
