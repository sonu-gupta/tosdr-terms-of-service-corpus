         Home Â» About Â» Privacy Policy Software Privacy Policy Inkscape, as a software, does not, in any way, collect or transmit any Personal Information (or any information at all). Caveat Inkscape may access your Linux, Mac or Windows username e.g.
C:\Users\Bob\ for the purpose of opening the files you want to open with it, like any application.
This username, in some cases, might be included in edited svg files.
If *you* choose to transmit on the web a svg file created or edited with Inkscape, it might contain full file paths including that username, that Inkscape sometimes embeds into the file for the purpose of remembering where you save png exports of specific files.
You can get around that by saving as "Optimized SVG", and this information will be stripped out of the file. Website Privacy Policy This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which Inkscape collects, uses, maintains and discloses information collected from users (each, a âUserâ) of the https://inkscape.org website (âSiteâ). Personal identification information We may collect personal identification information from a User in a variety of ways.
This includes data collected from usage of activities, services, website features and resources offered by our website, such as, but not limited to: visiting our site, filling out forms, uploading files and responding to surveys.
Users may be asked for their name or nick name and email address, as appropriate.&nbsp.
Users may, however, visit our Site anonymously.
We will collect personal identification information from Users only if they voluntarily submit such information to us.
Users can always refuse to supply personally identifying information, except that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Site related activities.
Sometimes we may award items, for which we require a mailing address.
This doesn't need to be the User's home address - a P.O.
box or place of employment or a trusted third party of their choice would be acceptable in most cases.
This is opt-in, but if the User chooses not to opt-in, they may be ineligible to receive the rewards.
Inkscape may fund development activities or reimburse individuals for expenses or similar.
Payments for these things will require some banking information (or postal address for sending checks), but this information is not required by Inkscape or its administrators.
instead the User will be directed to provide it to the Software Freedom Conservancy, who will cut the checks or conduct the money transfer directly with the User.
Data about donations a User makes to the Inkscape project are recorded by the Software Freedom Conservancy, and, depending on the way the User donates the money, by the money-handling service that is used (e.g.
Paypal).
Some of the individual donation data may be shared with the project Board.
We will not publish any data about individual donations without the donor's consent (Software Freedom Conservancy Privacy Policy). Non-personal identification information We may collect non-personal identification information about Users whenever they interact with our Site.
Non-personal identification information may include the browser name, the type of computer, operating system, country, default language, IP address and similar information. Web browser cookies.
