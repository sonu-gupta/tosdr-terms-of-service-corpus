Tawk.to operates a web application and corresponding mobile apps (on http://www.tawk.to).
It is tawk.toâs policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our services.

Website Visitors

Like most internet-service operators, tawk.to collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers, apps and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, geographical location, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.
tawk.toâs purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how tawk.toâs visitors use its services, and to provide tawk.to users the ability to understand how their visitors use their services.
From time to time, tawk.to may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its services.
tawk.to also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for users that use the services and visitors.

Gathering and Use of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to tawk.toâs websites and users of tawk.toâs apps choose to interact with tawk.to in ways that require tawk.to to gather personally-identifying information.
The amount and type of information that tawk.to gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.
For example, we ask users of our app to provide an email address.
In each case, tawk.to collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitorâs interaction with tawk.to.
tawk.to does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

(ii) to comply with our legal obligations.
(iii) because processing is necessary for purposes of our legitimate interest or those of any third party recipients that receive your personal data, provided that such interests are not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.
 We may also process your data based on your consent where you have expressly given that to us.
Retention Period:
We will retain your personal information for as long as is needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements).
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
For personal information that we process on behalf of our customers, we will retain such personal information in accordance with the terms of our agreement with them, subject to applicable law.

Types of personal data we collect and use

We will only process personal data in ways that are compatible with the purpose we collected it for, or for the purposes you later authorize.
Before we use your personal data for a purpose that is materially different from the purpose we collected it for or that you later authorized, we will provide you with the opportunity to opt-out.
