         COMMERCIAL ENTITY AGREEMENT FOR PAYPAL PAYMENT CARD FUNDED PROCESSING SERVICES &nbsp.
This Commercial Entity Agreement for PayPal Payment Card Funded Processing Services (âCommercial Entity Agreementâ or "CEA") is agreed with all PayPal Users that are Commercial Entities (as defined by Visa Europe, Visa Inc, Visa International, Mastercard Worldwide, UK Maestro, Solo and/or International Maestro (together the "Associations")).
Each such PayPal User is referred to as âMerchantâ and may be referred to herein as âyouâ and/or âyourâ.
This CEA constitutes your separate legally binding contract for credit and debit card processing for PayPal transactions between you and the Acquirer (as defined below).
For the purposes of this CEA, "Acquirer" shall mean (a) Worldpay (UK) Limited if Merchant is based in Europe.
and/or (b) Worldpay PTE Ltd if Merchant is based in Singapore.
and/or (c) Worldpay (HK) Limited if Merchant is based in Hong Kong.
and/or (d) Citizens Bank, N.A.
if Merchant is based in the United States and/or (d) Worldpay PTY.
Ltd if Merchant is based in Australia.
In this CEA "we", "us" and "our" refer to Acquirer.
In accordance with the provisions of this CEA, Acquirer may terminate its provision of credit and debit card processing services and require PayPal to enforce any of the provisions of Merchantâs agreement(s) with PayPal ("PayPal Agreement"), agreed by and between Merchant and PayPal.
Merchant agrees to the terms and conditions of this CEA.
Merchant further agrees that this CEA forms a legally binding contract between Merchant and Acquirer.
PayPal is not a party to this contract and acts only as Acquirerâs agent in connection with it.
If we propose to change this CEA in a substantial manner, PayPal will provide you on our behalf with at least 30 days' (or such minimum period as is required by law) prior notice of such a change.
After the notice period elapses, you will be deemed to have agreed to all such amendments to the CEA.
To amend this CEA but not in a substantial manner, PayPal will post on our behalf a revised version of the CEA on the PayPal website(s), and the revised version will be effective at the time PayPal posts it.
 If you disagree with any proposed amendments, you may close your PayPal account before the expiry of the notice  period provided in the notice and otherwise in accordance with the terms of the PayPal Agreement, and this CEA will terminate on the closure of your account.
A change to this CEA will be considered to be made in a âsubstantial mannerâ if the change involves a reduction to your rights or increases your responsibilities.


Purpose of this CEA. When your customers pay you through PayPal, they have the option of paying you through a funding source supported by PayPal including a card.
In most instances, you will not know the funding source that your customer selected.
Since you may be the recipient of a card funded payment, the Associations require that you enter into a direct contractual relationship with an acquirer who is a member of the Associations.
By entering into this CEA, you are fulfilling such Association requirement and you are agreeing to comply with Association rules as they pertain to payments you receive through the PayPal service.

Obligations of Acquirer.&nbsp.


Acquirerâs obligations under this CEA are limited exclusively to the processing of Merchant's card transactions in the territory in which the Merchant is based and the receipt and disbursement of related funds to PayPal for the account of the Merchant (the âAcquiring Servicesâ).&nbsp.
All other obligations relating to the provision of the services under the PayPal Agreement are the responsibility of PayPal and any issue, dissatisfaction, dispute and/or service dispute of the Merchant relating to any services provided to the Merchant should be notified to and brought against PayPal in the first instance.
Subject to the terms of this CEA and the PayPal Agreement, Acquirer will initiate a payment to the designated account (as made known to Acquirer by PayPal) of an amount equal to the value of card transactions processed by Acquirer for the Merchant under this CEA (less deductions for refunds, fines, assessments, chargebacks, chargeback costs, fees or other Merchant liabilities (whether actual or anticipated) under this CEA or the PayPal Agreement).
 Any obligation of Acquirer to remit funds under this CEA is subject to any rights of Acquirer under its agreement with PayPal.
Merchant agrees that any payment made to PayPal by Acquirer under this CEA will be deemed good receipt by Merchant of the sums due from Acquirer to Merchant in relation to Acquirerâs liability to Merchant under this CEA.
Merchant shall indemnify Acquirer and keep Acquirer indemnified against all losses, costs, claims, demands, expenses (including legal expenses) and liabilities of any nature (including any re-settlement obligations under the Association rules) arising from or relating to the payment of funds by Acquirer into an account in the name of PayPal in accordance with the terms of this CEA.
Throughout the term of this CEA and after its termination for any reason, Acquirer shall be entitled to defer (for such period as it shall in its reasonable discretion consider appropriate) the date upon which the payment of funds in respect of card transactions would (but for this clause) be due in order to protect its position with respect to actual or anticipated chargebacks, fines, assessments, refunds, chargeback costs, fees, fraud, illegal activity or any other liability of Merchant or relating to any card transactions or under this CEA or the PPA, whether actual or anticipated.&nbsp.
Amounts so deferred may be set-off against any actual chargebacks, fines, assessments, refunds, chargeback costs, fees or any other liability of Merchant. &nbsp.
The Merchant understands and acknowledges that during the term of this CEA and after its termination for any reason whatsoever, the Merchant shall continue to bear total responsibility for all chargebacks, chargeback costs, refunds, fines, assessments, fees, fraud and illegal activity resulting in any way from card transactions processed pursuant to this CEA and all other amounts then due or which thereafter may become due under this CEA or the PayPal Agreement.



Association Rules.


Deposit Transactions. Merchant agrees that it shall only accept payments through PayPal processing services for bona fide transactions between the Merchant and its customer for the sale of goods or services.
Merchant shall not submit a transaction for the refinance or transfer of an existing obligation that was uncollectible.
Merchant acknowledges that for Visa and Mastercard payments, PayPal shall obtain an authorization for transaction amounts prior to completing the transaction.

Split Transactions. Merchant agrees not to split the sale into two (or more) separate amounts in order to avoid obtaining authorization for the full amount.
Except, however in an instance where the Merchant and cardholder agree on a partial shipment of product, or where the transaction qualifies for delayed delivery or special order deposits (such as partial shipments based on inventory on hand), a sale may be split into multiple transactions.

Minimum or Maximum/Surcharges. Merchant agrees that it shall not set minimum or maximum transaction amounts or impose surcharges as a condition of honoring Visa and Mastercard cards, unless otherwise permitted in the particular jurisdiction of a transaction.

Visa and Mastercard Marks. Merchant is authorized to and must use the Visa and Mastercard logos or marks on Merchantâs promotional materials and website to indicate that Visa and Mastercard cards are accepted as funding sources for PayPal transactions.

Discrimination. Merchant agrees that it shall not engage in any acceptance practice that discriminates against or discourages the use of Visa or Mastercard in favour of any other card brand unless otherwise permitted in the particular jurisdiction of a transaction.

Access to Cardholder Data. Merchant acknowledges that where it has access to Cardholder Data (defined as the cardholderâs card number, expiration date, and CVV2) it will abide by any data security standards of the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (or any replacement body), Visa or Mastercard, including the Payment Card Industry SSC Standards.
In addition you agree to comply with the data security standards required by PayPal under the PayPal Agreement, as may be amended from time to time.&nbsp.
.
In the event that Merchant receives Cardholder Data in connection with the PayPal processing services, Merchant agrees that it will not use the Cardholder Data for any purpose that it knows or should know to be fraudulent or in violation of any Association rules.
Merchant also agrees that it will not sell, purchase, provide or exchange in any manner or disclose Cardholder Data to anyone other than its acquirer, Visa or Mastercard (as applicable) or in response to a government request.

Merchant Identification. Merchant agrees to prominently and unequivocally inform the cardholder of the identity of the Merchant at all points of interaction including the location (physical address) of the Merchant to enable the cardholder to easily determine whether the transaction will be a domestic transaction or a cross-border transaction.

Chargebacks. Merchant shall use all reasonable methods to resolve disputes with the cardholder.
Should a chargeback dispute occur, Merchant shall promptly comply with all requests for information from PayPal.
Merchant shall not attempt to recharge a cardholder for an item that has been charged back to the cardholder, unless the cardholder has authorized such actions.



Merchantâs Refund Policy must be on Merchantâs Website. If Merchant limits refund/exchange terms or other specific conditions for Card sales, Merchantâs policy must be clearly provided to the cardholder prior to the sale and Merchant must conform with all applicable laws and the Association rules.

Audit.&nbsp.
Upon Acquirerâs request, the Merchant must promptly disclose to Acquirer such information as Acquirer reasonably requires in order to enable Acquirer to perform its obligations, and/or assess its financial and insurance risks in connection with the services provided, and/or to assess the Merchantâs compliance with the terms of the CEA and/or the Association rules.
