HOW WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGY TO COLLECT INFORMATION
We, and our third-party partners, automatically collect certain types of usage information when you visit our Service, read our emails, or otherwise engage with us.
 We typically collect this information through a variety of tracking technologies, including cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, file information, and similar technology (collectively, âtracking technologiesâ).
 For example, we collect information about your device and its software, such as your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, platform type, device type, operating system, date and time stamp (a unique ID that allows us to uniquely identify your browser, mobile device, or your account), and other such information.
 We also collect information about the way you use our Service, for example, the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave our website, the pages you visit, the links you click, how frequently you access the Service, whether you open emails or click the links contained in emails, whether you access the Service from multiple devices, and other actions you take on the Service.
 When you access our Service from a mobile device, we may collect unique identification numbers associated with your device or our mobile application (including, for example, a UDID, Unique ID for Advertisers (âIDFAâ), Google AdID, or Windows Advertising ID), mobile carrier, device type, model and manufacturer, mobile device operating system brand and model, phone number, and, depending on your mobile device settings, your geographical location data, including GPS coordinates (e.g., latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device, or we may be able to approximate a deviceâs location by analyzing other information, like an IP address.
 We may collect analytics data or use third-party analytics tools such as Google Analytics to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service and to understand more about the demographics of our users.
 You can learn more about Googleâs practices at http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners and view its currently available opt-out options at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
 We may also work with third-party partners to employ technologies, including the application of statistical modeling tools, which permit us to recognize and contact you across multiple devices.
 Although we do our best to honor the privacy preferences of our users, we are unable to respond to Do Not Track signals set by your browser at this time.
We use or may use the data collected through tracking technologies to:  (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site.
(b) provide custom, personalized content and information, including targeted content and advertising.
(c) recognize and contact you across multiple devices.
(d) provide and monitor the effectiveness of our Service.
(e) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, usage, and demographic patterns on our Service.

(ii) disable existing cookies.
or (iii) set your browser to automatically reject cookies.
 Please note that doing so may negatively impact your experience using the Service, as some features and services on our Service may not work properly.
Depending on your mobile device and operating system, you may not be able to delete or block all cookies.
 You may also set your email options to prevent the automatic downloading of images that may contain technologies that would allow us to know whether you have accessed our email and performed certain functions with it.

Other companies and brands owned or controlled by Company and other companies owned by or under common ownership as Company, which also includes our subsidiaries (i.e., any organization we own or control) or our ultimate holding company (i.e., any organization that owns or controls us) and any subsidiaries it owns.
 These companies will use your personal information in the same way as we can under this Policy;
Third-party vendors and other service providers that perform services on our behalf, as needed to carry out their work for us, which may include preventing fraud or other illegal activity, such as anti-money laundering services, verifying your identity and status as an accredited investor, identifying and serving targeted advertisements, providing mailing services, providing tax and accounting services, contest fulfilment, web hosting, or providing analytic services.

4.
 LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING IN THE EU
In the EU, the purposes for which we process your personal data are:

The provision of personal data by you may be necessary for the performance of any contractual relationship we have with you;
Where it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations laid down by EU law;
Where in our legitimate interests (provided these are not overridden by your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms â this includes our own legitimate interests and those of other entities and branches in our group of companies) such as:

to contact you and respond to your requests and enquiries;
for business administration, including statistical analysis;
to provide the Services to you;
for fraud prevention and detection.
and
to comply with applicable laws, regulations or codes of practices.



We may also process your personal data on the basis of your freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous consent.
You should be aware that you are entitled under Data Protection Law to withdraw your consent where that has been given, at any time.
 If you do this and we have no alternative lawful reason to process your personal data, this may affect our ability to provide you with rights to use the Service.

6.
 THIRD-PARTY TRACKING AND ONLINE ADVERTISING

Interest-Based Advertising. We participate in interest-based advertising and use third-party advertising companies to serve you targeted advertisements based on your browsing history.
 We may share or we may permit third-party online advertising networks, social media companies, and other third-party services to collect information about your use of our website over time so that they may play or display ads on our Service, on other devices you may use, and on other websites, apps, or services, including on Facebook.
 Typically, though not always, the information we share is provided through cookies or similar tracking technologies, which recognize the device you are using and collect information, including click stream information, browser type, time and date you visited the site, and other information.
 We and our third-party partners use this information to make the advertisements you see online more relevant to your interests, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics, and market research.

Social Media Widgets and Advertising. Our Service may include social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, Google Plus, LinkedIn, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, or other widgets.
 These social media companies may recognize you and collect information about your visit to our Service, and they may set a cookie or employ other tracking technologies.
Your interactions with those features are governed by the privacy policies of those companies.
We display targeted advertising to you through social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and others.
These companies have interest-based advertising programs that allow us to direct advertisements to users who have shown interest in our Service while those users are on the social media platform or to groups of other users who share similar traits, such as likely commercial interests and demographics.
 These advertisements are governed by the privacy policies of those social media companies that provide them.

Cross-Device Linking. We, or our third-party partners, may link your various devices so that content you see on one device can result in relevant advertising on another device.
 We do this by collecting information about each device you use when you are logged in to our Service.
 We may also work with third-party partners who employ tracking technologies or the application of statistical modeling tools to determine if two or more devices are linked to a single user or household.
 We may share a common account identifier (such as an email address or user ID) with third-party advertising partners to help recognize you across devices.
 We, and our partners, can use this cross-device linkage to serve interest-based advertising and other personalized content to you across your devices, to perform analytics, and to measure the performance of our advertising campaigns.
