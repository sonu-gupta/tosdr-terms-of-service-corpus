May 2018


 Archived May 2018 version of our Privacy Statement We completely redesigned our Privacy Statement, but we havenât changed how we use your personal information.
The key enhancements are:

We use simpler language.
We included a summary at the beginning for those who donât have time to read all the details.
We explain better in which circumstances we are a âdata controller,â when we use personal information on behalf of our clients as a âdata processor,â and what this means for you.
We structured the key information in three sections (website users, end users of our clients, and users of our trial versions) to reflect that how we use your information depends on your relationship with us.
We describe in more detail what information we collect, how we use it, and whom we share it with.
We outline our marketing activities more clearly.
