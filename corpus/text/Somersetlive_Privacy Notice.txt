We may therefore use and permit others to use your personal information as set out below, where we have a legal basis to do so:

To provide products and services:


We may use your information to assess your request to receive the products and services we offer, including where necessary conducting identity and credit reference checks and other due-diligence checks.
We may use your information to provide and administer the products and services you have elected to receive, including notifying you of changes and updates to our products and services.

We may conduct market research to evaluate and improve our products and services generally or develop new offerings.
If you log-in to our Sites using social media, (e.g., Facebook, Google+, Twitter or similar social media platforms), you are granting permission to the social media platform to share your user details with us.
This will include your name and email address which will then be used to form a user identity.
If you send us a picture, or video, for publication you confirm that you have the consent of all the people in the picture or video.
If the picture, or video, features a child, or children, you confirm that you are the parent or guardian of the child, or children, and have the legal right to grant consent (or the parent or guardian of the child, or children, has granted such consent).
Where you enquire or raise complaints about our products and services, we will use your personal information to investigate and respond to your enquiry or complaint.


To understand our customers, how you use our products &amp.
services, and tailor your experience:


We may use your information to provide a single customer view across our Sites and ensure we understand who our customers are and their preferences and how our products and services are generally perceived.
We may customise and tailor your experience on our Sites and the products and services we offer to ensure they are more relevant to your interests and preferences.
We may use the personal information gathered from our Sites to analyse and determine the level of engagement with our Sites and whether the communications that we send to customers are relevant, e.g., we may analyse your browsing behaviours and whether or not you open the communications that we send you.
We may send you direct marketing communications (via email, post, or telephone) about products and services we feel may be of interest to you.&nbsp.
You can choose not to receive direct marketing communications from us at any stage.&nbsp.
Where you opt-in to the receipt of newsletters and other content via email we may include first and third-party advertisements, some of which may be personalised, based upon our profile of you as a customer.&nbsp.
The personal data provided at opt-in for newsletters and accounts may also be used to enhance our profile of you, and further improve the relevance of any content which you receive across our channels and customer touchpoints.
Digital advertising helps us to fund the news articles and content published on our Sites and enables us to provide some of our content for free.
We and our third-party ad partners may display digital advertising on our Sites that is tailored to your interests and preferences so the online adverts you see are more relevant to you.&nbsp.
We work with a number of third-party ad partners to deliver digital advertising on our Sites, and we use cookies and other personal information to personalise the advertising that you see, such as your email address, postcode, and other observed browsing behaviour.&nbsp.
We do not share identifiable information about you with our third-party ad partners.  &nbsp.
Where we share, match, and use data for this purpose it is always pseudonymised beforehand, which means it is converted into a hashed series of numbers and letters to protect your identity. 
Where we use cookies on our Sites for advertising purposes, we will always ask for prior consent and where you provide your consent the cookie information will be used along with other information we hold about you to display digital advertising that is more relevant to you. &nbsp.
It is important to note, however, that where you do not provide your consent for digital adverting you will still see digital advertising on our Sites, but this will not be tailored to your interests and preferences. 
We will conduct analytics and modelling to identify trends and assess our performance and internal processes.&nbsp.
We may disclose the insight we gain through such analysis to other businesses e.g., to demonstrate patterns of use to third-party ad partners and others.
However, any information shared is either aggregated, anonymised or pseudonymised.

Where permitted by applicable laws, where you interact with us, we may monitor, record, and retain all associated correspondence and communications, such as written letters, telephone call recordings, emails, text messages, social media messages, in person meetings and any other communications.&nbsp.
We will do this to, (i) comply with our legal and regulatory obligations (ii), prevent, or detect crime (iii), maintain appropriate evidential records (iv), protect the security of our communications systems and (v) for training and quality purposes.
We will use your information to monitor and manage data security and the security of our Sites and networks.
