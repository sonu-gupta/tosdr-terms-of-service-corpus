Vogel App: The mobile Vogel application, available for Android and iOS operating systems.


Vogel Server: The Vogel server application, running on Amazon Web Services cloud, communicates securely with the Vogel application.


Vogel Service: The discrete service Vogel can perform on behalf of the user (e.g.
tighten Facebook privacy settings).

SummaryHow Vogel works:


A user downloads and uses the Vogel app on their device.


The user requests the Vogel app to conduct one or more tasks on their behalf (e.g.
tighten Facebook privacy settings).


The Vogel app requests the user for information (e.g.
their Facebook username and password) to complete the tasks.


The Vogel app uses the information to complete the tasks either on the user device itself or sends the information to the Vogel server securely.


The Vogel app and Vogel server discard the user information after the task is completed.

Why do we collect this information?
Vogel helps users:


Tighten their privacy settings on social media (e.g.
Facebook)


Delete personal data collected by Internet companies (e.g.
Google), and by gadgets (e.g.
Amazon Alexa)

To perform these tasks, Vogel needs to use the personal data listed above.
What do we do with this information?


Authenticate the user and make setting changes (e.g.
turn location tracking off at Facebook),


Make appropriate requests (e.g.
opt-out requests) to service providers and data collectors,


Set up accounts with services (e.g.
credit bureaus) that will enable credit locks/freezes and other privacy protection measures on the userâs behalf.


After completing the above tasks, the Vogel app deletes the data for the user, on the Vogel app, as well as on the Vogel server.
Where is the information stored?
The information is stored temporarily on the user device (inside the Vogel app), or securely on the Vogel servers while the Vogel services are completed on behalf of the users.
All data collection by Vogel is temporary
The Vogel app collects the user data only for the period of time necessary (usually between a few seconds to a few minutes) to complete each Vogel service.
Thereafter, the data is discarded.
How is the information discarded?
The information is discarded from the Vogel app and the Vogel servers every time a task is completed.
The Vogel app running on the userâs device, and the Vogel server store the information temporarily in the memory (RAM) and not on any kind of long-term storage (disk).Â©&nbsp.
