        Workona Terms of ServiceLast updated: May 23, 2019
The following terms and conditions (the âTermsâ) form a binding agreement between you, in your individual capacity or on behalf of the organization you represent, as applicable, and Workona Inc., a Delaware corporation (âWorkonaâ), and govern your use of the internet-based applications, software, services and websites offered by Workona (the âServicesâ).1.
Customers and Authorized UsersThese Terms apply to both Customers and Authorized Users, as applicable and as set forth below.
A âCustomerâ is you or the entity that you represent in agreeing to these Terms and creating an account on the Service, as indicated by you at the time of your creation of an account.
If you create an account but are not formally affiliated with an organization, or do not have the necessary organizational authority to enter into the Terms on behalf of such organization, then you as an individual are the Customer.
For example, if you signed up using a personal email address and invited a couple of friends to work on a new startup idea but havenât formed a company yet, you are the Customer.
However if you sign up using a primary email address with a domain owned by your company, and you have the necessary authority to bind your company to these Terms, then your company is the Customer.
An âAuthorized Userâ is a person who a Customer, or a person with admin access on a Customerâs account, has invited to participate in a Customer account.2.
Acceptance of the TermsBy creating an account, or by entering into an agreement to purchase a Subscription (as defined below), you agree, as an individual or on behalf of the organization that you represent, as applicable, to be bound by these Terms as Customer.
By accepting an invitation to join a team or organization account created by a Customer or otherwise indicating your assent to these Terms, you agree to be bound by these Terms as an Authorized User of a Customerâs Subscription.
In either case, you represent and warrant that (1) you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by these Terms, (2) you are at least 13 years of age, and (3) you have the authority to enter into the Terms (on behalf of yourself or, if applicable, the organization that you represent).
If you do not wish to be bound by these Terms, you may not access or use the Services.
Our Services are not designed for users under the age of 13, and if you are younger than 13 you may not use the Service.
These terms incorporate by reference the Workona Privacy Policy available at https://workona.com/policies/privacy.3.
Changes to the TermsThese Terms are subject to occasional revision.
We will notify you of any changes to our Terms by posting the new Terms on the Services and updating the âLast Updatedâ date below.
We will also notify you of material changes by sending an email to the email address you have provided to us.
For existing Customers and Authorized Users, any changes to these Terms will be effective thirty calendar days following notification of such change, and for new Customers and Authorized Users entering into these Terms after the new âLast Updatedâ date, these changes will be effective immediately.
Continued use of the Services following such changes will indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by the updated version of these Terms.4.
Access to the ServiceA Customer may enter into an agreement with Workona to purchase a subscription to access and use the Service, subject to these Terms (a âSubscriptionâ).
Workona may, in its sole discretion, also offer Customers the ability to access and use the Service without payment, subject to these Terms (an âUnpaid Subscriptionâ).
Workona may terminate any Unpaid Subscription at any time, in its sole discretion, without liability to the applicable Customer or any Authorized User.
In the case of a Subscription, Customer and its Authorized Users will be permitted to access and use the Service for the period set forth in such Subscription.
In all events, Workona reserves the right to modify or discontinue the Service with or without notice and without liability to any Customer or Authorized User.
If you object to any such modifications, your sole recourse will be to cease access to the Services.5.
