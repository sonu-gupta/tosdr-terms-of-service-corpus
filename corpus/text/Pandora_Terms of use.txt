Content Selection and Functionality of the Service.
Although we rely primarily on the Music Genome Project and your selections and interactions with the Services to select the content that we display and perform, there are many factors that influence our ability to provide certain content and services, such as licensing restrictions and content costs.
Pandora reserves the right in its discretion to select, display, and perform content based on a number of different factors, including but not limited to licensing and contract restrictions and requirements, territorial limitations, industry trends, and content cost and availability.
We strive to provide you with the best possible experience, and keep your tastes in mind when we select content to display and perform.

We may also keep track of your interactions with the Services, which may include the features you use, the advertising in which you see or show interest, and the content you view.
We do this for a variety of reasons, such as to gain an understanding of the types of music, content, or features you and/or other similar listeners tend to like or dislike, for compensating artists and other rightsholders for use of their content, to provide you with relevant and interesting advertising, and to improve the Services generally, which includes enhancing our music selection algorithms in an effort to provide you and other listeners with the music most suited to your tastes.

(b) Applicability of Section.
The terms of this section 25 will apply to all disputes that may arise out of, are connected with, or relate to this Agreement or the Services, subject only to the following exceptions: (1) if Pandora reasonably believes that you have in any manner acted or failed to act in any manner that may cause harm to us or any third party, we may seek injunctive or other appropriate relief in any court of competent jurisdiction.
or (2) any dispute may, at the option of the claiming party, be resolved in small claims court in Santa Clara County, California, provided that all claims by all parties in the dispute (i) fall within the jurisdiction of the small claims court, and (ii) were unsuccessfully resolved through the Informal Resolution procedure required in section 25(c) below.
Furthermore, in no event will the terms of this section limit Pandora's ability to investigate complaints or reported violations of this Agreement, or to take any action we deem necessary and appropriate to mitigate actions against us, including reporting any suspected unlawful activity to law enforcement officials, regulators, or other third parties such as music rightsholders.

If you have any dispute with us or any related third party, arising out of, relating to, or connected with this Agreement or the Services, you agree to contact us directly and provide a brief, written description of the dispute and your contact information (including your username, if your dispute relates to an account).
and give us thirty (30) days from the date of filing your written description with us within which to resolve the dispute to your reasonable satisfaction.
If Pandora does not resolve the dispute through good faith negotiations under this informal process, you may pursue the dispute in accordance with the arbitration agreement below.
(d) Arbitration Agreement.
Any claims by Pandora, or claims by you that are not resolved by the Informal Resolution procedure described in section 25(c) above, arising out of, relating to, or connected with this Agreement must be asserted individually in binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (including utilizing desk, phone, or video conference proceedings where appropriate and permitted to mitigate costs of travel).
This Agreement and each of its parts evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce, and the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C.
ÃÂ§ 1 et seq.) will apply in all cases and govern the interpretation and enforcement of the arbitration rules and arbitration proceedings.
Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
In addition to and notwithstanding the terms stated above, the following will apply to your disputes: (1) the arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Agreement including any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable.
(2) the arbitrator will not have the power to conduct any form of class or collective arbitration, nor join or consolidate claims by or for individuals.
and (3) you hereby irrevocably waive any right you may have to a court trial (other than small claims court as provided above) or to serve as a representative, as a private attorney general, or in any other representative capacity, or to participate as a member of a class of claimants, in any lawsuit, arbitration, or other proceeding against us or related third parties arising out of, relating to, or connected with this Agreement.
The arbitration proceeding and the results thereof will be kept confidential by each party and not used for any purpose other than a party exercising its rights and fulfilling its obligations with respect to the other party.
provided, however that either party may disclose the existence and results of the proceeding: (1) as required by law, rule, or regulation.

In the event such a provision cannot be modified and becomes invalidated or unenforceable, its invalidation or unenforceability will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement. 27.
