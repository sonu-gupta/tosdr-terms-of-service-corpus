 Privacy Policy  Last updated June 15th, 2020.

 This privacy policy applies to all the BrainPOP and its affiliates (âBrainPOPâ) owned and operated websites and mobile applications (which we collectively refer to as âServicesâ).
By accessing or using our Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

 Definitions  For purposes of this policy, we will use the following definitions: 

Personally identifiable information (PII) is information that can identify a user of the Services, including his or her e-mail, name, and address.
It also includes PII combined with non-PII.


De-identified information is information from which personally identifiable components have been removed and a reasonable determination made that an individual is not identifiable.


Student Records are records that are directly related to a student and maintained by BrainPOP on behalf of a school or district subscriber.

 What Type of Information Do We Collect and Why? Education Product Subscribers: 
Information collected during the subscription process: During the registration process for any of our subscriptions, we ask the subscriber to provide us with a name, email address, school or district affiliation (when applicable), phone number, and billing information.
We may also ask you to provide username and password.
We use the information to create and service the account, fulfill the subscription and send you service-related announcements.
For instance, we may send emails about routine maintenance, new feature launches or product recommendations related to your subscription.
We may also use this contact information to request feedback on our products and services, to inform future customer service and product improvements.
If you are registering for a free trial, we will use the information to create a free trial account and to send occasional promotional emails and other marketing campaigns.
You may opt out of promotional email messaging at any time as described in the Opt Out section below.

 BrainPOP at Schools:  Whether engaging with BrainPOP through a free trial or a paid subscription, schools or districts are required to appoint an administrator (âAdministratorâ), who is authorized by the school or the district to be responsible for the Students Records.

 Each school or district Administrator has access to a dashboard that allows them to create, update, review, modify and delete individual accounts, and monitor logins within the individual accounts.

 To create the teacher accounts, we require a full name, email address, class name, and a password security question.
We also use the email address to send product updates and use recommendations, password recovery information, effectiveness and efficacy data, invitations to participate in surveys and research and more (messaging may not be available in all jurisdictions).
An unsubscribe option is included in promotional messaging.

 If a school or district uses and accesses individual accounts through any of the single sign on services that we support, we collect the information we use for the individual accounts function from the third party integrated service.

 Students:  Students accounts can be created by the school, the district, or by the teachers, or the teacher can invite the students to create the accounts using a class code provided by the teacher.
We collect studentsâ full name, class, graduation year/grade, username, password and security question(s).
Students will be able to store their activities, quizzes, movies and other projects theyâve created and correspondences with their teachers within their individual accounts.
We collect studentâs voice-recording if they use the recording feature in Make-a-MovieÂ®.
Students cannot interact with other users outside their school or classroom subscription.
Studentsâ PII is not posted publicly.

 BrainPOP at Home:  To create a family subscription for home use, parents or legal guardians are asked to provide their full name, email address and other minimally required personal information.

 For family subscriptions that permit individual accounts, we also ask parents or guardians for their childrenâs name (first or full name, depending on product), graduation year/grade, username, password and security question(s), an avatar image, when applicable.
We use this information to create the individual child accounts.
Some of the family subscriptions allow children to store their activities, quizzes, movies and other projects they created, and badges or goals they have achieved, and the Homeschool subscription allows for children to correspond with the parent/guardian within the Services.
Children cannot interact with other users outside their family or homeschool subscription.
Children PII is not posted publicly.

 Parents or guardians subscribing to the family products will receive occasional emails with information about usage of the accounts, new features, product use recommendations, effectiveness and efficacy testing, backup schedules, survey and research participation invitation and more.
An opt-out will be included at the bottom of promotional messaging.

 Children under Age 13:  In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), BrainPOP does not collect personally identifiable information from children under 13, without a parent or guardian's consent, or that of a school if applicable.
Parents and guardians of children under 13 who use any of the BrainPOP products have certain rights under COPPA and BrainPOP recognizes those rights.
At any time, parents/guardians using a home product may request to review the personal information we collected from their child, request that we make no further use of that information or request that we delete it.
To exercise your right to delete information, please use the contact information below.
Parents/guardians of children using BrainPOP through a school account should contact their school to exercise their rights and we will work with the parent/guardian and school together to facilitate those requests.

 A child's participation or access to an activity on BrainPOP cannot be conditioned on him or her providing more personal information than is reasonably necessary for that activity.

 Connecting with BrainPOP: 
Contact information for newsletter and surveys: On BrainPOP EducatorsÂ®, and other adult-facing pages of our Services, including pages that do not require log in, adult users may choose to sign up for newsletters, promotional offerings, or participation in surveys, all of which require contact information.
The submitted contact information will be used for promotional purposes, and you may opt-out at any time.
An opt-out link or instructions on how to opt-out will be included at the bottom of such messages.
Registration for newsletters, promotional offerings, and surveys participation are not intended for minors.


Information we collect when you contact us: When you send us messages through our system or by email or through other online platforms, we collect the information you provide, including your message and any contact information you include.
We use and retain such information to respond to your request, facilitate support to you in the future and to optimize our support services.
We will respond once to messages from children under age 13 and then we delete those messages and any personally identifiable information contained in them.


Feedback: Certain features we offer include an option to provide us with feedback.
The feedback feature does not identify the user submitting it.
If we receive personally identifiable information through a feedback form we take steps to immediately delete that information.
We reserve the right to use feedback for any purpose with no obligation to you.


Applying for a job: all resumes submitted by applicants through our website are submitted through BambooHR.
We will only use the information for the application process.

 Information Collected Automatically  We automatically receive and record information on our server logs from a userâs browser.
This may include the IP address, pages of BrainPOP visited, the time spent on those pages, and access times and dates.
We use this information to better display our Services, maintain a userâs session, identify the country the user is located in, monitor, analyze use of and administer BrainPOP, and to better tailor it to your needs.
We may also use this information to serve advertising to adult users.

 To collect this information, we use technological tools including: 

Cookies. A cookie is a small data file sent from a website or application and stored on your computer or device.
Cookies allow us to recognize your browser when you return to BrainPOP, remember your login information, enable access to paid content and monitor potential account misuse.
Cookies also allow us to better understand how you interact with BrainPOP and to monitor aggregated usage.
You can set your browser to detect some cookies, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie.
Disabling our cookies will prevent access to paid content and limit some of the functionalities within our Services.
To learn more about browser cookies, including how to manage or delete them, look in the Tools, Help or similar section of your web browser, or visit allaboutcookies.org.


Pixel Tags. A pixel tag (also known as a âclear GIFâ or âweb beaconâ) is a tiny image â typically just one-pixel â that we place in our marketing emails, newsletters, promotional offerings and surveys.
We use pixel tags and line tracking to analyze the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.

 We use Google Analytics to assist us in collecting and assessing automatically collected information.
For more information about Google Analytics, see Google Analytics Terms of Service and the Google Privacy Policy.
You can prevent Google Analytics from collecting information about you and recognizing you on return visits to our Services by disabling cookies on your browser or by installing the Google Analytics opt-out plug in.
Note that we are not responsible for Googleâs opt-out tools.

 By using our Services, you agree to our use of these tracking technologies.

 We do not track users across unaffiliated sites and services, however, when you use the Internet, unaffiliated parties such as ad networks, web analytics companies and social networking platforms may collect information about your online activities over time and across our and other websites.
This information may be used to provide advertisements for products and services that may interest you, and those companies may use cookies, clear GIFs and other tracking technologies.

 In addition, we and our third party partners may use tracking technologies to deliver targeted advertisements and marketing messages to adult users on our or unaffiliated websites and online services.
We also occasionally source information about groups of adults to generate a "lookalike audience" or similar audience of prospective customers through advertising platforms.
This allows us to target prospective customers with advertisements on their networks who appear to have shared interests or similar demographics to our existing customers, based on the platforms' own data.
We do not have access to the identity of anybody in the lookalike audience, unless they choose to click on the ads, and this information is only used for customer prospecting.

 To learn about interest-based advertising, âlookalike audiencesâ and how you can opt-out of these features, you may wish to visit the Network Advertising Initiativeâs online resources, at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices, and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) resources at http://www.aboutads.info/choices.
Note that if you wish to opt out, you will need to do so separately for each of your devices and for each web browser you use.
You may also manage certain advertising cookies by visiting the EU-based Your Online Choices at http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/.
You may also be able to limit interest-based advertising through the settings on your mobile device by selecting âlimit ad trackingâ (iOS) or âopt-out of interest based adsâ (Android).
You may also be able to opt-out of some â but not all â interest-based ads served by mobile ad networks by visiting http://youradchoices.com/appchoices and downloading the mobile AppChoices app.

 We also subscribe to various third partiesâ education market information and databases, for example databases of school contacts.
We use this data to learn about the industry we serve, to improve our services and for direct marketing.
Some third-parties may provide us pseudonymized information about you (such as demographic information or sites where you have been shown ads) from offline and online sources that we may use to provide you more relevant and useful advertising.


Push notifications on mobile apps: Our adult users have the option to accept push notifications.
If push notifications are accepted, we will store your previously provided name and email address in the push notification token.
If you choose to receive push notifications, we will need to collect certain information about your device - such as operating system and user identification information - in order to ensure they are delivered properly.
We also collect the user time zone, which is set on the device, to ensure that we send notifications at an appropriate time of the day.
We do not combine this information with other PII.
You may turn push notifications off at any time using your device controls.

 How Long We Retain Personal Information:  Districts, schools and homeschools are able to delete student personally identifiable information at any time and in real time using the Administrator dashboard as mentioned above.
Once that information is deleted, it is deleted from our servers â first from our servers and then, after two weeks later, from any back-up server.
If information was not deleted by the school or the district before the subscription expired, we retain such information for a limited period of two years after expiration.

 Student classroom accounts and the student identifiable information within them are automatically deleted after two years of inactivity - first from our server and then, two weeks later, from any back-up server.
At that point it cannot be restored.

 If your jurisdiction requires the deletion of student data within a shorter time period, or upon immediate termination of the subscription, you are required to delete such data using the Administrator dashboard as mentioned above or contact us for assistance at legal@brainpop.com.

 Districts and schools may request copies of their student personal information (which includes an CSV template file of names, classes and quiz scores), which shall be provided within four (4) weeks of the written request.

 Individual accounts created on the BrainPOP Home subscription will automatically be deleted after three (3) months after the expiration of the subscription.

 We will retain, use and share anonymous or aggregate and de-identified information for lawfully permissible purposes, including developing and improving educational products and services, educational research purposes, evaluating, informing and demonstrating the effectiveness and efficacy of our products and services.

 How We Share Your Information  We may provide Personally Identifiable Information to our partners, business affiliates, and third party service providers who work for BrainPOP and operate some of its functionalities.
These may include hosting, streaming, credit card processing services and companies that provide marketing emails on our behalf.
A current list of these third parties service providers is available to our subscribers upon request through privacy@brainpop.com.
These third parties service providers are bound contractually to practice commercially reasonable security measures and to use your Personally Identifiable Information solely as it pertains to the provision of their services.
They do not have the independent right to share your Personally Identifiable Information or use it for any unrelated purposes.

 We reserve the right to disclose personally identifiable information if we are required to do so by law, or if we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or others' safety, investigate fraud, and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, subpoena, or legal process.

 We also reserve the right to transfer your Personally Identifiable Information in case of a corporate restructuring (such as a merger, acquisition or other disposition of our business), as long as the receiving entity adopts this Privacy Policy regarding your information.

 We may share teachersâ, administratorsâ and parentsâ email addresses collected when registering to free trials with third parties business partners for marketing purposes when the individual has opted in to receive such communication.
You may opt out of promotional messaging at any time as described in the Opt Out section below.

 Security  We strive to maintain security policies and procedures that are designed to protect your information.

 Our servers are located in a secured, locked, and monitored environment to prevent unauthorized entry or theft, and are protected by a firewall.
The servers are located in a data center in the United States and backed up daily to a secure, U.S.-based, off-site data center.

 We apply a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL or HTTPS) encrypting technology to encrypt data in transit between the server and the browser remains encrypted.
We also encrypt the data at rest.

 Governance policies and access controls are in place to ensure that the information of each district, school, or other subscriber is separated, and all subscribers can only access their own data.

 Only limited BrainPOP personnel have access to the database, and personnel only access it when necessary to provide services.
Personnel with access to Student Records pass criminal background checks and undergo periodic privacy training.

 We follow standardized and documented procedures for coding, configuration management, patch installation, and change management for all applicable servers, and we have a third party audit our practices at least once a year.

 While we strive to maintain industry-standard privacy and security practices, it should be noted that no industry system is fail proof, and we are not responsible for security incidents not reasonably foreseeable or reasonably within our control.
In the event of unauthorized access to Personally Identifiable Information, we will notify the affected subscriber(s) in accordance with applicable law, and as appropriate, coordinate with the subscriber to support notification of affected individuals, students, and families.

 Links to Third Party Sites  While using our Services, you may be referred to or linked from or to third party sites, such as educational partners whose games are included on our GameUpÂ® portal.
While we contractually require our third parties partners to adhere to our privacy policies, you should keep in mind that once you leave BrainPOP and visit a third party site, our privacy policy is no longer in effect.
We are not responsible for information, content, terms of use, or privacy policies on these other sites.
By browsing and interacting with any other website, you are subject to that website's own rules and policies.
Please read those rules and policies carefully before proceeding.
