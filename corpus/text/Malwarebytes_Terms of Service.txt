         Malwarebytes Website Terms of Service  Last Updated: January 19, 2017 
 Welcome to the Malwarebytes Inc.
("Malwarebytes") website, malwarebytes.com (the "Site").
Please read these Terms of Service (the "Terms") carefully because they govern your use of our Site (and its subdomains) and related services accessible via our Site, excluding (i) the online store made available via the Site which is governed by separate Terms and Conditions, accessible at https://store.malwarebytes.com/342/?scope=optandc .
(ii) the purchase and use of our Malwarebytes Software which is governed by the separate End User License Agreement, accessible at https://www.malwarebytes.com/eula .
(iii) the Malwarebytes Privacy Policy accessible at https://www.malwarebytes.com/privacy/ , and (iv) other separate written terms and conditions or policies governing specific Malwarebytes products or services (collectively (i)-(iv) the "Excluded Terms").
If there is a conflict between these Terms and the Excluded Terms, the Excluded Terms shall govern.
To make these Terms easier to read, the Site and our services are collectively called the "Services." 

Agreement to Terms

 By using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
If you don't agree to these Terms, do not use the Services.
If you are accessing and using the Services on behalf of a company (such as your employer) or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to these Terms.
In that case, "you" and "your" will refer to that company or other legal entity.


Changes to Terms or Services

 We may modify the Terms at any time, at our sole discretion.
If we do so, we'll let you know either by posting the modified Terms on the Site or through other communications.
It's important that you review the Terms from time to time because if you continue to use the Services after we have posted modified Terms on the Site, you are indicating to us that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms.
If you don't agree to be bound by the modified Terms, then you can't use the Services anymore.
Because our Services evolve over time we may change, suspend or discontinue all or any part of the Services, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.
