The links to social media platforms are integrated in such a way that data is not automatically transmitted to the operator of the social media platform.

Games

We make online games from various partners available to customers via https://games.mail.com.
End customers can register with the respective cooperation partners and play the games free of charge.
The customer is redirected to the partner's page (games open in a new tab or browser window).
During the registration process, the customer must agree to the terms and conditions and data protection declarations of the respective partner.
This takes place exclusively on the side of the respective partner.
In the case of games without registration, the partner's data protection provisions and terms and conditions are displayed directly when the partner page is called up.
By registering with one of the cooperation partners, the end customer enters into a contractual relationship exclusively with this external partner.
In order to be able to present you the online games offer of our partners, pseudonymized usage data is collected.
However, these do not allow any conclusions to be drawn about your person, they only give us information about whether our users were able to find their way around our website or what could be improved.
