At OSable, the privacy of our users is of paramount concern in a world where personal data is being sold to advertisers on a regular basis and targeted advertising is common-place.
We do not operate with this business model.
We instead operate on the model that relies on donations from our satisfied users of our tool

(N.B.
We do not currently accept 'donations' but this is being developed at the moment).

We are a community project, so we feel this is the most ethical method we could utilise.
Consider this our promise.
