Badgr is an online platform to create, curate, issue, receive, explore, and share micro-credentials (âBadgesâ).
Badgr allows organizations to access tools to issue Badges to Badge Recipients as well as various related administrative tools and services, and it allows individuals to receive Badges as an indicator of accomplishment or skill (e.g.
successful completion of a degree or a continuing education course).

If you are a Badge recipient or just visiting our Site, the Badgr Terms of Service is the master contract that governs your use of Badgr as a Badge recipient or when visiting our Site.
If you are accessing Badgr on behalf of an organization with a business account, the Badgr Terms of Service is the master contract that governs your use of Badgr and access to the Site unless your organization has a master agreement with us.
An organization with a business account might, for example, access Badgr to issue Badges via the web interface, facilitate a Badge transfer on behalf of one or more badge recipients (e.g.
a clearinghouse) or to access the Badgr API to enable automated Badge issuance.
If your organization has a master agreement with us, these Badgr Terms of Service are incorporated into and made a part of that master agreement and they apply to your access to the Site and use of Badgr.
In all cases, your access and use of the Site is subject to the terms and conditions set out below in these Badgr Terms of Service and the other documents listed below (collectively, âTermsâ).
The Terms consist of the following documents:

Badgr Terms of Service.
These contain the core legal and commercial terms that apply to your use of Badgr.
Where there is a master agreement in place, however, the master agreement will control.
Badgr Privacy Policy.
This policy describes how we collect, manage, use, store, and share data in our capacity as a controller, including when you are just visiting our Site, you are only accessing Badgr to receive Badges, or you contact us for Badgr services pricing or other information and your organization does not yet have a business account.

This explains how we process data, including in compliance with European Data Protection Laws (defined in the DPA) and the California Consumer Privacy act of 2018 (CCPA), where applicable.

TERMS OF SERVICE
1.
THE BADGR SERVICE.

1.1 Description. Badgr is an online platform to create, curate, issue, receive, explore, and share Badges.
Users can access tools to issue Badges to learners and other persons eligible to receive a Badge (each a âBadge Recipientâ), as well as associated administrative tools and services.
Badge Recipients and other individuals eligible to receive a Badge can utilize Badgr to receive, organize and display Badges).
Badgr also includes features that integrate with products and services offered by third parties to facilitate the micro-credentialing process and the sharing of Badges.
For example, the Badgr Pathways tool allows users to interact with Badges from other Open Badge Specification compliant platforms.

1.2 Open Badges.


a. Badges are based on the Open Badge Specification developed through the work of IMS Global Learning Consortium, Inc.
(âIMS Globalâ) and its members, including CSky.
CSky expects all users to respect the Open Badge Specification.
CSky plays no role in determining the value or veracity of a Badge, and CSky does not endorse or vouch for the qualifications of any Badge Recipient.
The issuer of a Badge is solely responsible for determining the value and veracity of each Badge and the qualifications of each prospective Badge Recipient.

b. In 2020 IMS Global launched the Badge Connectâ¢ API open standard, an initiative that was developed in partnership with its members, including CSky.
As a supporter of the Badge Connect standard, CSky allows third parties to send Badges between Badgr and third-party services on behalf of Badge Recipients.
The third party accessing Badgr for such purposes is solely responsible for obtaining the Badge Recipientâs consent in advance of accessing Badgr for such purposes and for ensuring it shares the Badge Recipientâs Badges only with third-party services the Badge Recipient has expressly authorized.
Any third party accessing Badgr to facilitate Badge sharing must have a Business Account.

c. When a Badge is issued by the owner of a Business Account, pursuant to the Open Badge Specifications, Badgr creates a publicly available webpage for the Badge.
This means the Badge and the associated Badge meta-data automatically becomes publicly available information upon issuance.
In addition, once a Badge is issued, that Badge becomes sharable at the discretion of the Badge Recipient.
Notwithstanding this change in status, an issuer of a Badge always has the ability to correct Badge information or delete a Badge through its Business Account.

1.3 Eligibility. You may only access and use Badgr if you can form a binding contract with CSky and only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable laws.
You must be 13 years old or older to use Badgr.

1.4 Changes to Badgr. We reserve the right to modify or discontinue Badgr (or any part or feature thereof) with or without notice.
For example, we may change Badgrâs pricing at any time or add new fees and charges from time to time, but will provide notice to you of these changes via information on the Site.
You acknowledge that CSky may establish general practices and limits concerning use of Badgr, including, without limitation, the maximum period of time that data or other content will be retained on our servers.
CSky shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of Badgr.

1.5 Prohibited Uses. Except for access to facilitate Badge sharing under the Badge Connectâ¢ API open standard as described in Section 1.2.b.
above or where you have otherwise received express permission from CSky, you are at all times prohibited from accessing or otherwise using the Site: (a) to build a competitive product or service or (b) in conjunction with any other services that you sell or otherwise monetize.
