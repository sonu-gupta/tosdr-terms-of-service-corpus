For the purposes of this Section, âDisputeâ shall mean any dispute, claim, or action between you and Hitnamer.com :(-): arising under or relating to any Hitnamer.com :(-): Services or Products, Hitnamer.com :(-):âs websites, these Terms, or any other transaction involving you and Hitnamer.com :(-):, whether in contract, warranty, misrepresentation, fraud, tort, intentional tort, statute, regulation, ordinance, or any other legal or equitable basis, and shall be interpreted to be given the broadest meaning allowable under law.
YOU AND Hitnamer.com :(-): AGREE THAT âDISPUTEâ AS DEFINED IN THESE TERMS SHALL NOT INCLUDE ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BY YOU OR Hitnamer.com :(-): FOR (i) TRADE SECRET MISAPPROPRIATION, (ii) PATENT INFRINGEMENT, (iii) COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT OR MISUSE, AND (iv) TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT OR DILUTION.

(B) Binding Arbitration. You and Hitnamer.com :(-): further agree: (i) to arbitrate all Disputes between the parties pursuant to the provisions in these Terms.
(ii) these Terms memorialize a transaction in interstate commerce.
(iii) the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C.

and (iv) this Section shall survive termination of these Terms.
ARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JUDGE OR JURY IN A COURT PROCEEDING AND YOUR GROUNDS FOR APPEAL ARE LIMITED.
The arbitrator may award you the same damages as a court sitting in proper jurisdiction, as limited by the Limitation of Liability set forth in Section 19 of this Agreement and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that partyâs individual claim.
In addition, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.
The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and enforceable by any court with jurisdiction over the parties.

The Dispute Notice to you will be sent by certified mail to the most recent address we have on file or otherwise in our records for you.
If Hitnamer.com :(-): and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the Dispute within sixty (60) days after the Dispute Notice is received, you or Hitnamer.com :(-): may commence an arbitration proceeding pursuant to this Section.
Following submission and receipt of the Dispute Notice, each of us agrees to act in good faith to seek to resolve the Dispute before commencing arbitration.



(E) WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS AND CLASS ARBITRATIONS. YOU AND Hitnamer.com :(-): AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING DISPUTES AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FEDERAL OR STATE CLASS ACTIONS, OR CLASS ARBITRATIONS.
NEITHER YOU NOR Hitnamer.com :(-): WILL SEEK TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD AS A CLASS ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR IN ANY OTHER PROCEEDING IN WHICH EITHER PARTY ACTS OR PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY.
NO ARBITRATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING WILL BE COMBINED WITH ANOTHER WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES TO ALL AFFECTED ARBITRATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS.


(F) Arbitration Procedure. If a party elects to commence arbitration, the arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ) and governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the AAA (âAAA Rulesâ) in conjunction with the rules set forth in these Terms, except that AAA may not administer any multiple claimant or class arbitration, as the parties agree that the arbitration shall be limited to the resolution only of individual claims.
The AAA Rules are at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
If there is a conflict between the AAA Rules and the rules set forth in these Terms, the rules set forth in these Terms shall govern.
You may, in arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise available to you pursuant to federal, state, or local laws, as limited by the Limitation of Liability set forth in Section 19 of this Agreement.
All Disputes shall be resolved by a single neutral arbitrator, and both parties shall have a reasonable opportunity to participate in the selection of the arbitrator.
The arbitrator is bound by these Terms.
The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Terms is void or voidable.
The arbitrator shall also have exclusive authority to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope, or validity of the arbitration agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.
Notwithstanding this broad delegation of authority to the arbitrator, a court may determine the limited question of whether a claim or cause of action is for (i) trade secret misappropriation, (ii) patent infringement, (iii) copyright infringement or misuse, or (iv) trademark infringement or dilution, which are excluded from the definition of âDisputesâ as stated above.
The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.
The arbitratorâs award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
You may choose to engage in arbitration hearings by telephone.
Arbitration hearings not conducted by telephone shall take place in a location reasonably accessible from your primary residence (or principal place of business if you are a small business), or in Maricopa County, Arizona, at your option.


(G) Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding. If either you or Hitnamer.com :(-): decide to arbitrate a Dispute, we agree to the following procedure:
i.
Write a Demand for Arbitration.
The demand must include a description of the Dispute and the amount of damages sought to be recovered.
You can find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.adr.org (âDemand for Arbitration: Consumer Arbitration Rulesâ).
ii.
Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to AAA by mail at American Arbitration Association Case Filing Services 1101 Laurel Oak Road, Suite 100 Voorhees, NJ 08043.

iii.
Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the other party at the same address as the Dispute Notice, or as otherwise agreed to by the parties.



(H) Hearing Format. In all hearing formats, the arbitrator shall issue a written decision that explains the essential findings and conclusions on which an award, if any, is based.
During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Hitnamer.com :(-): or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Hitnamer.com :(-): is entitled.
The discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute may be allowed during the arbitration.



(I) Arbitration Fees and Payments.

i.
Disputes involving $75,000.00 or less.
Hitnamer.com :(-): will promptly reimburse your filing fees and pay the AAAâs and arbitratorâs fees and expenses.
If you reject Hitnamer.com :(-):âs last written settlement offer made before the arbitrator was appointed (âHitnamer.com :(-):âs last written offerâ), your dispute goes all the way to an arbitratorâs decision (called an âawardâ), and the arbitrator awards you more than Hitnamer.com :(-):âs last written offer, Hitnamer.com :(-): will: (i) pay the greater of the award or $1,000.00.
(ii) pay twice your reasonable attorneyâs fees, if any.
and (iii) reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration.
The arbitrator will determine the amount of fees, costs, and expenses unless you and Hitnamer.com :(-): agree on them.
ii.
Disputes involving more than $75,000.00.
The AAA rules will govern payment of filing fees and the AAAâs and arbitratorâs fees and expenses.
iii.
Disputes involving any amount.
In any arbitration you commence, Hitnamer.com :(-): will seek its AAA or arbitratorâs fees and expenses, or your filing fees it reimbursed, only if the arbitrator finds the arbitration frivolous or brought for an improper purpose.
In any arbitration Hitnamer.com :(-): commences, Hitnamer.com :(-): will pay all filing, AAA, and arbitratorâs fees and expenses.
Hitnamer.com :(-): will not seek its attorneyâs fees or expenses from you in any arbitration.
