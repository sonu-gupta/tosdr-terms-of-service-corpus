Community Leaders can use Community to message with the individuals who have signed up to receive their messages (âCommunity Membersâ). 
Please also read our

Terms of Service (âTermsâ), which describe the terms under which you use Community.Our collection of informationWe collect the following when you use Community:

You may have the option to provide other information as well, such as your email address.
We refer to all of this as âcontact info.â 
If you start a conversation with a Community Leader by sending a text message to their Community Number, we collect your phone number along with the contents of the text message, so we wonât need to ask you for it.
If you later start a conversation with another Community Leader by sending a text message to their Community Number, we wonât need to ask you again for your contact info.
If you start a conversation with a Community Leader from a supported website or Internet-based messaging service, the required contact info and signup process may vary.

We require your email address, and you may have the option to provide email addresses for additional authorized users for your account.

Messaging info

When you send or reply to messages via Community, we collect your messages, along with message-related information (such as the phone number from which the message was sent, when the message was sent, and whether the message includes a particular word, phrase, or emoji).
When you interact with messages sent via Community, we collect information about those interactions.
We refer to all of this as âmessaging info.â 
Keep in mind that anyone who receives your messages via Community can save a copy and share your messages with others.
This includes any personal information you send in a message (for example, your address), so be careful with what you choose to share.
