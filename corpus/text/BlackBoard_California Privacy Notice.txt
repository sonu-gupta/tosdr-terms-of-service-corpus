Our Commitment to Privacy



We care about privacy.
We believe that privacy is a fundamental right for all individuals.
Our clients entrust us with the personal information of their employees and their users, who are often students.
We take the obligations that are attached to this information very seriously.
We therefore have a dedicated data privacy program with privacy by design at heart.
You can learn more about our data privacy program by visiting our Privacy Center. Scope of Notice



This California Privacy Notice (the âNoticeâ) supplements the information in our Privacy Statement and applies only to individual residents of the State of California (âconsumersâ or âyouâ).
This CA Notice describes how we (as a âbusinessâ) collect, use, disclose, and otherwise process personal information of individual residents of the State of California, either online or offline, within the scope of the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA).
Where we provide our products and services to consumers on behalf of our clients, we are considered a âservice providerâ under CCPA.
In this case, the clientâs privacy notice governs the use of personal information.
For example, when we process Student Data on behalf of our client institution, we are acting as a service provider and we retain, use and disclose the Student Data in accordance with our written agreement with the client.
Accordingly, this Notice only reflects how we collect, use, disclose, and otherwise process personal information for our own purposes (e.g., for our websites and marketing).
For the purposes of this Notice, personal information does not include:


Publicly available information from government records.


Deidentified, aggregated or anonymized information that is maintained in a form that is not capable of being associated with or linked to you.


Information relating to our employees, contractors and other personnel (which is governed by a separate privacy notice)


When we use terms that are defined in the CCPA, they have the same meaning as in the CCPA. Collection, Use and Disclosure of Personal Information
