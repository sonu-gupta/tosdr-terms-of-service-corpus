 Houseparty Privacy Policy Last Updated: July 22nd, 2020
The Houseparty Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand the information we collect and the different ways we may use or share it.
This policy applies to your use of Houseparty.
By âHouseparty,â we mean the Houseparty website, browser extension, mobile app, and any other of our products and services that directly link to this policy.
And who are we? Weâre Life on Air, Inc., a subsidiary of Epic Games.
To learn more about privacy at Houseparty, please keep reading below! If youâd like to read more about privacy at Epic Games, be sure to check out the Epic Games Privacy Policy here. What Information We Collect You probably wonder what information we collect.
This often depends on the exact nature of our relationship with you and how you choose to use Houseparty, but weâve described the most common examples below.
We have broken these descriptions down into categories to make them clearer:

We collect account information. We collect information relating to your account.
For example, we collect basic registration details like name, email address, birthday, and username and password when you create a Houseparty account.
You may be able to share other account-related information with us too, like if you choose to provide a profile photo or telephone number.
We collect some information about your friends when you invite or refer them to Houseparty or import your contacts.

We collect usage information. We collect information about your interactions with and on Houseparty.
For example, we collect information about how long you chat with your friends.
If you purchase items, we collect information about what you purchase.

Houseparty uses this info to make the product better for you so you can focus on being present with your friends.
We want to do the heavy lifting, utilizing tech to improve the experience.


We collect certain information when you link third party accounts or apps to Houseparty. If you link social media accounts to Houseparty, we collect certain social media account information.
If you link your contacts we collect information about your friends, like their phone numbers and addresses.

We collect location information. For example, we may collect your zip code and state.
Based on your IP address, we also derive location information.

We collect feedback information. We collect information that you give us when you complete a survey or participate in a contest or promotion.
This includes when you write a review or make a suggestion.

We collect device information. We collect information about the browser or device you are using.
We may look at what site you came from, or what site you visit when you leave us.
We may also collect device identifiers.
For example, this might include your operating system and hardware model.
This may also include your mobile carrier. Why We Collect Information Now that you know what we collect, we want to tell you why and what we do with that information.
Below we explain how we use information:

We use some information to communicate with you. We use information to respond to your questions, including questions about our services or your relationship with us, and to communicate with you about this policy or our Terms.
We may also contact you about your feedback.

We just want to be able to be responsive to you, and occasionally reach out to hear how itâs going on Houseparty, and make sure you have updates on whatâs going on with us!


We use some information so you can participate in Houseparty and to enhance your experience. We use information to process your registration and to empower you to use certain features.
With your permission where required by law, for example, we use information to suggest other users with whom you may want to connect.
We also use information so you can invite new people to join Houseparty and to provide or suggest specific features.

We help you find friends and make connections.
For example, we might suggest a connection to you based on your friends on who could be a good addition to the party.


We use some information to improve our products. We use information to make Houseparty better, for example by saving certain preferences you choose, tracking events in Houseparty, and recording other performance data.
We use this information to customize your experience, analyze product trends, and to develop and improve our products.

We use some information for marketing purposes. We use your information to share updates about new products and special offers, including promotions, surveys, and contests, through email, on our app, or on social media platforms.
We might also use this information to tell you about products and offers, new features, or updates.
These might be our own offers or products or select third-party offers or products we think you might find interesting.

We use information to protect our company and users. We use information to protect our company and users, for example to identify fraud and secure, protect accounts, and protect Houseparty.
This includes looking into potentially prohibited or illegal activity.

We may also use push notifications in our mobile apps. We may send you push notifications about updates and other information we think you will find interesting, for example to let you know when a friend is online.

Our basis for processing European information. Our basis for processing your information for the reasons described above is typically to perform a contract, including responding to your requests.
For example, this includes providing customer service.
Where this applies, if you choose not to provide information, we may be unable to perform the contract or respond to your request.
We also process information based on your consent.
Where you have provided consent, you have the right to withdraw it.
We also use information about you when we have a legitimate purpose in doing so.
For example, this includes helping secure and improve Houseparty.

We also use information as otherwise permitted by law.
 How We Collect Information Like many other companies, there are different ways that we collect information, which weâve outlined below:

We collect information directly from you. You might provide us information in several ways.
For example, we collect information when you create an account, contact us, or participate in a survey.

We collect information passively. We use tracking tools to collect information from you passively.
These tools include things like browser cookies and web beacons.
We use these on our sites and in emails that we send to you.
We collect this information about users over time when you download and use our app.

The information we gather helps us give you the best experience on Houseparty.


We get information about you from third parties. Social media platforms and third-party apps may give us information about you.
We may also collect information about you from other users.
This might include your name, phone number, or email address if they invite or refer you to our app or if they have linked their contacts to their Houseparty account.

What social platforms are we talking about? We might get information, for example, from Snapchat or Facebook if you choose to link your Houseparty account with these third-party platforms.
Information they share with us includes certain details from your profile.


We combine information. Houseparty is an integrated social media platform, which means we may combine information that we have collected across devices, such as computers and mobile devices.
We may also combine information we get from a third party with information we already have and combine information that we have collected from other third-party sites. When We Share Information Houseparty is part of the digital community, and as part of our business there are times that we share information with third parties.
You can find out more about that here:

Sharing on Houseparty. Houseparty is designed to let you join video chats with not only your connections but also the connections of others.
If someone who is not your direct connection joins your video chat session you will get a notice.
Your public profile is available to both your connections and their connections.
Other users may also be able to view your name, username, and top Connections (i.e., who you speak to most often).
Connections can see when you were online last and a list of some of your other Connections, and receive a notice when you go online and are âin the house.â

Houseparty exists to help you connect with the people you care about most.When you connect with your friends, they can see some of the profile information youâve created on Houseparty.
Want to change things up? Read about modifying your controls in the âyour choicesâ section below.


We share information with our vendors. We may share information with trusted third parties, including companies who serve as our vendors and help us deliver our services and social media partners if you elect to use social media integration features.
We may also share some information with companies that help operate our app or run a promotion.

What can we say? We canât do it alone.
Sometimes we have to work with other companies to help us deliver a great Houseparty experience.
We are owned by Epic Games, this means that we might rely on them to help us out.


We will share information if we think we have to in order to comply with the law or to protect ourselves. For example, we will share information to respond to a court order or subpoena or if a U.S.
or non-U.S.
law enforcement agency, government agency, or investigatory body requests it.
We may also share information we collect when we investigate potential fraud, abuse, or other similar violations of Houseparty rules and codes of conduct.

We may share information with any successor to all or part of our business. If all or part of our business is sold, weâre part of a merger or acquisition, or there is a financing or bankruptcy, we may share information as part of that transaction.

We may also share information for other reasons we may describe to you or as permitted under law.
 Your Choices You have certain choices about how we use your information.
Those are described here:

You can opt out of certain marketing. To stop receiving our promotional emails or communications follow the instructions in any promotional message you get from us.
If you opt out of getting marketing messages, you will continue to receive non-marketing messages from us about your relationship with us where permitted by law.

You can control certain aspects of your interactions with others on Houseparty. Houseparty is meant to offer a fun way for people to interact with other people in ways similar to how you might in-person.
Any Connection of a participant in a video chat session may join an unlocked chat session, with or without an invite from you and whether or not you know him or her.
However, your settings do give you certain controls over your video conversations, chats, and Facemails.

We believe in respecting social norms.
If one of your friendsâ friends is about to join your Houseparty chat, youâll receive a notice that they are joining.
If you donât want friends of friends joining your party, you can âlockâ the conversation.
Anyone in the room can unlock the group session to allow more people to join, just like at a real house party.
You can learn more about this in our Party Guidelines in the app.
You can also choose âPrivate Modeâ to have your rooms always locked by default.


You can control certain notifications about being online. If you donât want your friends to know that youâve launched the app, then you can âSneak into the House.â This is a one-time selection.
You can also select online notification preferences for yourself and friends in your notification settings.
When you launch the app, youâre starting a party and others may be able to immediately join you unless you âlockâ the room.

You can control cookies and tracking tools. Your browser may give you the ability to control cookies or other tracking tools.
How you do so depends on the type of tool.
Certain browsers can be set to reject browser cookies.
To control flash cookies, which we may use on certain websites from time to time, you can go here.
Why? Because flash cookies cannot be controlled through your browser settings.

Our Do Not Track Policy: You may change your browser settings or take other steps to block, manage, or delete cookies.
Not all of our websites and online services currently respond to browser âdo not trackâ signals, so you will need to use your browser settings to effectively manage cookies.
In some cases, blocking or disabling cookies may cause Houseparty not to work as intended and some features may not be available.

You can control certain settings on your mobile device. For example, you can turn off the location services or push notifications on your phone.
To modify the push notifications you get from us, you can change your preferences in Houseparty settings.
You also can modify app level permissions, such as location collection, through your device settings.
The Digital Advertising Alliance also offers a tool for opting out of the collection of cross-app data on a mobile device for interest-based advertising.
To exercise choice for companies participating in this tool, download the AppChoices app here.
Choices you make are both browser and device specific. You May Have Certain Additional Rights In some places laws grant residents certain additional rights.

The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action will be the state and federal courts located in the Northern District of California and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.
Unless you timely provide Life On Air with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice (as defined below in the Section titled âYour Choicesâ), you acknowledge and agree that you and Life On Air are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding.
Further, unless both you and Life On Air otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one personâs claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.
If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this âDispute Resolutionâ section will be deemed void.
Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this âDispute Resolutionâ section will survive any termination of these Terms. Arbitration Rules The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the âAAA Rulesâ) then in effect, except as modified by this âDispute Resolutionâ section.
(The AAA Rules are available at https://www.adr.org/mediation or by calling the AAA at 1â800â778â7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section. Arbitration Process A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules.
(The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAAâs roster of arbitrators.
If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules. Arbitration Location and Procedure Unless you and Life On Air otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.
If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and Life On Air submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary.
If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. Arbitratorâs Decision The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules.
The arbitratorâs decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award.
Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
The arbitratorâs award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the âLimitation of Liabilityâ section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable.
The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimantâs individual claim.
If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneysâ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law.
Life On Air will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneysâ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration. Fees Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules.
However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Life On Air will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
