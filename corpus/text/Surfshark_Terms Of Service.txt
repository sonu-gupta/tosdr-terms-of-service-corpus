You should still read the whole thing since this is only a comment and the Terms are the binding document youâre agreeing to if you have a Surfshark account.
But weâre not judging.
Thank you for visiting Surfshark! Please read the following information carefully.
PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE PROVISIONS COVERING AUTOMATIC RENEWAL OF SERVICES AND CHANGE OF THESE TERMS OF SERVICE.
These Terms of Service govern your access to and use of all Surfshark Services.
This is a binding agreement.
IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS OF SERVICE, DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE WEBSITE OR OUR SERVICES.
BY ACCESSING OR USING THE WEBSITE AND OUR SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF SERVICE.
We may change these Terms of Service from time to time.
We will post a notice on the Surfshark Site any time these Terms of Service have been amended or updated.
It is your responsibility to review these Terms of Service periodically, and if at any time you find these Terms of Service unacceptable, you must immediately leave the Surfshark Site and cease all use of our Services.
When you agree to use our Services, which includes, but is not limited to: the use of our servers, routers, IP addresses, protocols, add-ons, software, applications, extensions, and other equipment, as well as any updates thereof, you agree to accept these Terms.1.
What services does Surfshark provide?A VPN, plus a bunch of other services that all have to do with privacy and security.
Surfshark provides virtual private network (VPN) services, also other privacy and cyber security related services (âServicesâ).
Services include, but are not limited to VPN and other software, extensions, applications, information and content made available to you by Surfshark.
A VPN is a secure way to protect your online activities by encrypting your data connection.
Thus, third parties are unable to monitor your network traffic, such as websites, downloaded files, or other used internet services.
With Surfshark you can connect to different VPN servers worldwide to ensure the privacy of your location.
We donât collect logs or any other information thatâd let us identify you.
The only things we do collect are strictly necessary to provide you with our services.
You can find more details about that in the Privacy Policy.

No-logs Policy is one of the most important features of our Services.
It means your activities are not in any way logged, retained, or transferred to third parties when you connect to our Services.
We do not collect any information about what you do online (your visited IP addresses, browsing history, session information, used bandwidth, connection time stamps, network traffic or any other similar data).
We can ensure such policy as we are based in the jurisdiction, which does not require data storage or reporting, and processes related to provision of our Services are automated.
Moreover, only very limited user data collected from or provided by you is processed in order to provide Services to you.
To prevent service abuse, our servers store your user ID and connection time stamps, but this information is automatically deleted within 15 minutes after termination of your session.
More information on what information is collected about you and how it is used can be found in our Privacy Policy at https://surfshark.com/privacy.
No shady stuff, please.
We do not approve any unlawful, illicit, criminal or fraudulent activities committed by using Surfshark Services.
As we are not logging any information about your activities, you are using the Surfshark Services at your own responsibility.
Surfshark will not be liable in any way or form for illegal actions done by you arising through or from the use of our Services.2.
Do I have to create an account?Yup.
And youâre responsible for it.
In order to use some of the Surfshark Services, you will be asked to set up an account.
You are solely responsible for all usage or activity on your account including, but not limited to, use of the account by any person who uses your account, with or without authorization, or who has access to any computer on which your account resides or is accessible.3.
What happens if I share or lose my account information?Please take care of your information.
If you tell us about losing it right away, we may be able to help you out.
If you open an account to use or access the Services, you must complete the registration process by providing the complete and accurate information requested on the registration form.
You may be asked to provide an e-mail address and password.
You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password.
You may not sell, or trade that Account to any other person.
You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account, e-mail address, or password.
We are not liable for any loss that you or any third party incur as a result of someone else using your password, either with or without your knowledge.
We reserve the right to terminate your account at any time.4.
What is Surfshark payment, automatic renewal and refund policy?To keep you secured, Surfshark Services renew automatically.
You can cancel automatic renewal at any time.
You can subscribe to Surfshark Services on a service period basis.
After signing up for Surfshark Services you may choose a payment method.
Only some of our Services are free of charge.
Paid Surfshark Services renew automatically at the end of each service period and your chosen payment method is charged again, unless you decide to cancel your automatic payments before the automatic renewal.
By entering your payment details you agree with the automatic renewal.
We will inform you in advance by email about the automatic renewal of your subscription (if it is longer than one month).
We will send the first receipt for your purchased Services to your email.
All later receipts will be sent to your Surfshark account (to see those receipts please log in to your account, click on âMy accountâ, select âSubscriptionsâ and then see the receipts in the âInvoices &amp.
receiptsâ section).
Surfshark may change the price for the subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, or other subscription terms from time to time and will communicate any price or other changes to you in advance.
Subject to applicable law, you accept the new price and terms by continuing to use the Services after the changes take effect.
Please see currently applicable recurring subscription fees  here.
We can refund you on the basis of our 30-day money-back guarantee.
Except if you signed up via iTunes/App Store/Amazon or with a prepaid card/gift card.
These are out of our hands.
Your satisfaction with our Services is our main goal.
If you choose not to use our paid Services anymore, we guarantee you a right to claim a refund within 30 days following your purchase of our Services.
However, we would like to solve your issue before you decide to cancel the subscription, therefore you are always welcome to reach out to us at support@surfshark.com.
You can get a refund for the cancellation of our Services twice.
If you already have been granted a refund once, you can get the second refund if the period between both cancellations for which you claim refund is not less than 6 months.
If you purchase our Services again after the second refund, you will not be granted a refund for any further cancellation.
Monthly subscriptions may be refunded on the basis of the 30-day money-back guarantee only after the initial purchase.
Once a monthly subscription is renewed, it cannot be refunded on the basis of the 30-day money-back guarantee.
As a rule, you have no right to claim a refund after the period of 30 days from the purchase has passed.
Nevertheless, in the exceptional cases, we will consider refund beyond such 30-days period, at our sole discretion, if you can demonstrate that the Services which you purchased were not available or usable and that you made reasonable attempts to contact us regarding this issue.
In such a case, we may provide you with a pro-rata refund of Servicesâ fees paid during the subscription period when the Services were not available or usable.
If you purchase our subscription through iTunes/App Store/Amazon â we are not able to grant you a refund, as subscriptions purchased via the iTunes/App Store/Amazon are subject to iTunes/App Store/Amazon refund policies.
In such a case, you would have to contact a specific store for a refund.
Surfshark cannot refund any purchases made from our resellers.
In this case, refunds are handled according to the terms and conditions of the reseller from which the product was purchased.
Payments made using prepaid cards or gift cards are not refunded.
For payments made in cryptocurrency, the equivalent amount in US Dollars is refunded in the same cryptocurrency (based on the rate of exchange at the moment of refund).
You have a right to cancel your account at any time, however, canceled accounts will not be refunded for the unused part of the ongoing service period.
No refunds will be considered for accounts terminated for violation of these Terms.
Any fees charged by Surfshark are exclusive of taxes.
Nevertheless, we may calculate and add taxes or duties, including, but not limited to VAT, GST and other taxes or fees under laws applicable to you at the time of purchase.
All payments are being processed by our own payment processing companies (Surfshark Limited, registered at Suite 1, 3rd Floor 11-12 St.
Jamesâs Square, London, United Kingdom, SW1Y 4LB and Surfshark Inc., registered at 16192 Coastal Highway, Lewes, Delaware 19958, County of Sussex) with help of third-party providers (see our Privacy Policy).5.
