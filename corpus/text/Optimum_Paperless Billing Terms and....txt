 Paperless Billing Terms and Conditions 
By enrolling in paperless billing ("Paperless Billing"), you have selected to receive your Optimum bill and associated notices, including potentially service-impacting notices, electronically.
If you request to only receive your bill electronically, you understand and agree that you will no longer receive a paper statement, and Optimum will send electronic notifications that your billing statement is available online to the electronic method you elect to receive account updates and notices, or to the e-mail address you provided during enrollment by default.
Other notices, disclosures or contracts entered outside of the billing cycle may be sent to you directly to your selected method of electronic communication, or to e-mail by default.
By agreeing to Paperless Billing, you are confirming to Optimum that you are able to access all information provided to you in electronic form.
If you have more than one account with us, you will need to select a statement and notice delivery method for each account.
 You understand that there may be a time lag between when you stop receiving a paper bill and start receiving Paperless Billing notifications.
While your Paperless Billing service is being activated, it is your responsibility to keep your accounts current and contact Optimum if you do not receive your bill notice.
You agree that you are responsible for maintaining a valid method of electronic communications, including a valid e-mail address and agree to notify us of any change in your method of electronic communications and e-mail address.
You also agree that all change in terms notifications, legal and other notices (such as notices about changes to the agreements governing your account) that Optimum provides may be provided only through this notification.
Optimum sets the criteria for Paperless Billing eligibility and may, at any time and at its sole discretion, accept, deny or cancel Paperless Billing for your account and send a paper bill.
You may cancel Paperless Billing and receive paper statements at any time by changing your statement option through the Optimum customer portal.
Each bill, together with any legal notices on the bill (including any change(s) in terms) about your Account, will remain available online for a period of up to twelve months.
Inserts included with your bill but not printed on the bill will remain available for up to three months.
You may print these statements or download them to your own system.

Your browser also must support 128-bit encryption.

You agree that you have the necessary software to view and save PDF files.
