What Similar Technologies Do We Use?

We employ and our third-party advertising partners (such as Marketo or HubSpot) employ a software technology called âclear gifsâ (a.k.a.
Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that helps us better manage content on the Site by informing us what content is effective.
âClear gifsâ are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies and are used to learn about the interactions of our users with the Site and our outbound emails.
A âscriptâ is a piece of program code that is used to make our website function properly and interactively.
This code is executed on our server or on your device.
A âweb beaconâ (or a pixel tag) is a small, invisible piece of text or image on a website that is used to monitor traffic on a website.
In order to do this, various data about you is stored using web beacons.In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a userâs computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our website visitors Personal Data.
We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails recipients have opened.
This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
