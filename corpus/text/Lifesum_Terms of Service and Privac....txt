In an ongoing effort to improve our Services, additional personal data may be collected from you.
In such cases, we will notify you when the personal data collection takes place.Our use of your personal dataYour privacy is important to us and we will only process your personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy and relevant personal data regulation.Data processing necessary to provide the ServicesAs a part of offering the Services to you we process your personal data that you provide us with at the time of registration, such as:

First and last name
E-mail
Date of birth
Country of residence
Weight
Height
Device identifier, i.e.
information on what device, IP-address etc.
you use to register and log on to the Services

As you continue to use the Services, you will regularly provide Lifesum with further personal data.
It follows from the nature of the Services that we must process such data that you upload to the Services to enable the Services, for example, we will process your weight data and calorie intake to enable the monitoring and presentation of your personal goals (whether it be weight loss or weight gain).
This processing is a pre-requisite for us being able to offer the Services to you.
If you connect to the Services using a Third-Party Application (e.g., Apple HealthKit, Facebook) Lifesum will collect and use your personal information from such Third Party Applications such as your username, name, profile picture, country, hometown, email address, date of birth, gender as well as such health data that you choose to synchronize with Lifesumâs Services.
Some of the data mentioned above, collected from you and processed by Lifesum for certain features of the Services, is possible for us to delete and cease processing for the future if you so require, without you having to terminate your use of the entire Services, i.e., not all data (submitted over time by you to us either directly or through third-party services) is required for you to still be able to use the Services.
If you want us to cease processing certain data about you under this category, we will inform about the consequences of such cease, i.e., how it will affect your use of the features of the Services.Customer relationship as a legal groundIt should be noted that marketing sent by Lifesum to you on the basis of a customer relationship as a legal ground for processing personal data, does not require a consent.
Such data will be processed and used in compliance with relevant personal data regulation.ProfilingLifesumâs Services are based on a profound knowledge of best practice with regard to health.
Lifesum cooperates with nutritionists, behavioral psychologists, personal trainers, stress experts to stay on top of the latest research and science.
In addition, Lifesum analyze the usage of the Services, in order to provide you as a user with the most relevant features of the Services as possible with regard to your personal goals.
In analyzing the usage of the Services, Lifesum will process certain data for so-called profiling.
Profiling means processing of your and other usersâ personal data to analyze or predict aspects of your use of the Services, behavior and, location in reaching your health goal.
The data processed will be user habits where we will track actions taken by you such as when you move between screens, press buttons and take actions on the Services.
The purposes of the profiling is to monitor how engaged users are in different features of our Services, find out ways to make the Service more effective (fit for purpose) and vary the features or content to better match your individual usage patterns and preferences.
The profiling of your data can also be used as the basis for marketing towards other new potential customers on other platforms than the LIFESUM Services, such as other social media platforms.
Please note that this so called look-a-like-process of recruiting new customers does not mean that you will receive any marketing.
Nor does it mean that any other third parties will gain access to your data for any other purpose than for LIFESUM to reach new customers, i.e.
third party providers (for example social media) will only process your data on behalf of LIFESUM as processors, see further under transfer of data below.
Lifesumâs processing of your personal data for profiling purposes as described above, does not require any consent as a legal ground to be processed.
If this should be the case, i.e.
if, under relevant personal data regulation, consent is required for the use as described above, you hereby give your consent to Lifesum using your personal data as defined above for profiling, for the purpose of improving the Services and for providing customer support.Marketing â legitimate interestLifesum may use your personal data for profiling and marketing purposes via emails, notifications, or other messages, by Lifesum or Lifesumâs selected business partners.
Profiling will be used for marketing purposes to enable personalized and relevant offers to you, based on your preferences, see more above under Profiling.
The use of personal data for marketing purposes will only concern such offers that have a close relation to your use of the Service and the offers will be sent to you by Lifesum.
no personal data will be transferred to third parties for marketing purposes.
This processing is based on a legitimate interest, on our side the interest to offer you the best possible service, on your side the possibility to be offered relevant products and services relevant to your use of the Service and for third parties to reach you with such offers.
In other words we are of the conclusion that consent is not required.
If this should be the case, i.e.
if, under relevant personal data regulation, consent is required for the use as described above, you hereby give your consent to us using your personal data as defined above.Opt-out from marketingIn case you do not want Lifesum to use your personal data for the purpose of marketing, you may at any time unsubscribe from any further messages by clicking the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of such a message, or by using such opt-out features as are available in the app settings in the Services.CookiesLifesum uses cookies in order to function properly.
