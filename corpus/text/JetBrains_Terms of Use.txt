Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
 We, and our third-party service providers, use cookies and other tracking technologies ("Cookies") on our Website and within our products or services (collectively our "Site").
See below for more information about these technologies.

 We use Cookies to identify you when you visit our Site, to deliver our products and services to you, to provide you with services when you browse our Site, and to improve our Site and the services that we provide ("Service Purposes").
With your consent, we may also use Cookies for analytics purposes and for targeted advertising ("Commercial Purposes").
Any personal data collected by these technologies will be stored and processed for no longer than 1 year.

MORE ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGIES WE USE

Cookies. A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we store on your browser or on the hard drive of your computer.
Unless you have adjusted your browserâs settings so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies as soon as you visit our Site.
There are two types of cookies:


Persistent cookies: These cookies remain on a userâs device for the period of time specified in the cookie.
They are activated each time the user visits the website that created that particular cookie.


Session cookies: These cookies allow website operators to link the actions of a user during a browser session.
A browser session starts when a user opens the browser window and finishes when they close the browser window.
Session cookies are created temporarily.
Once you close the browser, all session cookies are deleted.

 Cookies can be either first-party or third-party cookies.
Whether a cookie is first-party or third-party depends on which domain placed the cookie.


First-party cookies are those placed by a website being visited by the user at the time (for example, cookies placed by us).
Cookies placed by JetBrains are used when you create an account, identify yourself using a JetBrains Account, purchase products using our e-store, or use any of our services, including (but not limited to) our issue tracker, blogs and discussions forums, signing up for our newsletter, and so on.
At times we may also use Cookies for testing out new features of our Website and/or web-based services with a subset of our audience.


Third-party cookies are cookies that are set by a domain other than that of the website being visited by the user.
If a user visits a website and another entity sets a cookie through that website, this would be a third-party cookie.


Clear GIFs, pixel tags, and other similar technologies. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer's hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages.
We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a.
web beacons, web bugs, or pixel tags), in connection with our Website to, among other things, track the activities of Website visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Website usage.
We and our third-party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our customers, to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.

HOW TO DELETE AND BLOCK OUR COOKIES
 You can block Cookies by activating the setting on your browser that allows you to refuse the setting of all or some Cookies.
However, if you use your browser settings to block all Cookies (including Cookies that are essential for the Site to work), you may not be able to access all or parts of our Site.

WHAT COOKIES DO WE USE AND WHY?
 Generally, our Site uses Cookies to distinguish you from other users of our Site.
The Cookies used on our Site, regardless of whether they are used for service purposes or commercial purposes, are categorized as follows:

 a) Strictly necessary

 b) Performance

 c) Functionality

 d) Targeting


'Strictly Necessary' â These Cookies let you move around the Site and use essential features like secure areas.
Without these Cookies, we cannot provide the requested services.
We use Strictly Necessary Cookies to:

 a) Identify you as being logged in to our Site and to authenticate you.

 b) Make sure you connect to the right service on our Site when we make any changes to the way the Site works.

 c) For security purposes.

 Accepting these Cookies is a condition of using the Site, so if you block these Cookies, the Site may not work correctly and we may not be able to provide our services and products to you.


'Performance' â These Cookies collect information about how you use our Site, for example, which pages you visit, and if you experience any errors.
Performance Cookies do not collect any information that could identify you, and are only used to help us improve how our Site works, understand what interests our users, and measure the effectiveness of our advertising.
We use Performance Cookies to:

 a) Carry out web analytics â provide statistics on how our Site is used.

 b) Obtain data on the number of Site users that have viewed a product.

 c) Help us improve the Site by registering any errors that occur.

 d) Test different designs for the Site.

 Some of our Performance Cookies are managed for us by third parties.
We do not allow such third parties to use these Cookies for any purposes other than those listed above.


'Functionality' Cookies â These are used to provide products or services or to remember settings to improve your visit.
We use Functionality Cookies for such purposes as:

 a) Remembering settings you've applied, such as layout, text size, language, preferences, and colors.

 b) Remembering if we've already asked you whether you want to fill in a survey.

 c) Remembering if you have engaged with a particular component or product list on the Site so that it isnât shown again unnecessarily.

 d) Showing you when you're logged in to the Site.

 e) Providing and showing embedded video content.

 Some of these Cookies are managed for us by third parties.
We do not allow such third parties to use these Cookies for any purposes other than those listed above.


'Targeting' Cookies â Targeting Cookies are used to track your visit to our Site and other websites, including the pages you have visited and the links you have followed, which allows third parties to display targeted ads to you on the websites you visit.

 We and our third-party service providers use Targeting Cookies to:

 a) Link to social networks, like Facebook, that may subsequently use information about your visit to our website in order to provide advertising or other offers that may be of interest to you when you visit other websites.

 b) Provide third parties with information on your visit so that they can present you with advertisements or other offers that may be of interest to you.

 If you are in the EU, you may opt-out of certain third-party Cookies that we and other websites may use for targeting, via http://www.youronlinechoices.eu or www.aboutads.info.
Opting out of one or more ad networks only means that members of those particular ad networks will no longer deliver targeted content or ads to you.
It does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads on our websites or other third-party websites.
If your browser is configured to reject Cookies when you visit one of the aforementioned opt-out pages, and you later erase your Cookies, use a different computer, or change web browsers, your preference may no longer be active.
Since all of these Cookies are managed by third parties, you should refer to the third parties' own website privacy notifications and policies for further information (see below for more information about the particular targeting Cookies used on our Site).

 Users in the United States may opt out of many third-party ad networks.
For example, you may go to the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") Consumer Choice Page for information on opting out of interest-based advertising, and available choices regarding having your information used by DAA companies.
You may also go to the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") Consumer Opt-Out Page for information on opting out of interest-based advertising, and available choices regarding having your information used by NAI members.

 Opting out of one or more of the companies listed on the DAA Consumer Choice Page or the NAI Consumer Opt-Out Page will opt you out from those companiesâ delivery of interest-based content or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising through our Site or on other websites.
You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., context-based ads).
Also, note that if your browsers are configured to reject Cookies when you opt out on the DAA or NAI websites, your opt-out may not be effective.
Additional information is available on the DAA's website at www.aboutads.info and on the NAI's website at www.networkadvertising.org.

DO NOT TRACK
 Currently, our systems do not recognize browser "do-not-track" requests.
You may, however, disable certain tracking by disabling cookies in your browser.
However, by doing so we cannot guarantee the correct behavior of the services we provide to you.
