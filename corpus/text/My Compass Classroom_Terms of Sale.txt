COMPASS LLC (âWeâ or âCompanyâ) hereby allows you to access certain premium features or content in exchange for a one-time or recurring fee (subscription membership), as applicable to the relevant features or content.
Your transactions and any other use of the Paid Services (âMembershipsâ or âSubscriptions) are subject to these COMPASS LLC Paid Service Terms of Sale (âTermsâ). 1.
Your Acceptance By using a Paid Service, you signify your agreement to (1) these Terms of Sale.
and (2) COMPASS LLCâs Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and all other terms and conditions that generally apply to the Website (as such term is defined in the Terms of Service).
Please read the Terms carefully.
If you do not understand the Terms, or do not accept any part of them, then you may not use the Paid Services.
Each time you place an order for a Paid Service (including when you order individual subscriptions or items of content), you enter into a separate contract for services on these Terms.
When you complete a purchase, you signify that you wish to enter into a binding contract for the provision of the applicable Paid Services. 2.
Payment, Refund and Cancellation Policy Compass LLC accepts payment via the current payment method indicated prior to purchase, which may include any other form of payment that we may make available to you from time to time.
You must tender valid payment or have a valid accepted form of payment on file in order to purchase Paid Services.
You agree to abide by any relevant Terms of Service or other legal agreement, whether with Compass LLC or a third party, that governs your use of a given payment processing method.
Prices for any Paid Service may change at any time, and Compass LLC does not provide price protection or refunds in the event of a price reduction or promotional offering.
You agree to pay for any Paid Service that you order.
Compass LLC will charge your credit card or other form of payment for the price listed on the relevant Paid Service offer, along with any additional amounts relating to applicable taxes, bank fees and currency fluctuations.
If you purchase any automatically renewing subscriptions, you agree that Compass LLC will charge the payment method on file on the first day of each billing period for the relevant subscription, and if the payment method on file becomes invalid due to an expired credit card or other similar reason and we are unable to charge you on the next billing period, Compass LLC reserves the right to immediately revoke your access to any Paid Service you have ordered until you update your payment method.
If you fail to update your payment method within a reasonable amount of time, Compass LLC may cancel your subscription.
Credit card or bank statements may show âCompass,â âCompass Classroom,â or âMy Compass Classroomâ as the authorized charge.
Billing periods may be monthly or annually.
The renewal period applicable to any subscription will be the same as the initial billing period for the Paid Services.
If Compass LLC is required to collect or pay any taxes in connection with your purchase of a Paid Service, such taxes will be charged to you at the time of each purchase transaction.
Additionally, if required by law, you are responsible for reporting and paying certain taxes in connection with your purchase and use of a Paid Service.
Such taxes may include duties, customs fees, or other taxes (other than income tax), along with any related penalties or interest, as applicable to your purchase or country of purchase.
REFUNDS: all purchases are final.
SUBSCRIPTION CANCELLATIONS: you purchase a subscription to a Paid Service that automatically renews, you may cancel the subscription any time before the end of the current billing period and the cancellation will take effect on the next billing period.
You will retain access to the Paid Service from the time you cancel until the start of the next billing period, and will not receive a refund or credit for any remaining days in your current billing period.
If you have any questions or need to contact us about cancellation, please send an e-mail to hello@mycompassclassroom.com or write to Compass LLC, marked for the attention of âSupport Services,â at our business address listed at the bottom of this policy. 3.
Accessing Paid Services.

You shall have sole responsibility for obtaining a device which satisfies those requirements. 4.
License Your use of the Paid Services must be only for personal, non-commercial use.
You agree not to use any Paid Service, in whole or in part in connection with any public presentation even if no fee is charged (except where such use would not constitute a copyright infringement).
You are receiving a non-exclusive license to access the Paid Service and all rights, title and interest in the Paid Services (including any content offered through the Paid Services) not expressly granted to you in these Terms are reserved by Compass LLC and its licensors.
If Compass LLC reasonably determines that you violated any of the terms and conditions of the Paid Service Terms, your rights under this Section 4 will immediately terminate and Compass LLC may terminate your access to the Paid Service and/or your Compass LLC account without notice and without refund to you. 5.

 6.
Changes Compass LLC reserves the right to change the availability and content of the Paid Services at any time with or without notice to you.
In addition, we reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue any Paid Service with or without notice to you and we will not be liable to you or any third party for any such modifications, suspension, or termination.
However, this will not affect your ability to request a refund as described above.
In certain cases, content available within a Paid Service may become unavailable.
Compass LLC will have no liability to you for any such unavailability.
We may also change these Paid Service Terms from time to time so we encourage you to periodically review the most up-to-date version at https://mycompassclassroom.com or https://compassclassroom.com 
If the Paid Service Terms change, you will have the opportunity to review the new terms when you next purchase any Paid Service.
By completing the purchase, you signify your agreement to the new Paid Service Terms, and further, that they will apply to your use of the Service as a whole (including any Paid Service you have purchased in the past) and all subsequent purchases (until the Paid Service Terms change again).
If you refuse to accept the updated Paid Service Terms then you may not buy any additional Paid Services and the latest version of the Paid Service Terms that you accepted will continue to apply to your use of previously purchased Paid Services. 7.
