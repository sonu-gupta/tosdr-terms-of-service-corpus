What types of information does this Privacy Policy cover?
We collect various types of information about You and Your use of the Service via Our website, Help Desk and call centers, postal mail, remote kiosks, Our Facebook Page or other social network platforms or by other means, generally classified as Personal Information and Non-Personal Information.
Generally, We gather and use Personal Information internally in connection with providing the Service to You, including to personalize, evaluate and improve the Service and Our ability to provide the Service to You, to contact You, to respond to and fulfill Your requests regarding the Service, and to analyze how You use the Service.
We may share Your Personal Information with Our Affiliates and with other third parties as described below.

What Information do We collect and how do We use this Information?
PERSONAL INFORMATION
Personal Information is the information You provide to us voluntarily or passively through Your use of Our Service and/or website, and which is directly associated with or reasonably linked to a specific person, computer or device.
For example, through the registration process, when the equipment to provide the Service is installed, maintained or upgraded at Your premises, when You contact Us regarding the Service, and through Your account settings, We collect Personal Information such as Your name, email address, phone number, billing address and billing information (such as credit card account number or other financial account information), service address, and the nature of any of Your devices or other property making use of the Service.
You may be required to provide certain Personal Information to Us in order to register with Us, to assist Us in improving Your Service or troubleshooting problems You are experiencing with the Service, Your computer or device, or otherwise to improve the quality of the Service.

We will communicate with You if youâve provided Us the means to do so.
For example, if youâve given Us Your email address or phone number, We will email or call You about Your use of the Service or product improvements or upgrades, and other transactional information about Your Service.
We may also combine Your Personal Information with additional Personal Information obtained from Our Facebook Pages or other social network platforms, Our Affiliates, Our Operational Service Providers (third party owned companies that provide or perform services on Our behalf, to help serve You better and to perform functions in order to support Our businesses and operations), or other companies, such as credit bureaus, background check firms, and marketing research companies.
Some forms of Non-Personal Information as described below will be classified as Personal Information if required by applicable law or when such information is directly associated with or reasonably linked to a specific person, computer or device, or is combined with other forms of Personal Information.

NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION
Website Information, Use of Cookies and other Similar Tracking Technology
When you visit Our website, We will collect various types of Non-Personal Information, such as information on Our server logs from Your browser or device, which may include Your IP address, unique device identifier, âcookieâ information, the type of browser and/or device youâre using to access the Service, and the page or feature You requested.
(IP Address and device identifiers are traditionally classified as Non-Personal Information, unless We are required to do so otherwise under applicable law.) âCookiesâ and âweb beaconsâ are text file identifiers We transfer to Your browser or device that allow Us to recognize Your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features on Our website are visited, by how many people, and other activity on the website.

You can change the preferences on Your browser or device to prevent or limit Your deviceâs acceptance of cookies, web beacons or other similar technology, but this may prevent You from taking advantage of some of the features on Our website, or accessing certain functions and conveniences.
If You click on a link to a third party website or service, such third party may also transmit cookies to You.
Again, this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies or other such tracking technology by any third parties, and We are not responsible for their privacy policies and practices.

We also use Personal Information and Non-Personal Information to enhance Our website and Our Service offerings. For example, such information can tell Us how often visitors use a particular feature of Our website and which products and services are most interesting to current and potential customers, and We can use that knowledge to make the website useful and interesting to as many users as possible and to enhance and refine Our Service offerings.
We will continue to conduct analytics on Our website performance.
You may not opt-out of this use of cookies or other Personal Information or Non-Personal Information.

Technology is improving every day and to improve Our Servicesâ operation and function We may introduce new technologies and monitoring techniques without advance notice or consent from You.
We may also use third party providers to conduct such internal analyses.

NETWORK INFORMATION
We also collect Network Information, information about Your access to, and use of, Our network, which may or may not be directly associated with or reasonably linked to a specific person, computer or device.
For example, We may collect information about the performance of the Provider Equipment installed on Your property or at Your premises, when You are using the Service, the various devices You are using to access the Service, the amount of data You are transmitting and receiving, the content of the data You are transmitting and receiving, the websites You are visiting, and any other information that is transmitted over Our network.

device.


How is Network Information Used?
We use Network Information to monitor and enhance the performance of Our network.
We will not monitor the content of the websites viewed or email communications as part of Our standard network management.
Generally, We will only monitor and preserve the following Network Information:
â¢ When You are using the Service;
â¢ How You are using the Service, such as monitoring traffic patterns regarding websites visited, amount of data being sent or received, or other activity;
â¢ The amount and types of data You are transmitting and receiving through the Service.
and
â¢ General information regarding the performance of the Provider Equipment installed on Your property or at Your premises, and its interaction with the rest of Our network.
However, We reserve the right to, and may, monitor, access, review and preserve any Network Information and/or content in the following situations:
â¢ In response to an inquiry from You or an another Authorized User on Your account regarding Your or their use of the Service or problems You or they are experiencing using the Service;
â¢ If We have reason to believe You are using the Service in violation of Your Service Agreement or any applicable statutes, rules, ordinances or regulations;
â¢ If We have reason to believe Your use of the Service is negatively affecting other Customers.
or
â¢ When We are required by law or legal process to do so, or when We have a good faith belief that We are required by law or legal process to do so.


How is Personal Information used for marketing and advertising purposes?
We will use Personal Information to send You marketing and advertising messages related to Our Service and Our website using Your email address, postal address, or Your telephone number (for voice, texts, and pre-recorded calls). We may deliver a marketing or advertising message based on Your visits to Our website, which will be general advertising or âContextual Advertising,â which is advertising based on the subject matter or the content of the specific website page or subject matter.
We may also send You âFirst Party Advertising,â which is advertising that is customized or personalized based on a history of Your use of our Services (possibly combined with information from our Facebook fan page or other social network platforms).
First Party Advertising is based solely on a combination of information We collect from You â not from Your visits to other websites across the Internet.

You may opt-out of First Party Advertising but not Contextual Advertising.
