In addition to this Cookie Notice, CrowdStrikeâs Privacy Notice also applies.
The Privacy Notice details the ways CrowdStrike uses, stores, and protects your personal data, and informs you of your data protection rights.
Per applicable data protection laws, you may be presented with the option to agree to the use of certain cookies prior to browsing CrowdStrikeâs website.
In doing so, you can consent to allow all cookies, consent only to specific categories of cookies, or reject the use of cookies except for those deemed necessary for the website or otherwise designed in a manner that is permissible under applicable law.
 What is a Cookie? 
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a userâs computer to remember your webpage actions or preferences over time.
Cookies donât read or modify data on the userâs computer.
Cookies help provide a user with a better and faster online experience.
When you visit a website for the first time, your internet browser will download and place cookies on your device.
The next time you access the same website from the same device, the website will recognize that you have visited before, and in some cases adapt the content to your prior visits.
This allows the website experience to be tailored to your personal interests and preferences.
A web beacon is a small graphic file that is placed on the web page the user visits and is often used to help deliver cookies and gather usage and performance data.
 Why does CrowdStrike use cookies? 

To allow Websites and Web Portals to function properly: Cookies perform different functions that help us make your online experience smoother and more interactive.
Especially if you are using the same device and the same browser as you did when you visited our website previously.
Some cookies are essential to maintain and operate CrowdStrikeâs websites and web portals.
They allow us to provide you with consistent access to services and functionalities, consistent and updated information, and a seamless online experience.

To help us improve our Websites and Web Portals: Cookies help us improve our website and web portals by analyzing how visitors interact with them.
We use that information to determine what is popular and what else visitors may find useful.
That information allows us to understand how visitors use our website to make them better and enhance the web experience, and to display content most relevant to individual users.

To customize a userâs web experience on our Websites and Web Portals: Cookies also help us understand how you use and interact with our websites and web portals.
They can be used to remember your preferences and user ID when you visit our websites.
If we know your settings and preferences we can provide a more personalized user experience by helping you navigate more efficiently to relevant pages, remember your personal preferences, and modify content based on those preferences to provide more personalized content (based on preferences or geography, for example).
In addition to the above uses of cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies, we also use third-party service providers to help us implement and utilize cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to analyze the data they collect.
In some cases, we link the information gathered by cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to a userâs personal information.
We may also use cookies, web beacons, tracking technologies, and the personal information they collect to tailor our Websites, Web Portal, and communications so they are more relevant to a userâs interests.
Additionally, cookies enable tailored content such as relevant advertisements to be provided on partner websites.
