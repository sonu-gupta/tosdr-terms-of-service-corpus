Sharing

In addition to the other disclosures described in this Privacy Policy, we will also share your information:




where we have your consent to do so (including as set out in this Privacy Policy);


as reasonably necessary in order to provide the Services to you (for example, by providing your personal information to suppliers we may use to fulfil the Services or to communicate with you);


where it is necessary to carry out your instructions (for example, to process a payment instruction we must provide your personal information to our payment processors);


where your data is in an anonymous and aggregated format, meaning you could not be personally identified from it;


as we reasonably believe is permitted by law or regulation or as is necessary to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms and conditions and/or any other agreement with you.
or to protect the rights, property, or safety of King, our users, or others.
and


if there is a sale of the assets of King or corporate restructuring, or as a result of a change of control of King or one of its group companies, or in preparation of any of these events.
Any third party to which King transfers of sells King's assets will have the right to continue to use the personal and other information that you provide to us in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy.




We may also share your information with our service providers if necessary to enable them to provide services to us.

Security

King takes appropriate security and technical measures to protect your information from unauthorised access, loss and misuse.
In addition, we request that our suppliers who process personal information on our behalf take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information and maintain an appropriate level of security.
However, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information online and offline, as the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving.
As such you should always take care when sharing your information online.


Legal Bases

In each case where we process your information, we do so lawfully in accordance with one of the legal basis set out under European data protection law.
The legal bases which we rely upon are the following:





Contractual Necessity. This covers data used by us in order to provide you with Services that you have requested - and that we have agreed - to provide to you, such as our games, customer services, chat functionality and third party social network connectivity;



Legal Obligation. This covers data used by us to comply with a legal obligation, such as to maintain records relating to tax or to respond to a valid legal request for certain data;



Legitimate Interests. This covers data used by us for purposes that are not harmful to your privacy and can be reasonably expected within the context of your use of our Services, such as Marketing, Advertising, analytics, research and optimisation of our games and other Services.
and



Consent. This is used as a legal basis in the following contexts: (i) the collection of data stored on your device by us and our advertising partners, including device information, ad identifiers, IP address, country and region.
You consent to this collection when you agree to install our game and you can withdraw your consent to this by uninstalling our games.
(ii) the storage of data on your device by us and our advertising partners, including through the use of cookies.
By accessing and using our Services, you consent to this storage and you can withdraw your consent by updating your cookie settings.
and (iii) the use of your data by us and our partners for targeted advertising purposes (for more information, see Marketing and Advertising above).
You consent to this collection when you accept this Privacy Policy and you can withdraw your consent to this processing by following the steps at How to adjust your preferences for interest based advertising.
Where we ask for your consent to use your data for any other purpose, we will make this clear at the point of collection and we will also make clear how you can withdraw your consent.





In this Privacy Policy we have explained how you can opt out of certain types of processing that we undertake and where any processing is based on your consent, you can withdraw that consent at any time in the ways described in this Privacy Policy.
Nonetheless, if you play our games we will still collect some personal data about you and process it as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.
If you do not wish us to collect any personal data about you at all, you should cease playing our games and stop using our Services.

Retention

We will keep your information for as long as your account is active or we consider necessary for the purposes described in our Privacy Policy.
We will also retain and use your information for as long as is required in order to comply with our legal obligations.

Location of storage

We store your information on servers that we control which are primarily based in the EEA.
We may also use servers and engage providers that are located outside the EEA in order to process and store your information and to provide services to us.

International Transfer

We may transfer your information to affiliated entities or third parties to jurisdictions outside the EEA.
Please note that these countries outside of the EEA may not have the same data protection laws as your own jurisdiction.
We take steps to ensure that there are adequate safeguards and mechanisms in place (including the use of EU model clauses) to allow the transfer of your information across borders outside of the EEA.
