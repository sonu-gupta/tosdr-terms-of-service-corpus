Privacy
 Melissa Privacy Policy Approach to Privacy  Melissa Corporation considers itself a steward of the information it collects, maintains and utilizes.
Our responsibility is to ensure the security of the information in our care and to maintain the privacy of consumers through appropriate, responsible use.

 Our information policies define how information may be used.
These policies vary to meet the legal requirements and consumer expectations in the area in which the information product or service is being used.
Our approach to privacy acknowledges there are changing needs and expectations and provides the flexibility so that Melissa can implement new processes and policies to resolve information issues in this dynamic environment.
 This policy sets out our responsibilities under The General Data Protection Regulation 2016 (âGDPRâ) and other applicable laws relating to the processing and security of personal information.
 Accountability for Information Use  Melissa is held accountable for its information use by consumer privacy expectations and by laws and industry codes established by government entities and industry organizations around the world.
The security of your data is important to Melissa Data.
We have a 30+ year history of establishing and refining our controls to secure client data in an ever-changing and increasingly connected world.
Among the laws and industry self-regulatory codes which Melissa complies in the United States are: 

Service Organization Control (SOC)

 Melissa undergoes company-wide SOC 2 Type II audits on an annual basis to have its processes, procedures, and controls formerly evaluated and tested by an independent accounting and auditing firm, SSAE 16 Professionals, LLP.
SOC 2 Type II is the corporate industryâs standard for an overall control structure and affirms our long-standing commitment to strong controls and safeguards for handling and processing your data.


Health Insurance Portability &amp.
Accountability Act (HIPAA)

 Melissa has achieved compliance with all data security standards outlined in the Health Insurance Portability &amp.
Accountability Act (HIPAA).
Healthcare providers, financial institutions, government agencies, and third party data vendors who handle their data, are required to meet the most stringent data security guidelines by law.
The evaluation of compliance was performed by SSAE 16 Professionals, LLP to measure the strict controls Melissa has in place to keep customer information private and secure.
 CAN-SPAM Act Direct Marketing Associationâs Ethical Business Practices California Consumer Privacy Act Notice  The California Consumer Privacy Act (âCCPAâ) takes effect on January 1, 2020.
It provisions that a resident of California (âconsumerâ) has certain rights to their personal information.
âPersonal informationâ means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.
Personal information does not include publicly available information, which is information lawfully made available from federal, state, or local government records.
See further: CA CIV CODE 1798.140, subsections (g) and (o).

 The consumer rights provisioned by CCPA are broadly known as the following: 

Right to Know
 A consumer has the right to request that a business that collects a consumerâs personal information disclose to that consumer the categories and specific pieces of information the business has collected about that consumer, the categories of sources from which such information was collected, and the categories of third parties with whom the business shares personal information.
A consumer can exercise their right to know twice in a 12-month period.
The request is also limited to the previous 12 months prior to the request.
See further: CA CIV CODE 1798.100, 110, 115, 130 

Right to Opt-Out of Sale of Personal Information
 A consumer has the right, at any time, to direct a business that sells personal information about the consumer to third parties not to sell the consumerâs personal information.
See further: CA CIV CODE 1798.120, 135 

Right to Delete
 A consumer has the right to request that a business delete any personal information about the consumer which the business has collected from the consumer.
However, a business or service provider is not required to comply with a consumerâs request to delete the consumerâs personal information if it is necessary for the business or service provider to maintain the consumerâs personal information in order to: 

 Complete the transaction for which the personal information was collected, provide a good or service requested by the consumer, or reasonably anticipated within the context of a businessâs ongoing business relationship with the consumer, or otherwise perform a contract between the business and the consumer.

 Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity.

 To enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with the expectations of the consumer based on the consumerâs relationship with the business.

 Comply with a legal obligation.

 Or a number of other enumerated exceptions.


 See further: CA CIV CODE 1798.105 
 Melissa products and services rely on data collected from a range of third-party data providers, including both government and private sources, which may include a consumerâs personal information.
Under the CCPA, a resident of California may submit a verifiable consumer request to exercise the three rights above.
If you are a resident of California (as defined in CA CCR 17014) and would like to submit a verifiable consumer request to Melissa, follow the link below to an online submission form, or email Melissa Technical Support Team at CCPArequest@melissa.com or call 1 800 800 6245 x 4.


Submit a Verifiable Consumer Request

 In order to prevent improper or potentially fraudulent requests under CCPA, a business must only respond to verifiable consumer requests only from that consumer.
Such requests must only come directly from the consumer themselves or their agent that is authorized in writing, such as a power of attorney, and must include documented proof of the consumerâs identity (and agentâs identity, if applicable).
See further: CA CIV CODE 1798.140, subsection (y), 185, subsection (a)(7).

 The CCPA also provides that a business shall not discriminate against a consumer because the consumer exercised any of the consumerâs rights under the CCPA.
See further: CA CIV CODE 1798.125.

 Pursuant to CA CIV CODE 1798.130, Melissa discloses that products and services sold to customers may contain personal information of California consumers (as defined in CA CIV CODE 1798.140).
Such products and services are typically used for address validation, identity verification, or for marketing and CRM (customer relationship management) purposes.
For a list of categories of personal information click here.

 Categories: name, address, phone number, email, gender, date of birth, age, race, marital status, home-ownership status, hobby and lifestyle interest preferences, vehicle type preference, consumer credit card holding status.
