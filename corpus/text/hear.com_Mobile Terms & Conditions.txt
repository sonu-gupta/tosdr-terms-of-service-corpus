If an arbitratorâs award is granted, it is binding and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Neither party may bring an action, in arbitration or otherwise, unless the action is started within two years of the occurrence allegedly causing the damage in question.
No arbitration brought under, or with respect to, this Section is to be joined to an arbitration involving any other party subject to these Mobile Terms, whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise.

Hear.com will pay its, and you will pay your, lawyersâ, expertsâ, and witnessesâ fees, expenses, and costs with respect to all claims.

The Notice must be sent by certified mail to hear.com LLC 396 Alhambra Circle, Suite 600 Coral Gables, FL 33134.
The Notice should describe the nature and basis of your claim or dispute and the specific relief you seek.
