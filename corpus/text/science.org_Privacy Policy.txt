Resumes On Science Careers, we give you the option of putting your resume or CV (collectively referred to as âresumeâ) in our database.
There are two ways of doing this:
You can post your resume in our database as either a public or private resume.
Public resumes can be searched by parties with access to our searchable resume database.
If you allow your resume to be searchable, then all parties with access to our searchable resume database (or copies thereof) will have access to your resume.
We attempt to limit access to our searchable resume database (or copies thereof) only to paying employers, recruiters, hiring managers, headhunters, and human resource professionals, as well as law enforcement and national security agencies, but cannot guarantee that other parties will not gain access to this database.
We are not responsible for the use made of resumes by third parties who access such resumes while they are in our searchable database.
You may remove your resume from our searchable database at any time.
However, employers, recruiters, and others who have paid for access to that database or to obtain a copy of that database, as well as parties who have otherwise gained access to the database may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases.
We are not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of resumes in these instances.
Please note: It is not our practice to restrict access to our resume database to any particular customer(s).
Please be advised that your current employer or an entity affiliated with your current employer might be a customer of the ScienceCareers.org sites.
We are not responsible for any actions or results that may occur as a result of any customerâs access to and/or use of your resume.
We reserve the right to remove from our database any resumes we consider to be illegal or offensive. Virtual Career Fairs If you register to participate in a Science Careers Virtual Career Fair, we will collect and retain information about you, including Personal Information.
Information you provide when registering for a Science Careers Virtual Career Fair is collected through our Virtual Career Fair platform provider and is shared with the career fair sponsor as well as the employers you interact with during the career fair.
This information includes Personal Information such as your name, email address, resume and information from other questions you answer during the registration process.
This information may also include chat history from conversations/interactions that you have with employers participating in the career fair.
for clarity, if you participate in private chats, the conversation/interaction between you and an employer will be shared only with that employer.
If you participate in public chats, all participants will see your conversation/interaction during the chat and the chat history may be shared with all participating employers.
This information may become subject to the policies of the employers with whom you interacted at the career fair.
We are not responsible for these policies or any actions or results that may occur as a result of any employerâs access to and/or use of your information. Additional Terms and Rules for Social Networking Social networking services provided on the AAAS and Science Websites (e.g., the Science Careers Community pages) may have additional terms of conduct, privacy policies, and privacy settings that you will be required to agree to and set when you register for such services.
