         Scotiabank Privacy Agreement
Scotiabank recognizes the importance of your personal information and we never take for granted the trust that you - as a customer or a business partner - have placed in us to protect that information.

Scotiabank values transparency.
With this Privacy Agreement, along with our Digital Privacy and Interest-Based Advertising Policy, we are striving to provide you with a good understanding of why we collect and use your personal information, how your information is shared, retained and protected, and how you can exercise your personal choices.
 We will also explain how you can find out what personal information we hold about you.
When you apply or sign-up for a product or service that requires further explanation about how we use your personal information, we will explain that to you.

Some of our affiliates and subsidiaries have their own privacy policies, but where that is not the case, this Privacy Agreement and our Digital Privacy and Interest-Based Advertising Policy apply to The Bank of Nova Scotia and the current and newly acquired members of the Scotiabank group of companies or any Scotiabank programs in Canada (âScotiabankâ or âweâ or âusâ).
