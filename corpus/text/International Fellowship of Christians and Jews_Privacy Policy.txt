Limit processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing.
You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.
In some cases, there may be overriding grounds which require us to process your information.
Request we provide your personal data to you or to a third party.
