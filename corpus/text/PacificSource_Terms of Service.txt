Online privacy and security
At PacificSource, protecting your personal information is important to us.
We are as committed to protecting the information you provide through this Website as when you provide it to us over the phone, in person, or through the mail.
However, we recognize, and want you to recognize, that while electronic communications have many benefits, they are not as secure as other means of communication.
Please read the following information carefully to better understand how using this Site affects your privacy.
Security practices
We attempt to protect online information according to applicable laws and established company security standards and practices.
We have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information under our control, and we continually evaluate new technologies for safeguarding your information.
However, we cannot guarantee the confidentiality or security of electronic transmissions via the Internet because these transmissions may potentially use insecure computers and links, and data may be lost or intercepted by unauthorized parties during such transmission.
If you wish to submit personal or confidential information by a more secure means of communication, please contact us.
The information you provide to us online is protected by Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.
SSL is the leading security protocol for data transfer on the Internet.
This technology scrambles your account information as it moves between your computerâs browser and our computer systems.
When information is scrambled, or encrypted in this way, it becomes nearly impossible for anyone other than PacificSource to read it.
This secure session helps protect the safety and confidentiality of your information when you interact with us online.
