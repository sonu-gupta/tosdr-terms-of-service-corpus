In order to function properly, Evernote needs access to several different software components and services on your device, some of which contain your personal information.
This page describes information our applications collect from your device, and how we use that information. 
Defined terms on this page have the same meanings as defined in our Privacy Policy.
When you install, modify, or use an Evernote application, you may see permission requests or alerts regarding the device capabilities the application could potentially use.
For example, on some versions of Android you will see a long, generic, technical list of device capabilities upon installation of the app, while on other versions of Android and iOS you will see device permission requests pop up as they are used in the app.
Rather than list such permissions exhaustively, this page describes how each Evernote application uses key device features that may access or use your personal information.
Many of these capabilities may be turned on or off through your device settings or your Evernote account settings.
