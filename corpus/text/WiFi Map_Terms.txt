Mapâ or âweâ).
PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY, AS THEY ARE A
LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND WIFI MAP.
PLEASE BE ADVISED: THESE TERMS CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT GOVERN HOW
CLAIMS THAT YOU AND WIFI MAP HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER CAN BE BROUGHT
(SEE SECTION 4 BELOW).
THOSE PROVISIONS WILL, WITH LIMITED
EXCEPTIONS, REQUIRE YOU TO SUBMIT CLAIMS YOU HAVE AGAINST WIFI MAP
TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, NOT AS A
PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS, GROUP OR REPRESENTATIVE
ACTION OR PROCEEDING.
In order to install, access or use the App, you must be of legal age
for those activities in the jurisdiction in which you are located.
If you are not of legal age, you must not install, access or use the
App.
1.
Binding Agreement.
Termination

Your installation of, access to or use of our App constitutes your
binding agreement to those Terms, including the dispute resolution
and arbitration provisions.
If at any time you disagree with these
Terms, you must refrain from installing our App, or, if you have
already installed our App, refrain from accessing or using it and
delete it.
These Terms contain the entire agreement between you and
WiFi Map, and supersede any prior agreements or arrangements with
you that relate in any way to WiFi Map or the App.
WiFi Map reserves the right to immediately terminate these Terms and
any services provided by WiFi Map, including its publication of the
App and provision of any content, information, functionality or
other services through the App, at any time, either with respect to
you or generally, for any reason, including your violation of these
terms, or for no reason.
The preamble above, this{â â}
Section 1, 2â4 and Sections 6â19 shall survive the
termination of these Terms.
2.
Governing Law

These Terms, and any claims, disputes or controversies related to
your use of the App or any content, information and related
materials (âContentâ) provided through the App or otherwise
related to the relationship between you and WiFi Map, whether
contractual or non-contractual, are governed by the laws of the
State of New York, United States of America, without giving effect
to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule, whether in the
State of New York or any other jurisdiction, that would cause the
laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York to apply.
3.{â â}
Jurisdiction and Venue for Claims not Subject to Arbitration

The New York state and United States federal courts sitting in New
York County, New York shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any
claims, disputes or controversies related to these Terms, your use
of the App or any Content provided through the App, or otherwise
related to the relationship between you and WiFi Map, whether
contractual or non-contractual, that are not subject to mandatory
arbitration under Section 4.
4.
Mandatory Binding Arbitration




(a) Agreement to Arbitrate



Any claims, disputes or controversies related to these Terms, your
use of the App or any Content provided through the App, or otherwise
related to the relationship between you and WiFi Map, whether based
in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other
legal theory, regardless of when they arise and regardless of any
termination of these Terms, shall be determined by mandatory binding
individual (not class) arbitration.
The arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her
own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the
existence, scope or validity of the this agreement to arbitrate or
to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.
Arbitration is
more informal than a lawsuit in court.
THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN
ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.
There may be more limits on the availability and scope of discovery
than in court.
The arbitrator must follow these Terms and can award
the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees),
except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including
declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties
to the arbitration.
This arbitration provision will survive
termination of these Terms.



(b) Exceptions



Notwithstanding Section 4(a), nothing in these Terms,
including this Section 4, will be deemed to waive,
preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to
(i) bring an individual action in a U.S.
small claims court for
a matter within the jurisdiction of that court or (ii) bring an
individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary
individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final
ruling from the arbitrator.
In addition, the agreement to arbitrate
in this Section 4 doesnât stop you or us from bringing
issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.
Those
agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your
behalf (or vice versa).





(c) No Class or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver




YOU AND WIFI MAP EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN
YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS
MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.
Unless both
you and WiFi Map agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more
than one personâs claims or otherwise preside over any form of a
representative or class proceeding.
The arbitrator may award
injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking
relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted
by that partyâs individual claim.
If a court decides that applicable
law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraphâs limitations as
to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that
claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in
court.



(d) Arbitration Rules



Either you or WiFi Map may start arbitration proceedings.
Any
arbitration between you and WiFi Map will take place in the English
language under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association (âAAAâ) then in force (the â
AAA Rulesâ), as modified by this Section 4.
The
Federal Arbitration Act shall apply to, and govern the
interpretation and enforcement of, this provision (despite the
choice of law provision above).
The AAA Rules, as well as
instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA,
appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.
WiFi
Map can also help put you in touch with the AAA.
Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish)
of your residence, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or
less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted
(i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the
arbitrator.
(ii) through a non-appearance based telephonic
hearing.
or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the
AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your residence.
If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required
to pay a filing fee, WiFi Map will reimburse you for that filing
fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case
you will be responsible for the filing fee.
WiFi Map will pay any
other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator
compensation, unless otherwise required by the AAA Rules or court
order.
Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is
conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision
sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on
which the decision and award, if any, are based.
The arbitrator may
make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and
reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding
and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the
arbitratorâs ruling on the merits.



(e) Notice.
Process



A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written
notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal
Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or if we do not
have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (â
Noticeâ).
WiFi Mapâs address for Notice is: WiFi Map LLC,
Attn: President, 25 Broadway, 9th Floor, New York, NY 10004, USA.
The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim
or dispute.
and (ii) set out the specific relief sought (â
Demandâ).
You and WiFi Map each shall use good faith efforts
to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement
to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or WiFi
Map may commence an arbitration proceeding.
During the arbitration,
the amount of any settlement offer made by you or WiFi Map shall not
be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a
final decision and award, if any.
All documents and information
disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly
confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient
for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the
enforcement of the arbitratorâs decision and award and shall not be
disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know
for such purposes or as required by applicable law.



(f) Enforceability



If the agreement to arbitrate in this Section 4 is
invalidated in whole or in part, the exclusive jurisdiction and
venue described in Section 3 shall govern any claim in
court arising out of or related to these Terms.
5.
