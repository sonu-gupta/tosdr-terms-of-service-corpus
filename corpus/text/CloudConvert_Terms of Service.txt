 Auto Refill Packages  You will be charged when 95% of your credits are consumed.

 By enabling the "Auto Refill" option, you agree to be charged your chosen package automatically, if your previous package is consumed by 95%.
You are responsible for monitoring your account to prevent unwanted payments.
The Auto Refill option can be cancelled at any time.

To receive a refund, you must submit a claim, which contains at least the following information: 

the dates and times of each unavailability incident that youâre claiming
your request logs that document the errors and corroborate your claimed outage
