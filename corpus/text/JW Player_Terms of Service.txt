If Publisher Uses any Beta Products, Publisher's Use of any such Beta Product(s) constitutes unconditional agreement to be bound by, and such Use shall be subject to, the JW Player Beta Program Agreementhttps://jwplayer.com/beta-program-agreement with respect to such Beta Product(s).
Distribution
Except pursuant to the Purpose or as otherwise specifically set forth herein, Publisher shall not Distribute, re-license, sell, lease, transfer, encumber, assign or make available for public use the Products or any Adaptation thereof.
Any attempt to take any such actions is void and constitutes a material breach of these Terms of Service.
Term
These Terms of Service shall become effective on the Effective Date.
For all Editions other than the (i) Enterprise Trial Edition or (ii) Enterprise Edition if otherwise set forth on an applicable Order Form, these Terms of Service shall remain effective for a period of one (1) year (the "Initial Term").
Upon the conclusion of the Initial Term, these Terms of Service shall automatically renew for additional successive one (1) year terms, except in the case of the Enterprise Edition which shall renew for additional successive terms for the same period as the Initial Term (each a "Renewal Term" and together with the Initial Term and any Negotiation Period(s), the "Term").

THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CANNOT BE TERMINATED BEFORE THE END OF THE PERIOD FOR WHICH PUBLISHER HAS ALREADY PAID, AND EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THESE TERMS, COMPANY WILL NOT REFUND ANY FEES THAT PUBLISHER HAS ALREADY PAID.

Publisher's charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when Publisher initially selected to use the Products or Editions.
Publisher hereby acknowledges that it will not receive notice of a renewal cancellation date or automatic renewal and expressly waives the application of New York General Obligations Law Section 5-903, and any similar laws, to the renewal of these Terms of Service.

provided that Company may in its sole discretion notify Publisher that such Negotiation Period will not occur, in which case these Terms of Service will expire as provided herein.
Publisher will for the Negotiation Period be invoiced, and will pay in accordance with the payment terms herein, one-twelfth of the annual Fees provided on the applicable Order Form, and the License Scope for Content Plays, Hosting and Streaming will be one-twelfth of the annual limits provided on such Order Form.
The Negotiation Period will not renew without the written consent (email sufficing) of Company.

Publisher (not the Company) is responsible for any statements and omissions in Publisher's privacy policy.
