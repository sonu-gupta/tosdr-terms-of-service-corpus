The request for any product, service or application must be made by persons with the legal capacity to do so according to their country of residence.
In the case of minors under 16 years of age, in compliance with the regulatory requirements applicable to you according to your country of residence, in order to process your data, it may be necessary for any application, activation or registration to be made by your parents or guardians or, where applicable, with their consent.

The application and contracting of our products, applications and services by parents or guardians in their own name for their subsequent use by minors, implies knowledge and acceptance of their responsibility for all uses made by the minors in their charge, whether or not they are authorised by them.
If they allow the minor in their care to use our products, services and applications, they will do so under their exclusive supervision and responsibility, with full and unreserved acceptance of their respective conditions and of this policy.

Voicemod operates and supports its products, services and applications from Europe (Spain) and worldwide, without prejudice to the use of platforms and suppliers located in other countries within the framework of its provision, subject to the provisions of the data protection regulations in force at any given time.
 
User data may be stored or processed on our servers in Europe, without prejudice to the fact that it may be stored or processed in other countries where our suppliers related to our services and applications have their presence, operate or maintain their facilities.
Suppliers that may participate in our services and applications located outside the EU and the European Economic Area (EEA) must have an adequate level of protection, under the conditions and guarantees required by law and contract.
Any international transfer will be carried out in compliance with the current legal framework.
Initially, we do not carry out international transfers of data processed on our servers in Europe and, if they could be carried out in the future or processed outside the European Economic Area (EEA), they will be carried out in accordance with the European legal framework in force and by means of transfer mechanisms authorized by the same.
The data transfers that may be carried out will be those necessary to operate and supply the applications, products and services described for the indicated purposes.

SECURITY MEASURES
 
Voicemod is committed to complying with its obligation of confidentiality and secrecy regarding the personal data it processes and adopts the administrative, technical and physical security measures required by the legislation on privacy in order to reasonably ensure their protection and avoid their alteration, loss, treatment or unauthorized access, taking into account at all times the state of technology.
However, we cannot fully guarantee the absolute invulnerability of our security systems or those of third parties, since no security measure currently in place is absolutely unbreakable, and Voicemod will therefore not be liable under any circumstances for any incidents that may arise in relation to personal data when they are derived from an attack or unauthorized access to its systems in such a way that it is impossible to detect them by the security systems in place, without prejudice to the possible obligation to report the event to the competent authorities and users concerned.
 
Voicemod is specifically subject to the European data protection legal framework and, in particular, to the GDPR Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), as well as to other applicable national and international regulations.
