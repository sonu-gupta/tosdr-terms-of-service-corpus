As discussed further below, we and our service providers (which are third party companies that work on our behalf), may use a variety of technologies, including cookies, SDKs, and similar tools, to assist in collecting this information.

Our Websites.
When you use our Websites, we collect and analyze information such as your IP address, browser types, browser language, operating system, the state or country from which you accessed the Services, software and hardware attributes (including device IDs) referring and exit pages and URLs, platform type, the number of clicks, files you download, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the terms you use in searches on our sites, the date and time you used the Services, error logs, and other similar information.

Location Information.
When you use the Services, we and our service providers may automatically collect general location information (e.g., IP address, city/state and or postal code associated with an IP address) from your computer or mobile device.
This information allows us to enable access to content that varies based on a userâs general location (e.g., to provide you with accurate sales tax information and to deliver content customized to your location).
We will ask your permission before collecting your precise GPS location information.
In such instances, we will use your precise geo-location information to provide customized services, content, promotional offers and other information that may be of interest to you.
If you no longer wish for us and our service providers to collect and use GPS location information, you may disable the location features on your device.
Please see your device manufacturer settings.

Our Use of Cookies and Similar Online Tools.
To collect the information discussed in this Section, we and our service providers use web server logs, cookies, tags, SDKs, tracking pixels, and other similar tracking technologies.
We use these technologies to offer you a more tailored experience.

A web server log is a file where website activity is stored.
An SDK is a set of tools and/or code that we embed in our Apps and software to allow third parties to collect information about how users interact with the Services.

(iii) understand the parts of the Services you have visited and used.
(iv), enhance your user experience by delivering and measuring the effectiveness of content and advertising tailored to your interests.
(v) perform searches and analytics.

(2) measure popularity of the Services and associated advertising.
and (3) access user cookies.

As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather information through other methods.
Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether.

Online AdvertisingThe Services may integrate third-party advertising technologies (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Facebook, Google Ad Words, TikTok, Criteo and others) that use cookies, pixels, and other technologies to deliver relevant content and advertising for Ro products on the Services, as well as on other websites you visit and other applications you use.
The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you enter such as your searches, demographic data, and other information we collect from you.

If you began using the Services after October 14th, 2021, we may also share customer information such as your email address with third-party advertising networks that use such information to better target advertising to you regarding Ro products and services, as well as other products and services, as you browse the internet.

We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your device you use to access the Services by non-affiliated third party advertising network services.

If you are a California resident, the CCPA allows you to make certain requests about your personal information.
Specifically, the CCPA allows you to request us to:

Inform you about the categories of personal information we collect or disclose about you.
the categories of sources of such information.
the business or commercial purpose for collecting your personal information.
and the categories of third parties with whom we share/disclose personal information.
Provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you.
Delete certain information we have about you.

The CCPA further provides you with the right to not be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising your rights.
Please note that certain information may be exempt from such requests under California law.
For example, we need certain information in order to provide the Services to you.
We also will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before responding to a request.
If you are a California resident and you would like to exercise any of your data rights under California law, please click here to submit your request through our webform.
Alternatively, you can email us at california-privacy@ro.co.

Sale of Personal Information.
The CCPA requires companies that âsellâ (as defined in the CCPA) your personal information to provide you with notice and an opportunity to opt out.
If you began using the Services prior to October 14th, 2021, Ro has not sold (and will not sell) information collected prior to that date that identifies you such as your name, email address, phone number, or postal address.
Like many companies with an internet presence, we do work with third parties that provide marketing and advertising services to us, including interest-based advertising services, and these third parties may place tags, pixels, cookies, beacons, and other similar tracking mechanisms on our Website and App and collect your online identifiers.
Because of the CCPAâs broad definitions of âsaleâ and âpersonal information,â making certain online identifiers available to these companies so that they can provide marketing and advertising services to Ro may be considered a âsaleâ under the CCPA .
To opt out of sharing your information with participating third parties for interest-based advertising, please visit the Network Advertising Initiativeâs Consumer Opt-Out link, the Digital Advertising Allianceâs Consumer Opt-Out link, or Your Online Choices.
Please note that these opt-outs are device and browser based, so you will need to opt out on each of your devices and browsers.
For more information, see the Online Analytics and Advertising Section above.
If you began using the Services after our Privacy Policy was updated on October 14th, 2021, as discussed above in the âOnline Advertisingâ section, we may also share information such as your email address with third-party advertising networks that use such information to better target advertising to you regarding Ro products and services, as well as other products and services, as you browse the internet.
This sharing may be considered a âsaleâ under the CCPA.
To opt out of the sale of your information under the CCPA as a California resident, please click here.

Shine the Light Disclosure.
The California âShine the Lightâ law gives residents of California the right under certain circumstances to request information from us regarding the manner in which we share certain categories of personal information (as defined in the Shine the Light law) with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
