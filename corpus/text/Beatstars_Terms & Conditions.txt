You may have your CPA make those examinations only for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of the statements sent to you.
All such examinations will be in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (âGAAPâ) procedures and regulations.
Your CPA may make such an examination for a particular statement only once, and only within one (1) year after the date we send you that statement.
Your CPA may make such an examination only during our usual business hours, and only at the place where such books and records are maintained in the ordinary course of business.

Auto-Renewal of Membership

 Your subscription to the applicable subscription on the Service will automatically renew at the end of your Subscription Term continuously and indefinitely without action by the member, and the membership fee is charged to the member at the time of renewal.
An enrollee whose membership fee has been paid is entitled to all privileges included in the membership until the membership is cancelled by the enrolled member as set forth in the paragraph below.
By providing your payment method information for your subscription, you are agreeing to pay a subscription fee, that will automatically renew, at the then current rate, unless you cancel prior to the expiration of the current Subscription Term, and any applicable taxes and service fees (collectively, "Fees").

 The Fees will be charged to your original payment method automatically at the beginning of your Subscription Term, and at the beginning of each renewal Subscription Term thereafter on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your current Subscription Term, unless you cancel your subscription or your account is suspended or terminated pursuant to these Terms.
The renewal Subscription Term will be the same length as your initial Subscription Term unless otherwise disclosed to you at the time of sale.
The rate for the renewal Subscription Term will be the then current subscription-rate.

 The Fees charged to your payment method may vary from Subscription Term to Subscription Term due to changes in your subscription plan or applicable taxes, and you authorize BeatStars to charge your payment method for these amounts.
BeatStars reserves the right to change the pricing of subscriptions at any time.

 We may require additional verifications or information before accepting any order.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that, if we cancel all or a portion of your order or if we provide you less than the quantity you ordered, your sole and exclusive remedy is either that: (a) we will issue a credit to your credit card account in the amount charged for the cancelled portion or the quantity not provided (if your credit card has already been charged for the order).
or (b) we will not charge your credit card for the cancelled portion of the order or the quantity not provided.

 Do not assume that a cancellation or change of an order you have placed with BeatStars has been effected until you receive a confirmation from BeatStars via email or the Service.
As stated above, you will be responsible for, and your credit card or third-party payment account may be charged for, the payment of all fees associated with orders already processed or shipped before your cancellation/change request or a request to terminate your account was received.




No Responsibility to Sell Mispriced Products or Services

However, we are human, and therefore we do not warrant that specifications or pricing on the Service is complete, accurate, reliable, current, or error-free.

Additional terms may apply.

Community Usage Rules


 As a user of the Service, these Community Usage Rules ("Rules") are here to help you understand the conduct that is expected of visitors of the Service's online forums and work spaces ("Communities").

 Nature of Rules.
Your participation in the Communities is subject to all of the Terms, including these Rules: 

Your User - Generated Content.
All of your User-Generated Content either must be original with you or you must have all necessary rights in it from third parties in order to permit you to comply with these Terms and any Additional Terms.
Your User-Generated Content should not contain any visible logos, phrases, or trademarks that belong to third parties.
Do not use any User-Generated Content that belongs to other people and pass it off as your own.
this includes any content that you might have found elsewhere on the Internet.
If anyone contributes to your User-Generated Content or has any rights to your User-Generated Content, or if anyone appears or is referred to in the User-Generated Content, then you must also have their permission to submit such User-Generated Content to BeatStars (for example, if someone has taken a picture of you and your friend, and you submit that photo to BeatStars as your User-Generated Content, then you must obtain your friend's and the photographer's permission to do so.).


Speaking of Photos.
No Pictures, Videos, or Images of Anyone Other Than You and Your Friends and Family.
If you choose to submit photos to the Service, link to embedded videos, or include other images of real people, then make sure they are of you or of you and someone you know - and only if you have their express permission to submit it.


Act Appropriately.
All of your Service activities must be venue appropriate, as determined by us.
Be respectful of others' opinions and comments so we can continue to build Communities for everyone to enjoy.
If you think your User-Generated Content might offend someone or be embarrassing to someone, then chances are it probably will and it doesn't belong on the Service.
Cursing, harassing, bullying, stalking, insulting comments, personal attacks, gossip, and similar actions are prohibited.
Your User-Generated Content must not threaten, abuse, or harm others, and it must not include any negative comments that are connected to race, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, or physical handicap.
Your User-Generated Content must not be defamatory, slanderous, indecent, obscene, pornographic, or sexually explicit.


Do Not Use for Commercial or Political Purposes.
Your User-Generated Content must not advertise or promote a product or service or other commercial activity, or a politician, public servant, or law.


Do Not Use for Inappropriate Purposes.
Your User-Generated Content must not promote any infringing, illegal, or other similarly inappropriate activity.


Be Honest and Do Not Misrepresent Yourself or Your User - Generated Content.
Do not impersonate any other person, user, or company, and do not submit User-Generated Content that you believe may be false, fraudulent, deceptive, inaccurate, or misleading, or that misrepresents your identity or affiliation with a person or company.


Others Can See.
We hope that you will use the Communities to exchange information and content and have venue appropriate discussions about job search-related issues with other members.
However, please remember that the Communities are public or semi-public and User-Generated Content that you submit on the Service within a Community may be accessible and viewable by other users.

and your electronic or physical signature.

 Please note that the DMCA provides that any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification may be subject to liability.

However, we will not do this if we first receive notice at the addresses above that the party who sent us the DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice has filed a lawsuit asking a court for an order restraining the person who provided the material from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on the Service.
You should also be aware that we may forward the Counter-Notification to the party who sent us the DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice.

 Dispute Resolution




General

Certain portions of this Paragraph L are deemed to be a "written agreement to arbitrate" pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act.
You and BeatStars agree that we intend that this Paragraph L satisfies the "writing" requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act.


 First - Try to Resolve Disputes and Excluded Disputes. If any controversy, allegation, or claim arises out of or relates to the Service, the Content, your User-Generated Content, these Terms, or any Additional Terms, whether heretofore or hereafter arising (collectively, "Dispute"), or to any of BeatStars' actual or alleged intellectual property rights (an "Excluded Dispute", which includes those actions set forth in Paragraph L(1)(b), then you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Dispute or Excluded Dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it.
Our notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us.
But if no such information exists or if such information is not current, then we have no obligation under this Paragraph L.
Your notice to us must be sent via email to support@BeatStars.com.
For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, BeatStars and you will engage in a dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the Dispute or Excluded Dispute, though nothing will require either you or BeatStars to resolve the Dispute or Excluded Dispute on terms with respect to which you and BeatStars, in each of our sole discretion, are not comfortable.


 Binding Arbitration. If we cannot resolve a Dispute as set forth in Paragraph L (1)(a) (or agree to arbitration in writing with respect to an Excluded Dispute) within sixty (60) days of receipt of the notice, then ANY AND ALL DISPUTES ARISING BETWEEN YOU AND BeatStars (WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, STATUTE, REGULATION, ORDINANCE, TORTâ INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FRAUD, ANY OTHER INTENTIONAL TORT OR NEGLIGENCE,âCOMMON LAW, CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION, RESPONDEAT SUPERIOR, AGENCY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY), WHETHER ARISING BEFORE OR AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THESE TERMS, MUST BE RESOLVED BY FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION.
THIS INCLUDES ANY AND ALL DISPUTES BASED ON ANY PRODUCT OR SERVICE PURCHASED THROUGH THE SERVICE OR ADVERTISING AVAILABLE ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICE.
For U.S.
residents, the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"), not state law, shall govern the arbitrability of all disputes between BeatStars and you regarding these Terms (and any Additional Terms) and the Service, including the "No Class Action Matters" Section below.
BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATE, EACH PARTY IS GIVING UP ITS RIGHT TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD BY A JUDGE OR JURY. BeatStars and you agree, however, that the applicable state, federal or provincial law, as contemplated in Paragraph L(1)(f) below, shall apply to and govern, as appropriate, any and all claims or causes of action, remedies, and damages arising between you and BeatStars regarding these Terms and the Service, whether arising or stated in contract, statute, common law, or any other legal theory, without regard to any jurisdiction's choice of law principles.
Any Dispute will be resolved solely by binding arbitration in accordance with the then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules ("Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), except as modified herein, and the arbitration will be administered by the AAA.
If a party properly submits the Dispute to the AAA for formal arbitration and the AAA is unwilling to set a hearing then either party can elect to have the arbitration administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services Inc.
("JAMS") using JAMS' streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, or by any other arbitration administration service that you and an officer or legal representative of BeatStars consent to in writing.
If an in-person arbitration hearing is required and you are a U.S.
resident, then it will be conducted Austin, Texas.
You and we will pay the administrative and arbitrator's fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules.
but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require BeatStars to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this Paragraph L to be enforceable, then BeatStars will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration.
The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator who will apply and be bound by these Terms and any Additional Terms, and will determine any Dispute according to applicable law and facts based upon the record and no other basis, and will issue a reasoned award only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration and class action waiver provisions are for the court to decide.
This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms or the Service.
 You can obtain AAA and JAMS procedures, rules, and fee information as follows: AAA: 800.778.7879 and http://www.adr.org and JAMS: 800.352.5267 and http://www.jamsadr.com.


 Limited Time to File Claims.TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU OR WE WANT TO ASSERT A DISPUTE (BUT NOT A EXCLUDED DISPUTE) AGAINST THE OTHER, THEN YOU OR WE MUST COMMENCE IT (BY DELIVERY OF WRITTEN NOTICE AS SET FORTH IN PARAGRAPH L(1)(A)) WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE DISPUTE ARISES -- OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED. Commencing means, as applicable: (a) by delivery of written notice as set forth above in Paragraph L (a).
(b) filing for arbitration as set forth in Paragraph L (1)(b).
or Paragraph L(f) filing an action in state, Federal or provincial court.


 Injunctive Relief.
The foregoing provisions of this Paragraph L will not apply to any legal action taken by BeatStars to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in connection with, any loss, cost, or damage (or any potential loss, cost, or damage) relating to the Service, any Content, your User-Generated Content and/or BeatStars' intellectual property rights (including such BeatStars may claim that may be in dispute), BeatStars' operations, and/or BeatStars' products or services.


 No Class Action Matters.
YOU AND BEATSTARS AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OR AS AN ASSOCIATION. Disputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be joined or consolidated with any other arbitrations or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party.
There shall be no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on any basis involving Disputes brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, or other persons or entities similarly situated.
But if, for any reason, any court with competent jurisdiction holds that this restriction is unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement in Paragraph L to arbitrate will not apply and the Dispute must be brought exclusively in court pursuant to Paragraph L(1)(f).
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Paragraph L, any and all issues relating to the scope, interpretation and enforceability of the class action waiver provisions contained herein  (described in this "No Class Action Matters" section), are to be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction, and not by the arbitrator.
The arbitrator does not have the power to vary these class action waiver provisions.


 Jurisdictional Issues. Except where arbitration is required above or with respect to the enforcement of any arbitration decision or award, any action or proceeding relating to any Dispute or Excluded Dispute arising hereunder may only be instituted in state or Federal court in Austin, Texas.
Accordingly, you and BeatStars consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts for such matters.


 Small Claims Matters Are Excluded from Arbitration Requirement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either of us may bring qualifying claim of Disputes (but not Excluded Disputes) in small claims court of competent jurisdiction.


 Governing Law. These Terms and any Additional Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with, and any Dispute and Excluded Dispute will be resolved in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to its conflicts of law provisions.

and (vii) BeatStars Parties' use of the information or content that you submit to us (including your User-Generated Content and Music Content) (all of the foregoing, "Claims and Losses").

 You will cooperate as fully required by BeatStars Parties in the defense of any Claims and Losses.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, BeatStars Parties retain the exclusive right to settle, compromise, and pay any and all Claims and Losses.
BeatStars Parties reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any Claims and Losses.
You will not settle any Claims and Losses without, in each instance, the prior written consent of an officer of a BeatStars Party.

 Furthermore, you agree to, and you hereby, defend, indemnify, and hold BeatStars Parties harmless from and against any and all, but not limited to, any Claims made by a PRO or music publisher with respect to any public performances or communications to the public of any musical works embodied in Your Content, any contributor to any sound recording included within Your Content, including claims from any unions, guilds, background musicians for vocalists, engineers, etc., or any other party for any use or misuse of any other forms of intellectual property or proprietary rights in Your Content, including, but not limited to, trademark rights and invasions of the right of privacy or publicity.
You agree to reimburse us, on demand, for any payment made by us at any time with respect to any Claims to which the foregoing indemnity applies.
Pending the resolution of any claim, demand, or action, we may, at our election, withhold payment of any monies otherwise payable to you hereunder in an amount which does not exceed your potential liability to us pursuant to this Section.

 If we make an indemnification request to you under this Section, we may permit you to control the defense, disposition or settlement of the matter at your own expenses, provided that you shall not, without our prior written consent, enter into any settlement or agree to any disposition that requires any admission of liability by BeatStars or imposes any conditions or obligations on BeatStars other than the payment of monies that are readily measurable for purposes of determining your monetary indemnification or reimbursement obligations to us.
If we, in our reasonable and good faith judgment conclude that you are not capable of defending your or our interests against any Claims, then we shall have the option to control the defense in any matter or litigation through counsel of our own choosing to defend against any such Claim for which you owe BeatStars an indemnification, and the costs of such counsel, as well as any court costs, shall be at your expense.




 Operation of Service.
Availability of Products and Services.
International Issues

 The Service is operated in the United States, and is primarily intended for users located in the U.S.
BeatStars makes no representation that the Service is appropriate or available for use beyond the U.S.
If you use the Service from other locations, you are doing so on your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws regarding your online conduct and acceptable content, if and to the extent local laws apply.

 We reserve the right to limit the availability of the Service and/or the provision of any content, program, product, service, or other feature described or available on the Service to any person, entity, geographic area, or jurisdiction, at any time and in our sole discretion, and to limit the quantities of any content, program, product, service, or other feature that we provide.
You and we disclaim any application to these Terms of the Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.




 Severability.
Interpretation

 If any provision of these Terms, or any Additional Terms, is for any reason deemed invalid, unlawful, void, or unenforceable by a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms or the Additional Terms, and the invalidity of the provision will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of these Terms or the Additional Terms (which will remain in full force and effect).

 To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to waive, and you hereby waive, any applicable statutory and common law that may permit a contract to be construed against its drafter.
Wherever the word "including" is used in these Terms or any Additional Terms, the word will be deemed to mean "including, without limitation,".
The summaries of provisions and section headings are provided for convenience only and shall not limit the full Terms.




 Communications

 As permitted by applicable law, when you communicate with us electronically, such as via email and text message, you consent to receive communications from us electronically.
Please note that we are not obligated to respond to inquiries that we receive.
You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.

Survival

 BeatStars reserves the right, without any limitation, to: (i) investigate any suspected breaches of its Service security or its information technology or other systems or networks, (ii) investigate any suspected breaches of these Terms and any Additional Terms, (iii) investigate any information obtained by BeatStars in connection with reviewing law enforcement databases or complying with criminal laws, (iv) involve and cooperate with law enforcement authorities in investigating any of the foregoing matters, (v) prosecute violators of these Terms and any Additional Terms, and (vi) discontinue the Service, in whole or in part, or, except as may be expressly set forth in any Additional Terms, suspend or terminate your access to it, in whole or in part, including any user accounts or registrations, at any time, without notice, for any reason and without any obligation to you or any third party.

 Any suspension or termination will not affect your obligations to BeatStars under these Terms or any Additional Terms.
Upon suspension or termination of your access to the Service, or upon notice from BeatStars, all rights granted to you under these Terms or any Additional Terms will cease immediately, and you agree that you will immediately discontinue use of the Service.
The provisions of these Terms and any Additional Terms (including the terms applicable to User-Generated Content), which by their nature should survive your suspension or termination will survive, including the rights and licenses you grant to BeatStars in these Terms, as well as the indemnities, releases, disclaimers, and limitations on liability and the provisions regarding jurisdiction, choice of law, no class action, and mandatory arbitration.




 Assignment

 BeatStars may assign its rights and obligations under these Terms and any Additional Terms, in whole or in part, to any party at any time without any notice.
These Terms and any Additional Terms may not be assigned by you, and you may not delegate your duties under them, without the prior written consent of an officer of BeatStars.




 No Waiver

 Except as expressly set forth in these Terms or any Additional Terms: (i) no failure or delay by you or BeatStars in exercising any of rights, powers, or remedies hereunder will operate as a waiver of that or any other right, power, or remedy, and (ii) no waiver or modification of any term of these Terms or any Additional Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by the party against whom the waiver or modification is sought to be enforced.
For avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall be construed to restrict BeatStars' right to amend these Terms or any Additional Terms as otherwise permitted in those agreements.
