SPECIFIC INFORMATION ABOUT COOKIES USED ON OUR WEBSITES 
Freepik only displays advertisements to its free users: if you become a "premium" user we will not show you advertisements.
To show you this advertising, for example, we use cookies.

Freepik only hires tier-1 service providers (such as OneTrust) and advertising providers (such as IAB vendors, Google).

Regarding the control and management of cookies and similar technologies, we use One Trust âcookie complianceâ technology, based on IAB Europe âTransparency and Consent Frameworkâ.
Through our cookie setting panel (powered by One Trust) you can consent or reject, granularly, the use of our cookies and those of third parties, as well as certain data processing carried out by third parties based on their legitimate interests.
By selecting "Reject all" you will also block said data processing.
Cookies (and similar technologies) help us better understand what interests and helps our users most, and to improve our services.
You can find extended information and clarification about each category of cookies used on our websites through our cookie settings panel, to which you access by clicking on âCookie settingâ, located at the bottom of all our webs, in section âLegalâ.
Please find below the description of some of them: Session and persistent cookies We use the so-called âsession cookiesâ, which are stored exclusively during the time of your visit to any of our websites.
In addition, we and our partners use "persistent cookies" to withhold information about those users who repeatedly access any of our websites. Analytical, advertising cookies...
We use personalized advertising cookies (which we will talk about below) and web analytics cookies, to know the number of visitors to the different pages and sections of our website, their interactions and duration of their visits, place of entry and exit, to try to improve our content and its capacity to generate interaction.
We use Google Analytics, Cloudfare and Hotjar cookies to measure the results of visits and customer acquisition, and to analyze traffic and, for example, detect potentially malicious âbotsâ. Cookies can also be âfirst-partyâ or âthird-partyâ cookies "First-party" cookies are those that are sent to the user's terminal equipment from a device or domain managed by Freepik as editor of the website from which the services requested by the user are provided.
"Third-party" cookies are those that are sent to the user's terminal equipment from a device or domain that is not managed by Freepik, but by another organization, which processes the data obtained through such cookies.
You can find out complete information about the data processing carried out by these third parties (lawful bases, international data transfers carried out, retention periods, exercise of rights of access, erasure, restriction of processing, portability and rectification, and how exercise your rights, ...
in their respective policies linked in this text and in the cookie tables).
You will find detailed information about all cookies used on each of our websites (www.freepik.com.
www.flaticon.com.
www.slidesgo.com and www.freepikcompany.com) in the cookie table at the end of this text. Information on the processing of data shared with our advertising partners Preliminary information In the field of online advertising, cookies and other similar technologies allow website visitors to be recognized or singled out (but not identified in the traditional sense of the word, that is, by their names, surnames, ID number or email address) and classified into groups or "audiences" based on their interests.
Knowing your interests and personalizing the advertising displayed to you in accordance with them is possible thanks to the use of these cookies and similar technologies. Third-parties advertising We allocate the exploitation of our advertising spaces to companies that market them to third parties who then insert their advertisements on our website, depending on your habits and interests.
Consequently, Freepik offers its advertising spaces based on real-time biddings through two channels or platforms:

Google AdManager and
Various platforms that also market our advertising spaces among their own partners through header bidding techniques (Rubicon Project, Index Exchange, DistrictM, Amazon APS, OpenX).

Through these real-time biddings, companies interested in our advertising spaces, bid to display their ads on our website, customizing their advertising based on the user.
Freepik logically benefits from the advertising displayed, enables the collection of user information through cookies and captures their consent to this extent through its websites.
But here is where our intervention and responsibility ends.
Freepik cannot and indeed does not control the advertisements displayed, nor does it participate in the data processing operations carried out on these platforms to select the user receiving the ads and the advertiser placing such ads.
For these purposes, and to guarantee the quality of both the advertising and the advertisers, Freepik only markets its advertisement space with the leading platforms worldwide (IAB those others mentioned in the cookies policy), as previously stated.
You can learn more about Google AdManager and the Header Bidding service providers, in their respective links as provided below.
You can browse the full list of IAB Europe partners (advertisers) here. You can prevent targeted advertising from being specifically shown to you on Freepik websites in the following ways: Through our cookie setting panel: by granularly accepting or rejecting the different categories of cookies used, you can authorize or not the processing of your data for the purposes of profiling you, the placing of personalized advertising, and the rest of the processing operations described hereby.
You can also disable cookies in your browser by installing a plug-in as Ghostery or Privacy Badger or through a rejection system ("opt-out") provided by some third parties that install cookies on our website, as Google (behavioral advertising) (requires Google log-in). Adobeâs advertising 
Freepik, in turn, offers third-party advertising (Adobe), and tracks its users through Google Analytics when they click on its advertising banners, to check the performance in terms of conversion rate on that advertiser's website. Freepik advertising 
Freepik maintains an âaffiliateâ advertising program on different websites that will redirect its users to our website when they click on our banners or advertisements.
We verify and track the performance of our affiliates through the software tool Postaffiliate Pro.

Moreover, Freepik contracts personalized advertising services of Pinterest, Google Ads and Bing Ads to attract potential new users to our websites who have been profiled by such platforms according to their interests.
Freepik selects, among these profiles, those who we understand may be interested in our products (for example, those users who had visited our websites, or users within a determined age or geographical location).
These platforms integrate "cookies" and other technologies on our website.
These technologies allow them, after you have provided consent, to track, for example, whether their users have only accessed Freepikâs websites to just quit, they have downloaded any products or have become Premium users.
Then, they provide us with this information in an aggregated and anonymous way to bill us accordingly, allowing us to better understand the price and profitability of our advertising campaigns on each platform.
Furthermore, we may show advertisements to visitors who have left our website, for example without registering, to try to convince them to do so (retargeting techniques).
Regarding these data processing operations, Freepik is a "joint controller" together with each of those platforms, in relation to (i) the selection of the interests of its users to whom we request our advertising is displayed.
(ii) their monitoring and observation on our websites.
and (iii) the provision of statistical and aggregated data to Freepik on the result of these campaigns, that is, the conversion rate , if applicable, into our clients.
All these processing operations are carried out without Freepik being able to identify you: we only identify you when you register as a free or premium user.
Otherwise, Freepik does not participate in and therefore is not a controller of the processing operations that advertisers and platforms carry out for their own purposes, either prior or subsequent to those other processing operations carried out together with Freepik. International data transfers Regarding Freepik advertising, by using Facebook and Google services, we participate in the international transfer of personal data to countries with a potentially lower level of protection than that imposed by the General Data Protection Regulation.
These international transfers are therefore based on standard contractual clauses.
In relation to third-party advertising, Freepik's controllership is limited to the duties of providing information and obtaining our website visitorsâ consent for the purpose of using their cookies to show personalized advertising.
 Additional Information Below, and in the corresponding cookie tables, Freepik provides you with the links to the information offered by each of these companies and platforms regarding the joint controllership situations already described and their own processing operations (lawful bases, international data transfers carried out, retention periods or the exercise of a right of access, erasure, restriction of processing, portability and rectification).
We remind you again that you can exercise your rights of access, restrictions of processing and / or erasure in relation to the processing of your personal data carried out jointly with the aforementioned platforms:

Through our email rpd@freepik.com, if you are a registered user of Freepik.
And otherwise, before the platforms in which you have a user account (because we will not be able to identify you).
