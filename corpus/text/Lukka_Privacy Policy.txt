This policy applies to any individualâs personal data which is in our possession or under our control.
By visiting, accessing, or using our Sites or our Products, you acknowledge that we use your personal information as set out in this policy.
This policy does not apply to anonymized data as it cannot be used to identify you.

An identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, email address, an identification number, location data, and online identifier or to one or more factors specific to his/her physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity. 
 
In order to provide you with the Products, we may ask you to provide us with certain details or personal data.
The collection of personal information is limited to what is necessary to meet the Companyâs objectives.
Some examples of personal data that we may collect are:

Other Information: Information from other companies or third parties when you connect a third party account or service with the Lukka Products or when we may use service providers to supplement the personal data you give us (e.g., validate your email address).

 
You have the right to refuse, deny, or withdraw consent on providing us with any of the personal information described above at any time (see also section 12).
However, we may not be able to offer our Products to you if we agree to such a request.
 
Should our Company develop or acquire additional personal information, outside of what was defined above, about its customers for our use, we will update this policy to reflect such additional information.

Maintain the safety and security of our users, our Site, our Products and our business.
Send you and your agents announcements relating to security, privacy or other administrative-related communications.
Note that you may not opt out of these communications as they are not marketing oriented and therefore do not rely on consent.

Conduct audits related to our interactions with you.
Detect security incidents and protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity.
Conduct internal research for technological improvement and other internal operations.

The Companyâs methods of collecting personal information are reviewed by our management before they are implemented to confirm that personal information is obtained fairly, without intimidation or deception, and lawfully, adhering to all relevant rules of law, whether derived from statute or common law, relating to the collection of personal information. 
 
If you are based in the European Economic Area (EEA), use of personal information under EU data protection laws must be justified under one of a number of legal âgroundsâ and we are required to set out the grounds in respect of each use in this policy.
We note the grounds we use to justify each use of your information in each heading below.
