If any part of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law, including but not limited to, (a) the warranty disclaimers, (b) the liability limitations, and (c) the requirement that the existence, content or results of arbitration remain confidential, only that provision or part so found, and not the entire Agreement, will be inoperative.
