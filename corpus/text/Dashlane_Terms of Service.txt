         Dashlane Terms of Service


Our âTerms of Serviceâ are below.
You will have to accept them if you want to use our software, and we know that they are long and can be hard to follow.
We want you to understand what you are agreeing to, so each section starts with a short âplain Englishâ summary.
The summaries are not part of the Terms, but are provided as an aid to understanding them.



LAST UPDATED: December 1, 2019 (effective January 1, 2020)


1.
Introduction



Summary: 



This is a legal contract between you and Dashlane.
You must be at least 18 years old to accept these Terms, which include our 
Privacy Policy
.
We may change these Terms on occasion, and by continuing to use our Services after a change, you accept the revised Terms.
The Terms donât apply to sites and services you may access through the Services that are operated by other companies.
Any subscription for paid Services will automatically renew unless you cancel it within thirty days of the renewal date.
If you are in the United States, any legal claim involving these Terms or the Services will be settled by arbitration, not by a trial in front of a judge or jury, or through a class action lawsuit.
These Terms are governed by New York State law.



a.
Dashlane, Inc.
and its affiliates (âDashlaneâ, or âweâ and its derivatives) operate
www.dashlane.com (together with any subdomains, the âSiteâ) and provide our users (each user, âyouâ) with mobile, desktop, and web applications (each an âAppâ and, collectively, the âAppsâ).
These Terms of Service (the âTermsâ) are a binding agreement between you and Dashlane SAS (if you are a French resident) or Dashlane USA, Inc.
(for everyone else) regarding your use of the Site, the Apps, and any related services we may perform (the Site, Apps and services together, the âServicesâ).
As used in these Terms, a âdeviceâ means any computer, phone, tablet, or other computer hardware on which Apps run.

b.
By using the Services, you represent that you (i) may legally do so, (ii) are at least 18 years old (or the age of majority in the jurisdiction where you reside), and (iii) have the power to enter into a binding contract with usâeither individually or on behalf of the entity for whom you are using the Services.
You must affirmatively accept these Terms and the
Privacy Policy when initially downloading or accessing an App.

c.
These Terms do not apply to third-party websites, services and applications (âThird-Party Servicesâ) you may access through the Services.
Unless required by applicable law, we are not responsible for the content or practices of Third-Party Services and provide links to them only for your convenience.
We recommend you review the terms and policies of any Third-Party Service you access through the Services.
d.
WHEN YOU PAY FOR A SUBSCRIPTION TO THE SERVICES, YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW FOR ADDITIONAL PERIODS OF THE SAME DURATION AS THE INITIAL SUBSCRIPTION AT THE THEN-CURRENT RATE FOR SUCH SERVICES, UNLESS YOU CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 7(c).
e.
Your use of certain Services may be subject to additional terms (âSupplemental Termsâ).
If any provision of the Supplemental Terms conflicts with these Terms, the Supplemental Terms will control with respect to such Service.

f.
Dashlane Business is our offering for businesses.
If you are purchasing a Dashlane Business license, you will be bound by
Dashlane Business Terms, and not these Terms, with respect to your use of the Services.
Individual users accessing Dashlane under a Dashlane Business license are still required to accept these Terms, since Dashlane Business users also receive access to a âPersonalâ space that is not available to the Business account administrator.

g.
THESE TERMS REQUIRE THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS, AND LIMIT THE REMEDIES AVAILABLE IF THERE IS A DISPUTE ABOUT THESE TERMS OR YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES.
By accepting these Terms, you are waiving certain rights to legal remedies you may otherwise have.
Arbitration is not permitted in certain jurisdictions.
Please see Sections 10 and 12 for more information.

h.
Any dispute or claim arising under these Terms or related to the Services will be governed by and interpreted according to the laws of the State of New York, consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, without giving effect to any conflicts of law provisions that would require a different result.
The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the Sale of Goods will not apply to these Terms.
i.
We may change these Terms at any time.
When we do so, we will post the updated Terms on this page and also inform you through the Services, as applicable.
Any changes to the Terms will be effective immediately for new users and thirty (30) days after we post notice of the changes on the Site or inform users of the changes via the Services for existing users.

LICENSE



Summary: 



You have a limited license to use our Apps for your personal or (if applicable) internal business use, along with any documentation and updates applicable to the Apps and Services you use.
You may not (try to) hack, reverse-engineer, break the law using, or otherwise do âbadâ things with or to the Services.
We are not required to support the Apps (but we do and will continue to do so).
Your use of mobile Apps is subject to additional terms imposed by the âApp Storeâ from which you downloaded the App.
Keeping our Apps compatible with the rest of the digital world takes a lot of work, and sometimes Apps may not work with a particular site or service, even if they did before.



a.
License.
Dashlane grants you a personal, non-exclusive, revocable, non-sublicensable, and non-transferable license to download and install the Apps in object code format, on one or more devices, solely for your own personal or internal business purposes.
The license includes the right to (i) access, use, and make a reasonable number of copies of any published descriptions of the functionality, technical requirements, or use of the Services (collectively, âDocumentationâ), and (ii) use any changes to the Apps made available to all users of such Apps at no additional cost (each an âUpdateâ) when each Update is made generally available.
Updates may be installed automatically or may require installation by you.
Failure to install an Update may result in an App or the Services not functioning correctly.

 xiii.

attempt to do any of the above.

Dashlane may take any actions it deems reasonable, including terminating your Account, for any breach of these restrictions (or the Terms generally).

c.
Support.
The license granted in Section 3(a) does not entitle you to receive any support for the Apps or Services, though we may choose to (and do) provide it.
While Dashlane strives to constantly improve the Services, we are not required to fix any specific error, bug, or issue except as set forth in Section 9(a).
We generally support only the current version of the platform or operating system on which the Services run (e.g., iOS, Windows).

d.
App Store Restrictions.

 i.
The availability of mobile Apps is dependent on the entity from whom you obtained the App (each an âApp Storeâ).
The relevant App Store is not a party to these Terms, and Dashlane, not the App Store, is solely responsible for the Services and any related claims (e.g., legal compliance or intellectual property infringement).
You are responsible for connectivity fees associated with your use of any Apps or App Store and any fees charged by an App Store in connection with the Services.
You will comply with all applicable App Store terms and policies when using any mobile App.
The App Store (and its subsidiaries) are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms and may enforce them.

 ii.
You will only use Apps accessed through or downloaded from the Apple App Store (A) on an Apple-branded product that runs iOS (Appleâs proprietary operating system), and (B) as permitted by the âUsage Rulesâ in the Apple App Store Terms of Service.

e.
Third-Party Services.
The Apps are designed to work with many Third-Party Services, however, their continued compatibility with any specific application, site, or service is dependent on such Third-Party Service.
To maintain compatibility with particular applications, you may need to update an App or a third party application from time to time.
We cannot guarantee that any currently supported Third-Party Services will remain compatible with the Services.

4.
FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS 


Summary: 



We provide the Services, but you are responsible for how you use themâboth in making sure the data you store in the Apps is correct and for how it is used (including when you use the Services to share data with others).
Like most providers of consumer applications, while we make every effort to ensure that our features work correctly, we cannot and do not guarantee that they will always do so.


The Services offer features that save you time and protect your data.
In-depth information about features and availability can be found at
www.dashlane.com/plans.
We may remove features from the Services or certain Apps at any time, and not all features are available with all plans and in all jurisdictions.
And while we strive to ensure the proper operation of the Services, we explicitly do not guarantee that they will work properly at all times, be error-free, or be available on an uninterrupted basis. How you use the Services is up to you, and you acknowledge the following: 
a.
Secured Data.
The Services can be used to store many kinds of data, including contact information, credit card information, IDs (such as a driverâs license or passport), and important notes (collectively âSecured Dataâ).

Dashlane does not and cannot screen Secured Data.
You are solely responsible for the accuracy of the Secured Data and how you use it.

b.
Passwords.

Dashlane provides Dark Web Monitoring on an âas-isâ basis and does not warrant the completeness or accuracy of the results.
