PRIVACY POLICY

ABOUT THE SERVICE



What We Do


Our website helps connect inmates who are seeking non-incarcerated pen-pals to correspond with.
Since our inception, we have expanded from providing just our pen-pal services to providing inmates with the opportunity to post legal, employment, and reintegration profiles, organizing book donations, and providing services aimed directly toward reducing recidivism and raising awareness.
Upon release, we also provide inmates with reintegration kits and various self-help documents.


What We Donât Do



We do not do background checks on any user of the Services, including inmates.
The information in each inmateâs profile, including criminal charges and convictions, is provided by the inmate with no research or any other form of confirmation by us.
Only in select circumstances, when the option is available, do we verify basic inmate information made available through government websites.
We do not provide legal services, legal referrals or legal advice.
We are not a dating site (we encourage friendly communication rather than romantic).
Upon release, we do not provide inmates with housing, employment, financial or other assistance.
