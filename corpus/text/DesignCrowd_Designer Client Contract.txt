 This contract relates to the transfer of rights to work(s) created and submitted using the DesignCrowd Service.
This contract will apply to you in relation to any Project using the DesignCrowd Service, in your capacity as either a "Client" or "Designer".

 2.2 Designer acknowledges and agrees that Client will own the entire rights (including copyright) in and to the Work.
