We use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect some of this information.
If you are using our Mobile App, we may collect this information using our software development kits (âSDKsâ) or APIs the first time the SDK or API is initiated on your Mobile App.
For further information, please review the section below and our Cookie Statement available here.
Service Usage Data may include:



Device information: We collect information about the device and applications you use to access the Service, such as your IP address, your operating system, your browser ID, and other information about your system and connection.
If you are using our Mobile App, we may also collect information about the cellular network associated with your mobile device, your mobile deviceâs operating system or platform, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile deviceâs name and unique device ID, and information about the features of our Mobile App that you accessed.




Log data: Our web servers keep log files that record data each time a device accesses those servers and the nature of each access, including originating IP addresses and your activity in the Service (such as the date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches and other actions you take (for example, which features you used)), device event information (such as system activity, error reports (sometimes called âcrash dumpsâ)), and hardware settings.
We may also access metadata and other information associated with files that you upload into our Service.

(iii) Information we collect from other sources: From time to time, we may obtain information about you from third-party sources, such as public databases, social media platforms, third-party data providers, and our joint marketing partners.

Examples of the information we receive from other sources include demographic information (such as age and gender), device information (such as IP addresses), location (such as city and state), and online behavioral data (such as information about your use of social media websites, page view information and search results and links).
We use this information, alone or in combination with other Personal Information we collect, to enhance our ability to provide relevant marketing and content to you and to develop and provide you with more relevant products, features, and service.
B.
Use of Personal Information
We may use the Personal Information we collect or receive through the Service (alone or in combination with other data we source) for the purposes and on the legal bases identified below:

To bill and collect money owed to us by you to perform our contract with you for the use of the Service or where we have not entered into a contract with you, in accordance with our legitimate interests to operate and administer our Service.
This includes sending you emails, invoices, receipts, notices of delinquency, and alerting you if we need a different credit card number.
We use third parties for secure credit card transaction processing, and those third parties collect billing information to process your orders and credit card payments.
To learn more about the steps we take to safeguard that data, see the "Our Security" section of this privacy policy.
To send you system alert messages in reliance on our legitimate interests in administering the Service and providing certain features.
For example, we may inform you about temporary or permanent changes to our Service, such as planned outages, or send you account, security or compliance notifications, such as new features, version updates, releases, abuse warnings, and changes to this privacy policy.
To communicate with you about your account and provide customer support to perform our contract with you for the use of the Service or where we have not entered into a contract with you, in reliance on our legitimate interests in administering and supporting our Service.
For example, if you use our Mobile Apps, we may ask you if you want to receive push notifications about activity in your account.
If you have opted in to these push notifications and no longer want to receive them, you may turn them off through your operating system.
To enforce compliance with our Standard Terms of Use and applicable law, and to protect the rights and safety of our Members in reliance on our legitimate interest to protect against misuse or abuse of our Service and to pursue remedies available.
This may include developing tools and algorithms that help us prevent violations.
For example, sometimes we review the content our Members send or display to ensure it complies with our Standard Terms of Use.
To improve that process, we have software that helps us find content that may violate our Standard Terms of Use.
We may or our third-party service provider may also review content that our Members send or display.
This benefits all Members who comply with our Standard Terms of Use because it reduces abuse and helps us maintain a reliable platform.
Please do not use Mailchimp to send or display confidential information.
To meet legal requirements, including complying with court orders, valid discovery requests, valid subpoenas, and other appropriate legal mechanisms.
To provide information to representatives and advisors, including attorneys and accountants, to help us comply with legal, accounting, or security requirements in reliance on our legitimate interests.
To prosecute and defend a court, arbitration, or similar legal proceeding.
To respond to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
To provide, support and improve the Service to perform our contract with you for the use of the Service or where we have not entered into a contract with you, in reliance on our legitimate interests in administering and improving the Service and providing certain features.
For example, this may include sharing your information with third parties in order to provide and support our Service or to make certain features of the Service available to you.
When we share your Personal Information with third parties, we take steps to protect your information in a manner that is consistent with our obligations under applicable privacy laws.
For further information about how we share your information, refer to Section 5 below.

To provide suggestions to you and to provide tailored features within our Service that optimize and personalize your experience in reliance on our legitimate interests in administering the Service and providing certain features.
This includes adding features that compare Membersâ email campaigns, using data to suggest other publishers your Contacts may be interested in, or using data to recommend products or services that you may be interested in or that may be relevant to you or your Contacts.
Some of these suggestions are generated through analysis of the data used in our data analytics projects, as described below.
To perform data analytics projects in reliance on our legitimate business interests in improving and enhancing our products and services for our Members.
Our data analytics projects use data from Mailchimp accounts, including Personal Information of Contacts, to provide and improve the Service.
We use information like your sending habits and your Contactsâ purchase history, so we can make more informed predictions, decisions, and products for our Members.
For example, we use data from Mailchimp accounts to enable product recommendation, audience segmentation, and predicted demographics features for our Members.
If you or your Contact prefers not to have their data used for this purpose, you can alter the settings on your account (as described here) to opt out of data analytics projects, or your Contact can opt out of data analytics projects at any time by visiting this page or emailing us at personaldatarequests@mailchimp.com.
As always, we take the privacy of Personal Information seriously, and will continue to implement appropriate safeguards to protect this Personal Information from misuse or unauthorized disclosure.
To combine and anonymize data about our Members and our Member's use of the Service in order to create aggregate, anonymized statistics which we may use to provide certain features within the Service and for promoting and improving the Service in reliance on our legitimate interests.
To personalize the Service, content and advertisements we serve to you in reliance on our legitimate interests in supporting our marketing activities and providing certain features within the Service.
We may use your Personal Information to serve you specifically, such as to deliver marketing information, product recommendations and non-transactional communications (e.g., email, telemarketing calls, SMS, or push notifications) about us, in accordance with your marketing preferences and this privacy policy.

C.
Third-Party Integrations
We may use the Personal Information we collect or receive through the Service, as a processor and as otherwise stated in this privacy policy, to enable your use of the integrations and plugins you choose to connect to your Mailchimp account.
For instance, if you choose to connect a Google integration to your Mailchimp account, weâll ask you to grant us permission to view and/or download, as applicable, your Google Sheets, Google Contacts, Google Analytics and Google Drive.
This allows us to configure your Google integration(s) in accordance with your preferences.
For example, if you wanted to use the Google Contacts integration to share the templates in your Mailchimp account with contacts in your Google address book, we would need to access your Google Contacts to share your templates.

D.
Cookies and Tracking Technologies
We and our third-party partners may use various technologies to collect and store Service Usage Data when you use our Service (as discussed above), and this may include using cookies and similar tracking technologies, such as pixels, web beacons, and if you use our Mobile Apps, through our SDKs deployed on your mobile device.
For example, we use web beacons in the emails we send on your behalf, which enable us to track certain behavior, such as whether the email sent through the Service was delivered and opened and whether links within the email were clicked.
Both web beacons and SDKs allow us to collect information such as the recipientâs IP address, browser, email client type and other similar data as further described above details.
We use this information to measure the performance of your email campaigns, to provide analytics information, enhance the effectiveness of our Service, and for other purposes described above.
Reports are also available to us when we send email to you, so we may collect and review that information.
Our use of cookies and other tracking technologies is discussed in more detail in our Cookie Statement available here.
E.
Member Distribution Lists
In order to send an email campaign or use certain features in your account, you need to upload a Distribution List that provides us information about your Contacts, such as their names and email addresses.
We use and process this information to provide the Service in accordance with our contract with you or your organization and this privacy policy.

A Distribution List can be created in a number of ways, including by importing Contacts, such as through a CSV or directly from your email client.
We do not, under any circumstances, sell your Distribution Lists.
If someone on your Distribution List complains or contacts us, we might then contact that person.
You may export (download) your Distribution Lists from Mailchimp by accessing the âAudienceâ tab from within your account.
If we detect abusive or illegal behavior related to your Distribution List, we may share your Distribution List or portions of it with affected ISPs or anti-spam organizations to the extent permitted or required by applicable law.
If a Contact chooses to use the Forward to a Friend (FTF) link in an email campaign a Member sends, it will allow the Contact to share the Memberâs email content with individuals not on the Memberâs Distribution List.
When a Contact forwards an email to a friend, we do not store the Contactâs email address or their friendâs email address, and no one is added to any Distribution List as a result of the FTF link.
The Member who created the email campaign only sees an aggregate number of times their email campaign was forwarded by a Contact and does not have access to the email addresses used to share or receive that forwarded content.
F.

Please see Section 4, of this privacy policy for examples of the types of Personal Information we may ask Visitors to provide.
Where we say we assume an obligation about Personal Information, we will also require our contractors and subcontractors to undertake a similar obligation.
We will not use or disclose Personal Information for the purpose of our direct marketing to you unless: 
you have consented to receive direct marketing.

we believe you may be interested in the material but it is impractical for us to obtain your consent.

F.
Retention of Data
We retain Personal Information where we have an ongoing legitimate business or legal need to do so.
Our retention periods will vary depending on the type of data involved, but, generally, we'll refer to these criteria in order to determine retention period:

Whether we have a legal or contractual need to retain the data.
Whether the data is necessary to provide our Service.
Whether our Members have the ability to access and delete the data within their Mailchimp accounts.
Whether our Members would reasonably expect that we would retain the data until they remove it or until their Mailchimp accounts are closed or terminated.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your Personal Information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your Personal Information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
G.
California Privacy
The California Consumer Privacy Act (âCCPAâ) provides consumers with specific rights regarding their Personal Information.
You have the right to request that businesses subject to the CCPA (which may include our Members with whom you have a relationship) disclose certain information to you about their collection and use of your Personal Information over the past 12 months.
In addition, you have the right to ask such businesses to delete Personal Information collected from you, subject to certain exceptions.
If the business sells Personal Information, you have a right to opt-out of that sale.
Finally, a business cannot discriminate against you for exercising a CCPA right.

When offering services to its Members, Mailchimp acts as a âservice providerâ under the CCPA and our receipt and collection of any consumer Personal Information is completed on behalf of our Members in order for us to provide the Service.
Please direct any requests for access or deletion of your Personal Information under the CCPA to the Member with whom you have a direct relationship.

Consistent with California law, if you choose to exercise your applicable CCPA rights, we wonât charge you different prices or provide you a different quality of services.
If we ever offer a financial incentive or product enhancement that is contingent upon you providing your Personal Information, we will not do so unless the benefits to you are reasonably related to the value of the Personal Information that you provide to us.

H.
Do not Track
Certain state laws require us to indicate whether we honor âDo Not Trackâ settings in your browser.
Mailchimp adheres to the standards set out in this Privacy Policy and does not monitor or follow any Do Not Track browser requests.
