Our information practices are designed to comply with the United States Federal Trade Commission's Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and the European Union General Data Protection Regulation EU 2016/679 (GDPR) for users from the European Union and the United Kingdom.

Information Collection
DOGO websites generally require little or no collection of personal information and you can use the services without registering for an account or providing any personal data.
DOGO only collects personal information when a user knowingly and voluntarily provides it to us as part of the registration process for creating a user account. (i) From Account holders 
iDOGO accounts

iDOGO is a service that allows children to create avatars, create a book list, bookmark content, earn points and badges, enter giveaways and contests, and link to other users' iDOGO pages.
During the iDOGO account registration, we ask for (but do not save) a user's date of birth to determine whether parental consent is required for a child to use the iDOGO service.
When children under the age of 16 create an iDOGO account, we ask them to provide a parent or guardian email.
We use the provided parent or guardian email in order to send an email notifying the recipient that their child has created an iDOGO account.
We inform them of their child's username and password and provide them with a link to cancel the account if they wish to.
When children the age of 16 or over create an iDOGO account, we ask them to provide their email.
If a child uses a third party authentication service like Google, CLEVER or Microsoft Office365 to create an iDOGO account and if they are under the age of 16, we do not store the childâs email provided from the third party authentication service, but instead we ask the child for a parent or guardian email.
If the child is the age of 16 or over, we fetch their email from the third party authentication service in order to pre-populate the email field on the registration page, which the child can always overwrite.

Teacher accounts

Teacher accounts allow educators to create classroom pages, student accounts, assign content, and enter giveaways.
Teacher accounts may only be obtained by teachers who are 18 years of age or older.
During the Teacher account registration, teachers are asked to provide first and last name, email, school name and address, and the grade they teach.
We use the email to contact teachers about the service in the following situations: (i) request for a password reset.
(ii) respond to a question or a concern.
or (iii) to send email newsletters that the teacher opted-into.
The email newsletters offer teachers the opportunity to unsubscribe and decline further communications.
If a teacher uses a third party authentication service like Google, CLEVER or Microsoft Office365 to create a Teacher account, we collect and store their first and last name, and their email from the third party authentication provider.
If a teacher opts to synchronize their MS Teams, Google Classroom or CLEVER roster with their DOGO class page, we may collect and store the first and last names of the students that belong in the Google Classroom they selected.
This information is only available to the teacher to help him or her easily match the studentsâ usernames with their real names.
If a teacher opts to post content from their Google Drive account to their DOGO class page, we may store a link to the Google Drive file that the teacher selected.
The link to the file is only available to the students of the teacherâs DOGO class page.
If a teacher signs up for DOGOnews for Teachers PRO, which requires payment, we may collect payment information (such as credit or debit card) and pass the information to Stripe, our third party payment processor.
All payments are processed by Stripe and all payment information is stored by them and is not available to us.
All account holders may revoke DOGOâs access to their account on third party authentication services like Google, CLEVER and Microsoft Office365 at any time by updating the appropriate settings in the account preferences of the respective third party authentication service.
Users of third party authentication services should check their privacy settings on these services to understand and change the information sent to us through each third party authentication service.
Please review each third party authentication serviceâs terms of use and privacy policies carefully before using their services and connecting to our websites.
Except as stated in this Privacy Policy, we will not sell, rent, exchange, or release your personal information to outside parties. (ii) From All users In addition to the information collected when creating accounts, we may also collect certain information automatically when users visit the DOGO websites.

These emails are discarded once the share email is sent 2.

Parental Consent We never collect, store, use, or disclose personal information from children under the age of 16 without prior parental consent.
As outlined in Information Collection from Account holders â iDOGO accounts (Section 1 - i), we may collect and store a parentâs email from children under the age of 16 in order to notify the parent that his or her child signed up for an iDOGO account and to provide them with a link to cancel the account if they wish to.
From time to time, we may have special online promotions such as giveaways and contests on the DOGO websites that are open for iDOGO users under the age of 16.
In order for the child to be awarded a prize we require a written parental consent form be signed by the parent and returned to us.
The written parental consent form may ask for additional personal information necessary to award the prize.
In these situations, we may email a parent or guardian as follows: (i) to inform them that their child has entered a giveaway or contest and provide them a link to cancel their childâs participation and (ii) to remind them at the conclusion of a promotion, that a written parental consent is required in order to consider their child for the promotion.
Information given to us in this circumstance is used only for the purpose of awarding the prize and is stored in encrypted form on our secure servers for any future promotion the child may participate in.
The special online promotions are only for users residing in the US, since we do not fulfill prizes to Non-US users. 5.
Use of Personal Information Except as outlined in Parental Consent (Section 3) and Information Collection from Account holders â Teacher accounts (Section 1 - ii), we do not use personal information that we collect through the DOGO websites. 6.
Sharing of Personal Information With the exception of payment data passed to Stripe for processing payments for DOGOnews for Teachers plans, we do not sell, transfer, disclose, or share personal information we collect through the DOGO websites with third parties.
However, we may disclose personal information to third parties when required by law or pertinent to judicial or government investigations or proceedings, when otherwise necessary to protect the DOGO websites or the safety of our users or any third party, or with a parent/guardianâs consent.
If we sell, divest or transfer our business, or are otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, or in the event of bankruptcy, we may transfer your information to one or more third parties as part of that transaction, provided the third parties have agreed to data privacy standards no less stringent than our own.
In such case we will provide you with notice and an opportunity to opt-out of the transfer.
If you do not consent to the use of your information by such a successor company, subject to applicable law, you may request its deletion from the company. 7.
Data retention and information security Unless we receive a deletion request, we will retain your information for as long as you have an account or as is necessary to deliver our service to you.
The security and confidentiality of your childâs information is extremely important to us, and we take a number of steps to help safeguard any personal information that your child provides to us.
In particular:

We continually develop and implement features to keep your personal information safe
When you enter any information anywhere on DOGO websites we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL/TLS/HTTPD encryption)
The database where we store personal information is encrypted at rest, which converts all personal information stored in the database to an unintelligible form
We ensure passwords are stored and transferred securely using encryption and salted hashing.
User passwords are not visible to DOGO administrators or employees
We restrict access to personal information to authorized employees only
Other security safeguards include but are not limited to data encryption, firewalls, and physical access controls to files

However, no method of transmitting or storing electronic data is ever completely secure, and therefore we cannot warrant or guarantee that such information will never be accessed, used or released in a manner that is inconsistent with this policy.
If we know or have reason to know of a systems security breach by an unauthorized party of user data where that data is being or is likely to be used for an unauthorized purpose, we will promptly notify you so that you can take appropriate steps. 8.
Parental Control of Personal Information Upon providing proper identification, parents can review, correct, or have deleted their childâs personal information from our database, or refuse further collection or use of personal information from their child by writing to us at: DOGO Media, Inc.

California Privacy Rights and Do Not Track Disclosure If you are under the age of 18, or the parent of a user under the age of 18, residing in California, you are entitled to request removal of content or information you have posted on DOGO websites.
To request removal of your or your childâs content or information, please email us at help@dogonews.com for assistance, or you can delete specific information (or delete your or your childâs account) directly.
Please note that removal of your content or information does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal, as there may be de-identified or recoverable elements of your content or information on our servers in some form.
Additionally, we will not remove content or information that we may be required to retain under applicable federal and state laws.
Currently, various browsers offer a âDo Not Trackâ or âDNTâ option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to Web sites visited by the user about the userâs browser DNT preference setting.
DOGO does not track users over time and across third-party websites and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals.
For more information on âdo not trackâ, please visit www.allaboutdnt.org.
We do not share information that we collect through the DOGO websites with third parties for the third partyâs direct marketing purposes. 10.
International visitors DOGO websites are operated and managed on servers located within the United States.
If you use DOGO websites from the European Union or other regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that differ from U.S.
law, then you acknowledge and agree that you are transferring your Personal Information outside of those regions to the United States and that, by providing your Personal Information on DOGO websites, you consent to that transfer. 11.

If you are located in the EU, United Kingdom, Lichtenstein, Norway, or Iceland, you may have additional rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the "GDPR") related to your Personal Data, as described below.
We may limit or reject your request in certain cases, such as if it is frivolous or extremely impractical, if it jeopardizes the rights of others, if it is not required by law, or if the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy in the case in question.
In some cases, we may also need you to provide us with additional information, which may include Personal Data, to verify your identity and the nature of your request.
If you are an Account holder (iDOGO or Teacher account), you can accomplish most of the following by logging into your account.

You can also request that we transmit the data to another controller where technically feasible.
For the following, please email us at privacy@dogonews.com:
Withdrawal of Consent: If we are processing your Personal Data based on your consent (as indicated at the time of collection of such data), you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.
Please note, however, that if you exercise this right, you may have to then provide express consent on a case-by-case basis for the use or disclosure of certain of your Personal Data, if such use or disclosure is necessary to enable you to utilize some or all of our Service.
