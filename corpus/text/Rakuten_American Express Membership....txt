         American Express Membership RewardsÂ® Card Members Terms Rakuten Terms
These terms incorporate the Terms and Conditions for the Rakuten cash back shopping program.
Membership RewardsÂ® points at Rakuten are available to U.S.
American Express Card Members with a Card enrolled in the Membership RewardsÂ® program (âEligible Card Accountâ) only.
Card Members must be a Rakuten member and link their Membership RewardsÂ® program account to their Rakuten account at rakuten.com/american-express.
Card Members must use an Eligible Card Account at checkout to earn Membership Rewards points in their Rakuten account.
Corporate Cards or accounts are not eligible to participate.
Once Card Members have linked their accounts they will accrue Membership RewardsÂ® points in their Rakuten account instead of Cash Back for qualifying shopping activities determined by Rakuten.
All qualifying shopping trips completed prior to a Card Member linking his/her accounts including any accrued but unpaid Cash Back, will be paid in the payment method previously selected by the Card Member.
Rakuten typically will transfer accumulated Membership Rewards points from the Rakuten account to the Membership Rewards program account in accordance with Rakutenâs current payment schedule.
Rakuten reserves the right to modify the payment schedule at any time.
The minimum number of points that will be transferred is 500 Membership Rewards points.
Until points are transferred from the Rakuten account to the Membership Rewards program account, Rakuten in its sole discretion retains the right to make adjustments to the Rakuten account in accordance with the Terms and Conditions.
Points transferred from the Rakuten account will become available in the Membership Rewards program account within 8 to 12 weeks after receipt by American Express of the points information from Rakuten.
If American Express does not receive the points information from Rakuten, you will not receive the points.
Please note that points will not be made available by American Express if any Eligible Card Account is canceled or past due at the time of point fulfillment.
Card Members who opt out of earning Membership RewardsÂ® points on Rakuten, will no longer be eligible to participate in this program and earn Membership RewardsÂ® points in their Rakuten account.
Membership RewardsÂ® Terms and Conditions, including those about forfeiting points, apply to Membership RewardsÂ® points in the Rakuten account.
