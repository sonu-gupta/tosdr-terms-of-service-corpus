- Send you our Newsletter 
- Offer you new products, services, or special campaigns that are likely to be of interest to you (by mail, telephone, email or via social networks) 
- â¯Send you promotional offers 

Finally, Speaky may collect and use data with your consent if it is to send you promotional messages, provided that you are not yet listed as an Interested Party.
In this context, you may at any time request to unsubscribe to these promotional messages.



To whom can we transmit your Data? 

We only transmit your Data to third parties when: 
- â¯It is necessary for the proper execution of our services 
- â¯It is necessary to meet a legal obligation 
- â¯You give us the authorisation 
In order to execute our Services, we may subcontract, in whole or in part, some of our tasks to technical subcontractors, for example to an IT company with a view to hosting the Site and storing the Data and backup copies.
We ensure that subcontractors handle your data in the same manner we do.
that is, in a safe, respectful and responsible way.
and we provide adequate contractual guarantees to this effect.
Speaky therefore requires its subcontractors to comply with data protection legislation and to provide sufficient guarantees regarding the implementation of appropriate technical and organisational measures, so that the use of the data meets the requirements of applicable data protection legislation and guarantees the protection of your rights.

 You have the right to demand that incorrect Data be corrected and that inappropriate Data or Data that is no longer needed be deleted.
Right to Erasure 
 When you no longer want your Data to be used and request that it be deleted, we will proceed to delete your Data from our database.
It is necessary to take into account that it is not always possible to delete all personal data requested, for example when its processing is essential for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal rights, or because it is required by the judicial authorities to retain such Data.
You will receive further information concerning this subject, should it be necessary, in the response to your request.

 To the extent necessary, you will also be entitled to the portability of your Data under the conditions provided by applicable data protection legislation.

This right of portability is therefore only applied to Client and Student Data.
Right to Object to the Processing of your Data 
What happens when you do not wish or no longer wish to receive any form of commercial communication? You maintain the right to object, without having to provide a justification, to the use of your personal data for direct marketing purposes.

At the end of the storage periods described above, personal data will be deleted or made anonymous, except insofar as its storage is a legal obligation, specifically in case of compliance with the obligation to keep documents for accounting and tax purposes.


Security 

We have developed adapted technical and organisational security rules, in order to prevent the destruction, loss, falsification, modification, unauthorised access, and accidental disclosure to third parties and any other unauthorised handling of Data.
For example, Speaky synchronises databases containing User or Customer Data securely on three different physical supports in different locations.
In order to protect the entire system against viruses and security breaches, system software and application software packages are updated as soon as a security update is available.
A firewall is installed on each server and configured by our network administrator to protect against any external attack.
Access to the servers is also restricted by private-public key, with the private key being encrypted (DES 256).
Finally, the individual computer of each Speaky employee is equipped with an automatically updated and professional antivirus.
In addition, developers or employees working on the infrastructure are equipped with a computer that has a fully encrypted hard disk.
In the event of a data leak with adverse consequences for your Data, you are personally notified under the circumstances and within the time limits as stipulated by law.
To ensure the security of your Data, we advise that you: 
- â¯Do not disclose your password to third parties 
- â¯Change your password regularly 
- Make sure that access to your computer/tablet/smartphone is secure 
You are solely responsible for your client account and the consequences of its use, as well as for any information of any kind that you communicate to Speaky.
Speaky is not liable in the event of damage caused because of erroneous, incomplete or fraudulent information that you provide to us.


Telecommunications Privacy Guarantee 

All transmissions of personal data will be encrypted via âhttpsâ pages.
â¯This mainly concerns all the administrator tools (server management, database access, server access).
â¯All communication between servers is encrypted using TLS technology, and access to the server is via encrypted SSH and VPN connections.â¯This guarantees a high level of data security and confidentiality.â¯ In addition, all user and supervisor passwords are encrypted (SHA256) in our database and cannot be read externally or internally by SPEAKY.
It is for this reason that we only send new passwords and never an existing password.
This is a very important security measure that prevents inappropriate access to strictly personal and confidential data.â¯ 

Links to Third Party Sites 

 We would like to point out that our website may contain links to third party sites, and some of our services may grant you access to third party services (such as social networks).
We have no control over how third party sites and services handle your Data.
We do not review third party sites and services, and we are not responsible for those third party sites and services or their practices regarding the protection of your Data.
We invite you to carefully read the data handling policies of third party sites that you access from our site.


Handling of Data Related to Children 

We do not intentionally collect personal information from children under the age of 16 without the explicit authorisation of a parent or guardian.
In the event that information about children under the age of 16 has been inadvertently collected by us, we will take steps to delete the Data as soon as possible, unless we are required by law to store that information.
