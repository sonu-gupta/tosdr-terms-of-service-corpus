 OkayFreedom VPN Privacy Policy Preface
OkayFreedom is a virtual private network service (hereafter: "Service" or "VPN Service"), which can route Internet traffic via a computer (a so-called VPN server) to various regions.
This enables a user to hide his IP address from telemedia services and encrypt data traffic.
This service is made possible by software (hereafter: "Software" or "Product"), which the user installs on their computer.
The Service is offered by Steganos Software GmbH, Storkower Str.
158, 10407 Berlin, Germany (hereafter: âSteganosâ).
The following privacy policy applies to the use of OkayFreedom and is part of the Terms and Conditions.

Â§1 No data storage when using a VPN server
The OkayFreedom service saves neither addresses nor content accessed by the user, the IP address that OkayFreedom assigned to them.
nor the user's own IP address through which they are using OkayFreedom.
As a result, it is not possible for Steganos to ascertain the content an OkayFreedom user has accessed.
Neither the IP address of the user nor that of the accessed servers are saved.

Â§2 Pseudonymous user-ID instead of e-mail address
Personal data (e.g., email address) isnât required for the use of OkayFreedomâs free version.
For billing and load balancing purposes, OkayFreedom determines which data volume (only the amount of data transmitted, not addresses or content) belongs to which pseudonymous user-ID.
The pseudonymous ID is derived from the hash value of the computer's MAC address on which OkayFreedom is being used and is not traceable to a particular computer or user.

Â§3 De-coupling the payment process from the pseudonymous user-ID
When booking a premium account through Steganos' e-commerce provider, a user will be asked for personal details.
THE E-COMMERCE PROVIDERâLIKE STEGANOSâWILL NOT GAIN ACCESS AT ANY POINT IN TIME TO ADDRESSES OR CONTENT OF WEBSITES VISITED BY AN IDENTIFIABLE USER IF AN OKAYFREEDOOM VPN SERVER ROUTED THEM THERE.

Â§4 Collection and usage of data by Steganos
(1) Within the framework of OkayFreedom's free-of-charge offering, Steganos will only use the user's voluntarily given e-mail address for the provision of offers / services described here (see Terms and Conditions).
In particular, Steganos utilizes the user's e-mail address to send updates, newsletters and/or current information.
The user can unsubscribe from the newsletter.

(2) Steganos wishes to offer the best service possible to its customers.
Under certain circumstances, therefore, the software asks customers whether it may transmit their e-mail address to Steganos for the purpose of informing them about product innovations and special offers.
The transmission is voluntary and happens only with express consent of the customer.
To save the customer the effort of entering their e-mail address, Steganos software under certain circumstances tries to gather the address.
Should the customer agree to transmitting their e-mail address but later decide against receiving further information by Steganos via e-mail, they can unsubscribe with no justification required.

(3) Steganos automatically records certain information of users of the www.okayfreedom website that cannot be attributed to them, including IP address and browser type.
THIS DOES NOT APPLY TO THE USE OF THE OKAYFREEDOM VPN SERVER.
WHICH STORES NO DATA OF THIS TYPE.

Â§5 Dissemination of information to third parties
Steganos does not pass along users' personal data to third parties, unless the user previously has provided their express consent or unless there is a legal obligation to do so.
An exception is made for certain technical service providers who have been carefully selected by and are under instruction from Steganos to carry out certain tasks.
Such tasks include (for example) the distribution of newsletters (processing of project data), the collection and processing of anonymous data for usage patterns or integration of partner programs, as well as the collection of information about software errors that have occured for the improvement of the OkayFreedom website.
NEITHER STEGANOS NOR THE COMMISSIONED DATA PROCESSOR SHALL GAIN ACCESS TO WEB ADDRESSES OR CONTENT VISITED BY AN IDENTIFIABLE USER IF AN OKAYFREEDOM VPN SERVER ROUTED THEM THERE.
