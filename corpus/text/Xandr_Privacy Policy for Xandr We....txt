Information for Residents of European Countries


If you are located in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland (the âEuropean Countriesâ), you have certain rights and protections under applicable law regarding the processing of your âpersonal dataâ as defined under applicable law.
Some of the information that Xandr collects from you through its operation of the websites may constitute âpersonal dataâ under these laws.

Role of Xandr as Controller 

If you are located in one of the European Countries, Xandr will act a âcontrollerâ (as defined under applicable data protection laws) when processing your personal data collected through its operation of the websites.

Legal Basis for Processing

Xandrâs legal basis for processing your personal data depends upon the specific context in which we collect or use it.
For personal data collected through the operation of our websites we normally rely on our legitimate interests, except where our interests are overridden by your data-protection interests or your fundamental rights and freedoms.
The legitimate reasons for which we use your personal data are described in greater detail in the âHow We Use the Information We Collectâ section of this policy.
These legitimate interests include the operation of our websites and business, the promotion of our business, to undertake analytics on, and evaluation of, our business and our services, to contact you about our services or our websites and for any other purposes of which we notify you.
In addition, in some cases, we may rely on your consent as our legal basis for processing your personal data (for example, if we require your consent in order to store cookies on your browser).
Where we rely on consent to process your personal data, we will obtain such consent in compliance with applicable laws.
Where you have given your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.
Additionally, in certain cases we may also be under a legal obligation to process your personal data.

If you are located in one of the European Countries, you may be entitled to exercise certain data-subject rights available under applicable laws.
These rights include the right to request access to personal data we hold about you.
You may also have the right to object to, or request that we restrict, processing of your personal data.
You may also have the right to ask that your personal data be corrected, erased, or transferred to another party.

When Xandr transfers your personal data to group companies or third-party service providers outside of the European Countries, we use appropriate legal mechanisms to help ensure all applicable laws, rights and regulations continue to protect your personal data.
This may include the use of EU Commission approved standard contractual clauses.
Where such standard contractual clauses are used, a copy is available on request.
