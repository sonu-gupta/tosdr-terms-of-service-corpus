SLA Details

a.
This Service Level Agreement ("SLA") is a policy governing the use of the WIREWAX Platform under the WIREWAX MSA or Terms of Use.
b.
Terms not otherwise defined herein will have the meaning given to them in the WIREWAX MSA or Terms of Use.
c.
We reserve the right to change the terms of this SLA in accordance with the WIREWAX MSA or Terms of Use.

Service Availability

a.
"Service Availability" means that the Platform may be accessed and used by you (as measured by WIREWAX) as intended under the MSA or Terms of Use.

Uptime Commitment

a.
The Platform shall have Service Availability at least ninety-nine and nine tenths percent (99.9%) of the time each calendar month.

Uptime Measurement

a.
WIREWAX will measure uptime by checking the response of the WIREWAX HTTP Service.
Every one (1) minute, a third-party service (currently http://statuscake.com) will attempt to access the WIREWAX Service.
b.
If the service does not receive a successful HTTP response â that is, a HTTP response code of 2XX or 3XX â then that will count as one minute of downtime.
c.
A calendar month will mean 730 hours.
d.
The unavailability of the Platform will be calculated from the time that such unavailability is reported by you to WIREWAX at sla@wirewax.com.
We reserve the right to make reasonable changes to this measurement procedure.

Service Credits

a.
If the Platform fails to meet the Uptime Commitment during any one calendar month period by up to one (1) percentage point, then you will be eligible for a service credit (the "Service Credit(s)") in the amount of ten percent (10%) of the monthly fee for the affected service.
b.
For every additional one (1) percentage point during the calendar month that Uptime Commitment is missed, you will be eligible for an additional Service Credit in the amount of ten percent (10%) of the monthly service fee for the affected service, up to 100% of the monthly service fee.

Credit Requests and Payment

a.
To request a credit, send email to WIREWAX at sla@wirewax.com.
You must include either your WIREWAX account ID or registered email address, and dates and times of unavailability.
b.
If we confirm that you are owed Service Credits, we will issue a credit to your account within ten (10) business days.
Credits may only be used against future billing charges.

The Service Credits shall be your sole and exclusive remedy for any failure of the Platform to operate in accordance with the SLAs.
