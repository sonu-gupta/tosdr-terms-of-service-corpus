Accordingly, you may only post versions of academic papers or articles (âAcademic Papersâ), journal articles, or other content on SSRN if you have the right to do so.
By way of example, while many journal publishers permit posting of some versions of Academic Papers, most journals restrict the sharing of final versions.

You may post your paper to SSRN only if you are the copyright owner, have the copyright ownerâs permission, are permitted to do so under your publishing agreement or the publisherâs copyright policies or your institutionâs license agreement or under a Creative Commons license.
