CA End User Agreement and Supporting Documentation 


Below you will find general information governing the use of CA Offerings.
CA Offerings include on-premises software, SaaS, related Maintenance/Support, and Services and/or Education for CA and Symantec branded solutions.
While the End User Agreement applicable to your transaction with CA will remain constant, additional documentation applicable to your engagement will vary based on the specific CA Offering you wish to use.
If you have existing CA or Symantec agreements governing your use of a CA Offering, check with your CA Sales Representative to see if you can leverage those agreements.
Whether using the CA End User Agreement posted here or your existing agreement, your CA Sales Representative will provide the specific documentation for your CA Offering and engagement with CA.
These documents are for use across all Software business units, for all products and for all customers (direct and indirect), subject to any local country legal requirements.
