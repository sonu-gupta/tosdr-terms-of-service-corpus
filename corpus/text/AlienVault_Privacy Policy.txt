 Online demo Privacy Policy Last modified: July 1, 2020
This privacy policy (âPrivacy Policyâ) describes the information collection practices that AlienVault, Inc.
and its respective subsidiaries (âAlienVault,â âwe,â âus,â or âour,â if not explicitly referring to one company) follow when handling Personal Information (defined below) that we collect or receive in conducting our business, including through our products, services, content, websites, and user applications (the âSitesâ), as further explained below.
Employment data is not subject to this Privacy Policy, but will be covered under separate policies and procedures of, and agreements among, the various AlienVault companies.
If you are a resident of the European Union (âEUâ), you may have additional rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the âGDPRâ) with respect to your Personal Information, as outlined below.
For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, references to the EU also include the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and the European Economic Area countries Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway.

Without limiting the foregoing, Personal Information does not include information that is de-identified or corporate information that relates to an organization but not to an individual, such as a corporate name, corporate address or general corporate phone number.
âData subjectâ means an individual who is the subject of the EU Personal Data. INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM OR ABOUT YOU

Some third parties such as our business partners and service providers provide us with Personal Information about you, such as the following:


Account information for third party services. If you interact with a third party service when using our Sites, such as if you use a third party service to log-in to our Sites (e.g., Facebook Connect, Google Sign-In, or Twitter OAuth), or if you share content from our Sites through a third party social media service, the third party service will send us information about you, such as information from your public profile, if the third party service and your account settings allow such sharing.
The information we receive will depend on the policies and your account settings with the third-party service.

OS version
Endpoint Scans collect additional data:

File hashes of files on your system (SHA-1, SHA-256, MD5)






Website usage information we collect. In addition to Personal Information that you choose to submit to us, whenever you visit or interact with our Sites, we may collect or store information about your interaction with our Sites (âUsage Informationâ).
This Usage Information may include:

your IP address or any other unique identifier assigned to the device that you use to access our Sites;
the functionality and characteristics of your device, including type of browser, operating system and hardware, mobile network information, and in some cases location information;
the URL that referred you to our Sites, if any;
your activities on our Sites, such as which web pages you visit, what terms you searched within our Sites, and which links within our Sites that you click on.
and
the time of day that you visited our Sites and how long your visit lasted.

Usage Information is typically anonymous information.
however, if it is combined with your Personal Information in a manner that reasonably allows it to be associated with your identity, or is otherwise considered Personal Information under applicable law, it will be treated as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy, and, if you are an EU resident, it may be considered Personal Data and be subject to the section applicable to EU users below.
We use certain common methods and technologies to collect and store Usage Information about your interaction with our Sites (âAnalytic Technologiesâ).
These Analytic Technologies may be downloaded to the personal computer, laptop, tablet, mobile phone, or similar device that you use to access the Sites (âYour Deviceâ).
The specific Analytic Technologies that we use are as follows:


Cookies. A cookie is a data file placed on Your Device when you visit our Sites.
We use cookies only to facilitate the use and navigation of our Sites and to remember you and your preferences in case you revisit our Sites in the future and to conduct range measurement.
Information collected relates to technical information (e.g.
your browser, a timestamp, and a unique identifier).
Almost all browsers allow blocking of cookies in their entirety, removal of existing cookies, or warning to prevent the placing of a cookie.
You can find more information on this functionality in the documentation or in the help file of your browser.
Please note that blocking of cookies might impede your use of our Sites.
For more information, please see our Cookie Policy cybersecurity.att.com/legal/cookie-policy.
If you are a resident of the EU or other jurisdiction that requires us to obtain your consent to use cookies on our Sites, then you will have an opportunity to manage your cookie preferences on such Sites.
except that certain cookies are essential to enable core site functionality, and you cannot choose to disable those cookies.

Do Not Track Policy.
 Your browser may offer you a âDo Not Trackâ option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites.
Our Sites do not support Do Not Track requests at this time.

Analytics. We use analytics applications, including âGoogle Analyticsâ, to collect information about use of the Sites.
Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit a website, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other websites they visited prior to coming to a website.
We use the information obtained from these applications only to improve our Sites and our product and service offerings.
The information generated about your use of our Sites will be transferred and saved to the vendorâs server in the United States.
For Google Analytics, within Member States of the European Union or other signatories of the Agreement on the European Economic Area, Google will first shorten your IP address.
In exceptional cases, the full IP address will be transferred to a Google server in the United States to be shortened there.
Googleâs ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Sites is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.
You can opt-out of Google Analytics tracking by visiting https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/.

Web Beacons. A web beacon, including tracking pixels, is a small graphic image or other web programming code, also known as â1Ã1 GIFâ or âclear GIF.â We may download web beacons to Your Device when you access our Sites or through email messages that we send to you.
Web beacons are used to improve your experience on our Sites.
Web beacons also help us to understand whether users read email messages and click on the links contained within those messages so that we can deliver relevant content and messages.
Our web beacons may collect certain of your contact information (e.g., the email address associated with an email message that contains a web beacon).

Embedded Scripts. An embedded script is a programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with our Sites, such as which links within our Sites you click on, which type of browser or device you use (e.g.
mobile or desktop version).
We use such information to enhance the user experience.
This code is downloaded onto Your Device when you access our Sites and is deactivated or deleted when you leave our Sites.
Identification of the user does not take place.


Information we receive from third parties.
 We may receive Personal Information about you from third parties who recommend or suggest that we contact you for business purposes.
This includes basic contact information about you, such as your name, company name, title, address, phone number, fax number, and email address.
It may also include information on the content, products, or services you have shown interest in or may be interested in purchasing from us, as well as information on other companies or individuals with whom you do business.
We may also obtain Personal Information about you from third parties in connection with business transactions you initiate with us, such as through credit verification or other processes related to the transaction.
This Personal Information will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION

Site Hosting
. Our Sites and the servers on which they are hosted are operated in various countries around the world in which we conduct our business.
Thus, your Personal Information associated with our Sites may be transferred to and/or processed in a country other than that from which it was collected.
The data protection laws in those countries may differ from those of the country in which you are located.
The servers may be operated by third party hosted service providers.

Links to Other Websites and Applications. The Sites may contain various links to, as well as plug-ins or widgets from, social media and other third-party websites or applications, which may provide additional information, goods, services, and/or promotions.

You are able to change your email preferences or discontinue your participation in the Community Forums at any time.
Your password and your email-address will not be visible to other users or shared with third parties.
You should be aware that any User Submissions you post to a Community Forum, as well as your user name, may be viewed by other members of that forum.
If you choose to voluntarily post User Submissions to a Community Forum, be aware that such information is viewable by anyone else on that Community Forum.
Think carefully before you post and use caution before disclosing any Personal Information in a Community Forum.
We are not responsible for the accuracy, use, or misuse of any User Submission that you disclose or receive through a Community Forum.
We might also delete User Submissions without further notice if they include harmful or inappropriate content (e.g., pornographic material, content encouraging vandalism, crime, terrorism, racism, violence, or cruelty), or infringe any third partyâs rights or applicable law.

Promotions. We may offer various promotions (âPromotionsâ) through the Sites or elsewhere that may require registration with your Personal Information.
If you choose to enter or otherwise participate in a Promotion, your Personal Information may be disclosed to third parties in connection with administration of the Promotion, such as in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as otherwise required by law.
By entering into a Promotion, you are agreeing to the official rules that govern that Promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you, including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor and/or other parties to use your name, voice, and/or likeness in advertising or marketing materials.
These rules will be displayed to you during the registration process, and you will be asked for your consent to the respective data processing at that time.

Affiliates and Business Transfers. We may share your Personal Information with our affiliates.
Additionally, AlienVault or any part of its business, including our Sites, may be sold at some point in the future.
Should this occur, your Personal Information may be transferred to a subsequent owner, co-owner, or operator of the business unit or Site.
We also may disclose and transfer your Personal Information in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of stock or assets, or other corporate change, including, without limitation, during the course of any due diligence process.
In all such cases, this Privacy Policy will continue to govern the use and disclosure of such information.

Legal Protections and Law Enforcement. We may access, use, preserve, transfer, and disclose to third parties your Personal Information to: (1) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, subpoena, governmental request, or legal process if, in our good faith opinion, such is required or permitted by law.
(2) protect and/or defend this Privacy Policy or other policies or terms of use applicable to our Sites, including investigations of potential violations thereof.
(3) protect the safety, rights, property, or security of AlienVault or any third party.
and/or (4) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security issues or breaches, or technical issues.
This may include allowing third parties, such as copyright owners, Internet service providers, wireless service providers, and/or law enforcement agencies, to access and use your Usage Information in order to identify you.
We may take any of these steps without notice to you to the extent permitted by law. CHOICE AND UPDATING YOUR INFORMATION AND PREFERENCES We reserve the right to take reasonable steps to authenticate the identity of any individual seeking access to Personal Information.
We may provide web pages or other mechanisms on our Sites through which you can update subscription preferences.
You can also contact us to update your Personal Information or change your preferences.
Our contact information for these purposes is by email at CyberPrivacy@att.com.
If you receive a marketing communication from us by email, you may also opt out of receiving future email marketing communications by following the opt-out instructions provided in that email.

In accordance with our routine record keeping and applicable law, we may delete certain records that contain your Personal Information.
We are under no obligation to store such information indefinitely, and we disclaim any liability arising out of, or related to, the destruction of that information.
In addition, you should be aware that it is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our databases without some residual data because of backups and other reasons.
Also, if you have posted any User Submissions to a Community Forum, these communications cannot generally be removed.
Under California Civil Code Sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to contact us to prevent disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for such third partiesâ direct marketing purposes.
in order to submit such a request, please contact us at privacy@alienvault.com. INFORMATION SECURITY We will take reasonable precautions to protect your Personal Information in our possession from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction.
We will make reasonable efforts to keep your Personal Information reliable for its intended use, accurate, current and complete.
As necessary, we will take additional precautions regarding the security of particularly sensitive information, such as credit card information.
While we strive to secure your Personal Information, we cannot warrant or guarantee that this information will be protected under all circumstances, including those beyond our reasonable control. ENFORCEMENT We will conduct periodic internal compliance audits of our relevant privacy practices to verify adherence to this Privacy Policy.
We encourage you to raise any questions or concerns that you may have about the way we process your Personal Information by contacting us at the address set forth below.
We commit to resolve questions and complaints about your privacy and our collection or processing of Personal Information about you.

Privacy Shield.
AlienVault, Inc.
participates in the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework (the âPrivacy Shieldâ).
AlienVault, Inc.
is a company with international operations and customers.
We have developed global data security practices designed to ensure that personal information is appropriately protected.
When you submit Personal Information to AlienVault, Inc.

In certain situations, we may be required to disclose EU Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including meeting national security or law enforcement requirements.
Our company commits to cooperate with EU data protection authorities (âDPAsâ) and comply with the advice given by such authorities.

GDPR. For this GDPR section, we use the terms âPersonal Dataâ and âprocessingâ as they are defined in the GDPR, but âPersonal Dataâ means information that can be used to individually identify a person, and âprocessingâ generally covers actions that can be performed in connection with data such as collection, use, storage and disclosure.
AlienVault is the controller of your Personal Data processed in connection with the Sites.
Note that we may also process Personal Data of our customersâ end users or employees in connection with our provision of services to customers, in which case we are the processor of Personal Data.
If we are the processor of your Personal Data (i.e., not the controller), please contact the controller party in the first instance to address your rights with respect to such data.
If there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this Privacy Policy, the policy or portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such conflict.
If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following applies to you, please contact us at CyberPrivacy@att.com.


What personal data do we collect from you?

Please see the section INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM OR ABOUT YOU above for details of the Personal Data we collect.
For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, when we use the term Personal Information, that is intended to also indicate Personal Data pursuant to the GDPR and EU Personal Data pursuant to the Privacy Shield in each case if the applicable data subject is an EU resident.

How do we use your personal data? 
 Please refer to the section on HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION above for details of how we use and process your Personal Data.

Lawful Bases for Processing.
 We will only process your Personal Data if we have a lawful basis for doing so.
Lawful bases for processing may include consent, contractual necessity and our âlegitimate interests,â as further described below.


Contractual Necessity. When you purchase our products and services, we process your contact information (e.g., name, phone number, address, email address) as a matter of âcontractual necessityâ, meaning that we need to process the data to perform under our MSA, EULA, or other agreement with you, which enables us to provide you with the products and services you request.
When we process data due to contractual necessity, failure to provide such Personal Data will result in your inability to use some or all portions of the Sites or our products and services that require such data.

Legitimate Interest. We may also process your contact information and other categories of Personal Data described in the section titled INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU above for our legitimate interest purposes.
 Examples of these legitimate interests include: 
Operation and improvement of our business, products, and services
Provision of customer support
Protection from fraud or security threats
Protecting the security of your account with us
Providing you with a sign-in method
Determining your geographic location and preferences so that we can serve you better
Compliance with legal obligations
Completion of corporate transactions



Consent. In some cases, we process Personal Data based on the consent you expressly grant to us at the time we collect such data.
When we process Personal Data based on your consent, it will be expressly indicated to you at the point and time of collection.
If you provide us with opt-in consent to receive marketing information from AlienVault, we will process your email address for the purpose of sending you marketing information about our products and services.
The legal ground for processing your email address for this purpose is your consent.
You may withdraw your consent any time by selecting âunsubscribeâ in the marketing email or email us at CyberPrivacy@att.com.

Other Processing Grounds. From time to time we may also need to process Personal Data to comply with a legal obligation, if it is necessary to protect the vital interests of you or other data subjects, or if it is necessary for a task carried out in the public interest.



How and with whom do we share your data?
 We share Personal Data with vendors, third party service providers, and agents who work on our behalf and provide us with services related to the purposes described in this Privacy Policy or our MSA, EULA, or other agreement with you.
For more information on such third parties, please refer to the section titled WITH WHOM WE MAY SHARE INFORMATION above.

How long do we retain your personal data? 
 We retain Personal Data about you as set forth on our companyâs data retention policy.
In some cases we retain Personal Data for longer, if doing so is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed, or is otherwise permitted or required by applicable law, rule, or regulation.
Afterwards, we retain some information in a depersonalized or aggregated form but not in a way that would identify you personally.

What security measures do we use? 
 We seek to protect Personal Data using appropriate technical and organizational measures based on the type of Personal Data and applicable processing activity.
For example, we protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.
We also require our supplier and vendors to protect such information from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure.

Privacy Policy Update 
We are updating the Privacy Policy that applies to AlienVault, now known as AT&T Cybersecurity.
AlienVault is now part of AT&T Communications Company, and the Privacy Policy for AT&T Communications Company now applies to AlienVault.
Learn more below.


Whatâs changed? 
In July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) invalidated the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield, one of several legal mechanisms that governed the transfer of data from the EU to the U.S.
AlienVault, which had relied on the Privacy Shield, now utilizes a different legal mechanism for the transfer of data from the EU to the U.S.
Along with this change, we are aligning Privacy Policies for AT&T Cybersecurity products, including AlienVault, under the Privacy Policy that applies to AT&T Communications Company.
You can view that Privacy Policy here.


Does my business contract change? 
No.
This does not change the terms and conditions of your business contract.


When is the new policy effective? 
The new policy is effective January 15, 2021.


Where can I learn more about the EU courtâs decision that prompted this change, as well as AT&Tâs approach to privacy and compliance? 
Our comprehensive AT&T Privacy Center provides General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) notices, details about our global and U.S.
approach to privacy, and privacy protecting tips and tools.
In addition, we have provided additional details about our data transfer practices and compliance with government regulations in our document, âFrequently Asked Questions: Cross Border Data Transfers as Part of AT&Tâs Global Privacy Program,â which you can access here.
