F.
RESOLVING DISPUTES: 


PLEASE READ THIS PROVISION OF THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.
IT PROVIDES THAT ANY DISPUTE MAY BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION.
BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU ARE HEREBY WAIVING THE RIGHT TO GO TO COURT, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO A JURY.
IN ARBITRATION, A DISPUTE IS RESOLVED BY AN ARBITRATOR, OR A PANEL OF ARBITRATORS, INSTEAD OF A JUDGE OR JURY.
THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT THEY WOULD HAVE HAD A RIGHT OR OPPORTUNITY TO LITIGATE DISPUTES THROUGH A COURT AND TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE THEIR CASE, BUT THEY CHOOSE (BY THEIR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS OF USE, IN ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE OR THE SITE) TO HAVE ANY DISPUTES RESOLVED THROUGH ARBITRATION.

Any legal or equitable claim relating to the Service, the Site, your Subscription or these Terms of Use (a "Claim"), will be resolved as follows:

1.
Informal Claim Resolution: To initiate an informal resolution to a Claim, you must send a notice by first class United States mail to Sirius XM Radio Inc., 1290 Avenue of the Americas, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10104, Attention: CRM (a "Notice").
Neither of us may start a formal proceeding (except for Claims described in subsection 3 below) for at least sixty (60) days after one of us notifies the other of a Claim in writing.
If we initiate a Claim, we will send our notice to the billing address on file with us.
2.
Formal Resolution: If we cannot resolve a Claim informally, including past, present, and future Claims and disputes, and including any dispute as to the validity or applicability of this arbitration clause, then these Claims shall be resolved, upon election by either party, exclusively and finally by binding arbitration.

The party initiating arbitration must follow the rules and procedures of the American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ) in effect at the time the Claim is filed, and the parties agree that the arbitration shall be administered by the AAA.
You may obtain copies of the current rules, forms and instructions for initiating an arbitration by contacting:

American Arbitration Association
1633 Broadway, 10th Floor
New York, New York 10019
Web site: www.adr.org
(800) 778-7879

This arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (âFAAâ), and not by any state law concerning arbitration.

3.
Exceptions: Notwithstanding the foregoing, any dispute involving a violation of the Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C.
Â§605, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 18 U.S.C.
Â§Â§2510-2521, or a violation of our intellectual property rights may be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction.

4.
Small Claims: Instead of proceeding to arbitration, either you or we have the option to pursue a Claim in small claims court (or the equivalent) so long as the Claim 1) remains in that court, and 2) is made solely on our behalf (if brought by us) or on your behalf.
However, if that Claim is transferred or appealed to a different court, we reserve our right to elect arbitration.

5.
Cost Sharing: Whoever files the arbitration pays the initial filing fee.
If we file, we pay.
if you file, you pay.
If you have paid the initial filing fee and you prevail, we will reimburse you for that fee.
If there is a hearing, we will pay any fees of the arbitrator and arbitration firm for the first day of that hearing.
All other fees will be allocated as provided by the rules of the arbitration firm and applicable law.
In no event will you be required to reimburse us for any arbitration filing, administrative, or hearing fees in an amount greater than what your court costs would have been if the Claim had been resolved in a state court with jurisdiction.
However, we will advance or reimburse your fee if the arbitration firm or arbitrator determines there is good reason requiring us to do so, or if you ask us and we determine there is good reason for doing so.
Each party will bear the expense of that partyâs attorneys, experts, and witnesses, and other expenses, regardless of which party prevails, but a party may recover any or all expenses from another party if the arbitrator, applying applicable law, so determines.

6.
Class Actions and Severability: All Claims shall be arbitrated on an individual basis.
There shall be no right or authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on bases involving Claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, other Subscribers, or other persons similarly situated.
No Claim submitted to arbitration is heard by a jury or may be brought as a private attorney general.
You do not have the right to act as a class representative or participate as a member of a class of claimants with respect to any Claim submitted to arbitration (âClass Action Waiverâ).
The Class Action Waiver is material and essential to the arbitration of any disputes between the parties and is nonseverable from this agreement to arbitrate Claims.
A âClaimâ does not include any challenge to the validity and effect of the Class Action Waiver, which must be decided by a court.
The parties acknowledge and agree that under no circumstances will a class action be arbitrated.
If any portion of this arbitration agreement or the Class Action Waiver is limited, voided or cannot be enforced, then the parties' agreement to arbitrate (except for this sentence) shall be null and void with respect to such proceeding, subject to the right to appeal the limitation or invalidation of the Class Action Waiver, that portion will be severed, and the rest of the arbitration agreement will continue to apply.
If this entire agreement to arbitrate shall be null and void, then the parties agree that any actions shall be brought in the State or Federal courts of New York, New York.

7.
Binding Effect: In the arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged, as set forth in the FAA.
Any court with jurisdiction may enter judgment upon the arbitratorâs award.
The arbitrator's decision is final and binding on all parties and may be enforced in any federal or state court with jurisdiction.

G.
