 1: Introduction 

We, ERAS, take the protection of your personal data very seriously and strictly adhere to the rules laid out by data protection laws and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR-EU and GDPR-UK).
This privacy notice gives you information on how we collect and process your personal data through your use of this site and any data you may provide if you contact us regarding our products and services.
We have appointed a data protection officer (DPO) who is responsible for monitoring and providing guidance with our GDPR status.
If you have any questions about this privacy notice, including any requests to exercise your legal rights, please contact the DPO using the contact information in section 15 of this privacy notice. 2: Why We Collect Your Personal Information 

We collect your personal data for one of the following purposes:

To manage communications between you and us
Where we need to perform the contract we have entered into with you
To provide you with information you have requested or which we feel may be of interest to you
To ensure the safe operation of our website and to monitor the performance of our website
For marketing and advertising purposes
 3: Lawful Basis of Processing Information 

We only collect and use personal information about you when the law allows us to.
Most commonly, we use it where:

The data subject (you) has given consent to the processing activity taking place
If the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract
If the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject
If the processing is necessary for the purpose of the legitimate interest pursued by us or our partners

Where legitimate interest is identified as a lawful basis, we will undertake a legitimate interest assessment which is a three-part test covering:

The purpose test
to identify the legitimate interest
Necessity test
to consider if the processing is necessary for the purpose identified
Balancing test
considering the individualâs interests, rights or freedoms and whether these override the legitimate interests identified.
 4: What Information We Collect and Where From

We have in place technical and organisational measures to ensure personal information is secured and to prevent your personal data from being accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed.
We have in place a robust access control policy which limits access to your personal data to those employees, contractors and other third parties who only have a business need to know.
