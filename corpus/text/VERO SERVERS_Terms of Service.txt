 Terms of Service These Terms of Service (âTOSâ) are a contract between you, or the entity on whose behalf you are executing this agreement (âyouâ or âyourâ), and VERO SERVERS (âVEROSERVERS.COMâ, âweâ, âusâ, or âourâ).
By using our Services, you agree to abide by these TOS and our Privacy Policy.
These TOS may be modified at any time and, by continuing to use our Services, you agree to be bound by the modifications.
The most recent version of these TOS can always be found here.
While we facilitate your business on the Internet, we are an independent contractor.
We only have control of the products and services we provide directly, and are not liable for your actions, the actions of 3rd (third) party service providers, or the actions of individuals who use your products and services.
 
SERVICES
VEROSERVERS.COM provides a number of services and products to its customers, which are collectively referred to in these TOS as the âServicesâ.
 Regardless of whether you pay for a Service or it is provided as part of a package or for free, any Service you request or allow to be provided by VEROSERVERS.COM is included as part of the âServicesâ we refer to in these TOS and our Privacy Policy.
 
Services may also be provided by 3rd parties and their terms of service or use that may contain additional or different terms will also apply to your use of their services.
We shall not be responsible for any changes in the Services that cause any 3rd party products to become obsolete, require modification or alteration, or otherwise affect the performance of the Services.
Any malfunction or manufacturer's defects of 3rd party products or services, either sold, licensed or provided by VEROSERVERS.COM to you will not be deemed a breach of our obligations under this TOS.
We may change the specifications or details of the Services (including pricing) at any time, but we have no obligation to change the Services.
 Additionally, the 3rd parties we contract with to provide Services may change their offering between the time of purchase and the date the Services are delivered.
 We will use commercially reasonable efforts to inform you of changes to the Services.
