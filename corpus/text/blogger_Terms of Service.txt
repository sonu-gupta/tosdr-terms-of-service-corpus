Country version: NetherlandsWhatâs covered in these termsWe know itâs tempting to skip these Terms of Service, but itâs important to establish what you can expect from us as you use Google services, and what we expect from you.These Terms of Service reflect the way Googleâs business works, the laws that apply to our company, and certain things weâve always believed to be true.
As a result, these Terms of Service help define Googleâs relationship with you as you interact with our services.
For example, these terms include the following topic headings:

What you can expect from us, which describes how we provide and develop our services
What we expect from you, which establishes certain rules for using our services
Content in Google services, which describes the intellectual property rights to the content you find in our services â whether that content belongs to you, Google, or others
In case of problems or disagreements, which describes other legal rights you have, and what to expect in case someone violates these terms

Understanding these terms is important because, to use our services, you must accept these terms.
Besides these terms, we also publish a Privacy Policy.
Although itâs not part of these terms, we encourage you to read it to better understand how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information.Service providerIn the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland, Google services are provided by, and youâre contracting with:

Broadly speaking, we give you permission to use our services if you agree to follow these terms, which reflect how Googleâs business works and how we earn money.
When we speak of âGoogle,â âwe,â âus,â and âour,â we mean Google Ireland Limited and its affiliates.What you can expect from usProvide a broad range of useful servicesWe provide a broad range of services that are subject to these terms, including:
apps and sites (like Search and Maps)
platforms (like Google Play)
integrated services (like Maps embedded in other companiesâ apps or sites)
devices (like Google Home)

Our services are designed to work together, making it easier for you to move from one activity to the next.
For example, Maps can remind you to leave for an appointment that appears in your Google Calendar.Improve Google servicesWeâre constantly developing new technologies and features to improve our services.
For example, we invest in artificial intelligence that uses machine learning to detect and block spam and malware, and to provide you with innovative features, like simultaneous translations.
As part of this continual improvement, we sometimes add or remove features and functionalities, increase or decrease limits to our services, and start offering new services or stop offering old ones.
We maintain a rigorous product research program, so before we change or stop offering a service, we carefully consider your interests as a user, your reasonable expectations, and the potential impact on you and others.
We only change or stop offering services for valid reasons, such as to improve performance or security, to comply with law, to prevent illegal activities or abuse, to reflect technical developments, or because a feature or an entire service is no longer popular enough or economical to offer.
If we make material changes that negatively impact your use of our services or if we stop offering a service, weâll provide you with reasonable advance notice and an opportunity to export your content from your Google Account using Google Takeout, except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues.What we expect from youFollow these terms and service-specific additional termsThe permission we give you to use our services continues as long as you meet your responsibilities in:

service-specific additional terms, which could, for example, include things like additional age requirements

These resources include our Privacy Policy, Copyright Help Center, Safety Center, and other pages accessible from our policies site.
Although we give you permission to use our services, we retain any intellectual property rights we have in the services.Respect othersMany of our services allow you to interact with others.

comply with applicable laws, including export control, sanctions, and human trafficking laws

donât abuse or harm others or yourself (or threaten or encourage such abuse or harm) â for example, by misleading, defrauding, defaming, bullying, harassing, or stalking others
donât abuse, harm, interfere with, or disrupt the services

Our service-specific additional terms and policies provide additional details about appropriate conduct that everyone using those services must follow.
If you find that others arenât following these rules, many of our services allow you to report abuse.
If we act on a report of abuse, we also provide a fair process as described in the Taking action in case of problems section.Permission to use your contentSome of our services are designed to let you upload, submit, store, send, receive, or share your content.
You have no obligation to provide any content to our services and youâre free to choose the content that you want to provide.
If you choose to upload or share content, please make sure you have the necessary rights to do so and that the content is lawful.LicenseYour content remains yours, which means that you retain any intellectual property rights that you have in your content.
For example, you have intellectual property rights in the creative content you make, such as reviews you write.
Or you may have the right to share someone elseâs creative content if theyâve given you their permission.
We need your permission if your intellectual property rights restrict our use of your content.
You provide Google with that permission through this license.Whatâs coveredThis license covers your content if that content is protected by intellectual property rights.Whatâs not covered
This license doesnât affect your data protection rights â itâs only about your intellectual property rights
This license doesnât cover these types of content:
publicly-available factual information that you provide, such as corrections to the address of a local business.
That information doesnât require a license because itâs considered common knowledge that everyoneâs free to use.
feedback that you offer, such as suggestions to improve our services.
Feedback is covered in the Service-related communications section below.


ScopeThis license is:
worldwide, which means itâs valid anywhere in the world
non-exclusive, which means you can license your content to others
royalty-free, which means there are no fees for this license

PurposeThis license is for the limited purpose of:


operating and improving the services, which means allowing the services to work as designed and creating new features and functionalities.
This includes using automated systems and algorithms to analyze your content:
for spam, malware, and illegal content
to recognize patterns in data, such as determining when to suggest a new album in Google Photos to keep related photos together
to customize our services for you, such as providing recommendations and personalized search results, content, and ads (which you can change or turn off in Ads Settings)
This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored.

developing new technologies and services for Google consistent with these terms

There are two exceptions:

If you already shared your content with others before removing it.
For example, if you shared a photo with a friend who then made a copy of it, or shared it again, then that photo may continue to appear in your friendâs Google Account even after you remove it from your Google Account.
If you make your content available through other companiesâ services, itâs possible that search engines, including Google Search, will continue to find and display your content as part of their search results.
