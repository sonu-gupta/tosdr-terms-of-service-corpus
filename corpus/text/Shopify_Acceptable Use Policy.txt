Shopify is a commerce platform that provides the tools and technology for merchants to set up an online store and sell products and services on their own website, at physical retail locations, marketplaces and more.
While we believe the free and open exchange of ideas and products is a key tenet of commerce, there are some activities that are incompatible with Shopifyâs mission to make commerce better for everyone.
This Acceptable Use Policy (âAUPâ) describes activities that are prohibited in connection with your use of the Services.
Any capitalized terms used in this AUP are defined on the Shopify AUP definitions page, located at https://www.shopify.com/legal/aup-definitions.
The following activities are prohibited:



Child exploitation: You may not offer goods or services, or post or upload Materials that exploit or abuse children, including but not limited to images or depictions of child abuse or sexual abuse, or that present children in a sexual manner.
