We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information that we collect about you through the operation of our services.
We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.
We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what information on MyDramaList is shared publicly (or kept private), indexed by search engines, and permanently deleted.
We help protect you from overreaching government demands for your personal information.
We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your personal information.

Below is our Privacy Policy, which incorporates and clarifies these principles.Who We Are and What This Policy CoversAnyoung haseyo.

This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use MyDramaList.com
Throughout this Privacy Policy weâll refer to our website and other services collectively as âServices.â Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that information.Information We CollectWe only collect information about you if we have a reason to do soâfor example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better.
We collect information in three ways: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources.
Letâs go over the information that we collect.Information You Provide to UsItâs probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us.
The amount and type of information depends on the context and how we use the information.
Here are some examples:



Basic Account Information: We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account.
For example, we require individuals who sign up for a MyDramaList.com account to provide a username and email addressâand thatâs it.



Public Profile Information: If you have an account with us, we collect the information that you provide for your public profile.
For example, if you have a MyDramaList account, your username is part of that public profile, along with any other information you put into your public profile, such as a photo or an âAbout Meâ description.
Your public profile information is just thatâpublicâso please keep that in mind when deciding what information you would like to include.



Transaction and Billing Information: If you purchase a VIP subscription or any merchandise we may sell from us, you will provide additional personal and payment information that is required to process the transaction and your payment, such as your name, credit card information, and contact information.
