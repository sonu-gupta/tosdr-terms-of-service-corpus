a Scryfall account or joining our chat rooms.
If you do not agree with these terms, you may not register
for Scryfall or join our chat rooms.

Weâre going to use some shorthand to make this easier to read:
When we say âScryfallâ we mean the Scryfall website, API, chat bots, chat rooms,
and other related services.
When we say âweâ or âusâ we mean Scryfall, LLC, a United States company.
When we say âcontentâ, âyour contentâ, or âpostâ we mean any information
you submit or store on Scryfall services,
including account names, deck information, and chat messages.

We may modify these terms at any time.
Weâll try not to, but just know that we can change these terms at any time.
If the changes are material, weâll let you know by email or by posting a notice
before the changes go into effect.
The notice will designate a reasonable amount of time after
which the new terms will go into effect for all users.
If you donât agree to the new terms, you may delete your account and stop using Scryfall.

within the notice period, your content and use of the site will be subject
