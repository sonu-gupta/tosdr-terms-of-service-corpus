*Our liabilities that are excluded or limited Our 
liabilities
 are excluded and limited as stated in the Section of these terms and conditions that applies to the

Please Note: Except for our
 liabilities
 which are stated above as being unlimited, under no circumstances whatsoever will we be liable to you for any loss of profit, or any indirect or consequential loss or damage arising under or in connection with the 
contract 
or any 
transaction
 or 
service.


Any other
 liabilities
 of ours not referred to above, or not excluded or limited as above, are limited to the amount of our relevant insurance cover if we have relevant insurance in place or if we have no insurance cover in place to the price stated in the accepted 
order
 or
 offer
 for the relevant 
transaction
 or 
services
 (if any).
If a price is not ascertainable, these

charges
 for arranging and maintaining such insurance, in writing.
We may choose to use insurance to cover risks to our business as a whole, including all our contracts and all our customers but are not obliged to take out or maintain insurance.
If we agree to meet 
liabilities
 (or we are 
ordered
 to meet them) and we have alternative ways of funding the 
liabilities
, we can choose whether or not to draw on our insurance.

11.
OUR FACILITIES We normally operate via our website and a helpline at the telephone number advertised on our website.
We provide the facilities without
 fee
 or 
charge
 (unless a 
default
 or 
problem
 arises), and they are provided âas isâ.
We do not guarantee the availability of the facilities, or that they will continue to be available in their current form, or at all.
Your use of our website and helpline is subject to our Acceptable Use Policy.
If you use our website in a way that breaches our policy in any way, we may exercise any of our remedies under clause 16 in relation to your use of the website.

contract
applies to the policies as they stand at the date and time when you use the facilities.

RISK NOTICE We sell 
goods
and buy 
metal
, based on the global metal marketâs prices, which are outside our control, and change frequently.
The historical performance of our price, or the global metal marketâs prices of 
goods
and
 metal
 is not a reliable indicator of future prices.

13.
CANCELLATION RIGHTS You have no statutory right to cancel the 
contract
 if you change your mind.
This is because the prices of the 
goods
 and
 metal
 are subject to fluctuation: see the Risk Notice in clause 12, above.

Please Note: You can however choose to terminate your 
order
 at any time prior to delivery or collection of your 
item(s)
 under clause 14.

item(s).

TERMINATION AND CHANGES

 or 
offer
 you cannot change or withdraw the 
order
 or
 offer
unless we make any change under clause 7, above, and we ask you to confirm or withdraw your changed 
order
 or 
offer
.

Termination of contract by you You can terminate a particular
 transaction
 or 
service
 at any time and this will be treated as an
 order
 for our termination 
service
, for which you will incur a fee.
We will confirm to you in writing or verbally if and when we have accepted your order for termination.
See clause 15, and the Sections of these terms and conditions that apply to the 
services
 you wish to terminate, for details of the process and any costs and charges that apply.
Apart from that, you may not terminate the
 contract
 or any part of it except by giving us written notice after a 
material breach by us
 has occurred, or as permitted (if at all) by the Section of these terms and conditions that applies to the
 transaction
or 
service
.

Please Note: If you wish to terminate due to a 
material breach by us
, for the termination to be valid you must show us evidence of the breach if we ask (and if it is reasonable in all the circumstances for us to ask).

*Termination of contract by us Before we terminate the contract we will always consider whether any 
default
 or
 problem
 could be remedied.
If it can, we will try to contact you and work with you to try and remedy the breach.
However, when a 
default
 or 
problem
 in our view cannot be remedied, or it is not remedied within reasonable time after we try to contact you about it, or as a result of uncontrollable factors as set out in clause 20, we reserve the right to terminate.
In this case we may terminate the 
contract
 or a particular 
transaction
 or 
service
 by giving you written notice, or as permitted (if at all) by a Section that applies.
We can also terminate (or treat as being terminated) the 
contract
 or a particular 
transaction
 or 
service
, if we are released from our obligations under the
 contract
 or in relation to the particular 
transaction
 or 
service
.

*Changes to your details If you are an 
a


ccount user
 and there is any change to the details that we required you to provide for us to set you up as an 
account user
, you must notify us of the changes immediately.
The same applies if you lose your account card that we issue to account users.
After notifying us you will have to deliver to us the account card (or written confirmation that you have lost it) and any further 
ID
 as requested, at your cost.
If you do not do so we may exercise any of our âSuspension, refusal, blockingâ rights, as at clause 16 below, and may be entitled to terminate pending transactions or 
services
or the 
contract
.
We may at our absolute discretion treat it as a 
default
 or
 problem
.
If you are not an 
account user
 and there is any difference between the details we hold for you from an earlier or completed order or offer and the details you supply for a new 
order
 or
 offer
, we may require you to provide full and fresh 
ID
 for us to verify in full as part of the 
preconditions
 of the new
 contract
.

*15.
CONSEQUENCES OF TERMINATION OR REMEDIES If you or we terminate the 
contract
 or any part of it, either by valid notice or mutual agreement, all of the following consequences will apply to the 
contract
 or the part of it that is terminated:

You will be liable for any adverse movement in the underlying metal price based on the difference in the global market spot price from when your 
order
was placed and when the termination is accepted by us, multiplied by the precious metal content of your 
item(s)
.
A termination fee will be incurred.
You may have to provide 
payment
 for additional services such as delivery of 
goods
 to you.
All sums payable to us in respect of the period up to and including the date of termination will fall immediately due and payable.
This includes sums referred to in paragraph (1) immediately above, and fees and charges for any 
default
 or
 problem
.
You must pay those sums to us immediately.
Our obligations under or in connection with the 
contract
will cease to apply, and we will no longer meet those obligations.
This includes any obligation to complete 
transactions
 and/or to provide 
services
 which are terminated.

We do not breach the 
contract
 or any other obligation to you, or become liable to you, purely by virtue of terminating the 
contract
 or any part of it (provided we do so validly), and the same applies if you terminate validly.
We also do not breach the 
contract
 or any obligation to you, or become liable to you, by virtue of exercising our remedies (provided we do so properly).
Termination or exercise of our remedies will not affect your or our accrued rights and remedies.
Provisions in these terms and conditions which expressly or by implication have effect after termination will continue in full force and effect.

16.
OUR REMEDIES We will act reasonably and proportionally when exercising our remedies.
We may exercise the remedies set out below.





*Reliance on your order We are entitled to rely on your 
order
 as being complete and accurate.
It is your responsibility to ensure that the
 order
is complete and accurate.
Whilst we will carry out 
ID
 verification and check that your 
order
 contains the information we need, we read your 
order
for our own purposes and may not pick up errors or omissions.
You cannot rely on us to detect your errors or omissions.
If we have to deal with errors or omissions it may be a default or problem.




*Special fees and charges If there is a
 default
 or 
problem
 we may charge you fees and charges in accordance with our
 tariff
.




*Additional information You must provide additional information if we ask for it and our request is reasonable.
If you fail to provide such information when asked it will constitute a
 material breach by you
.
It will always be reasonable for us to ask for information relating to the 
preconditions
.




*Your death or incapacity If you die or cease to have mental capacity your personal representatives (following your death) or Deputy of the Court of Protection (in the event of your incapacity) must inform us as soon as possible of their appointment by submitting an 
order
 for our trustee 
service
.





*Voluntary trusts This applies if we provide our storage 
service
 for you.
 Your goods
 stored by us may be held on trust.
You may hold them on trust for someone else, or you may choose to place them in trust where someone else is the trustee.
In either case you must inform us by submitting an 
order
 for our trustee 
service
.
We will keep a record of the trust arrangement.

Trustee service To use our trustee 
service
, Clause 4 will apply.
We will treat your verified personal representative(s), Deputy or trustee(s) as being you for the purposes of the 
contract
.

*Suspension, refusal, blocking We have the following rights under the
 contract
 if there is a 
default
 or 
problem
 or a 
material breach by you
, or if any 
insolvency
on your part occurs, or if we have reasonable grounds to suspect any of the foregoing.
We may choose to exercise these rights in addition to any right of termination we may have, or as an alternative.
We will tell you that we are exercising our rights, and we may do this by email, phone or by formal written notice.
Our rights are that we may:

suspend processing of all or any part of your 
orders
, 
offers
, or
 transactions
.
and/or
suspend and/or stop you using all or any of the facilities which are available to you by virtue of you being an 
account user
.
and/or
suspend and/or stop provision of all or any 
services
.
and/or
refuse to receive 
orders
 or 
offers
 or 
payments
 from you, and/or to provide or operate 
user accounts
 and/or associated direct debits for you.
and/or
cancel your 
user accounts
 and/or your status as an
account user
, and/or associated direct debits.
and/or
block your access to our website and/or helpline facilities.


*Insolvency in relation to you If any
 insolvency
 on your part occurs before you become the legal owner of the 
item(s)
 (or we have reasonable grounds to believe such
 insolvency
 is about to happen) then, without limiting any of our other rights or remedies under the 
contract
 or at law: (1) we will not be obliged to complete any storage 
service
 or any collection or delivery
 service
 that you have requested, and (2) we may take the 
item(s)
 back and you must give them back immediately if we ask, and (3) if necessary we may enter any premises which you own or control, to get the 
item(s)
.
If we take the 
item(s)
 back we will either not process the payment from you, or will reimburse it to you.

*Indemnity against tax You must indemnify us on request against all or any direct or indirect taxes, duties, levies or similar payable by you in any jurisdiction in relation to any 
contract
, including for supply of
 goods
 or 
services
.
This means that if we are asked to make any such payment for you, you must reimburse us.

*Our right to withhold your property We can hold on to any
 item(s)
 that belong to you or that you 
order
, if you owe us any payment or other sum.
If you ask us for our collection or delivery 
service
 we will not be obliged to provide any of those 
services
 until you have paid the outstanding sums as well as the price for the
 order
 for the 
service(s)
.

*Set off We may at any time set off any sum of money you owe to us against any sum of money that we owe to you, whether or not either liability arises under the 
contract
.
If we exercise this right validly, it will constitute a 
default or problem
and you will have to pay our 
tariff
.
We may only exercise this right if we have asked you in writing for 
payment
 at least 5 
working days
 previously and we have not received it.
Any exercise of our right of set off will not limit or affect any other rights or remedies we have under the 
contract
 or at law.

*Set off against item(s) We have this right if we provide our storage 
service
for you.
If we are entitled to exercise our right of set off, above, and we owe you no money or less than the amount you owe to us, we may exercise our right of set off against 
item(s)
.
This means we will deduct from 
your goods
that we store for you or which we hold ready for collection or delivery some 
item(s)
 up to the value of the money you owe us.
We are unable to cut 
your goods,
 so if fractions are left over after we have exercised this right we will pay you the value of the fractions left over.
We will exercise this right based on the value of your 
item(s)
which we exercise the right against, as at the time when we exercise this right.
If we exercise this right validly, it will constitute a default or problem and you will have to pay our tariff.
Any exercise of our right of set off will not limit or affect any other rights or remedies we have under the 
contract
 or at law.

*Excessive outstanding charges and tariff We have this right if we provide our storage 
service
 for you.
If we do not receive 
payment
for our 
charges
and/or the 
tariff
, and the total of the outstanding sums ever exceeds the value of the
 goods
 we hold for you as part of our storage 
service
, we may cancel your 
user account
 and your status as an 
account user
.
If we exercise this right validly, it will constitute a 
default
or
 problem
 and you will have to pay our 
tariff
.
Any exercise of our right of set off will not limit or affect any other rights or remedies we have under the 
contract
 or at law.
For example, in these circumstances we are likely to exercise our rights of set off, above.




*Exclusion of certain statutory rights The terms implied into contracts by Sections 13 to 15 (inclusive) of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 and by Sections 3 to 5 (inclusive) of the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982 are, to the fullest extent permitted by law, excluded from the 
contract
.




*Unclaimed funds If we are unable to contact you at any time we will try several times, over a reasonable period of time.
We may also carry out searches to find alternative ways of contacting you, although we will try to avoid doing this as it will constitute a 
default
or 
problem
.
If we are still unable to contact you within a reasonable period of time we may cash in your
 item(s)
 and, after settling our fees, charges and costs, pay the remaining sums to a charity of our choice.

17.
VAT We will charge and collect from you, and you must pay, United Kingdom VAT at the rate applicable to the 
goods
 and 
services
 under the
 contract
.
We will account to HM Revenue and Customs in relation to VAT collected by us.

18.
DATA PROTECTION By submitting an 
order
 or 
offer
to us you give us your explicit consent allowing us to use your personal data as described in the 
privacy statement
.
We use your personal information as a data controller.
The 
privacy statement
 is subject to change.
The latest version is always available on our website.
Your consent applies to the privacy statement as it stands at the date and time when you provide personal data and when we use it.
You agree that we may use personal information provided by you in order to conduct appropriate anti fraud checks.
Personal information that you provide may be disclosed to a credit reference or fraud prevention agency, which may keep a record of that information.
You can rest assured that this is done only to confirm your identity, that a credit check is not performed and that your credit rating will be unaffected.
Your email address is essential in order for us to be able to supply you with important information such as order confirmations and changes to the service, By registering with us you accept that your email address may be used to supply you with such information.
You can withdraw your consent at any time.
This will constitute a 
default
 or
 problem
 because it will make it difficult or impossible for us to perform the 
contract
 or do anything else with or for you, and it may constitute a material breach by you.


19.
GUARANTEE AND COMPENSATION SCHEMES No guarantee funds or other compensation arrangements apply in relation to any of our
 goods
 or
 services
 or to any 
payment
 or 
transaction
 , except for the direct debit guarantee which we will confirm to you separately if you become an 
account user.

 will be delivered by our carrier to the delivery address as stated in the 
order
.
The liability for any loss is yours where delivery is subject to a postal redirection or to a PO Box or mail box address, or a house of multiple occupation.
We cannot be held responsible for delays in delivery or collection as a result of stock shortages, due to adverse weather, traffic delays, mechanical breakdowns or other circumstances beyond our control.
Any dates quoted for delivery are approximate only and the time of delivery will not be of the essence of the 
contract
.




Please Note: All 
orders
will be deemed delivered when signed for by any person at the delivery address or confirmed as delivered by our couriers.
You must satisfy yourself before requesting any delivery that this will be secure as any loss incurred after the delivery is signed for at the address or confirmed as delivered by our couriers will be your liability.
This may particularly be a risk for you if you live in a house of multiple occupation or you choose delivery to a work address.
You should not accept or sign for any delivery where the package has been damaged, resealed or tampered with and instruct the courier to return the item to us.
We cannot accept any liability for loss once a package has been accepted by any person at the delivery address.

Delivery in instalments We may deliver the
 item(s)
 by instalments.
This means that the 
order
 will be delivered in two or more separate packages.
If we do this, each package will constitute a separate 
order
, under a separate 
contract
.
If there is any delay or other problem with delivery of one package you will have rights and remedies under these terms and conditions in relation to that package, not the other packages.

 non-delivery.

non-delivery
, we will have no obligation to attempt fresh delivery of replacement 
item(s)

*Indemnity against loss You must indemnify us on request against all and any of our costs (including time spent by our staff) and expenses reasonably incurred in exercising our right to investigate 
non-delivery
reported by you.
This means that if we ask, you must reimburse us.
This indemnity will be disapplied if you or our investigation into 
non-delivery
can demonstrate there was no fraud, and that there are no reasonable grounds to suspect a fraud.

*Your obligation to accept delivery If no one accepts delivery at the delivery address the 
item(s)
 will be returned to us if not collected from the local sorting office.
Normally we will try to contact you and attempt to re-deliver them.
We do not normally treat this as a 
default or problem
unless (for example) it happens repeatedly.
Ultimately, if we are unable to arrange re-delivery, or if re-delivery fails, it will be a 
default or problem
, and at our discretion we may either (1) sell the
 item(s)
 and reimburse you for the sale price of the 
item(s)
after deducting our fees, charges and costs, or (2) move the
 item(s)

service
 fees.

 goods
 to you or for any 
non-delivery
, if it is caused by: (1) you being unavailable, (2) your instructions (or lack of instructions) relevant for delivery, or (3) by a person or factor that is outside the control of us or our carrier (e.g.
traffic or emergency) or that is within your control.

+Liability for delivery factors outside your control Failed delivery is deemed to be always in your reasonable control unless it is demonstrably caused by us or our carrier and not at all by you.

*Limitation of our liability for our failure to deliver Subject as marked â+â above, and to these terms and conditions, if a case of failed delivery is demonstrably caused by us or our carrier and not at all by you or a person or factor that is within your control, our liability shall be limited as follows (whichever applies):

If we or our carrier still hold the 
item(s)
: to the cost (if any) of re-delivery.
If we or our carrier do not hold the 
item(s)
: to the price (as stated in the accepted 
order
) of the 
item(s)
contained in the package that was not delivered, and the cost of our delivery 
service
for that package.

We will be liable for failed delivery of a package containing the 
item(s)
 if there is no fraud or error on your part and, for example, we confirm the package was never sent, or our carrier confirms that the package was lost by the carrier, or stolen from it.

Please Note: It will be at our discretion as to whether we meet liability for our failure to deliver by replacing the 
item(s)
 or refunding to you the original price stated in the accepted 
order

your goods
 with our subcontractors.
We are responsible for ensuring that, under our contracts with the subcontractors, our subcontractors bear the risk of loss, damage or theft of

item(s)
 agreed by you, but reserve the right to arrange for our subcontractor or its insurer to reimburse you in the form of cash reimbursement (Sterling).

service
 shall not exceed the then current value of

service

service
 at any time on providing you with 90 days notice.

your goods
 at the then current market price and will send any proceeds less our relevant charges to your

your goods
 without notifying you before the changes come into effect, and giving you the opportunity to terminate the storage 
service
 if you do not like the changes.

service
.
