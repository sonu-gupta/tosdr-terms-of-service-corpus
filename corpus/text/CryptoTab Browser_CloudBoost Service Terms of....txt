         CloudBoost Service Terms of Use
PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY.
BY USING THIS SERVICE, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF USE DESCRIBED BELOW.
IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SERVICE.
THESE TERMS OF USE ARE PROVIDED ON BEHALF OF CRYPTOCOMPANY OU, WITH A REGISTERED ADDRESS AT REBASE 1, TARTU 50104, ESTONIA, (together, Â«CryptoCompanyÂ», Â«weÂ», Â«usÂ», Â«ourÂ»).
CloudBoost Service
CloudBoost is a network based service which provides you remote server resources based on monthly subscription, unless otherwise indicated.
The network resources will be provided in multiples of your deviceâs power.
For example, if your default speed is 100 h/s and you buy 10x Cloud Boost, you will get 1000 h/s (where 100 h/s is the speed of your device and 900 h/s is the speed of our remote server resources).
This means that the more powerful your device is, the more network resources you will get for the same CloudBoost license.
We do not condone any unlawful use of the CloudBoost Services.
CloudBoost Services shall not be used for any criminal, illicit and illegal acts, and you accept and agree not to use the service for any illegal fraudulent activity.
CryptoCompany guarantees a 99.9% service uptime.

CryptoTab Browser can be installed from our official website only.
CryptoTab Browser can be installed once Terms are accepted and by the owner of a computer only.
CryptoTab Browser has a built-in cryptocurrency mining function.
The browser is mining the cryptocurrency, which we consider relevant for the present moment.
The mining results are displayed and paid out in Bitcoins at our exchange rate, and you agree to accept this rate.
When having mining function activated, CryptoTab Browser icon shall stay visible in the taskbar at any time, it should not be hidden from a computer owner.
If any of the provisions or terms specified herein are violated in any manner, we reserve the right to prohibit the use of CryptoTab Browser and stop mining process, including access and further use of the existing mining results.

Device Support
Please note that not all devices are supported by CloudBoost services.
To make sure that all your devices are supported by CloudBoost service before license purchasing, you need to open the mining tab on every device you are going to use.
If there is no CloudBoost option available that means device is not supported.
How It Works?
CloudBoost option is device type dependent, unless otherwise indicated.
It means that Android CloudBoost option can be used on Android device only, iOS CloudBoost option â on iOS only and Desktop CloudBoost is for Desktop Devices only.
Different CloudBoost options cannot be merged.
For example, if you buy 5x CloudBoost and 10x CloudBoost you will not get 50x CloudBoost.
In this case you can use both your licenses at the same time on different devices.
For mobile users there is also available a SuperBoost premium feature which increases your boosted power by x%.
SuperBoosts can be combined.
For example, if you buy 100% SuperBoost and 60% SuperBoost you will get 160% SuperBoost.
The maximum cumulative power of SuperBoost can be 400%.
You have a possibility to order CloudBoost Option for multiple devices by purchasing 1 license with a discounted price.
The number of purchased licenses can only be limited by the payment provider.
If the license you are trying to order is not accessible (inactive option state) that means selected payment option cannot support it and you need to select another one.
License sharing between multiple CryptoTab accounts is strongly prohibited.
