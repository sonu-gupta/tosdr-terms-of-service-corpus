Some cookies exist only during a single session and some are persistent over multiple sessions over time.
We use these technologies to remember user preferences, maximize the performance of our website and services, provide you with offers that may be of interest to you, measure the effectiveness of our email campaigns and to personalize online content.
These cookies and other technologies may be used to track you across devices and different websites over time.

 To provide you with more relevant and interesting experience, we may work with third party companies to display ads or customize the content on our website or mobile app and those of third parties (like on social media networks).
These companies may use cookies and similar tracking technologies as described in this Statement to gather information about your visits to the website, as well as your visits elsewhere on the Internet in order to provide you with more relevant advertising, known as interest-based advertising.
The Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") and Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") provide mechanisms for you to opt out of interest-based advertising performed by participating members at www.aboutads.info and optout.networkadvertising.org .
