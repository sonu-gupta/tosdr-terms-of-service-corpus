 To Enable Social Sharing and Connect with Us on Social Media.
Read More  Some of our services consist of social sharing and communication with others.
If you sign up for these services, we may ask for your consent to use your information to enable sharing as described in the service.
 We may also ask for your consent when you connect with us through Social Media.

 Promotions.
Read More We may ask you for permission to use your Personal Data and Fitness and Wellness Data for special offers, events, sweepstakes, and other Promotions.
We may use the Personal Data we collect during Promotions, to administer the Promotion, verify identity and age, and to communicate with you about the Promotion.



Social Sharing Settings 
Within our Services there are three sharing settings: Private, Share with Friends, and Public.
Under Armour apps are designed for your wellness and fitness benefit.
As such, you are able to control what Personal Data you share and with whom you share it.
We encourage you to adjust the sharing settings to best meet your objectives and sharing comfort level.
In the interest of safeguarding your Personal Data, we have outlined some initial default sharing settings.

Default Sharing Settings



"Physical Stats" are set as Private. "Private" means not shared with friends or other members.
You can change this default status for some of your physical stats.
Information that is "Private" by default includes, for example, your height, weight, BMI, and heart rate.


"Activity Stats" are set as Share with Friends. "Share with Friends" means visible to your friends, but not shared with other members.
You can change this default status if you want.
Information that is set as "Share with Friends" by default includes, for example, your workouts, steps, routes, friends challenges, and friendships.

 Community Social Data is set as Public. "Public" means visible to all others using the service.
For example social posts where you have set your account up as "Follow" (in app and on the websites), community forums, public challenges (challenges set up by Under Armour), and photos.


 Lookup Information is set as Public. We believe that social motivation helps you achieve your goals faster and allowing your friends to be able to find you is crucial to this experience.
Therefore, your first and last name, location, gender, username, main fitness activity, and profile picture are set as Public.
If you set your entire account as Private, your lookup data will no longer be available for your friends to find you (unless you otherwise indicate that desire within the Services).


 Changing Your Sharing Preferences

 Details on how to update your sharing preferences and the default settings for our Services are outlined within the sharing standard.


Note: When you share information from our Services externally with a SNS, the information you post is governed by their privacy policy and settings.

Interest-Based Advertising 
Interest-based advertising is advertising that is targeted to you based on your web browsing and app usage over time and across websites or apps.
Our advertising practices also include the creation and use of "audience segments." You have the option to restrict the use of information for interest-based advertising and to opt-out of receiving interest-based ads.
Depending on where you access our website from, you may also be asked to consent to our use of cookies, including advertising cookies.
Additional information on Audience Segments and our choices for interest- based advertising is found below.

 Audience Segments Read More  We disclose various types of information for purposes of interest-based advertising, including for third party, interest-based advertising.
This processing includes the use of Personal Data to create de-identified audience segments.
These audience segments are then made available for interest-based advertising, including for third party advertising, on Under Armour online properties.
The audience segments are based on website visits, app usage data, Fitness and Wellness Data, online and offline purchasing behaviours, interaction with our ads or marketing emails, similar types of information, and in some cases, data from third parties.
The segments, prior to being used, are de-identified so that they will not identify you personally.


United States Note: The audience segments are made available for interest-based advertising for third party advertising on Under Armour online properties and on and within third party websites and apps.
We use one or more safe haven entities and partners to de-identify segments before sharing these segments for third party advertising displayed on online properties operated by entities other than Under Armour.
We use a third party to match de-identified segments to targeting IDs that are then used on third party sites.

 Interest-Based Advertising Opt Outs, Choices, and Control Read More For all of the interest-based advertising described above, including segments, you have the choice to not have your data used to target and serve you interest-based advertising-including third party advertising-regardless of where such ads might be served.
These opt-outs require that strictly necessary cookies are not blocked by the settings in your web browser.
We support the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising of the Digital Advertising Alliance in the US, the Canadian Digital Advertising Alliance in Canada, and the European Digital Advertising Alliance in the EU.
If you live in the United States, Canada, or the European Union, you can visit Ad Choices (US), Your Ad Choices (Canada), or Your Online Choices (EU) to find a convenient place to opt-out of interest-based advertising with participating entities for each region.
These websites also provide detailed information about how interest-based advertising works.
Opting out does not mean that you will no longer receive advertising from us, or when you use the Internet.
It just means that the data collected from our website will not be used for interest-based advertising and that the advertising you see displayed on websites will not be customized to your interests.


 Mobile Apps. You may opt out of interest-based advertising on mobile devices by activating the "Limit Ad Tracking" or equivalent feature offered by your mobile platform.
It will transmit a signal to us and to third-parties that indicates your data should not be used for interest-based advertising.
 Our Cookie and Device ID Use section provides additional options for controlling the use of particular kinds of cookies, including advertising cookies.
You may use our "advertising cookies" toggle in these settings to prohibit the collection and use of Personal Data in cookies for interest-based advertising.








Managing Preferences and Withdrawing Consent 
You may at any time withdraw your consent with future effect and without affecting the lawfulness of processing of your Personal Data based on the consent you provided before you withdrew it, and exercise other controls regarding website and online data collection, interest-based advertising, your communication settings, and app preferences.
Depending on the Service, collection and use of Personal Data may be required for the Services to work.


We provide you several ways to manage your preferences: 


 Cookie Use and Controls Read More  Cookies serve a wide variety of purposes.
Cookies are pieces of data stored in your web browser that are transmitted to websites to remember your browser over time and distinguish it from other users.
Cookies are used to remember your shopping cart and personalize your web experience and for security, analytics, marketing, and interest-based advertising.
Our cookies are placed and read by our web servers, while other cookies are placed and read by other companies' web servers.
Information on specific cookies is found on our website via the AdChoices link.
You can block and control cookies using the information noted in this section.
If you block all cookies, certain functionality on our website will not work.

 One way to think about cookies is based on their function.
The following settings will control our use of browser cookies, the use of IP address for tracking, and the collection and use of data for cookie-based, interest-based advertising.



[ IN ] Required Cookies.
These strictly necessary cookies are used for core functionality, and recognize when you are signed in, remember things such as shopping carts and text entered, are necessary for security, and enforce your privacy preferences.
Without these cookies, some functionality on our websites will fail.
You can block these cookies in your browser preferences.


[ IN / OUT ] Functional Cookies.
These cookies help to improve the sites by allowing us to understand how the site is used and how the site performs.
These cookies include analytics and measurement.

[ IN / OUT ] Advertising Cookies.
These cookies help us and other parties personalize ads that are shown to you on our sites and Services, as well as on other sites.
If enabled, these cookies will allow third parties engaged in interest-based advertising on our site to recognize your browser software on other sites too.


 IP Address Use Read More  An IP address refers to an identifier assigned by a network to a computer, mobile device, Internet of Things (IoT) device, or routing device.
IP addresses, for purposes of this Privacy Policy, include "public" IP addresses, such as the IP address for a home router that is visible to the Internet, as well as "local" IP addresses, which are IP addresses assigned to computers and mobile devices "behind" a router (such as a home router).
Our advertising and analytics partners may use IP addresses to group or correlate devices for purposes of analytics, security and anti-fraud purposes, interest-based advertising, ad targeting, ad attribution, and limiting ad frequency.
You can choose not to have IP address used for purposes of advertising or analytics by using the cookie controls for "Advertising Cookies," and "Performance/Analytics," above.


 Web Pixels or Beacons Use Read More Pixels are extremely small image files that, when loaded by your web browser, cause the browser to make a network request to the party corresponding to the pixel.
If that party's cookies are currently stored in your browser, those cookies will be transmitted with the request.
Beacons can be used on web pages for advertising or to confirm the opening of a marketing email.
When used in conjunction with cookies for interest-based-advertising, the cookie controls above can be used to control the purpose for which they are used.

 HTML5 Local Storage Read More HTML5 Local Storage in the browser is different from cookies, but can be used for the same purpose (to pair a tracking ID to a particular web server with your web browser so that the web server can identify your web browser over time).
You can control the purpose for which HTML5 Local Storage is used by using the cookie controls outlined above.

 Flash Cookie Use Read More Flash cookies are "local shared objects" used by Flash player to store data, similar to cookies.
Although Flash content is declining in use, we may still use Flash on our sites.
If you have Flash installed, and wish to delete, block, or manage Flash cookies, please use the Flash settings panel made available by Adobe.

 Social Network Interaction and Widgets Read More Social network widgets, buttons, and plug-ins on our websites passively transmit data regarding a social network's members to that social network, even when a button is not clicked.
These technologies may allow a social network (such as Facebook, Twitter or YouTube) to personally identify its members and to know the web pages its members have visited.
This is true wherever social network buttons are embedded, regardless of whether a button is "clicked" or "pressed." If you belong to a social network or use these categories of web services, you should review the privacy policies of those services to understand the nature of the data that they collect and what, if any, options the service offers to control how data is collected and used.
If you disable advertising cookies, the passive tracking associated with these buttons will be blocked on our sites.

 Mobile Device Advertising IDs, Location, Sensor Data, and In-Range Device Data Use Read More  Our mobile apps and our Services may transmit Device IDs, Location Data, and data from sensors to us and our partners, including our advertising partners.


Device IDs
 include IDs associated with your mobile device carrier such as IMEI, MEID, IMSI.
platform-specific IDs such as Android ID, Google AID, and Apple's IDFA.
and IDs that are part of your device hardware, such as WiFi MAC address, and serial number.
Exactly which Device IDs are transmitted can depend on your mobile device platform and the version of your operating system.



Location Data.
 Our apps and Services transmit precise Location Data.
Location Data may be obtained from GPS services, cell tower triangulation, or known location of nearby WiFi access points.



Sensor and In-Range Device Data.
 Our apps and Services may also collect Device IDs and network addresses (including IP addresses, MAC addresses, and SSIDs) from other, in-range or networked devices and WiFi Access Points.
Our apps and Services may also collect information about altitude, air pressure, change in position.



How We Use Mobile Device Data.
 We may use Device IDs, coarse location and Location Data, and data from sensors, including the local network, (together with app usage data and Fitness and Wellness Data) for strictly necessary purposes.
improving our apps and analytics.
personalization and preferences.
and cross-app, cross-device, interest-based advertising.

 Withdraw Your Consent for Use of Your Mobile Device IDs and Location Data for Analytics and Advertising Read More Activating the "Limit Ad Tracking," "Opt out of Ads Personalization," or equivalent setting from your mobile device will transmit a signal to us and any third parties that we use (the signal will apply to all of our mobile apps running on that device).
When that signal is received by Under Armour or third parties, it communicates your choice to not have device IDs or Location Data used for purposes of advertising or analytics.
We honor the signal and require that our third party advertising and analytics partners do the same.
 To the extent our mobile apps personalize functionality for you, you can change these settings within the app, or reset to defaults by deleting and reinstalling the app.

 Other Ways to Manage Your Location Services Read More You can also turn off the transmission of precise Location Data by turning off those services using your mobile device's built-in settings.
Turning off location may cause some of our Services not to work.

 Change Consent Settings for Communication Preferences Read More 
Consent for Email Communication: After signing up for email communications, you can choose to unsubscribe using the unsubscribe link in any commercial email we send.
If you use more than one Service, then unsubscribing from the emails relating to that Service will not stop you from receiving emails from other Services.
Please note that if you unsubscribe from "all emails" this means "all emails other than strictly necessary emails." You will still receive email communications from us if they are strictly necessary to provide the Under Armour service or to confirm or validate a transaction, recover accounts, etc.

Text messages are auto-dialed and consent to text messages is not required for any purchase or service.

We don't sell Personal Data as defined by Nevada law.
 Residents of the United States have the right to ask us to delete your Personal Data, as permitted by law.

Residents of California

If you are a resident of California, you have certain rights to the Personal Data that we have collected about you.
Under California law, the exercise of these rights is subject to certain exemptions to safeguard the public interest (e.g., the prevention or detection of crime) and our interests (e.g., maintaining confidentially when legally required ).
We will comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable.
Requests to exercise your rights may be granted in whole, in part, or not at all, depending on the scope and nature of the request and applicable law.
To prevent unauthorized access to your Personal Data, we take steps to verify an individual's right to the data - including requiring users to reach out to us directly from a verified email address, pass a challenge response, and/or confirm information associated with the account.
Following verification of your identity, we will notify you if we are unable to fullfill your request and outline the reasons we are unable to honor your request at this time.


Your California Privacy Rights
 You have the following rights: 


Right of access to your Personal Data:
 You have the right to ask us for confirmation on whether we are processing your personal data, and access to the Personal data, as permitted by law.
This may include what Personal Data we collect, use, or disclose about you.


Right to deletion:
 You have the right to ask us to delete your Personal Data, as permitted by law.


Right to Opt-out of "Sale" and Certain Sharing Practices:
 You have the right to opt-out of certain data sharing practices with third parties who may use your Personal Data solely for their own purposes.
Your right to opt-out is limited to information we "sell" to these third parties.
"Sell" in this case does not mean providing data in exchange for money-we don't do that.
"Sell" instead means the disclosure of data, including technical device data that does not identify you directly, when a third party might use that data for its own purposes,such as for personalized advertising.


Note to California users between 13 and 16: If you are between the ages of 13 and 16, we do not "sell" your information to these third parties without authorization from you.




Right to Non-Discrimination:
 We will not discriminate against you, in terms of price or services that we offer, if you submit one of the rights requests listed above.

Additional California Rights:
California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California residents to request and obtain from us a list of what Personal Data (if any) we disclosed to third parties for that third party's direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year and the names and addresses of those third parties.
Requests may be made only once a year and are free of charge.

Under Section 1798.83, we currently do not share any Personal Data with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
If we do decide to share your Personal Data with third parties for their marketing purposes, you may opt-out of this disclosure at any time by submitting a request to our Support Team, or in writing to: 



Under Armour
 Attention: Privacy Office, Legal Department  1020 Hull Street  Baltimore, MD USA 21230


It is important to note that this opt-out does not prohibit disclosures made for non-marketing purposes or for purposes of assisting us with our own marketing.
Additionally, if you are a registered user under the age of 18 and a resident of California, you may request removal of content you have posted to the Services.
Requests can be made to our Support Team.
Please note that making such requests does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content.
For example, we may retain the information for our own internal records, and it is also possible that a third party we do not own or control may copy the posting and repost it elsewhere.
