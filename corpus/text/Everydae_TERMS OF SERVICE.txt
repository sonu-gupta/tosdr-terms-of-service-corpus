10.
Dispute resolutionBy agreeing to these Terms and Conditions, you agree that you are required to resolve any claim that you may have against Everydae on an individual basis in arbitration, as set forth in this section.
This will preclude you from bringing any class, collective, or representative action against Everydae, and also preclude you from participating in or recovering relief under any current or future class, collective, consolidated, or representative action brought against Everydae by someone else.
 
I.
Agreement to Binding Arbitration Between You and Everydae.
You and Everydae agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to (a) these Terms and Conditions or the existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, or (b) your access to or use of the services at any time, whether before or after the date you agreed to these Terms and Conditions, will be settled by binding arbitration between you and Everydae, and not in a court of law. 
You acknowledge and agree that you and Everydae are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding.
Unless both you and Everydae otherwise agree in writing, any arbitration will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, collective, consolidated, or representative proceeding.
However, you and Everydae each retain the right to bring an individual action in small claims court and the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.
 
II.
Rules and Governing Law.
The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with the AAAâs Consumer Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the "AAA Rules") then in effect, except as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.
The AAA Rules are available at https://www.adr.org/Rules or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. 
The parties agree that the arbitrator (âArbitratorâ), and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.
The Arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether the Terms are unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel.
 
Notwithstanding any choice of law or other provision in these Terms and Conditions, the parties agree and acknowledge that this Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.
Â§ 1 et seq.
(âFAAâ), will govern its interpretation and enforcement and proceedings pursuant thereto.
It is the intent of the parties that the FAA and AAA Rules shall preempt all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law.
If the FAA and AAA Rules are found to not apply to any issue that arises under this Arbitration Agreement or the enforcement thereof, then that issue shall be resolved under the laws of the state of California.
 
III.
Process.
A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules.
(The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration - Consumer Arbitration Rules at https://www.adr.org/Rules or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879).
The Arbitrator will be either (1) a retired judge or (2) an attorney specifically licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA's roster of consumer dispute arbitrators.
If the parties are unable to agree upon an Arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the Arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules. 
IV.
Location and Procedure.
Unless you and Everydae otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.
If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Everydae submit to the Arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the Arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary.
If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
Subject to the AAA Rules, the Arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. 
V.
Arbitrator's Decision.
The Arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules.
Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction to do so.
The Arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim.
An Arbitratorâs decision shall be final and binding on all parties.
An Arbitratorâs decision and judgment thereon shall have no precedential or collateral estoppel effect.
If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law.
Everydae will not seek, and hereby waives all rights Everydae may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys' fees and expenses if Everydae prevails in arbitration. 
VI.
Fees.
Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules.
However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Everydae will pay all such fees, unless the Arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). 
VII.
Changes.
If Everydae changes the terms of this section on Arbitration after the date you first agreed to the Terms and Conditions (or to any subsequent changes to the Terms and Conditions), you may reject any such change by providing Everydae written notice of such rejection within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the "Effective" date above.
This written notice must be provided either (a) by mail or hand delivery to our registered agent for service of process, or (b) by email from the email address associated with your Account to: support@everydae.com.
In order to be effective, the notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to reject changes to this Arbitration Agreement.
By rejecting changes, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between you and Everydae in accordance with the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first agreed to the Terms and Conditions (or to any subsequent amendments or changes thereto). &nbsp.
11.
SeverabilityIf any portion of these Terms and Conditions is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (1) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms and Conditions.
(2) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of the Terms and Conditions.
and (3) to the extent that any claims that might arise hereunder must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.&nbsp.
12.
Entire agreementThese Terms and Conditions along with Everydaeâs Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the use of the services and supersede any prior or inconsistent agreements, negotiations, representations, and promises, written or oral, with respect to the subject matter and is binding upon the parties and their permitted successors and assigns.&nbsp.
