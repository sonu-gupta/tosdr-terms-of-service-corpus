 Self-Serve Subscription AgreementLast Updated September 8th, 2020
This Self-Serve Subscription Agreement (âAgreementâ), together with the Terms of Use Agreement found at https://www.netlify.com/legal/terms-of-use/, govern use of Netlifyâs software, solutions and services (âServicesâ) to build, deploy and manage modern web projects.
By clicking on the âCreate Accountâ button (or any similar button) that is presented to you (âCustomerâ) at the time of sign-up or by using or accessing the Services, you indicate that you agree to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Terms of Use Agreement.
You will be referred to in this Agreement as either âyouâ or âCustomer.â If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company, organization or another legal entity, you are agreeing to this Agreement for that entity and representing that you have the authority to bind such entity to this Agreement, in which case the terms âCustomerâ or âyouâ will refer to such entity.
If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with this Agreement, you must not accept this Agreement and must not use the Service.
Some software available through the Services may contain open source or third party software, which may have additional terms and restrictions regarding such softwareâs use.
In appropriate cases, Netlify will enter into a written Enterprise Subscription Agreement with the Customer which will govern instead of this Agreement.1.
Email AccountA valid Netlify account may only be created and maintained by a Customer who provides valid information about the Customer in the signup process.
To maintain a valid account, the Customer must regularly update such information to assure its accuracy.
Netlify reserves the right to terminate any account that does not include a valid email address on file.
Please be aware, however, that if the domain of the email address associated with your account is owned or controlled by an entity and Netlify has now or in the future a direct subscription agreement with such entity, your account may be rolled into and consolidated with that organizationâs account after notification to you.
Following notice to you, if you choose not to change the email address associated with your account, your account will be controlled by the entity.2.
Access to ServicesCustomer is hereby granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable and non-sublicensable right to access and use the Services, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
If Customer is an entity, Customerâs Affiliates may also access and use the Services provided that such Affiliates complies with the terms of this Agreement, and Customer remains responsible for such Affiliatesâ acts and omissions in connection with this Agreement as if Customer had performed such acts and omissions itself.
âAffiliateâ means an entity which, directly or indirectly, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with a party, where âcontrolâ means the power to direct the management or affairs of an entity, for example through the beneficial ownership of more than 50% or more of the voting equity securities or other equivalent voting interests of the entity.
Netlify shall own and retain all right, title and interest in and to the Services and related software, all improvements, enhancements or modifications thereto, and all intellectual property rights associated with the foregoing.
Except for the limited access rights expressly granted in this Section 2, Customer obtains no rights to Netlify Services or intellectual property rights by implication, estoppel or otherwise.3.
Usage RestrictionsPlease refer to the Terms of Use Agreement at https://www.netlify.com/legal/terms-of-use/ for use restrictions that apply to all activity through the Netlify website, including use of the Services.
Customer shall be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of all of its usernames and passwords.
Customer is responsible for all activities that occur under Customerâs account.
The Services may only be used or accessed by persons at least 13 years of age and through an electronic device under the direct control of Customer at all times.
Netlify Managed DNS or Netlify functions are strictly for use with sites deployed to Netlify.
It is expressly allowed to have DNS records within Customerâs zone pointing to non-Netlify resources, but we expect that all zones Customer hosts with Netlify also have at least one hostname hosted by Netlify, and all functions hosted by Netlify are called primarily by a website hosted on our Services.
In some cases, this paragraph may not apply to a Customer who has entered into a separate Enterprise Subscription Agreement with Netlify.4.
Subscription Term and TerminationPlease refer to the subscription term stated in your account admin panel.
Your subscription term will automatically renew for successive periods of the same duration, unless terminated as permitted below.
For Free Usage Tier Customers, the Services may be terminated by either Netlify or Customer, without cause, immediately upon notice.
For Paid Plan Customers, Customer may terminate the Services at any time via Customerâs admin panel or via notice sent to Netlifyâs support addresses.
As discussed below, fees paid for the subscription term are not refundable in case of early termination.
Please note that any termination via the Customerâs admin panel must be done at least one (1) day prior to the end of the then-current subscription term to avoid charges for the renewal term, and any termination not completed via the Customerâs admin panel must be done by written notice at least ten (10) days prior to the end of the then-current subscription term to avoid charges for the renewal term.
For Paid Plan Customers, Netlify may terminate the subscription term immediately upon notice if the Customer fails to comply with any of the terms of this Agreement or the Terms of Use Agreement.
Netlify will not terminate a Paid Plan Customer for convenience during the subscription term.5.
Fees.
No RefundsCustomer shall pay the fees applicable to the Paid Plan that Customer selected at the time of initial sign-up.
Customer may opt to upgrade or downgrade to any other Paid Plan that Netlify is currently offering at any time during Customerâs subscription term.
provided that a downgrade will be not be effective until the renewal of subscription term.
If a Customerâs use exceeds the Services capacity applicable to the Customerâs selected Paid Plan, Customer will incur and agrees to pay additional fees that reflect actual usage, as such fees are described in the terms of the selected Paid Plan.
For Free Usage Tier Customers, if use exceeds the Services capacity applicable to the Free Usage Tier, Customer will incur and agrees to pay additional fees that reflect actual usage, as such fees are described in the terms of the Free Usage Tier description.
All fees are non-cancelable and non-refundable, including in case of Customerâs termination of the subscription term.
Customer pays in advance total fees for the subscription term, and in advance at renewal for any renewal term.
No refunds will be provided for the unused portion of the subscription term or renewal term in case of termination.
Following any termination, however, Customer will continue to have access to the Paid Plan Services through the end of Customerâs then-current subscription term.
Netlify reserves the right to change the fees or to institute new charges or to otherwise change the terms and conditions applicable to the Paid Plans.
provided, however, that any such changes will apply only (a) to new Services procured after the changes.
and (b) to continuing Services for any renewal term(s) starting after notice of such changes was provided or such earlier time as Customer affirmatively accepts the modified terms.
Customer is responsible for all sales, use, value added and similar taxes of any nature associated with Services other than U.S.
taxes based on Netlifyâs income.6.
Free Usage TierNetlifyâs Free Usage Tier is made available by Netlify to allow users to experience Netlifyâs Services, but the Free Usage Tier is offered at Netlifyâs sole discretion.
Netlify reserves the right to change the terms and conditions applicable to the Free Usage Tier, or to discontinue it.
While we always make an effort to communicate clearly and well in advance if we decide a particular website project is not a good fit for our Free Usage Tier, we reserve the right to disable or remove any website project on Netlifyâs Free Usage Tier without notice at our sole discretion.
Free Usage Tier website projects will reside in a common build environment shared by all Free Usage Tier users with no service level commitments.
Netlify may shut down Free Usage Tier website projects without notice for any reason or no reason.
In case of any delays or performance problems including those caused by a malicious attack on a website project, for the Free Usage Tier Netlify will resolve the issue by shutting down the affected website projects.7.
