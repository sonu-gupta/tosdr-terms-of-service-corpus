This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be interpreted broadly.
It includes, but is not limited to, all claims and disputes relating to Your use of the Services and Terms of Use, and applies to You and Skimble, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns.
Before any party may seek arbitration, the party must first send a written "Notice of Dispute" to the other party describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief.
Any notice to Skimble should be sent to 601 Capp Street, San Francisco, CA 94110.
After the Notice of Dispute is received, You and Skimble may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally.
If You and Skimble are unable to resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Notice, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding.

If either party brings a claim in court that should be arbitrated or either party refuses to arbitrate a claim that should be arbitrated, the other party may ask a court to force the parties to "compel" arbitration to resolve the dispute.
Either party can also ask a court to stop a court proceeding while an arbitration proceeding is ongoing.
YOU AGREE THAT BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS OF USE, YOU AND SKIMBLE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
YOU AND SKIMBLE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
ANY ARBITRATION WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.
CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED.
THIS APPLIES TO ALL KINDS OF CLAIMS UNDER ANY LEGAL THEORY.
The Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this section, will govern the arbitration.
For any claim where the total amount of the award sought is $10,000 or less, the AAA, You and Skimble must abide by the following rules: (A) the arbitration will be conducted solely based on written submissions.
and (B) the arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties.
If the claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA rules, and the hearing (if any) must take place in San Francisco, California.
The arbitrator's ruling is binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
In the event this agreement to arbitrate is held unenforceable by a court, then the disputes that would otherwise have been arbitrated will be exclusively brought in the state or federal courts located in San Francisco, California.
Claims of infringement or misappropriation of Skimble's intellectual property rights will be exclusively brought in the state and federal courts located in San Francisco, California.
The Agreement is made under and will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, without regard to its choice of law provisions.
The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to these Terms.
