INFORMATION 508 SOFTWARE COLLECTS



Information 508 Software Collects Through the Website



The Website does not collect Personal Information from Your computer when You browse the Website and request pages from 508 Softwareâs servers.
This means that, unless You voluntarily and knowingly provide 508 Software with Personal Information, 508 Software will not know Your name, email address, or any other personally identifiable information.

When You request a webpage from the 508 Software Website, 508 Softwareâs servers log the information provided in the HTTP request header, JavaScript or similar technical tools, including the IP address, the time of the request, the URL of the request, and other technical information.
508 Software collects this information in order to make its Website function correctly and to provide You the functionality that You see on the Website, as 508 Softwareâs servers use this information to deliver the Internet pages You request.
508 Software also uses this information to better understand how visitors use the Website and how 508 Software can better tune its Website, contents, security, and functionality to best meet Your needs.
However, this information is separate from any other personally identifiable information of persons browsing the Website.

When You use the Website, 508 Software, or trusted authorized third parties, may also collect certain technical and routing information about Your computer (also known as environment variables) to facilitate Your use of the Website and Products enabled thereby.
When You browse the Internet, Your Internet browser (such as Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, or Microsoft Internet Explorer) automatically transmits some information to 508 Software every time You access content on one of 508 Softwareâs Internet domains.
Examples of such information include the URL of the particular web page You visited, the IP address of the computer You are using, or the browser version that You are using to access the Website.
All of this information may be collected by 508 Software and used to help improve its offerings to You.



User Content



User Account holders, if and as applicable, may be permitted to upload certain content onto the Website and Products (
âUser Contentâ
).
This information shall be private and, except in accordance with the Privacy Policy, will not be disclosed to third parties without Your prior permission.



Providing Your Information to 508 Software



You never have to provide Personal Information to 508 Software.
However, should You choose to withhold certain required information, 508 Software may not be able to provide You with some or all of the Products.
Some of the information 508 Software asks You to provide may be identified as mandatory or optional.
If You do not provide the mandatory information with respect to a particular activity, You may not be able to engage in that activity or make such a purchase.
508 Software will inform You of the mandatory or optional nature of the requested or required information.

508 Software is the sole owner of the information it gathers on the Website and Products.
508 Software will only share Your information with outside parties in ways that are described in the Privacy Policy if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law, to cooperate with law enforcement agencies, to comply with a legal process served on 508 Software, or to otherwise comply with any current or future laws and regulations applicable to 508 Software.

You may be provided an opportunity on the Website to allow 508 Software to contact You from time to time regarding 508 Software news and Product updates.
In order to do so, You may be required to provide certain Personal Information to 508 Software.
508 Software will treat this information in accordance with the policies set forth in the Privacy Policy.

When You submit Personal Information to 508 Software through the Website, You understand and 
AGREE
 that this information may be transferred across national boundaries and may be stored and processed in any of the countries in which 508 Software and its affiliates and subsidiaries maintain offices.
You also 
ACKNOWLEDGE
 that in certain countries or with respect to certain activities, the collection, transferring, storage, and processing of Your information may be undertaken by trusted affiliates of 508 Software.
508 Software may use affiliates to aid in the facilitation of technical support services that may potentially receive limited access to Your Personal Information.
Though these affiliates may change from time to time, such affiliates are bound by contract to only process information per 508 Softwareâs instruction, to provide appropriate measures to protect Personal Information against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss alteration, and unauthorized disclosure or access, to assist 508 Software in responding to individuals exercising their rights under the Framework, and for understanding on whether onward transfers of data is allowed.

508 Software may establish relationships with various service providers whose services may become available to You from the Website or from other websites linked therewith.
Typically, these providers would offer services that 508 Software customers might find useful, such as those that can be used in conjunction with the Website or Products.
In order to use these other-website services, You may be required to provide Personal Information to such services providers.
Unless expressly provided to the contrary, Personal Information that You provide while You are visiting a provider's website will be subject to the privacy policy posted on such website.
additionally, Personal Information that You provide while on the 508 Software Website in conjunction with a providerâs service may also be subject to that service providerâs Privacy Policy.
For example, credit card information entered while populating a purchase form or registration process on the Website is collected by a third-party registration service and subject to their respective privacy policy, and not 508 Software.
You should be aware that 508 Softwareâs agreements with these service providers often provide that they will share with 508 Software Personal Information collected from You.
In such instances, 508 Software may use this information in a manner consistent with the Privacy Policy.

Payoneer, PayPal, Tipalti, 2Checkout, and any other third-party payment service providers designated by 508 Software are responsible for payment information You provide 508 Software, which will be subject to their respective privacy policies, such as:


Payoneer Privacy Policy
PayPal Privacy Policy


Tipalti Privacy Policy
2Checkout Privacy Policy


508 Software may also use third-party platforms to sell its Products, such as Amazon, cleverbridge, Digital River, eBay, StackSocial and other third-party platforms authorized by 508 Software to offer its Products.
These third-party platforms may change from time to time, however, regardless of the platform 508 Software chooses to offer its Products through, the safety of Your Personal Information will be paramount and handled in accordance with the Privacy Policy.

Cookies and Web Beacons



The Website uses âcookieâ and âweb beaconâ technology.
âCookiesâ are short pieces of data generated by a web server that a website stores on a userâs computer.
Certain pages on 508 Softwareâs Website may require the use of a cookie for purposes of keeping information You enter on multiple pages together.

Identify and categorize the Internet webpages from which a visitor came to the Website and in order to observe browsing patterns.
and
Provide functionality such as online orders, 508 Software Products, and other functionalities that 508 Software believes would be of interest and value to You.


The types of cookies that 508 Software uses are referred to as âsessionâ cookies and âpersistentâ cookies.
Session cookies are temporary and are automatically deleted once You leave the Website.

You may set your browser to block cookies (consult the instructions for Your particular browser on how to do this), although doing so may adversely affect Your ability to perform certain transactions, use certain functionalities, and access certain content on the 508 Software Website.

Web beacons are used in combination with cookies to help website operators understand how visitors interact with their websites.
A web beacon is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1-pixel x 1-pixel) that is placed on a website.
As opposed to cookies, which are stored on a userâs computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
These web beacons are not tied to personally identifiable information.
The use of web beacons allows a website to measure the actions of the visitor opening the page that contains the web beacon.
It makes it easier to follow and record the activities of a recognized browser, such as the path of pages visited on a website.
508 Software uses the information provided by web beacons to develop a better understanding of how the Websiteâs visitors use the Website, and to facilitate those visitors' interactions with the Website.
508 Software may make the aggregate data obtained from web analytics (including from its third-party analytics providers, if applicable) publicly available.
If this data is made publicly available, none of the information will be personally identifying information or potentially-personally identifying information.

508 Software may use Your email address to send a confirmation email when You sign up for a User Account and, if necessary, may use other information You provide to contact You in order to process a purchase or provide a Product You have selected.
Your Personal Information also may be used to keep You informed about Products and special offers.

As described above, 508 Software may collect information about Your use of the Website and Products.
508 Software may use this aggregate, non-identifying statistical data for statistical analysis, marketing, or similar promotional purposes.

508 Software recognizes and appreciates the importance of responsible use of information collected on the Website.
Without Your 
CONSENT
, 508 Software will not communicate any information to You regarding the Website, Products, or special offers available from 508 Software or its affiliates, although 508 Software may find it necessary to communicate with You regarding Your use of the Website, or Products in certain limited circumstances.
Except in the particular circumstances described in the Privacy Policy, 508 Software will not provide Your name to other companies or organizations without Your 
CONSENT
.



Disclosure of Information to Third Parties



Although 508 Software will always strive to guard Your identity, 508 Software may disclose Your Personal Information without Your permission in limited circumstances.
508 Software will only do so if it has a good-faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) comply with laws, regulations, or government requests or (2) to investigate or protect against harmful activities to its guests, visitors, associates, or property (including the Website or Products), or to others.
If 508 Software is required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide Your personally identifiable information, 508 Software will only do so upon receipt of appropriate documentation.
508 Software may also disclose Your information to investigate violation of and enforce the Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy.
Please know that 508 Software does not take this responsibility lightly.
Your privacy is of paramount importance to 508 Software.

508 Software may use the services of third parties, such as email service providers, purchase, shipping and order processing merchants and marketing companies that act as independent contractors on behalf of 508 Software.
These parties are prohibited from using personally identifiable information for any purpose other than for the purpose 508 Software specifies and are expected to provide the same level of protection for Personal Information as required by the EU-US Privacy Shield Principles.
508 Software does provide non-personally identifiable information to certain service providers for their use on an aggregated basis for the purpose of performing their contractual obligations to 508 Software.
508 Software prohibits the sale or transfer of Personal Information to entities outside of the 508 Software's affiliates for their use without Your approval.



Securing the Transmission and Storage of Information



508 Software operates secure data networks protected by industry-standard firewall and password protection systems.
508 Software security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary, and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by 508 Software users.
508 Software takes steps to ensure that Your Personal Information is treated securely and in accordance with the Privacy Policy.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed secure.
As a result, while 508 Software strives to protect Your Personal Information, it cannot guarantee the security of any information You transmit to 508 Software or from the Website or Products.
Your use of the Website and Products is at Your own risk.

508 Software treats the information You provide to 508 Software as confidential information.
which is, accordingly, subject to 508 Softwareâs company security procedures and corporate policies regarding protection and use of confidential information.
After personally identifiable information reaches 508 Software it is stored on a server with physical and electronic security features as customary in the industry, including utilization of login/password procedures and electronic firewalls designed to block unauthorized access outside of 508 Software.
Because laws applicable to Personal Information vary by country, 508 Software offices or other business operations may put in place additional measures that vary depending on the applicable legal requirements.
Information collected on the sites covered by the Privacy Policy is processed and stored in the U.S.
and possibly other jurisdictions and also in other countries where 508 Software and its service providers conduct business.
All 508 Software affiliates, agents, and employees are aware of 508 Software privacy and security policies and are required by 508 Software to abide by these policies.
Your information is only accessible to the affiliates, agents, and employees who need it in order to perform their specific jobs.



Change of Control

If, as a result of such a business transition, Your Personal Information will be used in a materially different manner, You will be given notice as to these different manners and the opportunity to re-consent or object to such material new purposes.

DATA CHOICES AVAILABLE TO YOU



Opt-In and Disclosure



You may always choose whether or not to disclose Personal Information and that choice will not prevent You from using the Website and having limited access to the Website and Products.

RIGHTS OF EUROPEAN USERS UNDER THE GDPR


508 Software complies with the principles of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) (GDPR).
If You are a natural person of the EU within the meaning of the GDPR (
âQualified Individualâ
), You are afforded certain additional rights by the GDPR as further described within this Section.



Data Controller



If and when 508 Software receives Your Personal Information directly from You via its Website or Products, it performs the functions of a âdata controllerâ, as defined by the GDPR, and has the ability to determine how personal information is collected, for what purposes, and how this data is to be processed.
As the data controller, 508 Software has implemented many technical and operational measures to ensure the most complete protection of Personal Information processed through its Website and Products.



Data Processor



508 Software processes Your Personal Information in accordance with the Privacy Policy and uses industry standard safeguards to secure Your information.



Consent



If You are a Qualified Individual, consents concerning Your Personal Information are handled in compliance with the Framework and the GDPR.
If and when consent requirements under the Privacy Policy conflict with the GDPR, the GDPR will prevail if You are a Qualified Individual.



Legal Basis for Processing



Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which 508 Software obtains consent for a particular purpose.
If the processing of Personal Information is necessary for the performance of a contract to which You are a party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for a particular Product, the processing is based on Art.
6(1)(b).
The same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries or functionality reviews concerning 508 Software Products or services.
If 508 Software is subject to a legal obligation by which processing of Personal Information is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art.
6(1)(c).
If the processing of Personal Information is necessary to protect Your vital interests or that of another Qualified Individual, then the processing is based on Art.
6(1)(d).
Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1)(f) if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by 508 Software or by a third party, except where such interests are prohibited or overridden by Your fundamental rights and freedoms under the GDPR.

Right to Restriction of Processing



As a Qualified Individual, You have the right to restrict processing where one of the following applies:


The accuracy of the Personal Information is contested by the data subject, for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the Personal Information;
The processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the Personal Information and requests instead the restriction of the controllers use of such data;
The controller no longer needs the Personal Information for the purposes of processing, but it is required by the data subject for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.
or
The data subject has objected to processing pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the data subject.




Right to Data Portability



You may request to receive Your Personal Information in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.
You have the right to transmit this data to another controller without interference.

Furthermore, You may have the Personal Information transmitted directly from one controller to another, where technically feasible and where such transmission does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.



Right to Object and Automated Decision-Making



You may object to decisions based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects or similarly significantly affects You, as long as the decision is not (i) necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between You and 508 Software.
(ii) authorized by EU or Member State law to which You are subject.
or (iii) based on the data subjectâs explicit consent.



Right to Object to Processing



You may object to the processing of Your Personal Information using the contact information provided in Section G below, unless there are legitimate grounds for the processing within the public interest, or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.

This right also applies to profiling to the extent that the processing is related to such direct marketing purposes.
If You object to 508 Software processing Your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes, then 508 Software will no longer process the Personal Information for such purposes.



Retention Policy



508 Software only retains personally identifiable information about You for as long as Your User Account remains active and for as long as it needs to provide You with Products or otherwise fulfill the purposes for which 508 Software had initially collected such information, unless otherwise required by law.
508 Software will retain and use information as necessary to comply with its legal obligations, for archival purposes, to assist in the resolve of disputes, and to enforce its agreements.



Cross-Border Data Transfers



If and when sharing of information involves cross-border data transfers, for instance to the U.S.
from an EU Member State, 508 Software uses data contracts with EU standard contract clauses or other suitable data clauses and safeguards to permit data transfers from the EU to other countries.
These standard contractual clauses commit companies transferring and receiving Your Personal Information to protecting the privacy and security of Your data.
