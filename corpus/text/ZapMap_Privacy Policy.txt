or process job vacancy applications and CVs.

We will retain your personal information for as long as your account is active to provide you with access to our Sites and Services as set out in this Privacy Policy.
We also collect and maintain aggregated, anonymized or pseudonymized information which we may retain indefinitely to protect the safety and security of our Sites and Services, improve Zap-Map or comply with legal obligations.
For inactive users, we will retain and use your information solely for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy and to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements and protect Zap-Mapâs legal rights.
We may retain personal data of inactive accounts for a reasonable period to allow us to respond to any follow up enquiries or complaints.
To determine appropriate retention periods for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, and the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data.
In the majority of cases this period is less than 24 months.
Where registered users subsequently withdraw their content and/or wish to remove all of their personal information from our Sites and Services, we will only continue to retain the registration details (including username and password) as part of a suppression list to ensure we comply with all âdo not contactâ requests, to allow us to respond to any follow up enquiries or complaints, and to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements and protect Zap-Mapâs legal rights.3.
HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL DATAWe take security seriously, and the security of your personal data is important to us.
We do our utmost to ensure your personal data is processed in a way that ensures appropriate security from unauthorised or unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction or damage.
We follow industry-standard practices to protect the data we collect and maintain, including using Transport Layer Security (TLS) to encrypt information as it travels over the internet.
In addition to encrypted transmission, your account information is protected by a password, which you should choose carefully and keep secure.
All passwords are stored in âhashâ format which is a widely used method to protect sensitive information.
We have implemented other technical safeguards to protect personal information entering the public domain via user contributions submitted on or to Zap-Map in the form of Zap-Chats (posts on Zap-Map), general comments, contributions to discussions, and/or messages to other users.
For example, all posts are moderated, and all Zap-Chat images and text are scanned before publishing and vehicle registration marks (VRMs) are removed wherever possible using automated visual processing.
In some circumstances, we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes.
This in effect removes any personal information and any security risk associated with your data.
We may use or store this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
However, as no method of electronic communication or storage is completely secure, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
Zap-Map therefore has a protocol in place in the event of a data breach.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so, and within the time limit specified by GDPR regulations.
As part of our data security procedures, we regularly employ penetration testers to review our database and server security measures.
Should you become aware of a security vulnerability across any part of our Sites and Services, we encourage the responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities by emailing security@zap-map.com.4.
YOUR DATA PROTECTION RIGHTSUnder European GDPR legislation which takes effect from 25 May 2018, to process your data we must have a lawful basis to do so.
GDPR permits six legal ways to process your personal data.
In the vast majority of cases, we process your personal data on the basis that:


You have given consent to the processing of your personal data for one or more specific purposes.

In a small number of cases, we may also process your personal data in cases where:

It is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject.
it is necessary in order to protect your vital interests.
it is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us.
or
It is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms which require protection of personal data.

In cases where we must rely on legitimate interests rather than consent to process personal data, we will always consider if it is fair and balanced to do so and if it is within your reasonable expectations.
We will balance your rights and our legitimate interests to ensure that we use your personal information in ways that are not unduly intrusive or unfair.
Examples of legitimate interests include: reporting criminal acts and compliance with law enforcement agencies.
internal and external audit for financial or regulatory compliance purposes.
statutory reporting.
maintenance of suppression lists.
physical and network security.
financial management and control.
and general administration.
GDPR gives you the user of Zap-Map Sites and Services, a number of important rights with which to control the use of your personal information.
Zap-Map is happy to comply with these rights which are as follows:


Withdraw consent â Where we are using your personal information on the basis of your consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time;

Right to be informed â You have the right to be told how your personal information will be used.
This policy document, and shorter summary statements used on our communications, are intended to be a clear and transparent description of how your data may be used;

Right of access â You can write to us asking what information we hold on you and to request a copy of that information.
This is called a Subject Access Request.
From 25 May 2018 we will have 30 days to respond to you once we are satisfied you have rights to see the requested records and we have successfully confirmed your identity;

Right of erasure â From 25 May 2018, you have the right to be forgotten (i.e.
to have your personal data deleted).
Where this occurs, we will only retain your registration details on a suppression list to ensure that you are not contacted in the future.
Should we be unable to comply with your request of erasure for legal reasons, we will notify you about this decision;

Right of rectification â If you believe our records are inaccurate you have the right to ask for those records concerning you to be updated.
This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected.
We may need to verify the accuracy of the new data provided to us;

Right to restrict processing â In certain situations you have the right to ask for processing of your personal data to be restricted because there is some disagreement about its accuracy or legitimate usage;

Right to data portability â Where we are processing your personal data under your consent, the law allows you to request data portability from us to another service provider.
We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format;

Right to object â You have an absolute right to stop the processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes.
This right is implemented by amending your contact preferences;

Right to object to automated decisions â In a situation where a data controller is using your personal data in a computerised model or algorithm to make decisions âthat have a legal effect on youâ, you have the right to object.

To submit a Subject Access Request, change consent, request erasure or rectification, restrict processing, to port data to another provider, and/or to object to automated decision making, please contact Zap-Map via email at privacy@zap-map.com, or write to: Next Green Car Ltd &amp.
