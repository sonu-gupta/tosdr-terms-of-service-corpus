        Fair UseAt Curve our mission is to create a connected world of finance and provide you with a convenient and simple way to manage your finances, in order to allow you to live lifeâs rich experiences.
In order to ensure that the experience of using your Curve card mirrors the experience of using your selected underlying payment card, there are some fair use limitations, which we highlight below.
For further information please see Curve Terms of Use (which includes definitions for terms used below) and Curve FAQs.ATM credit card withdrawal fair useCurve strongly discourages using an underlying credit card in order to withdraw cash.
Please note that your underlying credit card issuer may charge you fees for making such transactions with your Curve card.
In addition to the above fees, Curve may charge you an additional 2% for withdrawals above Â£200 (or currency equivalent) per calendar month, when using a credit card as the underlying card.
Please note that this is not a limit per credit card, but a cumulative for all credit card withdrawals using your Curve card in a calendar month.
This charge does not apply to ATM debit card withdrawals.
Our platform uses third-party systems to identify whether the Funding Source is a debit or credit card.
If you believe your card has been incorrectly defined you should contact us at: support@curve.com, where you will be required to provide evidence as such in order for your case to be investigated.ATM withdrawal fair useCurveâs fees and limits are separate from any terms your card issuer may apply to cash withdrawals or similar transactions.
Please check your card issuerâs terms of service for clarification.ATM domestic frequency fair usageATM usage is free for up to 10 domestic (withdrawals in the same currency as your Funding Source) withdrawals per calendar month after which time you may be charged Â£0.50 (or currency equivalent) per usage for each additional ATM withdrawal.Cash recyclingIn addition to the fees listed above, any behaviour which Curve deems to be âcash recyclingâ is not permitted.
This is where high volumes of cash (e.g.
defined by a high cash to spend ratio) are taken out of an ATM using a credit card or other payment card and then used to repay the card in order to gain rewards on the funding card or Curve Rewards.
Depending on the account activity, âhigh volumes of cash withdrawalsâ could include spending which is under Â£200/ month as it will be assessed on the volume and frequency of ATM withdrawals compared to non-ATM spend.
Any other equivalent usage which the Curve Compliance Team believes aims to achieve the same outcome, for example via the use of money transfer services, topping up savings accounts, transferring cash between payment accounts using Curve is also not permitted.
Such behaviour may result in your Curve account being blocked or cancelled.
See Curve Terms of Use for further information.Compliance with your underlying card issuerâs termsYou always need to be compliant with the terms of use and policies of your underlying payment card.
Your Curve card should not be used for any transactions which are not permissible with or are penalised by your underlying credit card issuer, such as any cash advance or quasi-cash transactions including money orders, buying lottery tickets, paying certain taxes, or transactions for investments purposes.

Non-permissible and penalised transactions may also include âCurve Frontedâ transactions discussed below.
Please see here for examples of such transactions.

Always make sure you check the terms and conditions of your underlying payment card issuer(s) before using this feature.
Please bear in mind that fees may be applied by your underlying card issuer for making such transactions using Curve (in addition to any fees charged by Curve) and that Curve shall not be liable for fees from your underlying card issuer.Curve Fronted transactions:Curve has functionality which enables you to:


pay off your credit card bills with a different underlying credit card selected in the Curve app


make other financial transactions where you normally cannot pay with a credit card or where you would incur significant fees


make government payments where you normally cannot use a credit card or incur significant fees


These types of transactions incur a 1.5% fee, depending on the Curve card subscription you are on (see our Terms of Service and our FAQs).
In addition to any fees charged by Curve, note that the issuer of your underlying card which is funding the Curve Fronted transaction may also charge you fees/fines for these transactions.
You will be able to use the Curve card, with an underlying debit card selected, to pay off your credit card bills for no charge (and this usually has no impact on your credit rating).
You must check the terms and conditions of your underlying card issuer(s) before making Curve Fronted transactions, along with any terms associated with the financial product you are trying to pay, e.g.
credit cards, P2P loans, etc.
You must ensure you fully understand any associated risks in making a Curve Fronted transaction.
For example, using Curve Fronted to pay off your credit card bill may impact your credit rating.
In case you use your Curve card to make Curve Fronted transactions paying off your credit card bill with an underlying credit card and then use the Go Back in Time function to change the underlying funding card to a debit card, your Curve Fronted fees will be refunded and it would not qualify as a Curve Fronted transaction.
Please note this may still (i) impact your credit rating, and (ii) mean your underlying credit card provider may charge you fees/fines.
Curve retains the right to withdraw this feature and/or disallow you from the use of your Curve card and services in the event you fail to use it responsibly and in compliance with applicable terms and this fair use policy.
Thank you for reading the policy.
