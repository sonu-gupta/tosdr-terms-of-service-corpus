Privacy Policy Update As the CEO of Jumbo, I made a commitment to make sure that each decision we make for our product and our company fundamentally respects your privacy.
Over time, we want to honor your trust by consistently striving to ensure each of our decisions protects your privacy.
Pierre Valade



This policy was last updated on December 9th, 2020.

Thank you for using Jumbo Privacy! Here we describe how we might collect, use and handle your personal data when you use our privacy and security services.
But first, we want to highlight two major principles that drive our day-to-day decisions:


Minimize data collection: we will always build services where the collection or use of your personal data is as small as possible, even sometimes not collecting any personal data at all, and you will always know about it and chose if you agree to such collection, or not;

Maximize security: security of our services and your personal data is our priority.
This means that we will always choose the highest standards for ensuring the security of your personal data and the best services to process your personal data, when necessary to use 3rd party products or services.

Whatever your choices are with regards to your activity with Jumbo Privacy, we will never EVER sell your personal data.
As a privacy company, we want your privacy and your use of Jumbo Privacy to be fully transparent and understandable.
Therefore, we have made a summary of all the services Jumbo Privacy provides you, and how every service impacts your personal data.

Please find hereunder more information on the processing of personal data made by Jumbo Privacy â 2121 Atelier Inc.


Title 1 â Jumbo Features you may use


Section 1.
Privacy &amp.
Security Services in the Jumbo App

Jumbo App is a mobile application available on iOS and Android who helps you manage your online privacy and security.
By using the Jumbo App, you are asking the Jumbo App to make changes to your privacy settings and/or personal data.
This is what we call âprocessing of your personal dataâ.
This is why when you open the Jumbo App for the first time, you will see a pop-up displaying a link to this privacy policy.
This privacy policy explains how the processing is done by us, in compliance with applicable laws protecting your privacy.
Before using the Jumbo App, we kindly ask you to read this privacy policy carefully and agree to its terms to continue using the Jumbo App if you agree to it.
If you do not agree with this privacy policy, please do not use the Jumbo App.

A.
Functionalities

Every step of the way, you are the one controlling and deciding how to manage your personal data and privacy settings related to the accounts you link to the Jumbo App.
The Jumbo App will never change anything in your accounts without your prior authorization.
Consequently, we are only processing your data because you have consented to it and/or because we are performing a service you have requested from us.
(i) Subscription to a Jumbo Plan
If you decide to subscribe to a Jumbo Plan (i.e.
Jumbo Plus or Jumbo Pro as described in our TOU) your account information necessary to grant you such subscription will be processed by Apple, if you use the iOS version of the Jumbo App, or Google if you use the Android version of the Jumbo App.
Your personal data processed by Google and Apple to grant you the subscription to a Jumbo Plan include your Google or Apple account information, your name, your email, your payment details, as well as your personal data to enable your subscription (subscription ID and transaction ID).
Jumbo Privacy has no access to your account information, even your name.
Apple and Google only send Jumbo Privacy your subscription ID and transaction ID to confirm your subscription, and to allow us to give you access to the Jumbo Plan you have subscribed to directly in your phone.
Your personal data is stored by Apple and Google until you delete it, except for your payment data, which is kept by Apple and Google for duration imposed by tax regulations in your country.
For more information on how Apple and Google use your data, please consult Title 2 on Processors.

(ii) Change of the privacy settings of your online accounts

We offer you the possibility to scan some of your online accounts through the Jumbo App to suggest privacy changes to your account settings.
You can choose what online account you want to scan through the Jumbo App.
To inform you of the changes we suggest, we will ask you to log into your account through the Jumbo App, using your username and password.
The authentication of your account will be made in your phone during the whole process.
We do not store any of this personal data in the Jumbo Cloud.
We might also offer you to save your password for some online services to avoid having to log in, every time you use the Jumbo App.
If you chose to do so your password will be stored within the Jumbo App in your phone.
In no event will Jumbo Privacy have access to your password.
If you do not wish for your password to be stored in your phone, please do not use the features that allow such storing of password within the Jumbo App.
To delete your passwords, please disconnect your account from the Jumbo App.
When you connect and authenticate any service through the Jumbo App, you are technically leaving the Jumbo App and signing on to your dedicated account on such service.
Therefore, the service might be collecting data related to such authentication.
For more information, we advise you to read the respective serviceâs Privacy Policy.
(iii) Transfer and Storage of your personal content

If you decide to transfer some of your personal content, the transfer of such personal content will be made directly from your account to the storage space you have selected.
This can be the Jumbo App or a third-party storage space selected.
If you decide to store your personal content in the Jumbo App, your personal content will be stored in your phone.
We do not have access to your personal content, and it is not stored in Jumbo Cloud.
If you want to delete your personal content, please delete the Jumbo App.
If you decide to transfer your personal content directly to a third party, we suggest you verify the third partyâs privacy policy before deciding to transfer your personal data to them.
Indeed, we suggest them in our app, but we do not have a business relationship with them.
We also do not endorse them, nor are affiliated to them.
This means that we are not responsible for how your data is stored with them.
(iv) Data breach feature

If you chose to verify if your email address was in a data breach, a hash of your email address you indicate will be transmitted from the Jumbo App, to SpyCloud through Jumbo Cloud.
This means that the hash of your email address will be on Jumbo Cloud for less than one second, and then transferred to SpyCloud.
Rather than verifying a breach with your plain-text email (e.g.
john@smith.com,) we query it with a hash (something that looks like this â642020b48e8f9706b14bc695f3b1f4ad719553dfâ.) A hash is created with whatâs called a âone-way-functionâ which is practically infeasible to revert and as such makes any potential leak of this data less impactful.
Therefore, we never look at your email address nor store it.
We use Microsoft Azure as our datacenter provider, and Cloudflare (more information on Cloudflare here) as our DNS provider (we also use cloudflare to proxy requests to Azure.) SpyCloud will use the hash of your email address only for the purpose of checking if your email address appeared in a data breach.
You can, at any time, disconnect this feature.
The hash of your email will be stored for security reasons by SpyCloud for 6 years.
(v) Privacy Requests/Delete My Data

When you chose to use the Privacy Requests/Delete My Data functionality to delete some of your personal data, or to opt-out from some services, you are mandating Jumbo Privacy to act as your privacy agent.
We will only act as your privacy agent towards the services you have selected in the Jumbo App and for the privacy requests (access, opt-out, deletion) you have chosen in the Jumbo App.
We need your legal full name and your signature to complete the mandate for exercise of privacy rights, and for the email address used to sign up to the account you want to associate to your Privacy Request in order to confirm the authentication ID.
We also use your email address to send you the mandate for your review and signature.
We might also collect your advertising ID (IDFA/AAID) directly in your phone, if you chose to make privacy requests related to such advertising ID, when necessary.
The mandate is sent to you by Docusign which is a certifier of electronic signature.
For more information about the use of your email address by Docusign, please see here.
By signing the mandate you agree that Jumbo Privacy will process your personal data to make the privacy requests you have selected and notably that your full legal name, email, privacy requests and signed mandate will be sent to the service providers you have selected in the Jumbo App.
We use Helpscout to send these emails.
For more information about the use of your personal information by Helpscout, please see here.
Once the privacy requests have been successfully processed, upon expiration of a period of twelve months during which you have not used the Delete My Data feature, we will send you a notification through the Jumbo App, to ask if you want to terminate your mandate from our archives.
Please consult our TOU for more information.
Once a mandate is terminated, we keep a record of your Privacy Requests and your mandate for two years in Jumbo Cloud in case we have any claims from you or the services you ask us to make Privacy Requests to, as proof you lawfully mandated us.
(vi) Secure Together
When you invite friends or if you have been invited to join Jumbo Privacy through the Secure Together feature, we collect a hash of the inviteeâs email address for us to send an email to them, and/or to confirm that they have downloaded the Jumbo App, and notify the inviter.
The hash of the inviteeâs email addresses is stored in Jumbo Cloud for thirty daysâ from the date of collection to give the invitee time to download the Jumbo App and send us such confirmation.
For more information about Jumbo Cloud, please see below.


B.

To send you such push notifications, we use MongoDB as service provider.
For more information about MongoDB, please see here.
Your token is stored by MongoDB, and in the Jumbo Cloud.
Your token is stored until you change your settings or request us to delete it.
We cannot identify you nor localize you through this token but we can know your time zone, the language chosen on your phone and send you messages.
This is why we have a strict security policy when collecting, storing and using your token.
