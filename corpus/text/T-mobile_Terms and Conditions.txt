         Legal Center Terms and Conditions Effective as of March 1, 2021 
 
Thanks for choosing T-Mobile.
Please read these Terms &amp.
Conditions (âT&Csâ), which contain important information about your relationship with T-Mobile, including mandatory arbitration of disputes between us, instead of class actions or jury trials.
You will become bound by these provisions once you accept these T&Cs.

 
WHO IS THIS AGREEMENT WITH?
These T&Cs are an agreement between you and us, T-Mobile USA, Inc., and our controlled subsidiaries, assignees, and agents.

activating, using or paying for the Service or a Device.
or
opening the Device box.

If you donât want to accept these T&Cs, donât do any of these things.
When you accept, you're telling us that you are of legal age (which means you are either legally emancipated, or have reached the age of majority as defined in your jurisdiction) and that you are able to enter into a contract.
If you accept for an organization, you're telling us that you are authorized to bind that organization, and references to "you" in these T&Cs may mean the organization.

In these T&Cs, you'll find important information about:

T-Mobile services provided to you (âServiceâ);
Any equipment for which we provide Service or which we provide to you to be used with our Service, such as a phone, handset, tablet, SIM card, or accessory (collectively, a âDeviceâ);
Any charges, taxes, fees, and other amounts we bill you or that were accepted or processed through your Device (âChargesâ);
Privacy information;
Network management practices;
Limitations of liability.
and
Resolution of disputes by arbitration and class action and jury trial waivers.

 
ARE THERE ANY OTHER TERMS THAT APPLY TO ME?
On Demand Lease Yes.
Your "Agreement" includes these T&Cs, the additional terms found in your Rate Plan, your Data Plan, your Service Agreement, and provisions linked to from these T&Cs.
Sections marked â*â continue after termination of our Agreement with you.
You should be aware that our Privacy Notice, located at www.T-Mobile.com/privacy, and Open Internet Policy, located at www.T-Mobile.com/OpenInternet, apply to the use of our products and services.
You might also have other agreements with us, such as an equipment installment plan or JUMP! Agreement.
 
*HOW DO I RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH T-MOBILE?
By accepting these T&Cs, you are agreeing to resolve any dispute with us through binding arbitration or small claims dispute procedures (unless you opt out), and to waive your rights to a jury trial and to participate in any class action suit.
For additional terms and conditions governing a dispute between us, including how to dispute Charges assessed to you on your bill, choice of law, disclaimers of certain warranties, limitations of liabilities, and your indemnification obligations, see âOther Terms Regarding Dispute Resolutionâ below.


Dispute Resolution and Arbitration.
YOU AND WE EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL CLAIMS OR DISPUTES IN ANY WAY RELATED TO OR CONCERNING THE AGREEMENT, OUR PRIVACY NOTICE, OUR SERVICES, DEVICES OR PRODUCTS, INCLUDING ANY BILLING DISPUTES, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION OR IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT.
This includes any claims against other parties relating to Services or Devices provided or billed to you (such as our suppliers, dealers, authorized retailers, or third-party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in the same proceeding.
You and we each also agree that the Agreement affects interstate commerce so that the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law, not state law, apply and govern the enforceability of this dispute resolution provision (despite the general choice of law provision set forth below).
THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.
THE ARBITRATOR MUST FOLLOW THIS AGREEMENT AND CAN AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT (INCLUDING ATTORNEYSâ FEES).

For Puerto Rico customers, references to "small claims court" should be understood to mean the Puerto Rico Telecommunications Regulatory Board (âTRBâ) for matters within the jurisdiction of said agency.
See OTHER TERMS REGARDING DISPUTE RESOLUTION for details on the billing dispute process in Puerto Rico.
Notwithstanding the above, YOU MAY CHOOSE TO PURSUE YOUR CLAIM IN COURT AND NOT BY ARBITRATION IF YOU OPT OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE EARLIER OF THE DATE YOU PURCHASED A DEVICE FROM US OR THE DATE YOU ACTIVATED A NEW LINE OF SERVICE (the âOpt Out Deadlineâ).
You must opt out by the Opt Out Deadline for each line of Service.
You may opt out of these arbitration procedures by calling 1-866-323-4405 or online at www.T-Mobiledisputeresolution.com.
Any opt-out received after the Opt Out Deadline will not be valid and you will be required to pursue your claim in arbitration or small claims court.

For any and all disputes or claims you have, you must first give us an opportunity to resolve your claim by sending a written description of your claim to the address provided in the âHow Do We Notify Each Otherâ Section below.
You and we each agree to negotiate your claim in good faith.
You agree that you may not commence any arbitration or court proceeding unless you and we are unable to resolve the claim within 60 days after we receive your claim description and you have made a good faith effort to resolve your claim directly with us during that time.

If we are unable to resolve your claim within 60 days despite those good faith efforts, then either you or we may start arbitration or small claims court proceedings.
To begin arbitration, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent (see the âHow Do We Notify Each Otherâ section below) and to the American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ).
The arbitration of all disputes will be administered by the AAA under its Consumer Arbitration Rules in effect at the time the arbitration is commenced, except to the extent any of those rules conflicts with our agreement in these T&Cs, in which case these T&Cs will govern.
The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org.
If the claims asserted in any request or demand for arbitration could have been brought in small claims court, then either you or we may elect to have the claims heard in small claims court, rather than in arbitration, at any time before the arbitrator is appointed, by notifying the other party of that election in writing.
The arbitration of all disputes will be conducted by a single arbitrator, who shall be selected using the following procedure: (a) the AAA will send the parties a list of five candidates.
(b) if the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator from that list, each party shall return its list to the AAA within 10 days, striking up to two candidates, and ranking the remaining candidates in order of preference.
(c) the AAA shall appoint as arbitrator the candidate with the highest aggregate ranking.
and (d) if for any reason the appointment cannot be made according to this procedure, the AAA may exercise its discretion in appointing the arbitrator.
Upon filing of the arbitration demand, we will pay or reimburse all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees.
An arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available in a court, including injunctive or declaratory relief and attorneysâ fees.
In addition, for claims under $75,000 as to which you provided notice and negotiated in good faith as required above before initiating arbitration, if the arbitrator finds that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover reasonable attorneysâ fees and costs.
Except for claims determined to be frivolous, we agree not to seek attorneysâ fees in arbitration even if permitted under applicable law.


Class Action Waiver
.
YOU AND
WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY PROCEEDINGS, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR COURT, WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, MASS, OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION.
If we believe that any claim you have filed in arbitration or in court is inconsistent with this limitation, then you agree that we may seek an order from a court determining whether your claim is within the scope of this class action waiver.
If a court or arbitrator determines in an action between you and us that any part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable with respect to any claim, the arbitration agreement and Class Action Waiver will not apply to that claim, but they will still apply to any and all other claims that you or we may assert in that or any other action.
If you opt out of the arbitration provision as specified above, this Class Action Waiver provision will not apply to you.
Neither you, nor any other customer, can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt out requirements above.



Jury Trial Waiver
.
If a claim proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, YOU AND WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.
 
WHAT IS A RATE PLAN?
Your âRate Planâ includes your Service allotments, for example, for minutes, messages or data, rates and other terms.
T-Mobile may introduce access to new technologies, features, or services that you can add for an additional charge.
If any term in your Rate Plan conflicts with these T&Cs, the term in your Rate Plan governs.
 
HOW WILL I BE CHARGED FOR DATA USAGE?
Data service may be included in your Rate Plan or data pass or you may be charged for data usage on a pay per use basis (âData Planâ).
Your Rate Plan and/or Data Plan will contain more information about how we calculate data usage.
You can check your current usage by visiting my.T-mobile.com or by using a short code from your device (you can find more information about the short code at www.t-mobile.com).
Sprint customers can check current usage by logging into your account at Sprint.com, or by using the My Sprint app.
If you do not have a Data Plan, your Device may not be able to access data services.
 
HOW DO I GIVE OTHER PEOPLE ACCESS TO MY ACCOUNT?
If you want someone else to be able to access and manage your account, you can establish them as an âAuthorized User,â so they can:

Make changes to your account;
Add or remove services or features to your account;
Receive notices and disclosures on your behalf;
Purchase Devices for use with our Service, including under an installment plan.
and
Incur Charges on your account.

The easiest way to designate an Authorized User is online through your my.T-mobile.com account.
Keep in mind that you should not share your account validation information, which includes the last four digits of your social security number or your PIN/passcode.
An Authorized User will need to verify identity before we provide access to account information.
When calling us, this requires presentation of the last four digits of the primary account holderâs social security number or the account PIN/passcode.
This information is sensitive so take steps to protect it.
We will treat presentation of the proper account validation information as authorized access to an account.
 
WHERE, HOW, AND WHEN DOES MY SERVICE WORK?
These T&Cs describe the experience you can expect on our networks, including information about our reasonable network management practices, and the experience on our roaming partnersâ networks.
Please check our coverage maps, which approximate our anticipated coverage area outdoors.
Your experience on our networks may vary and change without notice depending on a variety of factors.
You agree that we are not liable for problems relating to Service availability or quality.
To provide the best possible experience for the most possible customers on T-Mobile or Sprint branded rate plans, for many Rate Plans, we prioritize the data usage of a small percentage of our heavy data users, below that of other customers.
This threshold number is specified in your Rate Plan and is also periodically evaluated and may change over time.
We also prioritize the data of customers who choose certain Rate Plans after the data for other T-Mobile or Sprint branded rate plans, but before customers who are prioritized as heavy data users.
Customers whose data is prioritized lower may notice speeds lower than customers with higher priority in times and locations where there are competing customer demands for network resources.
See your selected service or visit our Open Internet page at the link below for details.
We prioritize smartphone and mobile internet (tablet) over Smartphone Mobile HotSpot (tethering) traffic on our network.
We utilize streaming video optimization technology in our networks to help minimize data consumption while also improving the service experience for all customers.
For example, a small number of Rate Plans experience video optimization via the Binge On feature.
Some qualifying video providers may choose to opt-out of the Binge On program.
For a list of opt-out providers visit http://www.t-mobile.com/offer/binge-on-streaming-video.html#.
The Binge On optimization technology is not applied to the video services of these providers, and high-speed data consumption will continue as if Binge On were not enabled.
Additionally, we may implement other network practices, to ensure optimized network performance as technologies evolve.
For example, some plans may offer gaming or audio streaming at standard or at high definition.
Our Open Internet Policy, located at www.T-Mobile.com/OpenInternet, includes important information on these topics as well as information on commercial terms and performance characteristics (such as expected speed, latency and network practices.)

Using Our Networks


WILL MY SERVICE VARY? WHAT FACTORS MAY AFFECT MY SERVICE?

As our customer, your actual Service area, network availability, coverage and quality may vary based on a number of factors, including your selected service, network capacity, terrain, weather, if you are on a private or public Wi-Fi network, using a non-T-Mobile device, or if your Device no longer supports network technologies compatible with or available on T-Mobileâs network.
Outages and interruptions in Service may occur, and speed of Service varies.
Devices also have varying speed capabilities and may connect to different networks depending on technology.
Even within coverage areas and with broadband-capable devices, network changes, traffic volume, outages, technical limitations, signal strength, obstructions, weather, public safety needs, and other conditions may impact speeds and service availability.
We engineer our network to provide consistent high-speed data service, but at times and at locations where the number of customers using the network exceeds available network resources, customers will experience reduced data speeds.
In those cases, customers who choose certain rate plans may notice speeds lower than customers on other T-Mobile or Sprint branded rate plans, which are prioritized higher on our networks.
Further, to provide the best possible on-device experience for the most possible customers on T-Mobile or Sprint branded plans and minimize capacity issues and degradation in network performance, we may, without advance notice, take any actions necessary to manage our network on a content-agnostic basis, including prioritizing all on-device data over Smartphone Mobile HotSpot (tethering) data and, for the vast majority of Rate Plans, further prioritizing the data usage of a small percentage of heavy data users (as defined in their Rate Plans), below that of all other customers in times and locations where there are competing customer demands for network resources, for the remainder of the billing cycle.
This threshold number is periodically evaluated and may change over time.
Where the network is lightly loaded in relation to available capacity, a customer whose data is prioritized below other data traffic will notice little, if any, effect from having lower priority.
This will be the case in the vast majority of times and locations.
At times and locations where the network is heavily loaded in relation to available capacity, however, these customers will likely see significant reductions in data speeds, especially if they are engaged in data-intensive activities.
Customers should be aware that these practices may occasionally result in speeds below those typically experienced on our 5G or LTE networks.
We constantly work to improve network performance and capacity, but there are physical and technical limits on how much capacity is available, and in constrained locations the frequency of heavy loading in relation to available capacity may be greater than in other locations.
When network loading goes down or the customer moves to a location that is less heavily loaded in relation to available capacity, the customerâs speeds will likely improve.
Visit www.T-Mobile.com/OpenInternet for details and for current data amount subject to this practice.

*CAN I ROAM ON MY DEVICE?



Domestic Roaming.
 Your Device may connect to another providerâs network (âOff-Netâ).
This may happen even when you are within the T-Mobile coverage area.
Check your Device to determine if you are Off-Net.
Please do not abuse this.
we may limit or terminate your Service if you do.
Your device may also connect to another providerâs secured Wi-Fi network.
See WHAT ARE THE PERMITTED AND PROHIBITED USES FOR MY DEVICE AND THE SERVICE? section for additional info.



International Roaming &amp.
Dialing.
 Availability and features offered for international roaming and dialing vary depending on your Rate Plan and Device.
All countries may not be available for roaming, and available countries may change from time to time.
visit http://www.t-mobile.com/optional-services/roaming.html for more information about which countries are currently available for roaming.
Whether roaming internationally or making and sending international calls and messages while in the U.S.
(or Puerto Rico), you may be charged international rates (including for voicemails left for you and for data usage).
This includes per-minute rates for calls, and per-minute rates for calls transferred to your voicemail, and the relevant data rates for data usage.
You may be charged for more than one call for unanswered calls that are forwarded to voicemail regardless of whether the calls result in actual voicemail messages being left for you and regardless of whether your Device is on or off.
Different rates and rounding increments apply in different countries.
For information on international access, rates, services, and coverage, visit http://www.t-mobile.com/optional-services/roaming.html.
While roaming internationally, your data throughput may be reduced, and your Service may be otherwise limited or terminated at any time without notice.
You are responsible for complying with U.S.
Export Control laws and regulations, and the import laws and regulations of foreign countries when traveling internationally with your Device.
The availability of, and access to, emergency calling services (e.g., 911 in the U.S.), may vary by country.
You should familiarize yourself with how to access these services before using your handset for international roaming.
See WHAT ARE THE PERMITTED AND PROHIBITED USES FOR MY DEVICE AND THE SERVICE? section for additional information about international roaming.
 

Streaming Video

We deploy streaming video optimization technology in our network, which also helps to ensure that available network capacity can be utilized to provide a good service experience for the maximum number of customers.
The optimization technology is intended to manage data usage on the network, reduce the risk of streaming video stalling and buffering on mobile devices, and reduce the amount of data consumed for streaming video, making room for other users to enjoy higher speeds and a better network experience overall.
Video optimization occurs only to data streams that are identified by our packet-core network as video or where the video provider has chosen to establish protocols to self-optimize their video.
While many changes to streaming video files are likely to be indiscernible, the optimization process may impact the appearance of the streaming video as displayed on a userâs Device.
In some instances, video optimization may also identify and treat downloads of video files as if they were real-time video streams.
However, the T-Mobile network offers content providers a way to opt-in to a protocol to help identify video downloads and ensure they are not treated as streaming video.
Customers may have Rate Plans where video optimization is delivered at DVD quality (typically 480p), with the ability to add a feature where video streams at speeds that provide HD video capability (typically 1080p).
Alternatively, customers may have Rate Plans that offer video optimization as a customer-controlled feature (e.g., âBinge Onâ) to toggle on or off DVD-quality video optimization.
Some qualifying video providers may choose to opt-out of the Binge On program, see listing at http://www.t-mobile.com/offer/binge-on-streaming-video.html#.
The Binge On optimization technology is not applied to the video services of these providers, and high-speed data consumption will continue as if Binge On were not enabled.
For more information about video optimization, visit our Open Internet Policy located at www.T-Mobile.com/OpenInternet. *HOW WILL I BE BILLED FOR USE OF THE SERVICES?
You agree to pay all Charges we assess and bill you or that were accepted or processed through all Devices on your account.
You agree to provide us with accurate and complete billing and tax related information and to report all changes within 30 days of the change.
You will receive an electronic (paperless) bill unless you tell us you want a paper bill.
You have the option of switching to a paper bill at no cost to you by changing your billing preferences at www.my.T-Mobile.comor by contacting Customer Care.
For more information about paperless billing, please visit www.t-mobile.com/billterms.
Your Device can be used to purchase services and products from third parties, and Charges for these purchases may be included on your T-Mobile bill.
For no additional cost you can block third party charges from being included on your T-Mobile bill by logging into your account at www.my.T-Mobile.com or calling Customer Care.
 

Off-Rate Plan Charges. You may have to pay extra for calls to some numbers (e.g.
conference &amp.
chat lines, broadcast, calling card, international, 900 or 976 calls, etc.).
Here is more information about how we bill for calls, data usage and messaging, Wi-Fi usage, third party charges, taxes, and surcharges.


Usage
.
Airtime usage is measured from the time the network begins to process a call (before the phone rings or the call is answered) through its termination of the call (after you hang up).
For voice calls, we round up any fraction of a minute to the next full minute.
Depending upon your Rate Plan, data usage may be rounded at the end of each data session, at the end of your billing cycle, and/or at the time you switch data plans.
You may be charged for more than one call/message when you use certain features resulting in multiple inbound or outbound calls/messages (such as call forwarding, call waiting, voicemail, conference calling, and multi-party messaging).
You will be charged for text, instant or picture messages, and email whether read or unread, sent or received, solicited or unsolicited.
We use filters to block spam messages, but we do not guarantee that you will not receive spam or other unsolicited messages.
Additional blocking options are available at www.my.T-Mobile.com.
Most usage and Charges incurred during a billing cycle will be included in your bill for that cycle.
Some usage and Charges may be delayed to a later billing cycle, which may cause you to exceed Rate Plan allotments in a later billing cycle.
Unused Rate Plan allotments expire at the end of your billing cycle.
You may be billed additional Charges for certain features and services.
Charges for Wi-Fi usage may vary.
see your Rate Plan for more details.


Taxes. You agree to pay all taxes and fees imposed by governments or governmental entities.
We may not give advance notice of changes to these charges.
To determine taxes &amp.
fees, we use the street address you identified as your Place of Primary Use (âPPUâ), unless the tax laws require use of a different address in which case we utilize the best information available to us to determine the correct address.
The PPU for Puerto Rico customers must be in Puerto Rico.
If you did not identify the correct PPU, or if you provided an address, such as a PO Box, that is not a recognized street address, does not allow us to identify the applicable taxing jurisdiction(s), or does not reflect the Service area associated with your telephone number, you may be assigned a default location for tax purposes.
Except as may be otherwise required by law, in the event you dispute your PPU or the location we assigned you and the resulting taxes or fees applied on your bill, you must request a refund of the disputed tax or fee within 60 days of the date of our bill containing such tax or fee.
Regardless of any Rate Plan guarantee, taxes and fees may change from time to time without notice.


Surcharges. You agree to pay all surcharges applicable to your Rate Plan.
Surcharges are not mandated or imposed on you by law, they are T-Mobile Charges that are determined, collected, and retained by us.
The components and component amounts of the Surcharges are subject to change without notice.
Surcharges include charges, costs, fees, and certain taxes that we incur to provide Services (and are not government taxes or fees imposed directly on our customers).
Examples include general and administrative fees (such as certain costs we incur to provide Service), as well as governmental-related assessments (such as Federal or State Universal Service fees, regulatory or public safety charges, environmental fees, and gross receipts taxes).
Surcharges assessed to you will vary depending on the type of Service and the Rate Plan you have. Surcharges may change from time to time without notice regardless of any Rate Plan guarantee (and subject to our 14-day notice policy if changes to your Service or Rate Plan will have a material adverse effect on you).
Surcharges will apply whether or not you benefit from the programs, activities, or services included in the Surcharge.
When Surcharges are assessed in connection with your Service, you can find the Surcharges detailed in either the âTaxes, Fees &amp.
Surchargesâ, âT-Mobile Fees and Chargesâ or the âOther Chargesâ sections of your bill or at www.myT-Mobile.com.
Other Fees.
We may charge activation, prepayment, reactivation, program, or other fees to establish, change, or maintain Services, Certain transactions may also be subject to a charge (for example, convenience payment, changing phone numbers, handset upgrades, etc.).
We will tell you if any of these fees apply to your requested transaction.
 
WHAT IF I DONâT PAY ON TIME?
We may charge a late fee of up to the highest amount allowed by law.
We may also charge a returned payment fee at the highest amount permissible by law. We may restrict your payment methods to cashierâs check, money order, or other similar secure forms of payment at any time for good reason.
If you fail to pay on time and we refer your account to a third party for collection, a collection fee will be assessed by T-Mobile and will be due at the time of the referral to the third party.
The fee will be calculated as a percentage of the amount due to the extent permitted, or not otherwise prohibited, by applicable law.
If we accept late or partial payments, you still must pay us the full amount you owe, including late fees.
We will not honor limiting notations you make on or with your checks.
Late payment, non-payment and/or collection fees are intended to be a reasonable advance estimate of our actual costs resulting from late payments and non-payments by our customers.
these costs are not readily ascertainable and are difficult to predict or calculate at the time that these fees are set.
You and we each agree that if you fail to timely pay amounts due, we may assign your account for collection, and the collection agency may pursue, in small claims court, claims limited strictly to the collection of the past due amounts and any interest or costs of collection permitted by law or this Agreement.
If your account is unpaid or otherwise not in good standing, your service may be reduced, suspended, or terminated.
 
*DOES T-MOBILE CHECK MY CREDIT?
Yes, for many of our products and services.
We may get information about your credit history from credit-reporting agencies, which may affect your credit rating.
We may report information about your account to credit bureaus.
Late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report.
We may place a temporary or permanent account spending limit (ASL) on your account to limit the amount you can charge, regardless of when payment on those charges is due, and we may suspend your Services without prior notice if your account balance reached the ASL, even if your account is not past due.
 
AM I REQUIRED TO MAKE A DEPOSIT?
We may require you to make a deposit or prepayment for Services.
We can apply deposits, payments, or prepayments in any order to any amounts you owe us on any account.
This deposit is refundable, and will be applied as a credit to your account along with interest as may be required by law.
 
CAN T-MOBILE ACCESS MY DEVICE?
We may remotely change software, systems, applications, features or programming on your Device without notice.
These changes will modify your Device and may affect or erase data you have stored on your Device, the way you have programmed your Device, or the way you use your Device.
You will not be able to use your Device during the installation of the changes, even for emergencies.
 
CAN I DOWNLOAD AND USE THIRD PARTY CONTENT AND APPS ON MY DEVICE?
Yes.
You are free to download and use content or applications (âContent &amp.
Appsâ) on your Device that are not provided by T-Mobile, at your own risk.
Third party Content &amp.
Apps may require your agreement to a license or other terms with the third party.
Some Devices or Content &amp.

Wireless alert capable handsets with appropriate notification settings are required for the service There is no additional charge for these wireless emergency alerts.

911 ACCESS

PLEASE CAREFULLY READ THE INFORMATION BELOW.
IT CONTAINS IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING LIMITATIONS OF 911 FUNCTIONALITY.
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THESE LIMITATIONS AND AGREE TO SHARE THESE LIMITATIONS WITH ANYONE WHO MAY USE YOUR SERVICE TO PLACE CALLS OR SEND TEXTS.

911 services are provided by your state and local government.
T-Mobile handsets are capable of making calls to 911 in the United States, and 911 access is available to customers regardless of your Rate Plan.
The handset must have battery power and network connectivity to complete a 911 call.
Although T-Mobile is often capable of communicating your phone number and/or current location to a public safety answering point (â911 Communications Centerâ), in some cases, 911 Communications Center operators may not know your phone number or have information about your current location.
As a result, when making 911 calls, you should provide your contact information and current location.
Other third-party entities are involved in connecting a 911 call and T-Mobile is not solely responsible for determining which 911 Communications Center your 911 call may be routed to.
If you are porting a phone number to or from us, we may not be able to provide you with some Services, such as 911 location services while the port is in process.
If you are outside the U.S., you may have to dial a different number than 911 to call emergency services.


Wi-Fi Calling. Wi-Fi Calling services use a broadband internet connection to make calls, including  calls to 911.
Calls to 911 using Wi-Fi Calling operate differently than 911 calls made over a cellular network or a landline phone.
If possible, use a cellular connection or a landline phone to place any 911 calls.
If a cellular connection is available when you a place a 911 call, your handset will make the 911 call using the handsetâs native dialer over the cellular connection to improve call quality and location accuracy even if you have Wi-Fi Calling services enabled. 
When you first enable Wi-Fi Calling on T-Mobile, you must provide us with the primary street address at which the Wi-Fi Calling service will be used (âYour E911 Registered Addressâ).
If you call 911 over Wi-Fi, we may transmit Your E911 Registered Address to the 911 Communications Center that answers the call, and it may be used to help emergency responders locate you.
However, because of the limitations associated with Wi-Fi 911 calling, including the fact that the broadband internet connection utilized may be supplied by a third-party unaffiliated with T-Mobile, you should provide the 911 Communications Center with your contact information and current location.
You agree to update Your E911 Registered Address before you use the Wi-Fi Calling service at a location different from Your E911 Registered Address.
You can update Your E911 Registered Address by accessing your MyT-Mobile.com account or by contacting T-Mobile Customer Care.


Text-to-911. Text-to-911 service may be available in some locations where T-Mobile service is provided.
This is dependent on your local 911 Communication Centerâs ability to receive text messages.


TTY Calls to 911. Calls to 911 from a TTY will not work when using Wi-Fi Calling or Voice-over-LTE (âVoLTEâ).
If you cannot make a voice call to 911, T-Mobile recommends that you use an internet-based Telecommunications Relay Service such as Video Relay Service, IP Relay Service, or IP Captioned Telephone Service.
T-Mobile Real-Time Text (âRTTâ) technology is also available on T-Mobileâs network and can be used on select devices to contact 911.
For more information, see www.t-mobile.com/responsibility/consumer-info/accessibility-policy.


VoIP Services


Some T-Mobile voice services, including Wi-Fi Calling services, utilize Voice over Internet Protocol (âVoIPâ) technology.
VoIP telephony is fundamentally different from traditional telephone service and has inherent limitations.
VoIP services, including 911 calling, may be unavailable or limited in some circumstances.
If possible, use a cellular connection to place any 911 calls.
911 functionality for T-Mobile VoIP services may be impaired or unavailable:

If you use the VoIP Service in a location other than at Your E911 Registered Address;
If there is a problem with the broadband network utilized, including network congestion, network, equipment, power failure, another technical problem, or during system updates or upgrades.
and
If you have lost electrical power.

Before using any T-Mobile VoIP service, you must provide us with Your E911 Registered Address.
If you call 911 using a T-Mobile VoIP service, we may transmit Your E911 Registered Address to the 911 Communications Center that answers the call, and it may be used to help emergency responders locate you.
You agree to update Your E911 Registered Address before you use your T-Mobile VoIP service at a different location.
You can update your E911 Registered Address by accessing your MyT-Mobile.com account or by contacting T-Mobile Customer Care.
In some circumstances when using a T-Mobile VoIP service, we may not be able to provide 911 Communications Centers with your correct current location.
If you make a 911 call using a T-Mobile VoIP service, you should always provide the 911 Communications Center your contact information and current location.
In some limited circumstances, such as when a user makes a call from an area not covered by the 911 network, users may have limited access, or no access, to either basic 911 or E911.
If the user does not have access to either basic 911 or E911, calls to 911 using T-Mobile VoIP services will be sent to a national emergency call center.
A trained agent at the national emergency call center should ask for the name, telephone number and location of the user calling 911, and then contact the local 911 Communications Center to request help for the user.
