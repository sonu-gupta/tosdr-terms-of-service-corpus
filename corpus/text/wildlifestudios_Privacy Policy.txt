You also can manage some aspects of information collection and use by visiting the âsettingsâ page of your mobile device and reviewing the permissions of each application or âapp.â

Opting Out of Third Party Tailored AdvertisingWe neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on the device you use to access the Services by non-affiliated third parties.
 If you are interested in more information about tailored advertising and your choices to prevent third parties from delivering tailored web and mobile web advertising, you may visit the following websites:

Network Advertising Initiative Consumer Opt-Out Page or the Digital Advertising Alliance Opt-Out Page for U.S.-based advertising
Your Online Choices EU website for EU-based advertising.
and &nbsp.
  
Google Ads Settings.

These opt-out tools are provided by third parties, not Wildlife Studios.
Wildlife Studios does not control or operate these tools or the choices that advertisers and others provide through these tools.
In addition, if you do not want to receive tailored in-application advertisements from third parties that relate to your interests in apps on your mobile device, you may opt-out by adjusting the ad tracking settings on your device.
You can also reset the advertising identifierâ (like an IDFA) from your mobile deviceâs settings page, which will prevent continued use of existing behavioral data tied to the previous âAdvertising Identifier.â In addition, depending on the platform provider (such as Apple or Google), you may be able to download apps, such as the Digital Advertising Allianceâs âAppChoicesâ app, that offer to provide you with control regarding the collection and use of cross-app data for tailored advertising.
Like the opt-out tools mentioned above for the web, these mobile opt-out tools are provided by third parties, not Wildlife Studios.
Wildlife Studios does not control or operate these tools or the choices that advertisers and others provide through these tools.

Please note that you may still receive advertisements from third parties within Wildlife Studios' apps even if you opt-out of tailored advertising, but they will not be based on your activity across unrelated web sites or apps.
f.

Our Policies Concerning ChildrenProtecting childrenâs privacy online is very important to us.
With the exception of Math Learner, our Services are not directed to children (under 13 in the US, under 16 for EU residents, or other age as required by local law), and the Services do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children.
When a user indicates they are under 13 (or the applicable age in their territory), we take actions such as limiting their access to certain features, such as social media plug-ins, chat features, and certain types of notification alerts, and limiting the collection and sharing of personal information to only what is necessary to support the internal operations of our Services.
 
If you are a parent or guardian and have any concerns regarding the service, wish to review information collected from your child, or have that information modified or deleted, you may contact us by submitting a request using our webform.
If we become aware that a child has provided us with Personal Data, we will delete any Personal Data we have collected, unless we have a legal obligation to keep it, and terminate the childâs account and/or revert them to the underage experience, as applicable.Transfer of Information to Other CountriesYour information may be transferred to the United States, Brazil, or other locations to process and store data in accordance with our Privacy Policy and to provide you with our Services.
Please note that privacy laws vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and the laws applicable in the location where your information is transferred, stored, used or processed, may be different from the applicable privacy laws in the country in which you are a resident.
We are committed to ensuring your information is protected.How Long We Keep Your InformationWe keep your information for no longer than necessary for the purposes for which it is processed.
The length of time for which we retain information depends on the purposes for which we collect and use it and/or as required to comply with applicable laws.
 For instance, we may retain some information for a few years after you have closed your account with us if this is necessary to meet our legal obligations or to exercise, defend or establish legal rights.Security of Your InformationWe implement appropriate security measures to protect the security of your information.
If you access our Services through a social network and your social network account is hacked, this may lead to someone accessing your Wildlife Studios apps without your permission.
Be careful to keep your social network account information, including your social network account password, secure as well.
We urge you to log out of your Wildlife Studios account and any social network account you have used to access our Services after you use it.
When you sign into your Wildlife Studios account or enter payment information, we or our third party payment processor use secure socket layer technology ("SSL") to encrypt the transmission of that information.
While we take reasonable precautions against possible security breaches of our Services and our customer databases and records, no website or Internet transmission is completely secure.
Although we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur, we cannot guarantee the security of your information while it is being transmitted to our Service.
Any transmission is at your own risk.
If you have questions about the security of our websites, please contact us by visiting our website at http://www.wildlifestudios.com/.Your California Privacy RightsUnder the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (âCCPAâ), California residents have certain rights around our collection, use, and sharing of their personal information as explained in the Your Legal Rights section above.
In addition, you have the right not to be discriminated against for exercising your privacy rights.
If you wish to exercise any of your rights as a California resident, please contact us as set forth below.
In exercising any rights under the CCPA, we will ask certain questions in order to verify your identity and your status as a California resident.
An agent may also submit a request on your behalf, but we may require that you verify the agent has been authorized by you.
As described above in the How We Share Your Information section, we have collected and disclosed the following categories of personal information for a business purpose over the past 12 months to our service providers and third parties listed in the Privacy Policies of Linked Third Party Services and Advertisers section above:
