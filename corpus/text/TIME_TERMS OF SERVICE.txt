 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY 

You acknowledge and agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by law, the entire risk arising out of your access to and use of the Sites, Services, Content and User Content, and your posting of any User Content remains with you.
Neither TIME nor any other party involved in creating, producing, or delivering the Sites or Services, Content or User Content will be liable for any incidental, special, exemplary or consequential damages, including lost profits, loss of data or loss of goodwill, service interruption, computer damage or system failure or the cost of substitute products or services, or for any damages for personal or bodily injury or emotional distress arising out of or in connection with these Terms or from the use of or inability to use the Sites or Services, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), product liability or any other legal theory, and whether or not TIME has been informed of the possibility of such damage, even if a limited remedy set forth herein is found to have failed its essential purpose.
In no event will TIMEâ aggregate liability arising out of or in connection with these Terms and your use of the Sites or Services, exceed the amounts you have paid to TIME in the twelve month period prior to the event giving rise to the liability, or $50USD if no such payments have been made, as applicable.

CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS RIGHTS




If you are a California resident and in connection with the foregoing releases, you hereby waive California Civil Code Section 1542 (and any similar provision in any other jurisdiction) which states: 




â

A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.â



 GEOGRAPHIC RESTRICTIONS

TIME will provide the Sites and Services with reasonable care and skill but makes no representations that they are appropriate for use from locations outside the United States or compliant with laws outside the United States.

TIME will review and may update these Terms periodically and will note the new effective date if any changes are made.
If we make material changes to these Terms we may choose to notify you by prominently posting a notice of a new Terms of Service update on the Sites for a period of time in our discretion but we encourage you to review these Terms and make note of the âeffective dateâ frequently. Your continued use of the Sites and Services after we post any changes to the Terms signifies your agreement to any such changes.

 ARBITRATION / DISPUTE RESOLUTION FOR U.S.
RESIDENTS


Governing Law. These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without application of conflict of laws rules, except that these Arbitration provisions shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. 

Resolution of Any Dispute. In the event a dispute arises between you and TIME (âDisputeâ), we want to provide you with an efficient, neutral and cost-effective means of resolving the dispute.
Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customerâs satisfaction by contacting us by writing to TIME USA LLC, TIME USA LLC, 1095 Sixth Avenue, New York, NY 10036, United States..
If, however, the Dispute cannot be resolved by the personnel directly involved, the parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute promptly by negotiation between duly appointed executive officers or other representatives of such parties, with full authority to negotiate and settle the Dispute.
If a Dispute has not been resolved by negotiations within 90 days as provided hereinabove, such Dispute shall be submitted to JAMS, or its successor (collectively, âJAMSâ), for mediation as provided hereinbelow.
Any party involved in the Dispute may commence mediation by providing to JAMS and each other party involved in the Dispute a written request for mediation, setting forth the subject of the Dispute and the relief requested.
The parties will cooperate with JAMS and with one another in selecting a mediator from JAMSâ panel of neutrals and in scheduling the mediation proceedings.
The parties covenant that they will participate in the mediation in good faith, and that they will share equally in its costs.
All offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether oral or written, made in the course of the mediation by any of the parties, their agents, employees, experts and attorneys, and by the mediator and any JAMS employees, are confidential, privileged and inadmissible for any purpose, including impeachment, in any litigation or other proceeding involving the parties.
provided, however, that evidence that is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as a result of its use in the mediation.
None of the parties may commence arbitration or a civil action with respect to the matters submitted to mediation until after the completion of the initial mediation session, or 30 business days after the date of filing the written request for mediation, whichever occurs first.
Mediation may continue after the commencement of arbitration or a civil action, if the parties so desire.

Limitation of Legal Remedies.
If there is a Dispute that remains unresolved after mediation, INSTEAD OF SUING IN COURT, YOU AND TIME EACH AGREE TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO THE JAMS ARBITRATION RULES AND PROCEDURES, ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, WITHOUT CLASS RELIEF, EXCEPT FOR DISPUTES PERTAINING TO TIMEâS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND STATUTORY CLAIMS THAT PURSUANT TO LAW ARE NOT ARBITRABLE.
This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted.
It includes claims based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory (âClaim(s)â).
The arbitrator's decision and award are final and binding, with some exceptions under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.
1, et seq., and judgment on the award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction.

Jury Trial Waiver.
YOU AND TIME EACH VOLUNTARILY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESOLVING ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN US ARISING OUT OF THESE TERMS OR THE SITES OR SERVICES.

Class Action Waiver.
YOU AND TIME EACH AGREE THAT CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER MAY ONLY BE BROUGHT IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
All arbitrations under these Terms must be conducted on an individual (and not a class-wide) basis, and an arbitrator will have no authority to award class-wide relief.
You acknowledge and agree that these Terms specifically prohibit you from commencing any legal proceedings as a representative of others, participating in a class, representative, or collective action as a class representative, class member or an opt-in party, acting as a private attorney general, or joining or consolidating Claims with claims or proceedings brought by any other person ("Class Action Waiver").

Arbitration Procedures. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of the Claim and setting forth the specific relief sought ("Notice").
All Notices to TIME must be sent to the following address: TIME USA LLC, 1095 Sixth Avenue, New York, NY 10036, United States..
Our notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us but if no such information exists or if such information is not current, then we have no obligation under this Section.
Upon receipt of such Notice, the receiving party will have a 60-day period in which it may satisfy the Claim against it by fully curing the Claim, providing all the relief requested in the Notice, or entering into a settlement to resolve the Claim to the mutual satisfaction of the parties.
After the expiration of such 60-day cure period, you or TIME may commence an arbitration proceeding.
Unless otherwise agreed to by you and TIME in writing, the arbitration will be governed and conducted by JAMS before a single arbitrator with substantial experience in the internet industry and shall follow substantive law in adjudicating the Dispute.
This Section shall be construed as a written agreement to arbitrate pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (âFAAâ).
You and TIME agree that this Section satisfies the writing requirement of the FAA.
The arbitration of any claim will be conducted in the State of New York, and for any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $5,000.00, you shall have the choice as to whether the hearing is conducted in person or by telephone.
Each party will pay the fees and costs of its own counsel, experts and witnesses.
The JAMS rules are available on its website at www.jamsadr.com.
To the extent that this dispute resolution Section conflicts with JAMS minimum standards for procedural fairness, the JAMS rules and/or minimum standards for arbitration procedures in that regard shall control.
Neither party shall sue the other party other than as provided herein or for enforcement of this clause or for the arbitratorâs award.
and any such suit may be brought only in Federal District Court or, if any such court lacks jurisdiction, in any state court that has jurisdiction.
The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, or enforceability of these Terms including any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable.
However, the preceding sentence shall not apply to the clause entitled âClass Action Waiverâ.

Exception to Arbitration
.
 Only disputes or actions pertaining to TIMEâs intellectual property rights, or statutory claims that pursuant to law are not arbitrable, are exempt from arbitration.

Survival. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms.

Severability. If any provision of this Section is declared or found by a court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator to be unlawful, unenforceable or void, such provision will be ineffective only to the extent that it is found unlawful, unenforceable or void, and the remainder of the provision and all other provisions will remain fully enforceable, except that if the Class Action Waiver for any Claim cannot be enforced, then the provision to arbitrate will not apply.



 DISPUTE RESOLUTION NON-U.S.
RESIDENTS

In the event of any dispute you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it.
Our notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us but if no such information exists or if such information is not current, then we have no obligation under this section.
Your notice to us must be sent to us at timeforeigndispute@time.com or to TIME USA LLC, 1095 Sixth Avenue, New York, NY 10036, United States.
For a period of 60 days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, TIME and you will engage in a dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the dispute, though nothing will require either you or TIME to resolve the dispute on terms either you or TIME, in each of our sole discretion, are unsatisfactory.
Nothing in this section will prevent a party from pursuing their claims in court or another complaint process.
If your country of residence or establishment is outside the U.S., these Terms will be governed by and interpreted in accordance with English law.
The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) is excluded.
This choice of law does not impact your rights as a consumer according to the consumer protection laws of your country of residence.
If you are a consumer, you may be able to bring judicial proceedings against us arising from or in connection with these Terms in a court within a jurisdiction according to the laws of your country of residence or the English courts.
if you are acting as a business, you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts.
If you have any comments, queries or complaints about these Terms or our Services, please contact us at legal@time.com.

Headings in the Terms are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect the interpretation or construction of this agreement.

The rights and remedies of TIME under these Terms and any other applicable agreement between you and TIME shall be cumulative, and the exercise of any such right or remedy shall not limit TIMEâ right to exercise any other right or remedy.
