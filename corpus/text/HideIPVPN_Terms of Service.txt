Terms of Service GENERAL
HideIPVPN.com (hereafter referenced as HideIPVPN) provides VPN services under the name of HideIPVPN.com.
As a provider of internet services, HideIPVPN offers its clients, and their customers and users, the means to disseminate public, private, commercial, and non-commercial information.
HideIPVPN respects the fact that the Internet provides a forum for free and open discussion and dissemination of information.
However, when there are competing interests at issue, HideIPVPN reserves the right to take certain preventative or corrective actions.
In order to protect these competing interests, HideIPVPN has developed these Terms Of Service, which supplements and explains certain terms of each customerâs respective service agreement.
These terms are intended as a guide to the customerâs rights and obligations when utilizing HideIPVPNâs services.

HideIPVPN does not review, edit, censor, or take responsibility for any information its clients may create.
By placing information on the Internet, clients have the same liability as other authors for copyright infringement, defamation, and other harmful speech.
Also, because the information they place on HideIPVPNâs network may be carried to a large number of people, including both clients and non-clients of HideIPVPN, clientsâ postings to the Internet may affect other clients and may harm HideIPVPNâs goodwill, business reputation, and operations.

To avoid any misunderstandings of what is considered a prohibited activity, HideIPVPN offers a brief explanation of previously stated prohibited activities.

Spamming is the sending unsolicited bulk and/or commercial messages over the Internet.
It is not only harmful because of its negative impact on consumer attitudes toward HideIPVPN, but also because it can overload HideIPVPNâs network and disrupt service to HideIPVPN clients.
Also, maintaining an open SMTP relay is prohibited.

Intellectual Property Violations is the engaging in any activity that infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property rights of others, including copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets, software piracy, and patents held by individuals, corporations, or other entities.
Also, engaging in activity that violates privacy, publicity, or other personal rights of others. HideIPVPN is required by law to remove or block access to customer content upon receipt of a proper notice of copyright infringement laws.

Defamatory or Abusive Language refers to the use of HideIPVPNâs network as a means to transmit or post defamatory, harassing, abusive, or threatening language.

Forging of Headers refers to the forging or misrepresenting of message headers, whether in whole or in part, to mask the originator of the message.

Illegal or Unauthorized Access to Other Computers or Networks is accessing illegally or without authorization computers, accounts, or networks belonging to another party, or attempting to penetrate security measures of another individualâs system (often known as âhackingâ).
This violation also includes any activity that might be used as a precursor to an attempted system penetration (i.e.
port scan, stealth scan, or other information gathering activity).

Distribution of Internet Viruses, Worms, Trojan Horses, or Other Destructive Activities refers to the distributing of information regarding the creation of and sending of internet viruses, worms, Trojan horses, pinging, flooding, mailbombing, or denial of service attacks.
Also, it includes any activities that disrupt the use of or interfere with the ability of others to effectively use the network or any connected network, system, service, or equipment.

Facilitating a Violation of this TOS refers to advertising, transmitting, or otherwise making available any software, program, product, or service that is designed to violate this TOS, which includes the facilitation of the means to spam, initiation of pinging, flooding, mailbombing, denial of service attacks, and piracy of software.

Export Control Violations refers to exporting encryption software, over the Internet or otherwise, to points outside the United States.

Other Illegal Activities refers to engaging in activities that are determined to be illegal, including advertising, transmitting, or otherwise making available ponzi schemes, pyramid schemes.
Other examples are fraudulently charging credit cards and pirating software.

Other Activities refer to any activity, including lawful ones, that HideIPVPN determines to be harmful to its clients, operations, reputation, goodwill, or customer relations.
The responsibility for avoiding the harmful activities just described rests primarily with the client. HideIPVPN will not, in normal practice, monitor the communications of its clients to ensure that they comply with HideIPVPN policy or applicable law.
When HideIPVPN becomes aware of harmful activities, however, it may take any action to stop the harmful activity, including but not limited to, removing information, shutting down a web site, implementing screening software designed to block offending transmissions, denying access to the Internet, or other actions HideIPVPN deems appropriate.
