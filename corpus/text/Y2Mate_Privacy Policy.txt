Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Y2Mate collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.
Y2Mate's purpose in collecting non personally identifying information is to understand better how Y2Mate's visitors use its website.
From time to time, Y2Mate may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.


Log Files

Y2Mate.is follows a standard procedure of using log files.
These files log visitors when they visit websites.
All hosting companies do this and a part of hosting services' analytics.
The information collected by log files includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date and time stamp, referring/exit pages, and possibly the number of clicks.
These are not linked to any personally identifiable information.
The data aims to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movement on the website, and gather demographic information.


Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Individual visitors to Y2Mate's websites choose to interact with Y2Mate in ways that require Y2Mate to gather personally-identifying information.
The amount and type of information that Y2Mate gathers depend on the nature of the interaction.
For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at https://y2mate.is/ to provide a username and email address.


Security

The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no transmission method over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.
While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
