Categories of Information  The CitSci.org staff collects and maintains a master list of all CitSci.org members.
This list includes information about member names, emails, and 
optional

Additionally, CitSci.org collects data that are submitted by its members such as species occurrences, site characteristics of any sort, and other data as specified by project managers for volunteers to submit.

Use and Disclosure of Information  As a policy, the names, emails, and addresses of all CitSci.org participants
