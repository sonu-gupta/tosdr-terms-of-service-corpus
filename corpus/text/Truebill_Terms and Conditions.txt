If it is necessary for our agents to represent to your service provider that they are the account holder, you consent to such representation solely in order to perform the Bill Negotiation.
A Bill Negotiation request can be cancelled anytime before it is completed by contacting our Support team or disabling TrueProtect in the Truebill app.
If you'd like to attempt to negotiate your own bill, you must cancel your request prior to Truebill completing the requested negotiation or you will be held responsible for all associated fees.
We may charge a Negotiation fee (the "Negotiation Fee") for our services connected with our TrueProtect Bill Negotiation product.
The current amount of the Negotiation Fee is decided by the user anywhere from 30-60% of the 12-month savings achieved as a result of the negotiation.
For instance, if a 40% fee is chosen and Truebill is able to lower a bill by $10 per month, that would equal savings of $120 over 12 months and a Truebill fee of $48.
We may charge the Negotiation Fee to the credit or debit card provided and authorized at the time the negotiation is submitted.
The Negotiation Fee is non-refundable, except in the event that an error was made during the negotiation or except as otherwise required by applicable law.
In the event that you choose to cancel the service for which Truebill performed a negotiation, you must notify Truebill in writing no later than thirty (30) days after your provider services are cancelled in order to receive a pro-rata credit for the days remaining in the month in which your services are cancelled.
If you cancel your service before all savings for a given billing period appear on your bill(s), you must send documentation within thirty (30) days after such cancellation takes effect showing the last date of service, and Truebill will adjust your invoice on a pro-rata basis taking into account the date of service cancellation.
If you have paid in advance, we will issue you a credit to use toward future savings with Truebill.
Truebill's negotiated savings generally take one to two billing cycles to reflect on your statement, most likely your next billing statement.
By default, you consent to Truebill improving the quality of your service if it does not increase your cost of service.
You are responsible for fees resulting from any and all negotiations that are submitted through your Truebill account.
âTruebill Subscription CancellationBy requesting a Subscription Cancellation you are authorizing Truebill as an authorized representative to contact your service provider on your behalf in order to cancel your subscription/service with the specified provider.
Truebill will provide account verification details including, but not limited to, your full name, service address, account number, payment verification, or security code, in able to validate the account with the service provider in order to proceed with the cancellation.
âTruebill Pay AdvanceYou may use Truebill Pay Advance to request an advance up to $125 to be deposited by us in your Linked Account in advance of your next scheduled paycheck deposit from your employer (âDirect Depositâ).
There are no fees or other charges for Pay Advances.
To request a Pay Advance, visit the Pay Advance section in the App, select the amount of the advance you would like to receive, and choose the optional tip amount you would like to pay us for providing you with a Pay Advance.
The suggested tip amount is 12% of the Pay Advance amount.
however, tips are not required to receive a Pay Advance.
Whether you tip us, and the amount you choose to tip will not affect the amount of your Pay Advance or your eligibility to receive a Pay Advance now or in the future.
If we approve your request, we will deposit the Pay Advance in your Linked Account.
You may only request one Pay Advance per Direct Deposit pay period.
We reserve the right to deny you access to the Pay Advance service or to receive a Pay Advance for any reason in our sole discretion.
To be eligible for a Pay Advance, at the time of your request you must fulfill the following primary eligibility criteria:
- maintain an active Truebill Account
- maintain a Linked Account, or have a valid debit card
- be a Truebill Premium subscriber in good standing
- not be authorized by any other person with ownership rights to your Linked Account to request and repay your Pay Advance

Repayment.
You authorize us to debit your Linked Account or charge your debit card on the day of, or within [3] days after your next Direct Deposit in the full amount of the Pay Advance, plus the amount of any tip you choose to pay.
Our failure to debit your Linked Account or charge your debit card when repayment is due does not waive or extinguish our right initiate repayment at a later date.
If you do not have sufficient funds in your Linked Account when we initiate repayment, you will be responsible for any overdraft fees, insufficient funds fees, late fees, or any other charges you incur that result from Truebill debiting your Linked Account or charging your debit card in connection with a Pay Advance.
If we determine from your Account Information that your Linked Account is unlikely to contain sufficient funds to repay us, we may choose in our sole discretion to wait to initiate repayment until your next Direct Deposit date.
If we are unable to debit your Linked Account or charge your debit card for the full repayment amount, you will not be eligible for additional Pay Advances.
However, we will have no legal or contractual claim or other remedy against you if you do not repay a Pay Advance.
and we will not engage in any debt collection activities, report your failure to repay to any credit reporting agencies, or sell your obligation to repay us to a third-party debt collector.
If you are unable to repay us but would like to become eligible for Pay Advances again, please contact us via the âContact Supportâ link in the chat section of the App, or email us at support@truebill.com.
You will be required to pay us in full for the Pay Advance by authorizing us to debit your Linked Account or to charge your debit card.

âFree Credit ScoreTruebill provides all members with free access to their Experian VantageScore 3.0 credit score and provides premium members with access to their credit report (collectively âCredit Scoreâ).
In order to access your Credit Score you must provide Truebill the following credit pull authorization: I hereby authorize Truebill to periodically obtain and use consumer reports about me in order to provide me with: (1) access to my free credit score, including periodic updates to my credit score.
and (2) recommendations regarding financial products and services that may be of interest to me, including credit cards, personal loans, home loans and other financial products and services offered by Truebill partners.
If you find discrepancies with your credit score or information from your credit report, please contact Experian directly.
âAbout VantageScore 3.0VantageScore 3.0, with scores ranging from 300 to 850, is a user-friendly credit score model developed by the three major nationwide credit reporting agencies, ExperianÂ®, TransUnionÂ®, and EquifaxÂ®.
VantageScore 3.0 is used by some but not all lenders.
Higher scores represent a greater likelihood that you'll pay back your debts so you are viewed as being a lower credit risk to lenders.
A lower score indicates to lenders that you may be a higher credit risk.

There are three different major credit reporting agencies, Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax that maintain a record of your credit history known as your credit file.
Credit scores are based on the information in your credit file at the time it is requested.
Your credit file information can vary from agency to agency because some lenders report your credit history to only one or two of the agencies.
So your credit scores can vary if the information they have on file for you is different.
Since the information in your file can change over time, your credit scores also may be different from day-to-day.
Different credit scoring models can also give a different assessment of the credit risk (risk of default) for the same consumer and same credit file.
There are different credit scoring models which may be used by lenders and insurers.
Your lender may not use VantageScore 3.0, so don't be surprised if your lender gives you a score that's different from your VantageScore.
(And your VantageScore 3.0 may differ from your score under other types of VantageScores).
Just remember that your associated risk level is often the same even if the number is not.
For some consumers, however, the risk assessment of VantageScore 3.0 could vary, sometimes substantially, from a lenderâs score.
If the lender's score is lower than your VantageScore 3.0, it is possible that this difference can lead to higher interest rates and sometimes credit denial.
