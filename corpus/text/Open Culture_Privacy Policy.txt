Open Culture, LLC (âOpen Culture,â âweâ or âusâ) knows that you care how information about you is used and shared.&nbsp.
This Privacy Policy explains how Open Culture collects and uses information at its website located at www.openculture.com and at other websites and mobile services provided by Open Culture (collectively the âNetwork Websitesâ).&nbsp.
This Privacy Policy also explains how you can control the collection, correction and/or deletion of certain types of information that we collect.&nbsp.
We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by other means (including offline) or from other sources.&nbsp.
Further, this Privacy Policy does not apply to any websites, webpages, blogs, applications, widgets or other services operated by any third party, including our affiliates, advertisers, providers and partners.

1.
Information We Collect


A.
Personally Identifiable Information

In general, Open Culture does not collect personally identifiable information on the Open Culture Services, except as set forth below.&nbsp.
For purposes of this Privacy Policy, âpersonally identifiable informationâ is data intended to be used to identify, contact or locate a person, including, name, address, telephone number or e-mail address and any other information (even if non-personally identifiable) provided in combination with such personally identifiable information.
You may provide us information about yourself, such as your name or e-mail address, when you use or post content on or though the Open Culture Services, including registering for the use of certain features such as email RSS feeds.&nbsp.
If you correspond with us by email, we may retain the content of your email messages, your email address, and our responses.&nbsp.
We may also retain any messages or other content you send through or post on the Open Culture Services.
The advertisements we deliver may offer the ability to interact, including playing a game or viewing a video.&nbsp.
The ad may also give you the opportunity to provide the advertiser with information about yourself.&nbsp.
In some instances, if you choose to interact with an advertisement or provide an advertiser with information about yourself, Open Culture may collect information on behalf of the advertiser.&nbsp.
In that case, the advertiserâs privacy policy would apply to the data collected and we will abide by the instructions given to us by the advertiser in our handling of the data.&nbsp.
Open Culture will not associate any information (non-personally identifiable or personally identifiable) we collect for an advertiser with any other information we may have collected about you through the Open Culture Services.

B.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information 

When you visit the Open Culture Services, Open Culture or third parties such as advertisers, third-party advertising networks, and third-party advertising serving companies may collect non-personally identifiable information.&nbsp.
For purposes of this Privacy Policy, ânon-personally identifiable informationâ is data that is not personally identifiable.
Open Culture and these third parties may implement certain technologies to enable the collection of such information.&nbsp.
An explanation of these technologies is below.


Cookies Information: When you visit the Open Culture Services, we may send one or more cookiesâa small text file containing a string of alphanumeric charactersâto your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets Open Culture help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site.&nbsp.
A cookie may also convey information about how you browse the Open Culture Services.&nbsp.
Open Culture uses session, persistent, flash and browser cookies.&nbsp.
The use of cookies on the Open Culture Services is anonymous and does not allow us to gather personally identifiable information about you.&nbsp.
A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser.&nbsp.
Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site.&nbsp.
Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browserâs directions.&nbsp.
A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser.&nbsp.
You can set your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.&nbsp.
However, some features of the Open Culture Services may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.


Device Identifiers

: When you access the Open Culture Services by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more âdevice identifiers.â&nbsp.
Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device that uniquely identify your mobile device and are used by Open Culture to enhance your use of the Open Culture Services.&nbsp.
A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the deviceâs operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Open Culture.&nbsp.
A device identifier may convey information to us about how you browse the Open Culture Services.&nbsp.
A device identifier does not collect or share any personally identifiable information about you.&nbsp.
However, a device identifier may be used in conjunction with other information in a manner that may constitute personally identifiable information.&nbsp.
A device identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Open Culture Services.&nbsp.
Some features of the Open Culture Services may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers are impaired or disabled.


Web Beacons/Click-Stream Data

: A web beacon is an electronic file that signals when a webpage, advertisement, video, other content, an email, or a newsletter has been viewed.&nbsp.
We may use web beacons in our emails and newsletters, or on our websites and services.&nbsp.
Open Culture may use web beacons in conjunction with cookies to collect click-stream data that helps us better understand how visitors move from page to page within our websites.&nbsp.
As with cookies, our use of web beacons is anonymous and does not allow us to gather personally identifiable information about you.


Passive Browser Information

: Open Culture collects passive browser information though its web servers.&nbsp.
We use the passive browser information to help us understand how many visitors come to our websites and where they come from, and ultimately to help us make decisions about how to organize the websites and deliver advertising.


Log File Information: Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page.&nbsp.
When you use the Open Culture Services, our servers automatically record certain log file information.&nbsp.
These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (âIPâ) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, data about how you interact with links on the Open Culture Services, and other such information.&nbsp.
We may display your IP address to the owners or maintainers of certain blogs, groups or communities if you post to those blogs, groups or communities and the owner or maintainer has enabled functionality for this purpose.


Scripts
:&nbsp.
A script is a short segment of computer code included in a web page or other content that can be used to set and access a cookie on your computerâs hard drive and to record your activity on a website.&nbsp.
Open Culture may use scripts on the Open Culture Services, on third-party websites, or in our emails and newsletters.

C.
Third Party Advertisements


If an advertiser asks Open Culture to show an advertisement to a certain audience and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.&nbsp.
In addition, third-party advertisers may use non-personally identifiable information about your visits to the Open Culture Services in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that they believe may be of interest to you.&nbsp.
If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please see the list provided immediately below.&nbsp.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party advertisers.&nbsp.
Please consult the respective privacy policies of such advertisers for more information.

You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through the Service, in which case Open Culture may not be able to provide certain services to you.
You can limit targeted advertising by configuring your browserâs settings or changing the management panel of the Adobe Flash Player to limit your acceptance of or delete cookies.&nbsp.
