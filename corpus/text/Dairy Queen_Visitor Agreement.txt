Arbitration does not use a judge or a jury.
Arbitration is final and binding and subject to only very limited review by a court.
Please review this section carefully.

This provision encompasses disputes or claims arising out of or relating to this Visitor Agreement, your use of the Websites, and your relationship with us, including any of our subsidiary, parent or affiliate companies.
Disputes will be resolved by binding arbitration, except that either you or us may take claims to small claims court if they qualify for hearing by such a court.

Judgment on any award may be entered in any court having proper jurisdiction.


Jury and Class Action Waivers.

 You and we agree that any proceeding, whether in court or in arbitration, will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action.

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.
This provision encompasses disputes or claims arising out of or relating to this Visitor Agreement, your use of the Websites, and your relationship with us, including any of our subsidiary, parent or affiliate companies.
Disputes will be resolved by arbitration using the Canadian Arbitration Association Expedited Arbitration Rules, or in small claims court.
The arbitration shall be held in Toronto and shall proceed in accordance with the provisions of the Canadian Arbitration Association.
Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
In any such presiding, the losing party will pay the legal expenses of the prevailing party.
You are thereby giving up your right to go to court, except that:

a.
You or we may take claims to small claims court if they qualify for a hearing by such a court.
