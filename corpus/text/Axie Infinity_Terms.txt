Axie Infinity is a distributed application that is currently running on the Ethereum Network, Loom Network and Ronin Network (the "Blockchains"), using specially-developed smart contracts (each, a âSmart Contractâ) to enable users to own, transfer, battle, and breed genetically unique digital creatures.

These assets can then be visualized on a website that the user can interact with the Site.
The Smart Contracts and the Site are collectively referred to in these Terms as the âAppâ.
Using the App, users can view their assets and use the Smart Contracts to acquire, trade, battle, and breed creatures with other App users.

Ethereum requires the payment of a transaction fee (a âGas Feeâ) for every transaction that occurs on the Ethereum network.
The Gas Fee funds the network of computers that run the decentralized Ethereum network.
This means that you will need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction that occurs via the App.

Any transfer of Axies occurs only on the Ronin network.

A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of the Axie ecosystem, and therefore the potential utility or value of Axies.

Upgrades by Sky Mavis to the Ronin Network may have unintended, adverse effects on all Axie Infinity assets.15.
