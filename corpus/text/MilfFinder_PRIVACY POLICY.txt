 Visiting our Website As soon as you visit our website, the company we have entrusted with the websiteâs operation will store the public IP address of the computer you are using to visit our website.
This includes the access date and time.
The IP address is a unique numeric address, through which your computer sends and receives data via the internet.
Usually, neither we nor our service provider will know whom the IP address belongs to, unless you provide us with any data permitting us to identify you while using our website.
Also, a user can be identified if we take legal action (in cases of cyber-attacks on our website, for instance) and are informed of the userâs identity during the process of investigation.
So as a general rule, you will not have to worry we will be able to draw a connection between you and your IP address.
Our service provider is using the IP address to enable you to visit and use our website, and to discover and prevent attacks on our websites.
Unfortunately, websites are attacked frequently, in order to harm the operators and users (for example blocking the access, spying on data, distributing malware like viruses or other illegal purposes).
Such attacks would adversely affect our websiteâs intended use as well as the security of our websiteâs visitors.
The IP address, along with the visitâs time, is being processed to prevent such attacks and potential dangers resulting from them for ourselves and for our websiteâs users.
Via our service provider we are pursuing the justified interests of maintaining our business operations as well as of preventing unlawful interference affecting ourselves or our websiteâs visitors.

In this case we will delete the data as soon as the reason ceases to exist.
The legal basis of this processing activity is article 6 (1) f) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in connection with Â§ 26 BDSG.
You can object to further processing of your data at any time by withdrawing your application.
