Claims under US Copyright Law


The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (âDMCAâ) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S.
copyright law.
If you believe, in good faith, that materials hosted on the Site infringe your copyright, please provide APMC at the address above with a notice of infringement (âNoticeâ) containing the following information:

an electronic or physical signature of the owner of the copyright or of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest;
a description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed including the URL (i.e.
Internet address) or other specific location on the Site where the material that you claim is infringing is located, including enough information to allow us to locate the material and to determine why you believe an infringement has taken place;
a description of the location where the original or an authorized copy of the copyrighted work exists, for example the URL where it is posted;
your address, telephone number, and e-mail address;
a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
and
a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the information in your Notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright ownerâs behalf.

If you believe that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send APMC a counter-notice.
Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed under the DMCA.
We suggest that you consult a legal advisor before filing a Notice or counter-notice.
Also be aware that there can be penalties for false claims under the DMCA.
APMC may suspend or terminate membership privileges, Accounts and access to the Site and Services for those who engage in repeated acts of infringement.


Claims under Canadian Copyright Law


Effective January 2, 2015, new rules under the amended Canadian Copyright Act also give copyright owners the right to send notifications to digital network providers, including organizations such as APMC, alleging that a customer has infringed their Canadian copyright.
This system is known as âNotice-and-Noticeâ.
Notices sent under it must contain certain information:

the infringement alleged;
to which material the allegation relates;
the claimantâs right in the material, and name and address.
and
the electronic address, date, and time of the alleged activity.

Such a notice should be sent to APMC at the address above.
Under Notice-and-Notice, digital network providers, including organizations such as APMC receiving a notice of claimed infringement are required to do two things.
We must forward the notice of claimed infringement to the customer/Subscriber whose account corresponds to the electronic location and time identified in the notice.
Secondly, we must preserve, for six months, the records allowing the identity of the person to whom the electronic location belongs to be determined.
If a court orders us to, we may be required to preserve those records for longer.
Rightsholders are entitled to take legal action to enforce their rights under the Canadian Copyright Act.


Claims under other Copyright Law


Other laws in other countries may provide different remedies for cases of alleged copyright infringement.&nbsp.
APMC abides, and requires its customers, to abide by all applicable laws.
APMC therefore encourages everyone to become familiar with their rights and obligations under the law.
These include both copyright obligations, and privacy rights.
Copyright owners who believe that copyrights other than in Canada on the United States may be infringed may send notifications to APMC, alleging that a customer has infringed their copyright and should specify:

the infringement alleged;
to which material the allegation relates;
the claimantâs right in the material, and name and address.
and
the electronic address, date, and time of the alleged activity.

Any other relevant information should also be included in the notice. Such a notice should be sent to APMC at the address above.


Disclosure of Customer Information


APMC may be asked, under the applicable law, to provide customer information when there is evidence of potential copyright infringement, and the copyright owner decides to take action.
APMC will only disclose customer information in these circumstances if required to do so by a court order or other legal or regulatory process.
