If you record any meetings, these are stored until deleted.
Please remember to remove them when they're no longer needed to free up storage for other users.

If meetings are recorded, the chat log is stored with the meeting to make it viewable in the recording.

Unlisted recordings are only viewable by the room owner (with one exception).
If made public, they will be listed on that room's page.

Administrators (currently only Amolith) can join any in-progress meeting and view any recording regardless of whether or not it's publicly accessible.
However, I will refrain from doing so.
I'm busy enough as it is and simply don't have the time much less interest.

Note: temporary email accounts, fake names, made up usernames, etc.
all work just as well as legitimate ones.
If you don't want to provide any personal information, don't :) Retrieved from âhttps://docs.nixnet.services/index.php?title=BigBlueButton/Privacy&oldid=1716â
