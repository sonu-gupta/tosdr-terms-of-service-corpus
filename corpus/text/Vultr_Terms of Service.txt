Pursuant to 47 U.S.C.
Â§230(d), you are hereby informed that you can research such services at websites, such as www.asacp.org.
Please note that this Site makes no representation or warranty regarding any of the products or services referenced on such sites, and recommend that the user conduct appropriate due diligence before purchasing or installing any online filter.
You agree to take particular steps to prevent minors from viewing this site if Your computer can be accessed by a minor.

Â§ 230(c)(1), and court decisions interpreting the scope of the CDA, You acknowledge and understand that Vultr operates as the provider of an interactive computer service.
Thus, We are immune from, and cannot be held responsible for, claims arising from the publication of Your content (including third-party content published on Your website(s)).
We do not create such content, and We are not responsible for the publication of remarks or communications of You or third-parties that may arguably rise to the level of being actionable under federal or state laws including, but not limited to, the publication of material that might be considered defamatory, or violative of privacy or publicity rights.
Note, that federal law allows Vultr to remove any content found to be offensive, defamatory, obscene or otherwise violative of Our policies, without impacting Our immunity status as an interactive computer service.
Nothing contained in this paragraph is intended to limit or alter the immunity from claims provided by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.
In the event that any court finds that any third party communication or third party content hosted by us falls outside of the realm of the immunity provided by the CDA, this shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any legal protections provided by Section 230 for any and all other content posted on our Website or hosted via our Services.
