In certain cases we may post content about the products or services of companies that are sponsoring XDA.
When relevant we will provide full disclosure of this fact within the content.
An article that is written by our sponsorship team on behalf of a sponsor will be published under the byline of Team XDA, A Word from Our Sponsors, or XDA Commerce Team.
These articles will also contain relevant disclosure of the sponsorship.
Sponsored social media posts will contain the #ad or #sponsored designations.
For sponsored videos, relevant disclosure will be in the videoâs description.

External Links

These commissions help compensate our writers and other staff.
Our goal is to post links only to interesting and useful products and deals.
