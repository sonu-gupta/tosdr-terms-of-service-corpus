WHEN CUSTOMER SIGNS UP FOR AND/OR CUSTOMERS ACCESS OR USES THE SERVICES SUCH HEREBY CONSTITUTES CUSTOMERâS ACCEPTANCE OF THE AGREEMENTS.


Modification to the Agreements, Policies and/or the Services.
Company may, in its sole and absolute discretion, at any time, change or modify these Universal Terms, any other policies or any other product or service terms and conditions related to the Services posted on Companyâs website (collectively âwww.inmotinhosting.comâ), Companyâs Acceptable Use Policy (âAUPâ) and Companyâs Privacy Policy, all of which are hereby incorporated herein by this reference, and such changes or modifications shall be effective immediately upon posting to Companyâs website located at inmotionhosting.com/legal (âCompanyâs Siteâ).
These Universal Terms, the Policies, Acceptable Use Policy and Privacy Policy shall collectively be referred to as the âAgreements.â Unless otherwise stated in a Policy, in the event of a conflict between the provisions of these Universal Terms and the terms in the Policies, Acceptable Use Policy or Privacy Policy, the provisions of these Universal Terms shall control.

Company may give written notice to Customer via electronic mail to the Customerâs electronic mail address as maintained in the Account.
Waiver.

No express waiver or assent by any party hereto to any breach of or default in any term or condition of the Agreements shall constitute a waiver of or an assent to any succeeding breach of or default in the same or any other term or condition hereof.

Force Majeure.
Neither party is liable for any default or delay in the performance of any of its obligations under the Agreements (other than failure to make payments when due) if such default or delay is caused, directly or indirectly, by forces beyond such partyâs reasonable control, including, without limitation, fire, flood, acts of God, labor disputes, accidents, acts of war or terrorism, epidemics, pandemics, government order, interruptions of transportation or communications, supply shortages or the failure of any third party to perform any commitment relative to the production or delivery of any equipment or material required for such party to perform its obligations hereunder.
No Third-Party Beneficiaries.
Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Agreements, nothing is intended, nor shall anything herein be construed to confer any rights, legal or equitable, in any person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer acknowledges and agrees that Company, and any supplier of third-party supplier that is identified as a third-party beneficiary, is an intended third-party beneficiary of the provisions set forth in the Agreements as they relate specifically to its products or services and shall have the right to enforce directly the terms and conditions of the Agreements with respect to its products or services against Customer as if it were a party to the Agreements.
