To recognize speech your audio may be sent to a third party provider such as Google, Apple, or Amazon Web Services.
We may ask you to allow Duolingo to collect and analyze your speech data to help us understand the effectiveness of our lessons, and to improve the product.
If you choose not to share your audio with us, or if we havenât asked you yet, then your audio will not be used in this way.

We will provide personal data to hosting providers such as Amazon Web Services, search engine providers such as Google, analytics providers such as Crashlytics, and support providers such as ZenDesk.
These data processors help us bring you the Service.
For example, we may share your information in order to detect where or how you encountered a bug when using our mobile application.
In connection with these operations, our service providers will have access to personal data for a limited time.
When we utilize service providers for processing any personal data, we implement contractual protections limiting the use of that personal data to the provision of services to Duolingo.
We will be required to access and disclose personal data in response to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws.
Additionally, we will access and share account or other personal data when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the Service or using the Duolingo name, or to prevent imminent harm.
This will include accessing and sharing personal data with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies.
Duolingo will share the complete and accurate results of Duolingo English Tests with such institutions, including universities, potential employers, or other third parties, (collectively, âScore Recipientsâ) as specified when you send your results after finishing a test or when you apply a coupon sponsored by the Score Recipient before starting a test.

Children under age of digital consentWe know that children deserve extra privacy protection.
Thatâs why we treat child users differently to ensure their parents are in control and we only collect the bare minimum information we need to make Duolingo work.
When a user creates a Duolingo account we collect their age and compare it to the local standard of child online consent depending on the country they registered in.
We refer to users under this age as âchild usersâ.
Child users are permitted to create a user account but we ask them to provide their parentâs email address instead of their own.
We also prevent child users from supplying their own name because we donât need that information.
After registration we will send an email notifying the parent about Duolingoâs privacy and information practices regarding child users, including what personal data we collect and how we use, share, and protect that personal data.
The email also explains how parents can request that Duolingo access, change or delete the personal data about their child.
Child users receive the following special treatment:

Lessons are made age appropriate by removing mature words like âbeerâ or âwineâ.
Advertisements are set to family safe content.
The Profile page is hidden, preventing the child from stating their name, location or bio.
Uploading an avatar photo is disabled.
Promotional emails are disabled.
Leaderboards are disabled.
Discussion forums are disabled.
The childâs profile is made private and hidden from other usersâ searches.
Other users are unable to follow the child.
The ability to follow other users or search for other users is disabled.
The ability to send an invitation email is disabled.
Finding friends on Facebook is disabled.
Social logins with Facebook, Google or Apple are disabled.
Social follow buttons for Twitter, Facebook and Instagram are disabled.

In addition, all users under the age of 16 receive the following special treatment:

Advertisements are set to non-personalised.
Third party behavioral tracking is disabled.
Third party analytics is disabled.

To prevent restricted users from amending these features, the settings will be hidden or grayed out.
In the future, once weâre sure the user is old enough we will automatically remove the restrictions, reset the settings to their defaults and make the settings visible for them to configure how they choose.
With regards to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule ("COPPA"), Duolingo only collects personal information from children under the age of 13 for the sole purpose of performing internal operations of the Service.
If we discover that we have unknowingly collected additional personal information from these children we will delete it.
If you believe this to be the case, please contact us at privacy@duolingo.com.

LinksThe Service may contain links to other websites.
We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites.
We encourage users to be aware when they leave the Service to read the privacy statements of other websites that collect personally identifiable information.
This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by Duolingo via the Service.

Information securityDuolingo has implemented administrative and technical safeguards it believes are appropriate to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of your personal data, Testing ID, User Photo, access credentials, and Duolingo English Test results.
However, given sufficient resources, a determined attacker could defeat those safeguards and may, as a result, gain access to the data we seek to protect.

Do Not TrackThe Service is not designed to respond to âdo not trackâ signals sent by some browsers.
