Information about your device and its software includes your IP address, browser type, internet service provider, device type/model/manufacturer, operating system, date and time stamp, and a unique ID that allows us to identify your browser, mobile device, or your Account (including, for example, a persistent device identifier or an Ad ID), and other similar information.
We may also work with third-party partners to employ technologies, including statistical modeling tools, that permit us to recognize and contact you across multiple devices.
We use this device and software information to diagnose and fix technology problems, serve you personalized advertising, personalize your experience, perform analytics/identify usage trends, and improve our products and Services.

In addition, we track the pages you visit on the Platform, the links you click on the Platform, whether you open emails or click the links contained in emails that we send, other actions you take on the Services, and whether you access the Services from multiple devices.
We may also use the information about the way you access and use our Services to determine products and services that may be of interest to you, to improve our products and Services, to evaluate the success of our advertising and marketing campaigns, and to send you marketing communications.

Analytics information. We may collect analytics data or use third-party analytics tools such as Google Analytics to help us measure traffic and usage trends and the demographics of our users in order to improve our Services.
You can learn more about Google's practices at http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners.

Location Information. In some cases, you provide your location information to us directly (e.g.
when you provide us with a delivery address).
In other cases, we may collect your location through GPS, WiFi, wireless network triangulation or other methods, or we may otherwise infer your location based on other information we collect.
(For example, we can approximate your location by your IP Address.) We use location information to customize content on our Services (e.g., show you the Restaurants that will deliver to your location and show you relevant Perks), facilitate order and delivery Services, detect and prevent fraud, and measure traffic and analytics on the Services.
If you have previously opted into Grubhubâs collection and use of location-based information through our mobile application, we may collect and store the precise location of your device when the app is running in the foreground or background of your device.
You may opt-out by adjusting the settings on your mobile device.
We also use the Google Maps API to gather information about your location.
Google uses various technologies to determine your location, including IP address, GPS and other sensors that may, for example, provide Google with information on nearby devices, WiFi access points and cell towers (see the Google privacy policy and the Google Maps terms of service to learn more).
We typically collect the foregoing generated and/or automatically collected information through a variety of tracking technologies, including cookies, Flash objects, web beacons, embedded scripts, mobile SDKs, location-identifying technologies, and similar technology (collectively, âtracking technologiesâ), and we may use third-party partners or services to assist with this effort.
Information we collect automatically about you or your device may be combined with other personal information we collect directly.
For information about our and our third-party partnersâ use of cookies and related technologies to collect information automatically, and choices you may have in relation to its collection, please see our "About Our Ads" policy.
We, or the third-party partners we use, may use the data collected automatically through tracking technologies to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Platform.
(b) provide custom, personalized content and information.
