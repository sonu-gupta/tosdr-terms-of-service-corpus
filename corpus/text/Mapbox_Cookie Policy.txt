âCookiesâ are small pieces of text information that a website sends you to store on your computer for future use.
A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain the cookie comes from, the âlifetimeâ of the cookie, and a randomly generated unique number or other value.
You can delete them from your computer at any time, or change your browser settings to not allow them.
But cookies do allow Mapbox to remember important information that enable your use of Mapbox, such as whether you are logged in or not.
Mapbox CookiesWe use two types of cookies, session cookies and persistent cookies.
Session cookies have a temporary "life" and are set to only remain in the cookie file of your browser until you leave the website.
We use these on an anonymous aggregate basis to analyze the total number of visitors to our website and which pages the visited.
Persistent cookies remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer (though how long will depend on the lifetime of the specific cookie).
 We use them so that we remember your computer when it is used to return to help customize your website experience, for example so you do not have to log in again.
Third Party CookiesTo calculate the effectiveness of Mapbox's online advertising, Mapbox uses persistent cookies provided by AdRoll, Bing, Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook and Google Ads.
When a visitor clicks on an ad on one of these platforms and lands on Mapbox.com, the cookie tells us that ad brought you to Mapbox.

Mapbox also uses several third party providers to improve the marketing abilities of the website.
These third parties include Drift, MadKudu, Clearbit, Marketo, and Customer.io.
The marketing cookies help facilitate timely communications with visitors of Mapbox.com,  such as to send you automated suggestions through your browser.
These cookies may be accessible to other companies that your browser interacts with, and Mapbox does not have insight or control into how those companies may use that information.
You can learn more or opt out from those companies' uses from their respective privacy policies.

You can delete these cookies at any time from your browser settings and also change your browser settings to opt out of cookies.
However, if you opt out of Mapbox cookies (also called "First party cookies), not all parts of the Mapbox website will work properly.
For example, you would not be able to log into your Mapbox account.
