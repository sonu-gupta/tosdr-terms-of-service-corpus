Personal information is any data with which you could be personally identified.

 Data collection when using the VPN connection Perfect Privacy's technical infrastructure has been designed and built with the requirement to collect only the absolute minimum of data necessary to operate the servers.
Specifically, we do not record or log any user traffic so potential sharing such data with third parties is technically impossible.
We do not store IP addresses, access times or duration, nor bandwidth caused by individual users.
For the operation of the servers, displaying general server information on the website and for the detection and elimination of potential technical problems, we record the total load of the individual servers.

For billing purposes and customer support, we store the following account-specific data:

Login credentials

Email address (anonymous email providers are allowed)

We do not store payment information such as credit card details.
These are processed exclusively by the payment service providers (see point 7, "Payment service providers").
