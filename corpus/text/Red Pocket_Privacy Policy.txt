and/or âRed Pocketâ) , including its parents, subsidiaries, and/or affiliates, ("Company"),will collect, access, use or disclose your Personal Information.
It applies to all of our products and services, including our customer portal (collectively, âServicesâ).
It does not apply to third-party or affiliated services, which are governed by separate privacy policies.

What is Customer Proprietary Information?
Customer Proprietary Information (Customer PI or Personal Information) includes Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI), and the content of your communications.
PII is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context.
Personal Information does not include information that is not used to identify you, such as aggregate or anonymous information.
Federal and state law require Company to protect the confidentiality of Personal Information.
CPNI is information related to a subscriberâs use of Companyâs network (e.g., broadband traffic statistics, device identifiers, call detail information) and information contained within Company subscribersâ voice-service bills.
CPNI does not include directory information such as name, postal address, or telephone number.
As Company provides our Services to you, Company obtains information about the quantity, technical configuration, type, location and destination of telecommunications services we provide to you, as well as some other information found on your Company bills.
This information may constitute CPNI, as defined by federal law.
Any CPNI that Company collects from you will be handled in accordance with federal law, the Companyâs internal CPNI Policy and this Privacy Policy.
Under federal law, you have the right, and Company has the duty, to protect the confidentiality of your CPNI.
What information do we collect and how do we collect it?

We may use software to follow your use of our Services and other applications, including the use of cookies, web beacons, and other mechanisms, in addition to analysis of network and device information.

Your use of third party applications and services. When using our Services, you may choose to use services and products offered by third parties, such as third party applications.
When you leave our network, you may also use mobile roaming services provided by third parties.
Your use of such services and applications may result in these third parties collecting your Personal Information and obtaining information from Company, including location information (when applicable).
You may also choose to give your Personal Information directly to third parties when using our wireless services or devices.
The Personal Information you give to a third party will be subject to that third partyâs terms, conditions and policiesânot this Privacy Policy.
You should always review a third partyâs privacy policy and terms of service before providing your Personal Information to them or using their services or products.

Pre Installed third party applications Company has partnered with selected third-party application developers to enhance your Red Pocket experience, and their applications may be found on your device that you use with our service.
These applications may or may not be branded as Company applications and may be preinstalled on your device when you obtain it from Company or installed on your device via over-the-air download at no cost to you.
These applications may require Company to share certain Personal Information with the third-party application for them to function.
When you use these applications, they may also share certain Personal Information with Company, which Company may use to provide you with enhanced Services, to market our offerings to you, or for any other purposes consistent with this policy.

If you would like to restrict the disclosure of your Personal Information for the marketing of certain products or services, you may contact us at the address above.
How can you opt-out, remove or modify information you have provided to us?

How will you let me know if this policy changes?

We may modify the terms of this policy from time to time, and will notify of any material changes in the manner required by law.
We may also seek your consent to have any changes to our privacy policy apply retroactively to information we collected from you prior to the change in policy.
Please check this page regularly for updates.
What if I visit or use a third-party website, application, or service?
In an attempt to provide you with increased value, we may include third party links in our Services.
These linked sites have separate and independent privacy policies.
We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites.
Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these linked sites (including if a specific link does not work).
What policies apply to children under the age of 13?
If we make available offers and products online where a child informs us that he or she is under the age of 13, we will ask a parent to confirm his/her consent in advance of further collection, use or disclosure of personal information from that child.
You should be aware, however, that wireless devices and services purchased for family use may be used by minors without the knowledge of Company.
If that happens, any information collected from the usage will appear to be the personal information of the actual adult subscriber and treated as such under this Policy.
What special rights apply to California consumers?
