EU General Data Protection Regulation (âGDPRâ)
 comes into force across the European Union on 25th May 2018 and brings with it the most significant changes to data protection law in two decades.
Based on privacy by design and taking a risk-based approach, the GDPR has been designed to meet the requirements of the digital age.
The 21st Century brings with it broader use of technology, new definitions of what constitutes personal data, and a vast increase in cross-border processing.
The new Regulation aims to standardise data protection laws and processing across the EU.
affording individuals stronger, more consistent rights to access and control their personal information.Our Commitment
JavaPipe is committed to ensuring the security and protection of the personal information that we process, and to provide a compliant and consistent approach to data protection.
We have always had a robust and effective data protection program in place which complies with existing law and abides by the data protection principles.
However, we recognise our obligations in updating and expanding this program to meet the demands of GDPR.

JavaPipe is dedicated to safeguarding the personal information under our remit and in developing a data protection regime that is effective, fit for purpose and demonstrates an understanding of, and appreciation for the new Regulation.
Our preparation and objectives for GDPR compliance have been summarised in this statement and include the development and implementation of new data protection roles, policies, procedures, controls and measures to ensure maximum and ongoing compliance.How We are Preparing for the GDPR

Information Audit â carrying out a company-wide information audit to identify and assess what personal information we hold, where it comes from, how and why it is processed and if and to whom it is disclosed.

Policies &amp.

Legal Basis for Processing â we are reviewing all processing activities to identify the legal basis for processing and ensuring that each basis is appropriate for the activity it relates to.
Where applicable, we also maintain records of our processing activities, ensuring that our obligations under Article 30 of the GDPR and Schedule 1 of the Data Protection Bill are met.
