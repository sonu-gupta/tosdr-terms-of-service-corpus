These Terms
JustPark Parking Limited (trading as JustPark) ("us", "we" or "JustPark") provides a website and associated services connecting our JustPark registered owners who have a parking space, charging point or storage spaces for vehicles and bicycles (âOwnersâ) with those seeking to book such parking space, charging point or storage spaces (âServicesâ).
These terms and conditions apply to all Services provided or arranged by JustPark to or for you, the recipient of the Services ("Driver" or "you").
These terms and conditions will apply at any time when you use this website ("Website") or any other method of accessing the Services (including via the JustPark application, automated phone system or payment kiosk).
By continuing to use the Website or the Services you accept these terms and conditions and they will apply to the agreement between you and us (the "Agreement").
This Agreement governs the relationship between us and you.
When you use the Services we are providing you with the means to enter into individual, direct contracts with Owners to park in the Ownerâs parking space or use the Ownerâs charging point or storage spaces (âParking Spacesâ).
When making bookings for Parking Spaces using the Services (âBookingsâ) and using the Parking Spaces you are entering into individual, direct contracts with the Owners.
You will be bound by your obligations under this Agreement and any additional obligations included in a listing relating to a Parking Space.
Unless we are the Owner of a Parking Space (either by virtue of owning the land of a Parking Space or by leasing or licensing the land of a Parking Space or by any other agreement relating to the land of a Parking Space under which we act as Owner of the Parking Space for the purposes of the Agreement), we are not a party to the agreement between you and the Owner and we will not be liable to you, the Owner or any third party for any breach of obligations in relation to the Parking Space whether set out in this Agreement, in any listings relating to a Parking Space or otherwise.
We simply facilitate the payment for your use of the Parking Space, provided by Owners.
Where we do either own, lease or license a Parking Space, we will be liable to you as Owner of that Parking Space in accordance with the JustPark Owner Agreement.
These terms and conditions may be amended from time to time as we continually develop the services we provide.
We may amend this Agreement by posting the amended terms and conditions on our website www.justpark.com/driver-agreement/.
These amended terms and conditions would take effect 7 days following being posted.
Should you no longer wish to use the Services you can simply stop using the Services.
You can also log out from your account with us (âAccountâ) and can contact us by emailing help@justpark.com. and request that we deactivate your Account.
Any amendments or new terms and conditions will be available on our Website.
The terms and conditions on the Website at the time you enter into a Booking for a Parking Space or use any other Services will be the ones that apply.
You may terminate this Agreement if you do not wish to be bound by any such amendments but by continuing to use our Website or Services you will be deemed to have accepted the new terms.
This Agreement is with you, the person using the Services.
You will comply with the terms of this Agreement and any additional restrictions in relation to the Parking Space.
If you allow another person to make use of a Booking you have made (and park in a Parking Space) you agree you will remain responsible for the Booking and the use of that Parking Space.


Registration
In order to make a Booking you must register an Account as set out here www.justpark.com/registration.

Once you have created an Account you will need to provide us with the registration number of the vehicle you are making the Booking for and any other relevant additional information we may need from you.
Booking confirmations and other relevant information in relation to the Services will be sent to the email address you give us (should you provide us with an email address), or at the time you make the Booking in the format you made the Booking (e.g.
if you make a booking at a kiosk, through the kiosk or if you make a booking using our automated phone system, over the phone) (âBooking Confirmationâ).
Please make sure this is right as we will not be responsible if this email address is incorrect and you do not receive a Booking Confirmation or other information from us that you might be expecting.
If you notice that your email address is incorrect please contact us to correct this.


Appointment as Agent for Bookings
You appoint us as your agent for the purposes of forming binding agreements between you and the Owner in relation to Bookings.
The Owner grants you a licence to use the Parking Space to which a Booking relates for the period of that Booking (âBooking Periodâ) and you also appoint us to collect your charges in relation to the Booking on behalf of the Owner.
At the time we confirm the Booking and receive payment from you (see clause 4 below), a binding agreement will be formed between you and the Owner.
The agreement between you and the Owner will include the relevant terms and conditions of these terms and conditions and will also include any additional restrictions relating to a Parking Space, included in a listing for that Parking Space.


Enquiries, Bookings and Payment
General
If you wish to use a Parking Space advertised on the Website you will be able to do so through one of two methods: Instant Bookings and Approved Bookings.
The listing for a Parking Space will indicate which method is to be used in relation to that Parking Space.


Instant Bookings
If a Parking Space can be booked through Instant Bookings you will be able to see its availability against its listing.
If the dates you require are available you may select the required dates and times.
Once you have selected the required dates and times we will request payment from you.
We will also ask you to confirm that you accept the terms of this Agreement and any additional terms for the Parking Space that are set out in the listing.
Once we have received payment and you have accepted the terms of this Agreement, your Booking will be confirmed and you will have entered a binding agreement with the Owner for the use of their Parking Space.
We will provide you with a Booking Confirmation which (if provided via email) will include a contact telephone number for the Owner together with detailed instructions relating to the Booking including the Booking Period.


Approved Bookings
If the space is not booked through Instant Booking you may make an enquiry as to the Parking Space's availability ("Enquiry").
You may make an Enquiry by selecting your desired dates on the listing page for the Parking Space.
By making an Enquiry you are not making a Booking.
you are under no obligation to complete a Booking for that Parking Space and the Owner is not under any obligation to provide the Parking Space to you.
We will pass your Enquiry on to the Owner of the Parking Space and will email you once the Owner has responded to confirm whether or not the Parking Space is available for the requested dates or period.
If the Parking Space is available we will email confirmation of the details of your Enquiry, and the Booking Period.
You will be invited to log on to the Website to confirm your booking and make payment.
You will also be required to accept the terms of this Agreement and any additional terms for the Parking Space that are set out in the listing in order to make the Booking.
Once we have received payment and you have accepted the terms of this Agreement your Booking will be confirmed and you will have entered a binding agreement with the Owner for the use of their Parking Space.
As with Instant Bookings, we will send you a Booking Confirmation email which will include a contact telephone number for the Owner together with detailed instructions relating to the booking including the Booking Period.


Payment On Booking
For short and medium-term use (any Booking Period of 6 weeks or less) when we request payment from you we will request the full amount due in respect of your Booking at the time of booking.
For long-term use (any Booking Period of more than 6 weeks) we will require that you pay for the first month of the Booking Period at the time of booking.
We will collect each subsequent month's payment in advance on the same day of the month for each subsequent month (or the remaining amount due for the Booking Period where less than a month is left) until the Booking Period is complete.
We are authorized by the Owner to accept payment from you on the Owner's behalf.




The Licence for the Booking Period
You are only permitted to use the Parking Space during the Booking Period.
Each Booking is only valid for the vehicle you entered details for when making the Booking.
If you wish to change the vehicle you are parking, you may amend your Booking by logging in to your Account and selecting the 'amend booking' button for that particular Booking.
You can amend a Booking at any point prior to the start of the Booking Period.
During your Booking, if you have any concerns or queries about the Parking Space you must contact the Owner using the contact telephone number provided or our messaging system.
Upon arrival at the Parking Space at the start of your Booking Period, you should inspect the Parking Space and ensure you are satisfied that it meets the description on the Website.
If you are not satisfied you must contact the Owner immediately.
Unless the Owner has agreed to a later departure time or a further Booking Period (with such agreement being made through JustPark Services) you will be liable to pay the full price for any additional time stayed.


Complaints and Disputes
You agree that if you have any dispute with an Owner concerning them or their Parking Space during the Booking Period you will resolve it in the first instance by directly communicating with the Owner.
In the event that a dispute cannot be resolved with the Owner directly, you may refer the dispute to us or make a complaint.
Similarly, an Owner may refer a dispute to us.
We are under no obligation to resolve any disputes between you and an Owner.
However, save for where we are the Owner of a Parking Space, we may seek to resolve the dispute between you and an Owner and we may require that you make a further payment to the Owner.
Or we may require that the Owner refund payments it has received in relation to the relevant Booking to you.
In the event that we determine that an Owner should make a refund or other payment to you and if we are holding funds on behalf of the Owner we may make the refund on the Owner's behalf (but we are not under an obligation to do so).
You must raise any dispute with us as soon as possible.
If the Owner has collected payment directly or if we have passed on your payment to an Owner then you are responsible for recovery from the Owner.
If at any point the Owner is, or is controlled by, JustPark we will use an independent third party to assist with any dispute.
You agree that the provisions in this clause will survive any termination of this Agreement.


Cancellation and Termination
If you want to cancel a Booking you must do so through the cancellation policy www.justpark.com/cancellation-policy which may be updated from time to time ('Cancellation Policy').
To cancel a Booking you must log into your Account and process the cancellation through the Website in accordance with the Cancellation Policy.
Cancellation of a Booking will take effect at the point you receive an acknowledgment of such cancellation from us.
If you fail to cancel a Booking in accordance with the Cancellation Policy you will be liable for the full amount of the fees payable to the Owner in relation to your Booking.
Bookings may also be cancelled by the Owner or JustPark in accordance with the Cancellation Policy.

or b) Â£100.
We are not responsible for: (i) losses not caused by our breach.
