Cookies and Web Beacons Like many websites, we use "cookies" and "web beacons" (also known as pixels) to collect information.
A "cookie" is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes.
We collect cookies that are necessary for the Platform to function, cookies that enhance the Platformâs performance, and cookies used for third-party tracking.
A "web beacon" is a tiny and sometimes invisible image or embedded code, placed on a Web page or email that can report your visit or use to a third party.
Web beacons are typically used by third parties to monitor the activity of users at a website for the purpose of web analytics, advertising optimization, or page tagging.
Additional information regarding web beacons is available on Wikipedia.
You can change your browser's settings so it will stop accepting cookies and web beacons or to prompt you before accepting a cookie or web beacon.
Opt-out options for cookies and web beacons are located here. Use of Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technology for Analytics We may use third party cookies or web beacons for the purposes of web analytics, attribution, and error management.
Our Platform may use vendor services that use cookies, web beacons, and similar technology to collect and store anonymous information about you, including when you pay for services, load a page, indicate that you heard about us on television, sign up for services, enter your payment information (but the payment details are not disclosed), start the intake questionnaire, and your response as to the referral source to the Platform.
Our Platform also uses analytics vendors to collect information (for example, Visitor Data and Onboarding Data) about user actions on our websites for purposes of analytics and analysis of certain Platform usage. Use of Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technology for Advertising Networks You and others may see certain ads for our services or for the Platform on other websites because we participate in ad networks.
Ad networks allow us to target our messaging to users through demographic, interest-based, and contextual means.
These networks track individualsâ online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of cookies, web server logs, and web beacons.
The networks use this information to show advertisements that may be tailored to an individualâs interests.
The information our ad networks may collect includes information about your visits to websites that participate in the relevant ad networks, such as the pages or advertisements you view and the actions you take on the websites.
This data collection takes place both on our websites and on third-party websites that participate in the ad networks.
This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and assists other websites and advertising partners to find you or people like you on different platforms, including social media websites.
As mentioned above, you can opt-out of cookies and web beacons by visiting this link here.

Social and General Information Tools We use several publicly-available tools and information exchange resources, such as (but not limited to) a blog, a Facebook page, a Twitter account, and others (collectively "Social and General Information Tools").
Any information you provide or share while using Social and General Information Tools may be read, accessed, collected by that site and users of that site according to their Privacy Policy.

Phishing Online identity theft and account hacking, including the practice currently known as "phishing", are of great concern.
You should always be diligent when you are being asked for your account information and you must always make sure you do that in our secure system.
We will never request your login information or your credit card information in any non-secure or unsolicited communication (email, phone or otherwise).

Links The Platform may contain links to other websites, services or offers which are owned, operated or maintained by third parties.
If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third website or service.
The fact that we link to a website or service is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices.
We do not have control over third party websites and services and we do not have control over their privacy policies and terms of use.

Security of Information While using any Internet-based service carries inherent security risks that cannot be 100% prevented, our systems, infrastructure, encryption technology, operation and processes are all designed, built and maintained with your security and privacy in mind.
We apply industry standards and best practices to prevent any unauthorized access, use, and disclosure.
We comply with all applicable federal laws, state laws, and regulations regarding data privacy.

Service Providers We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Platform, to perform certain tasks which are related to the Platform, or to provide audit, legal, operational or other services for us.
These tasks include, but not limited to, customer service, technical maintenance, monitoring, email management and communication, database management, billing and payment processing, reporting and analytics.
We will share with them only the minimum necessary information to perform their task for us and only after entering into appropriate confidentiality agreements.

You should also be aware that Counselors may be obliged to disclose information to law enforcement or other authorities to conform to their professional and legal responsibilities.
