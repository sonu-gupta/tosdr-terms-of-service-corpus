MoreThe Full Detailed Privacy Policy1.
What Information Does the Service Collect?a.
Information You Provide to Us.

Personal Information and Demographic Information.
 On the Service, we may ask you to provide us (and/or our vendors) with the following categories of information: (1) personally identifiable information, which is information that identifies you personally, including your first and last name, phone number, e-mail address, home address, credit card information (âPersonal Informationâ).
and (2) demographic information, including your zip code, frequency of visits, purchase amounts, physical characteristics (to assist customers with reach restrictions and/or visual impairments), and items purchased (âDemographic Informationâ).
We can collect this information through various forms and in various places on the Service or when you interact with the Service.
To the extent we combine Demographic Information with your Personal Information we collect directly from you on the Service, we will treat the combined data as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.b.
Information We Collect or Store As You Access and Use the Service Generally.In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us via our Service, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that store or collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Service (âUsage Informationâ).
This Usage Information may be stored or accessed using a variety of technologies that may be downloaded to your personal computer, browser, laptop, tablet, mobile phone or other device (a âDeviceâ) whenever you visit or interact with our Service.
To the extent we associate Usage Information with your Personal Information we collect directly from you on the Service, we will treat it as Personal Information.
This Usage Information includes:

your IP address, UDID, advertising identifier, and device identifier (âDevice Identifierâ).
A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Service, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier;
your Device functionality (browser, operating system, hardware, mobile network information);
the URL that referred you to our Service;
the areas within our Service that you visit and your activities there;
your Device location;
your Device characteristics.
and
Device data and the time of day.

Our App may access and read accounts, data and/or content on your Device, add content to your Device, and change settings of your Device, for the following reasons (i) allowing you to access and use the Service (or certain of its features and functions).
(ii) showing you the closest Little Caesars to you.
(iii) saving app images and sound files and writing usage logs to the Device.
(iv) sending Facebook and Twitter messages you initiate.
(v) sending and receiving data needed for App operations.
(vi) to provide you notice when you are not connected to a network.
and (vii) in connection with your Service usage.
You consent to these activities by installing the App or otherwise using the Service.
Your Device settings may enable you to disable, change or limit some of these activities (See Section 6 for more information) and you can disable all of them associated with the App by uninstalling the App.
We may use various now and later developed methods and technologies to store or collect Usage Information (âTracking Technologiesâ).
Tracking Technologies may set, change, alter or modify settings or configurations on your Device.
The App may also receive signals from and otherwise interact with Tracking Technologies that exist in the physical world.
Tracking Technologies include:



Cookies.
 A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Service.
A Flash cookie (or locally shared object) is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device.
HTML5 cookies can be programmed through HTML5 local storage.
Unlike Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies do not require a plug-in.


Web Beacons.
 Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as â1x1 GIFsâ or âclear GIFsâ) may be included in our Serviceâs pages and messages.
Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or e-mail can act as a web beacon.
Web beacons or similar technologies can be used to count visitors to the Service, to monitor how users navigate the Service, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.


Embedded Scripts.
 An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about the links you click on and other of your interactions with the Service.
The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Service, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.


Browser Fingerprinting.
 Collection and analysis of information from your Device, including your operating system, plug-ins, and system fonts, for purposes of identification.


ETag, or Entity Tag.
 A feature of the cache in browsers.
It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL.
If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned.
Used in this manner, ETags are a form of Device Identifier.
ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash, and/or HTML5 cookies.


Location-Identifying Technologies.
 Additionally, the Services may use GPS (global positioning systems) software, RFID (radio frequency identification), cellular and Wi-Fi data, and other subsequent location-based technologies and methods later developed.
These can use geo-fencing and iBeacons to locate you so we may verify your location, provide directions to our nearest Little Caesars, coordinate the preparation of your order based on your distance from a Little Caesars, deliver you relevant content based on your location, as well as monitor via the Service the efficiency of the services we provide to you.
Upon downloading the App, we provide location-based services to your approximate and/or exact location information.
Geo-fencing utilizes GPS and RFID signals to create a virtual boundary around a geographic area of our choosing, thereby allowing us to determine when you are in proximity to a Little Caesars.
In addition to traditional GPS location-based services, some of the retailers and others we work with may install low power Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, radio transmitters, or other devices in physical locations, which emit a signal that the App can detect to pinpoint your location or otherwise interact with the App (âiBeaconsâ).
Because iBeacons are more precise than GPS, we can improve the Services and send you more specific and relevant messages and offers.
In addition, we can track the efficiency of the service you receive from Little Caesars, by knowing when you enter or exit a Little Caesars or when you arrive in the parking lot for a carryout order.
You should consider the pros and cons involved in disclosing your location information to us and to other people.
Your Device settings may enable you to disable, change or limit some of these activities (See Section 6 form more information).

There may be other Tracking Technologies now and later devised and used by us in connection with the Service.


Tracking Technologies Choices and Consent.


We are giving you detailed notice of the Tracking Technologies and your limited choices regarding them so that your consent is meaningfully informed.
We may also provide you with a choice as to the level of data you share with us.
The Service may be limited and some features may not be available based on what data you elect and/or consent to share with us.
For more information on how to exercise preferences as to our features, functionality and communications, see Section 6, for choices regarding our service providers see Section 3(b),and for options regarding advertising and advertisers see Section 6(d).
Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools that are available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some but not all instances can be blocked in the future by selecting certain settings.
Each browser you use will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options in this regard.
Also, these tools may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies or HTML5 cookies or other Tracking Technologies.
For information on disabling Flash cookies go to Adobeâs website http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-third-party-local-shared.html.
Please be aware that if you disable or remove these technologies some parts of our Services may not work and that when you revisit our Services your ability to limit browser-based Tracking Technologies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.
Tracking Technologies in connection with App usage outside of a browser can only be disabled by uninstalling the App.
To uninstall an app, follow the instructions from your operating system or handset manufacturer.
For information on third party Tracking Technologies and browser Do Not Track signals, see the next section.

Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of Interest-based Ads, you will continue to receive non-targeted ads.

Mobile device opt-outs will not affect browser-based Interest-based Ads even on the same device, and you must opt-out separately for each device.
LCE is not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-partiesâ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.
However, LCE supports the ad industryâs 2009 Self-regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (http://www.iab.net/media/file/ven-principles-07-01-09.pdf) and expect that ad networks LCE directly engages to serve you Interest-based Ads will do so as well, though LCE cannot guaranty their compliance.d.
