Wallapop Shipping

Wallapop makes use of a courier service, that operates via Correos in order to deliver items purchased within the application. 
During the purchase process, the user can use this shipping service for their deliveries.
It is essential the whole transaction is carried out via the Wallapop chat and that the purchase is made in the wallapop app.
Mangopay is a platform that allows secure payments between Users via the internet, providing both the buyer and seller have registered with Mangopay and accepted the terms and conditions of the platform. 
(Mangopay, property of Leetchi Corp, company based in 14 rue Aldringen, L-1118, Luxemburgo). 
Wallapop informs their Users that they do not offer electronic payment systems nor do they act as an intermediary in such payments.
Hence, Users who use the Mangopay platform enter into a contract with Mangopay with respect to their payment services and terms and conditions, of which wallapop forms no part. 
As a result, any claim or dispute that is raised in relation to the services supplied by Mangopay must be made directly to them. 
For security reasons, Mangopay may require the user to supply identification in order to process a transaction.
This request, will be made when the total amount of the transactions made reaches or exceeds 1000 (one thousand) euros in sales or 2500 (two thousand five hundred) euros in purchases.
Or, when a request is made by the platform (generally due to the detection of unusual activity for the payment method in question). 
This document will be required by our Customer Service team who will manage the request with Mangopay. 
Once you have chosen the delivery service, the app will send a tracking number to both the buyer and the seller, so that the item can be located at all times.
The buyer will receive the item to the address supplied at the time of payment.

In order to deliver the items, your personal details will be supplied to the third party operators of the postal service carrying out the delivery and between those contracted to carry out the transaction, who are contracted to act within the established regulations of personal data protection.

Tracking your delivery:

Once the seller accepts the transaction, the buyer will receive a tracking number via SMS to the telephone number listed in the buyerâs profile so that they can also check the status of the delivery.
Additionally, the buyer will receive an SMS when the package is received by Correos and the shipping process begins.
Receiving these messages if free of charge.
It is also possible to check the status of your package via the package locator on the Correos website. 

If the parcel is not successfully delivered: 

In the case of two failed attempts at delivery are made to the buyerâs address, the package will be kept at the Correos office in order to be collected by the buyer who will be advised of the delivery attempt.
If the buyer does not collect the package within 15 days, it will be returned to the sender, they will not receive payment, and the costs for delivery and return of the package will be transferred to the buyer. 
Consequently, in the case of the buyer not collecting the package they have been sent, they will become liable for the costs of the delivery and the return to sender.
