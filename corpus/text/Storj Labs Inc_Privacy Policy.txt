Storj Labs Inc.
Privacy Policy

Last Updated April 20, 2021



This Privacy Policy describes the data protection practices of Storj Labs Inc.
and its affiliate, Storj Labs International SEZC (together referred to as âCompany,â âStorjâ âwe,â âus,â or âourâ).
This Privacy Policy applies to all websites owned and operated by us that link to this Privacy Policy (the âSitesâ), Storjâs online storage services and applications, and related online and offline services (collectively, the âServicesâ).
The Services enable customers to store data on third-party devices that have installed an open source, distributed storage software (âSoftwareâ).
This Privacy Policy does not apply to the information other devices that have installed the Software may collect about you or your device in connection with your use of the Software.

Storj is a network and service provider that provides decentralized cloud storage by connecting those seeking to store data (âCustomersâ) with those providing space for cloud storage (âNode Operatorsâ) (the âStorage Servicesâ).

Data submitted by Customers to the Services for storage with Node Operators (âStorage Materialsâ) is encrypted, which prevents Storj and Node Operators from accessing the content of the Storage Materials.
Storj acts as a service provider/processor of Storage Materials on behalf of itsCustomers.
Individuals whose data may be included in Storage Materials ultimately are subject to the privacy policies and practices of the Customer utilizing Storj for Storage Services.
Accordingly, for the purposes of the European Union (âEUâ) General Data Protection Regulation (âGDPRâ), Customers act as the data controller with respect to the processing of the Storage Materials.
Storj is not responsible for the privacy practices of Customers.
Storj acts as the data controller and not a processor/service provider when, for example, Customers, Node Operators, and other Site visitors provide Storj with information, such as contact, account, and registration information.
PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE HANDLE YOUR INFORMATION.
By using the Services, you expressly and voluntarily are accepting the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use (and other applicable agreements, such as the Storj DCS CustomerTerms of Service, and Node Operator Terms and Conditions) (collectively, âAgreementsâ) that allow us to process information about you.
This Privacy Policy contains the following sections:

 Cookies and Online Analytics

We use minimal third-party analytics tools to process the use of our site and products.
First-party session cookies are only applied during site visits when a customer clicks the accept button.
Session cookies on our site provide for better business analysis and helpful insights for how the site is performing.
We use in-house methods to understand website referral sources, visits per page, and page to page referrals on our site.
When a website visitor accepts a session cookie, we place our cookie in the browsing session to gain a better understanding as to how visitors navigate through our site.
When a user who accepts a session cookie creates an account we then gain insights around product behavior in association to the referral source of this customer, enabling insights for marketing initiatives that will help grow our business.
Third-party tools in use outside of our site and satellite interface include Google Analytics and Customer.io.
Google Analytics is currently in use in our documentation to understand what pages are being used the most.
Customer.io is our email marketing tool.
Links within customer.io emails have analytics applied to them to provide insights as to what interactions look like within our emails.
We do not sell or share this information with anyone else, including to the companies running the tools we use.
The types of tracking and analytics tools we and our service providers use for these purposes are:

âCookiesâ are small data files stored on your computer or device to collect information about your use of the Services.
Cookies may enable us to recognize you as the same user who used our Services in the past, and relate your use of the Services to other information we have about you.
Cookies may also be used to enhance your experience on the Services (for example, by storing your username) and/or to collect general usage and aggregated statistical information.
Most browsers can be set to detect cookies and give you an opportunity to reject them, but refusing cookies may, in some cases, limit your use of our Services or features.
To learn more about the use of cookies, including how to manage or delete them, click here.
Please note that by blocking, disabling, or managing any or all cookies, you may not have access to certain features or offerings of the Services.

âLocal shared objects,â or âflash cookies,â may be stored on your computer or device using a media player or other software.
Local shared objects operate much like cookies, but cannot be managed in the same way.
Depending on how local shared objects are enabled on your computer or device, you may be able to manage them using software settings.
For information on managing flash cookies, for example, click here.
A âpixel tagâ (also known as a âclear GIFâ or âweb beaconâ) is a tiny image â typically just one-pixel â that can be placed on a web page or in our electronic communications to you in order to help us measure the effectiveness of our content by, for example, counting the number of individuals who visit us online or verifying whether youâve opened one of our emails or seen one of our web pages.


Do Not Track.
Do Not Track (âDNTâ) is a privacy preference that Customers can set in certain web browsers.
We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for online advertising and analytics purposes, and that is why we provide the variety of opt-out mechanisms listed above.
However, we do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals.
Learn more about Do Not Track.

Personal Data Transfers Outside of the EEA




Storj may transfer some of your personal information outside of the EEA.
Storj may transmit some of your personal information to a country where the data protection laws may not provide a level of protection equivalent to the laws in your jurisdiction, including the United States.
As required by applicable law, Storj will provide an adequate level of protection for your personal data using various means, including, where appropriate:

relying on a formal decision by the European Commission that a certain country ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data (a full list of such decisions may be accessed online here).
entering into appropriate data transfer agreements based on language approved by the European Commission, such as the Standard Contractual Clauses (2010/87/EC and/or 2004/915/EC), which are available upon request at legal@storj.io;
implementing appropriate physical, technical, and organizational security measures to protect personal information against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss or alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, and against unlawful forms of processing.
and
taking other measures to provide an adequate level of data protection in accordance with applicable law.

Any onward transfer is subject to appropriate onward transfer requirements as required by applicable law.

Data Subject Rights

If you are an EEA resident, you may have a right to request from Storj access to and rectification or erasure of your personal data or restriction of processing concerning you, as well as the right to data portability under the GDPR.
You also have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to the processing of your personal data by us, and we can be required to no longer process your personal data.
In general, you have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes.
If you have a right to object and you exercise this right, your personal data will no longer be processed for such purposes by us.
You can exercise such rights by accessing the information in your account or by filling out the GDPR Data Subject Rights Webform.
Please also note that Storage Materials are encrypted, which prevents Storj and Node Operators from accessing the information.
Those who wish to access or delete any personal information within Storage Materials must direct their queries to the relevant Customer.
If you have provided consent for cookies that are not strictly necessary, direct marketing emails or other data processing, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing or other activity based on consent before you withdraw it.
You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.

 Additional Information for California Residents

The California Consumer Privacy Act (âCCPAâ) applies to certain companies based on thresholds set in the law.
The CCPA applies to companies that meet at least one of the following: minimum annual gross revenue of $25M.
collects the personal information of at least 50,000 âconsumersâ (as defined under the law), households, or devices.
or, derives at least 50% of its revenue from the sale of consumersâ personal information.
None of these currently apply to Storj.
Companies that are subject to the CCPA, however, must provide California residents with some additional information regarding the collection, use, and sharing of âpersonal informationâ as defined in the CCPA.
Although Storj currently is not subject to the CCPA, we voluntarily are providing certain additional information below for informational purposes only:

How We Source, Use, and Disclose Information for Business Purposes

Your California Privacy Rights

If the CCPA were applicable to Storj, the CCPA would require us to provide certain information to California residents upon request.
Specifically, the CCPA would allow California residents to request us to:

Inform them about the categories of personal information we collect or disclose about them.
the categories of sources of such information.
the business or commercial purpose for collecting their personal information.
and, the categories of third parties with whom we share/disclose personal information.

Provide access to and/or a copy of certain personal information we hold about them.
Delete certain personal information we have about them.
Provide them with information about the financial incentives that we offer to them, if any.

The CCPA exempts certain information from some requests including, for example, a company may need certain information to provide the requested services or to comply with a legal obligation.
In some circumstances if the consumer still asks for their information to be deleted, they may no longer be able to access or use the services offered.
Notwithstanding, the CCPA protects a person making a request under the law to be free from discrimination for exercising their rights.
Companies subject to the CCPA should take reasonable steps to verify the consumerâs identity before responding to a request, including by asking for verification information to match at least two verification points with information already on file.
If the consumer canât be verified this way, a company has the right, but not the obligation, to request additional information from the consumer.
The CCPA also permits consumers to designate an authorized agent to submit certain requests on their behalf.
The authorized agent must have signed, written permission to make such requests or a power of attorney, and may be subject to additional verification before the authorized agentâs request is processed.

As noted above, Storage Materials are encrypted, which prevents Storj and Node Operators from accessing the encrypted data.
If the CCPA applies, any person who wishes to access or delete personal information within Storage Materials must send their queries to the relevant Customer.

California âShine the Lightâ Disclosure

The California âShine the Lightâ law gives residents of California the right under certain circumstances to opt out of the sharing of certain categories of personal information (as defined in the Shine the Light law) with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
Storjâs policy and practice is to never share personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Accordingly, there is no need for Storj consumers to opt out.

10.
 Additional Information for Nevada Residents

Under Nevada law, certain Nevada residents may opt out of the âsaleâ of âcovered informationâ (as those terms are defined under Nevada law) where the sale allows the person buying it to license or sell such information to additional persons.
âCovered informationâ includes first and last name, address, email address, phone number, social security number, or an identifier that allows a specific person to be contacted either physically or online.
Storj does not sell consumer information as defined under Nevada law.
Notwithstanding, if you are a Nevada resident who has purchased or leased goods or services from us, Nevada law permits you to submit a request to opt out of the sale of your covered information.
To do so, you may email your request to nevadarequests@storj.io.
Please note we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity and the authenticity of the request.

11.
 Data Retention

Storj keeps personal data as long as required to provide the Services you requested and as needed to comply with applicable laws and compliance practices.

12.
 How We Protect Your Data and Our Services

We take measures to protect your information against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, and access.
However, no method of transmission over the internet, and no means of electronic or physical storage, is absolutely secure.
By using our Services, you acknowledge and accept that we cannot guarantee the security of your information and that use of our Services is at your own risk.

When you sign up for an account, you may be required to establish a username and password.
If you create an account with us, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account password and for any activity that occurs under your account.
We are not responsible for any loss or damage arising from your failure to maintain the confidentiality of your password.

13.
 Third-Party Links and Features

The Services may contain links to third-party services, and you may also integrate our Services with third-party services.
Our provision of such links does not signify our endorsement of such other websites, services, locations, or contents.
If you choose to use these third-party services or features, you may disclose your information not just to those third parties but also to their users and customers and the public more generally, depending on how their services function.
Storj is not responsible for the content or practices of such third-party services.
The collection, use, and disclosure of your information will be subject to the privacy policies of the third-party services, and not this Privacy Policy.
We urge you to read the privacy and security policies of third parties.

14.
 Children's Privacy

The Services are not intended for children under 13 years of age and we do not knowingly collect, maintain, or use Personal Information from children under 13 years of age.
We will take reasonable steps to delete personal information (as defined by the United States Childrenâs Online Privacy Protection Act) as soon as reasonably possible if we learn that we have inadvertently collected it from children under the age of 13 without parental consent.
If you learn that your child has provided us with Personal Information without your consent, you may alert us at legal@storj.io.
If we learn that we have collected any Personal Information from children under 13, we will take steps promptly to delete such information and terminate the childâs account.

15.
 Changes to our Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time.
We will make the revised Privacy Policy accessible through the Services, so you should review the Policy periodically.
You can know if the Privacy Policy has changed since the last time you reviewed it by checking the âEffective Dateâ at the beginning of this Privacy Policy.
If we make a material change to this Privacy Policy, we will provide you with notice in accordance with legal requirements.
By continuing to use the Services, you are confirming that you have read and understood the latest version of this Privacy Policy.

16.
 Contact Information

If you wish to contact us or have any questions about, or complaints in relation to, this Privacy Policy, please email us at legal@storj.io.
Please note that your communications with us may not necessarily be secure.

Please do not use the aforementioned email address for GDPR-related matters.
