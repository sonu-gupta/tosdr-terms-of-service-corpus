On most web browsers, you will find a âhelpâ section on the toolbar.
Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off.
We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Service features.
Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) may also use cookies on the Site.

Web Beacons) that help us better manage content on our Site by informing us what content is effective.
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements and actions of Web users.
