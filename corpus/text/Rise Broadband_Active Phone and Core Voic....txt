This Agreement governs both the Service and the Analog Telephone Adapter or any other IP connection Device (âDeviceâ or âEquipmentâ), used in conjunction with the Service.
BY USING THE SERVICE, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE OF LEGAL AGE TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND FULLY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.
PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT INCLUDES MANY IMPORTANT TERMS, INCLUDING: WARNINGS THAT YOU MAY BE UNABLE TO USE THE VOIP SERVICE FOR 911 OR OTHER EMERGENCY CALLS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.
LIMITS AND DISCLAIMERS ON COMPANYâS LIABILITY.

SERVICE

Service is offered on a monthly basis for a term that corresponds with the date Your RISE BROADBAND Internet service was activated and ends on the day before the same date in the following month.
Subsequent terms of this Agreement automatically renew unless You give RISE BROADBAND written notice of non-renewal at least ten (10) days before the end of the monthly term in which the notice is given.
You are purchasing the Service for full monthly terms, meaning that if You attempt to terminate Service prior to the end of a monthly term, You will be responsible for the full monthâs charges to the end of the then-current term, including, without limitation, unbilled charges, plus a termination fee, if applicable, all of which will immediately become due and payable.
Expiration of the term or termination of Service will not excuse You from paying all accrued and unpaid charges due under this Agreement.
If You subscribe to the Companyâs Residential Services, which is defined as Service intended solely for the subscriberâs residence, or home, and not for commercial purposes (âResidential Servicesâ), the Service and the Device are provided to You solely for such residential use.
You shall not resell or transfer the Service or the Device to another party.
You are prohibited from using the Service or the Device for auto-dialing, continuous or extensive call forwarding, telemarketing (including, without limitation, charitable or political solicitation or polling), fax or voicemail broadcasting or fax or voicemail blasting.
We reserve the right to immediately terminate or modify Your Service if We determine, in our sole and absolute discretion, that Your use of the Service or the Device is, or at any time was, inconsistent with normal residential usage patterns.
In addition, You will be required to pay our higher rates for commercial Service for all periods in which Your use of the Service or the Device was inconsistent with normal residential use.
If You subscribe to the Companyâs Business Services, which is defined as Service intended solely for the subscriberâs use to support commercial, for-profit or not-for-profit, non-residential enterprises (âBusiness Servicesâ), the Service and Device are provided to You as a small business User.
Because We have no control over Your power or Internet connectivity You may experience occasional outages.
For this reason We recommend that You maintain another backup provider so that You have backup contact ability.
It is recommended that You use a âfailoverâ number that can be configured in the website http://phone.RISEBROADBAND.net so that You can receive calls in the event of an outage.
You shall not resell or transfer the Service or the Device to another party.

If Your usage pattern for calls to the forty-eight (48) contiguous state local calling areas is in the ninety-fifth (95th) percentile for two months out of any three month period Your account will automatically convert from an unlimited domestic long distance account to a metered use account.
A metered use account will have a domestic long distance use allowance of 1500 minutes per user or per line, and additional domestic use for calls to the 48 contiguous state local calling areas will be billed at the then in effect domestic long distance rate, currently $.03 per minute.
