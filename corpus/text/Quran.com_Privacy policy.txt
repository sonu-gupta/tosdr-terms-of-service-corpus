         Privacy policy  This project is run by a set of Muslims who do this work for the sake of Allah.
We do not serve you ads, so we do not need to track you or use your personal data to provide you with better ads to increase our revenues.
We donât gather any information (there is no login, there is no request for location permissions (except optionally on salah.com for the purposes of computing more accurate Salah timings), and so on).

 If you open a support ticket, that account information goes to Zendesk, the support provider we use.
We do not have any access to this account information and any support ticket accounts or requests are subject to their privacy policy.

 We do use Google Analytics for ensuring that the site continues to work as expected and for knowing which features to prioritize work on.
This information is anonymous and we canât trace it back to any particular individual.

 Our code is open source, so the community can easily ensure that this stance on privacy is actually the case on the code level and not just a stated goal.
