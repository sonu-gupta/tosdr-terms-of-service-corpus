We, at Kongregate Inc.
(âKongregate,â the âCompany,â
âweâ or âusâ), are committed to respecting your privacy and the integrity and security of your personal information.
As the data controller of certain of your personal information, we want you to know how we handle it, how we use it, process it and/or share it, as well as the ways in which you can protect your own privacy.
This Privacy Policy applies to www.kongregate.com, www.kartridge.com and all other sites or online services that are owned or operated by Kongregate (each, a âSite,â and collectively, the âSites,â), all mobile games published or operated by Kongregate (each, an âApp,â and collectively, the âApps,â and together with the Sites, the âPlatformâ), and Kongregate games that can be played through third party platforms, e.g., via consoles, PCs and/or social media sites such as Facebook (â3rd Party Platform Gamesâ).
By visiting our Sites, using the Apps, playing 3rd Party Platform Games or otherwise access any of our other products, services or content through any of our Platform or through 3rd Party Platform Games (collectively, âServicesâ), you agree to and accept this Privacy Policy, our Cookie Policy (which is incorporated into the Privacy Policy) and our User Agreement (of which the Privacy Policy is a part).
We reserve the right to change our practices and this Privacy Policy at any time.

Amendments to Privacy Policy.
We reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy at our discretion and at any time.
When any changes are made, we will try to provide reasonable notice and will post the updated version on the Platform.
We may also send an email or provide notice within some or all of our Services when this Privacy Policy changes.
Each time a user accesses our Services, the Platform or 3rd Party Platform Games, the then current version of the Privacy Policy applies, and you agree that the information we collect will be subject to the Privacy Policy, as updated.
We encourage you to check this page regularly so that you know our current practices.
Should you have any questions about the changes, you are welcome to contact us at 1-800-678-2319, or support@kongregate.com.
If you do not agree with the changes, then unfortunately, we must ask you to cease using our Platform and/or Services, as we must have all users under the same terms in order to provide equitable Services to all.
Our Privacy Policy explains:

What information we collect;
Why we collect and how we use the information we collect;
With whom we may share your information;
How long we retain and how we protect the information.
and
What rights and link to control your personal data.

We ask that you read this Privacy Policy carefully and familiarize yourself with its content.
If you have any questions or concerns after reading this, please contact us at 1-800-678-2319, or support@kongregate.com. 1.
What Information We Collect When you access, connect to, sign up to, participate in, create an account for, make purchases within or otherwise use our Services, we may collect personal data from you.
The personal data we collect will depend on the circumstances and the Services you are using.
We collect information in two ways â (A) information that YOU provide and (B) information that we automatically collect.



Information You Provide You provide certain personally identifiable information that uniquely identifies you such as:

Email address when you choose to participate in various activities on the Platform such as registering an account, chat, posting messages in the games comment section or in our forums, sending feedback, entering contests, responding to surveys, or subscribing to newsletters or other mailing lists;
User name and password to protect your account;
Information requested by us when you report a problem with our Services;
Your contact information if you reach out to us;
Postal address and limited and tokenized payment information may be collected when uploading a game, or making a purchase.
and/or
Other information to us directly or through third-party services.


You may also provide us information in the following manners:




Information You Provide via Apps. You may have the option to link your mobile account to your Sites account in connection with certain Apps.
This will allow you to participate in content that crosses between the Sites and Apps, such as Kongregate level, points, and badges.
If you choose this linking option, the information we receive via the Sites may also apply to Apps, and vice versa.



Your Friends. You may invite friends to join the Kongregate community by using the âinvite a friendâ feature.
You will be required to submit your name and email address, as well as their name and email address.
Your friendâs personal information that you submit in this feature will be used only to send the email you request, and will not be otherwise stored or maintained by Kongregate.
You may also identify certain people as âfriendsâ under your Kongregate account.
this list is publicly visible to all, whether or not the user has a Kongregate account.



Information through Social Media. Personal information that you post voluntarily now or in the future through the Platform or on an area of a social network monitored by us (e.g., our Facebook page) may be visible to others and collected by third-parties.
Information that you disclose, including, but not limited to, through our online chat rooms, forums, game comments, profile shouts and direct messages is public and will be accessible to anyone who uses our Platform and/or 3rd Party Platform Games.



Payment Information. If you make a purchase in or through our Services, our third-party payment processor will collect the billing and financial information it needs to process your charges.
Kongregate does not collect or store your financial information, but our payment processors may share information with us in order for us to fulfill your order.
Our User Agreement explains our policies and terms relevant to our charges, billing practices, third-party credits and virtual currencies.



Customer Support Communication. Except as provided herein, when you ask for help from our Customer Support team, we will collect and store the contact information you give them (generally, your name and e-mail address), information about your game play or activity on our Services, and your Kongregate username and/or social network ID number.
We will also store the communications you have with the Customer Support team in order to provide you support and improve the Services.



Other Information You Provide. We collect the following types of personally identifiable information: your contact information (such as name, postal or email address, or phone number), username and password, purchase history on our Platform, game play preferences (such as an interest in a particular type of game or genre), information you provide by interacting with us through social media, and photographs that you submit on our Platform or through our social media channels.
By submitting a photograph, you waive any rights thereto and authorize us to copyright, use and publish the same in print or electronically for any lawful purpose.





Information We Automatically Collect. We and our affiliates, analytics or service providers, and third party companies with whom we have marketing relationships, use technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts, to analyze trends, administer the website, track usersâ movements around the website, and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual or aggregated basis.



Analytics. When you visit our Platform, we automatically collect the following types of information: information about the devices you use to access the Internet (such as the IP address and the device, browser, and operating system type), URLs that refer you to our Platform and the dates and times of your visits, information on your gaming behavior on our Platform (e.g., page views, paths you take through our Sites, frequency of visits, referring/exit pages), general geographic location information (e.g., country) that shows where you are when browsing our Sites, search terms that you enter to reach our Sites or enter on our Sites to find products, and the fact that you opened one of our emails.
We utilize analytics services to help us track the efficacy of our Platform and help us learn more about our usersâ behavior.



Information We Receive through Apps. If you play a Kongregate game through an App on a mobile device (such as your phone or tablet), we can collect mobile device identifiers that can include things like your MAC address and IP address.
We may also collect information such as device name and type, operating system, country, and any other information you choose to provide such as your game character name or e-mail address.
Additionally, we may access third party information such as your phone or Facebook contacts with your authorization and according to the rules you have established within your device permissions.



Social Media Features. Our Platform includes social media features, such as the Facebook âLikeâ button and widgets, the âshare thisâ widget, or interactive mini-programs that run on our Site.
These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.
Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy statement of the company providing it.



Facebook Link. To personalize the Site, and to simplify the registration process, we give you the option to link your account with Facebook.
When you link your account, Facebook may share data about you with us, and we may share information about you with Facebook.
In addition, Kongregate users who are your friends on Facebook will be shown your Kongregate username if you have both linked your Facebook accounts.



Information We Receive from Third Parties. As previously noted, you can play Kongregate games through third party consoles or third party social media sites such as Facebook.
When you play these 3rd Party Platform Games, backend system vendors may collect and share your information with us such as player IDs, session information, and purchase data, as well as personal information including email address, gender, and birthday and/or age range.
Because such services are offered through a third party, this collection of information is governed the applicable third partyâs privacy policy.



Tailored Advertising. Advertising allows us to provide many free-to-play Services.
Third-party advertising companies serve ads on our behalf across the Internet.
Such advertising partners have a legitimate interest to collect and profile personal data in the form of IP address and cookie ID from users on our website in order to provide targeted online advertising and ad measurement.



Cookies. As further described in our Cookie Policy, we automatically collect information through cookies and other similar technologies (e.g., web beacons, pixels, ad tags and device identifiers) to recognize you and/or your device(s).
Cookies are small text files stored by your Web browser on your computer, phone, tablet, or other device used to browse our Platform.
Cookies allow us to identify and authenticate visitors, track behavior, and enable important site features.
We also contract with analytics services and third-party advertising companies to collect similar information for specific purposes.

Please note that companies delivering advertisements on our Services may also use cookies or other technologies as described below in the section âThird Party Advertisersâ and those practices are subject to those companiesâ own policies.
 You can control cookies through your browser settings and other tools.
For more information on cookies, please see our Cookie Policy.

If you wish to reduce the availability or visibility of such information, you may change your profile settings to âPrivateâ in your account options.
This will prevent others, including 3rd party developers, from being able to see or access your friends list as well as other information you have shared on your profile page.

We may also share information with companies assisting in fraud protection, legal compliance or investigations.

For the portions of our Services that are directed to audiences who are not Children, we do not sell identifying information such as name, email address, phone number, or postal address, but we may share identifiers such as cookies and the advertising identifier associated with your mobile device with our advertising partners, and those partners may use and share those identifiers to show ads that are targeted to your interests.
If this takes place, these disclosures may constitute a âsaleâ under California law.

In the preceding twelve (12) months, we have not sold any personal information, but we have disclosed the following categories of personal information for a business purpose:


Category A: Identifiers.

Category B: California Customer Records personal information categories.

 4.
How Long We Retain Your Personal Data We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide our Services to you and fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
We do periodic status checks to review when personal data needs to be deleted.
However, as we process your personal data for various purposes, the actual period for which the personal data will be stored will depend on the circumstances.
For example, we may retain some information for a few years after you have closed your account with us if this is necessary to meet our legal obligations or to exercise, defend or establish legal rights.
When we no longer need to use your information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we will either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we cannot identify you.
While we endeavor to honor your requests related to your personal data, we may not be fully able
to honor the request until a later time or we may deny your deletion request if retaining the
information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:

Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or
service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our
ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you;
Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or
prosecute those responsible for such activities;
Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality;
Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights,
or exercise another right provided for by law;
Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal.
Penal Code Â§ 1546 et.
seq.);
Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public
interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the informationâs
deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the researchâs achievement, if you
previously provided informed consent;
Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on
your relationship with us;
Comply with a legal obligation.
and/or
Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context
in which you provided it.
 5.
How We Protect Your Information We strive to maintain the security of your personal information through a variety of security measures.
Safeguarding your personal data is a priority for us.
Personal data that you provide to us is stored on secure servers, and we use rigorous procedures to protect against loss, misuse, unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of your personal data.
Although we work hard to protect your personal data, please note that no system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
Therefore, while we strive to employ reasonable protections for your information that are appropriate to its sensitivity, we cannot guarantee that our safeguards will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use or disclose personal data, and we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of the information you share with us and we cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, loss or inadvertent disclosure of your information.
It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to any login or password information, and to your computer or device.
To minimize the risk of having your account being compromised, we recommend that you set up your account password using unique numbers, letters and special characters.
Do not disclose passwords to others.
Please notify us of any password compromises and change passwords periodically to maintain account protection.
To learn more about how to protect yourself online, we encourage you to visit the governmentâs website at www.onguardonline.gov 6.
Our Policies Concerning Children 
Our Services are Not Designed for Children. Our Services, Platform and 3rd Party Platform Games are generally designed for and directed at people 18 years of age or older.
No one under the age of 13 within the United States (or up to the age of 16 for children located in certain European countries)(collectively, âChildrenâ) may provide any personal information to us, and we do not knowingly collect information from Children except in connection with the following Apps which Kongregate has designated as directed to Children (collectively, our âKid-Appealing Gamesâ).
For our limited collection of Kid-Appealing Games, we recognize a special obligation to further protect personal information collected from Children.
We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses or phone numbers without permission.
Some of the features of our Kid-Appealing Games are age-gated so that they are not available for use by Children.
When we intend to collect personal information from Children, we take additional steps to protect childrenâs privacy, including:




Notifying&nbsp.
parents  about our information practices with regard to Children, including the types of personal information we may collect from Children, the uses to which we may put that information, and whether and with whom we may share that information;


In accordance with applicable law, and our practices, obtaining consent from parents for the collection of personal information from their children, or for sending information about our Services directed to Children;


Limiting our collection of personal information from Children to no more than is reasonably necessary to participate in an online activity.
and


Giving parents access or the ability to request access to personal information we have collected from their Children and the ability to request that the personal information be changed or deleted.




For additional information about our practices regarding Childrenâs personal information, please read our Childrenâs Privacy Policy.
With the exception of a handful or so of our Kid-Appealing Games, Children should not attempt to create an account or send any of your information to us, including your name, address, telephone number or email address.
If Kongregate learns that we have collected personal information from Children without verification of parental consent in contravention of these measures, we will terminate access to the account immediately and will take all reasonable measures to delete such information from its databases and to not use such information for any purpose (except where necessary to protect the safety of the child or other as required or allowed by law).
If you believe that we might have any information from or about Children, please contact us at 1-800-678-2319 or at support@kongregate.com.

You can manage these updates from the âsettingsâ page from within the App or from your device control panel that manages these notifications.

For example, Facebookâs relevant policy in this regard can be found here.
Please note that once Kongregate receives any personal information from a social media site as a result of a user playing 3rd Party Platform Games, it will be stored and handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy.



Opting Out of Geolocation. In order to improve and optimize our service continuously, we use mobile tracking technologies.
With the help of these services, we collect data on the usage of our Apps to be able to constantly improve our Services.
In this respect, we may collect: IP address, which is anonymized right away, MAC address, anonymized Device ID (IDentifier For Advertisers (IDFA)) or Google Advertiser ID (GAID), browser type, language settings, internet service provider, network status, time zone, URL of the entry and exit pages, date of access and time spent, clickstream data, and other statistical information about the use of our Services.

iPhone or iPad) and select the menu item âPrivacy.â Under âAdvertising,â you can turn off the Ad Tracking.


In the case of Android devices: Open the settings in your App list and tap on the âAdâ button.

Opting Out of Third Party Tailored Advertising. If you are interested in more information about tailored advertising and your choices to prevent third parties from delivering tailored web and mobile web advertising you may visit the following websites:


Network Advertising Initiative Consumer Opt-Out Page or the Digital Advertising Alliance Opt-Out Page for U.S.-based advertising.
and


Your Online Choices UK website for EU-based advertising.


In addition, if you do not want to receive tailored in-application advertisements from third parties that relate to your interests in apps on your mobile device, you may opt-out by adjusting the ad tracking settings on your device.
You can also reset the âAdvertising Identifierâ (like an IDFA) from your mobile deviceâs âsettingsâ page, which will prevent continued use of existing behavioral data tied to the previous âAdvertising Identifier.â


Further, depending on the platform provider (such as Apple or Google), you may be able to download apps, such as the Digital Advertising Allianceâs âAppChoicesâ app, that offer to provide you with control regarding the collection and use of cross-app data for tailored advertising.


Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads.
While you do have choices to limit personalized ads that are tailored to your interests, you may receive generic ads.
These opt-out tools are not provided by Kongregate but provided by third parties.

We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests.
in those cases, that company will be prohibited from using our usersâ personally identifiable information for any other purpose.



California Privacy Rights. California Civil Code Section 1798 allows California residents to ask companies with whom they have an established business relationship to provide certain information about the companiesâ sharing of personal information with third parties for direct marketing purposes.
California customers who wish to request further information about our compliance with this law or have questions or concerns about our privacy practices may contact us at support@Kongregate.com or by writing to the address provided under âQuestions, Concerns or Requestsâ below.



Do Not Track. Do Not Track is a concept that has been promoted by regulatory agencies such as the U.S.
Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for the Internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing Internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites by using browser settings.
At this time, there is no general agreement on how companies such as ours should interpret Do Not Track signals.
Kongregate does not currently respond to Do Not Track signals, whether that signal is received on a computer or on a mobile device.
