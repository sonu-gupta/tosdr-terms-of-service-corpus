This document is our "Privacy Policy" and it contains details on issues related to your privacy when using our services.
It is intended to inform you of our policies, procedures and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of any information that you provide through the Platform.

By deciding to provide the Information you agree to our methods of collections and use, as well to other terms and provisions of this Privacy Policy.
Protecting this Information is a top priority for us.
We will never sell or rent any Information you shared in the Platform.
Other than in the limited ways detailed in this Privacy Policy, we will never use or disclose any Information unless you specifically and explicitly requested or approved us to do so.
The Information may be used or disclosed to third parties for one or more of the following business or marketing purposes:

The Platform may also include the use of cookies and web beacons of services owned or provided by third parties that are not covered by our Privacy Policy and we do not have access or control over these cookies and web beacons.
We may also use third party cookies for the purposes of web analytics, attribution and error management.

 Social and General Information Tools We use several publicly-available tools and information exchange resources, such as (but not limited to) a blog, a Facebook page, a Twitter account, and others (collectively "Social and General Information Tools").
Any information you provide or share while using Social and General Information Tools may be read, accessed, collected by that site and users of that site according to their Privacy Policy.

 Phishing Online identity theft and account hacking, including the practice currently known as "phishing", are of great concern.
You should always be diligent when you are being asked for your account information and you must always make sure you do that in our secure system.
We will never request your login information or your credit card information in any non-secure or unsolicited communication (email, phone or otherwise).

 Links The Platform may contain links to other websites, services or offers which are owned, operated or maintained by third parties.
If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third website or service.
The fact that we link to a website or service is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices.
We do not have control over third party websites and services and we do not have control over their privacy policies and terms of use.

 Security While using any Internet-based service carries inherent security risks that cannot be 100% prevented, our systems, infrastructure, encryption technology, operation and processes are all designed, built and maintained with your security and privacy in mind.
We apply industry standards and best practices to prevent any unauthorized access, use, and disclosure.
We comply with or exceed all applicable federal laws, state laws, and regulations regarding data privacy.

These tasks include, but not limited to, customer service, technical maintenance, monitoring, email management and communication, database management, billing and payment processing, reporting and analytics.
We will share with them only the minimum necessary information to perform their task for us and only after entering into appropriate confidentiality agreements.

 Children's Privacy We do not knowingly collect or solicit any information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to become our user.
The Platform is not directed and not intended to be used by children under the age of 13.
If you're aware that we have collected Personal Information from a child under age 13 please let us know by contacting us and we will delete that information.

 International Transfer Your information may be transferred to â and maintained on â computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction.
Regardless of where your data is stored, it will be maintained securely as outlined in this policy.
Your consent to our Terms and Conditions followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to such transfers.

 Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials to enforce and comply with the law.
We may disclose information necessary or appropriate to protect the safety of the public or any person, to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), and to prevent or stop activity that may be illegal or dangerous.
You should also be aware that Counselors may be obliged to disclose information to law enforcement or other authorities to conform to their professional and legal responsibilities.
Specifically, and without limitation, you should be aware that the law requires mental health professionals to disclose information and/or take action in the following cases: (a) reported or suspected abuse of a child or vulnerable adult.
