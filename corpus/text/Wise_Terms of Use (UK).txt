9.
Payment Methods

We only accept payment for your transfer via ACH Pull Direct Debit, or, if you choose to initiate the transfer of funds from Your Bank Account, an ACH Push or domestic Wire Transfer.
No other payment methods are accepted, including cash, mailed check, or electronic check.

9.1 Payment by ACH Pull Direct Debit


If you choose to pay for your transfer using our ACH Pull direct debit feature, you will need to provide your bank account details, including your bank account number and routing number (each such bank account is deemed âYour Bank Accountâ).


When you choose to pay for your transfer using our ACH Pull direct debit feature and provide Your Bank Account details, you represent that Your Bank Account payment details are correct, that you are authorized to access and transmit funds from Your Bank Account, that Your Bank Account is in good standing with the account-holding financial institution, and that you have the authority to initiate an electronic funds transfer in the amount at issue to or from Your Bank Account.


When you choose to pay for your transfer using our ACH Pull direct debit feature and by providing Your Bank Account details and requesting a Transaction, you authorize us to initiate electronic credits and debits to Your Bank Account through the automated clearinghouse (ACH) network in order to process the requested Transaction, including any applicable fees and charges.

Your authorization shall remain in effect for any Transaction that you have authorized while a registered user with the Service unless canceled in accordance with this Agreement.


9.2 Payment by Wire or ACH Push


If you choose to pay for your transfer using the ACH Push or domestic wire transfer method, then your payment order will remain inactive until we receive your funds (the âDeposit Paymentâ) to our specified account.


Deposit Payments must be made to our specified account via ACH Push or domestic wire transfer.
If for any reason your Transaction is cancelled or refused, then we will promptly return the deposit to the account from which it originated.
In the event that we are unable to return the deposit, then we will promptly contact you using the most current contact information provided to us by you through your Wise registration.


10.
Exchange Rates


The âTransaction Amountâ is the amount that you send from Your Bank Account in an ACH Pull Transaction or the Deposit Payment in an ACH Push or wire transfer, minus any applicable fees and prior to any foreign exchange conversion.

Locked-In Exchange Rates.
We always specify the exchange rate applicable to your Transaction at the time you submit your requested Transaction, and this exchange rate will be locked-in (the âLocked-In Exchange Rateâ) for a period of 24 hours from the time you initiate your payment (the âSpecified Periodâ).
We will convert the Transaction Amount at the Locked-In Exchange Rate, provided that your Transaction Amount reaches our specified bank account within the Specified Period.

Unlocked Exchange Rates.
If the Transaction Amount reaches our specified bank account after the Specified Period, we will convert your funds at the Unlocked Exchange Rate, as defined below, which means that the exchange rate could be higher or lower than the Locked-In Exchange Rate.


We, through Wise, make reasonable efforts to align Unlocked Exchange Rates with the mid-market rate in global currency markets at the time of conversion.
Wise relies on aggregated third party information sources (including exchange rates under license from XE.COM Inc.
[âXEâ, http://www.xe.com/]), and we do not guarantee that the rates match any particular benchmark source at any given time.
We are not liable if the amount received by the Recipient is less than anticipated as a result of changes in the global currency markets.


In order to protect you from negative volatility in the global foreign exchange markets, we automatically apply a 3% rate limit (the âAutomatic Rate Limitâ).
This means that in the event that the conversion rate moves negatively (to your detriment) beyond the Automatic Rate Limit, then we will temporarily stop any further conversion until market conditions improve.
We will notify you if the situation does not improve for more than 24 hours.


Any rate limits will only apply to limit negative rate movements.
We will always pass on any improvements in exchange rates for Unlocked Exchange Rate transactions.




Neither we nor any of our service providers take any margin or spread on the exchange rate associated with your Transaction.
hence, there are no buy and sell rates.
The rate that you receive is exactly the same rate as your counterparty.
The only fees you pay us for the Service are the Transaction Fees and Administration Fees described in Section 13 of this Agreement.


For the avoidance of doubt, we do not currently offer the ability to make recurring payments or forward contracts as part of our Services.


11 .Transaction History

You can access the details of all your Transactions and other information relating to your use of the Service by logging into the Service Website (at www.wise.com/usa?) and selecting an option from navigation bar called âTransfersâ.

12.
Refused Transactions

We reserve the right in our sole discretion to refuse any Transaction.
Reasons for refusal may include but are not limited to an inability to match your registration information with your bank account details, incorrect Recipient details or an insufficient deposit amount.
We generally will attempt to notify of you of any refusal, using the contact information provided as part of your registration, stating (where possible) the reasons for the refusal and whether the problem can be corrected.
We will not notify you of a refusal where to do so would be unlawful.

13.
Cancellation of Transactions

You may cancel your Transaction for a full refund (a) within 30 minutes of authorizing your Transaction or (b) at any time thereafter if the Transaction Amount has not yet been converted in accordance with your order.

14.
Fees

Transaction Fees.
We charge a fee on every Transaction.
Fees relating to the Transaction are fully visible to you before you accept the Transaction.
Further information on our fees are published on the Service Website (https://wise.com/support/customer/portal/articles/1923639-pricing-for-transfers-from-usd).
The Transaction Fee is deducted from the Transaction Amount prior to conversion.
Transaction Fees do not include any fees that your bank or the Recipientâs bank may charge.
Those fees may be deducted from your deposit (in the case of your bank) or the delivered amount (in the case of Recipientâs bank).


Administration Fee.
An Administration Fee may be incurred when your Transaction is refused due to incorrect payment details, regulatory requirements or any other reason.
(This fee is in addition to any amount your bank or the Recipientâs bank may assess.) Any Administration Fee will be deducted from your Transaction Amount.
Our current Administration Fee for Refused Transactions is 8.00 USD per Transaction.


15.
Service Providers

We use agents and service providers to help us deliver the Service to you.
For example, Wise manages the Service on our behalf as our service provider.
Among other functions, Wise provides customer service and other functions and arranges delivery of funds to Recipient abroad.
Wise is registered in the United Kingdom as a money service business by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and is a licensed Payments Institution under the prudential supervision of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
Regardless, all services provided by Wise or other agents or service providers are performed at our direction and subject to our supervision and control.

16.
Errors and Compromised User Credentials

Once Transactions have been executed, they cannot be reversed, and, except as expressly set out in this Agreement, we will not be liable in any way for any loss you suffer as a result of a Transaction being carried out in accordance with your instructions.
If you believe there to be an error in connection with a Transaction or other problem as set out in this Section 15, then you should notify Wise Support through our Help Center or 1-888-908-3833.



If you think there has been an error or problem with your transfer, you must contact Wise Support no later than 180 days of the date we promised to you that the funds would be made available to the Recipient.
When you do, please tell us as much of the following information as possible: (1) Your name and address.
(2) The error or problem with the transfer, and why you believe it is an error or problem.
(3) The name of the person receiving the funds, and if you know it, his or her telephone number or address.
(4) The dollar amount of the transfer.
and (5) The confirmation code or number of the transaction.


The law generally requires us to investigate and determine whether an error occurred within 45 days after you contact us, but typically we will conduct this investigation and make a determination within ten business days.
We will inform you of our determination within three business days after completing our investigation.
If we decide that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation.
You may ask for copies of any documents we used in our investigation.


If your Transaction history shows Transactions that you did not initiate, please contact Wise Support at once to let us know.
Wise Support must hear from you no later than sixty days after the date we make available to you the periodic statement in which the error appears.
If you do not tell Wise Support, you may not get back any of the money you lost after the 60 days, if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the money had you told us in time.


Tell Wise Support at ONCE if you believe your user credentials have been compromised.
Telephoning is the best way of keeping any losses to a minimum.
Compromise of your credentials could allow thieves to access Your Bank Account to make unauthorized payments.
If you notify Wise Support within two Business Days, you can lose no more than $50 if someone uses your use credentials without your permission.
If you do NOT tell us within two Business Days after you learn of the compromise of your credentials, and we can prove we could have stopped someone from using your credentials without your permission if you had told us, you could lose as much as $500.


If a good reason (such as a long trip or a hospital stay) kept you from telling us, we may extend the time periods set out in this Section 15.


17.
âBusiness Day"

âBusiness Day" for purposes of this Agreement means any day, other than a Saturday, Sunday, federal or New York state holiday, on which the Bankâs offices are open for business.

18.

If, through no fault of ours, you do not have enough money in Your Bank Account or have not timely deposited sufficient funds with us to make the Transaction.

For errors made by you or a Recipient, such as making a transfer to an unintended person or transferring an unintended amount;
For errors by your bank, such as the provision of incorrect bank account information for Your Bank Account.

For losses or damage arising from your misuse or inability to use the Service Website, whether due to reasons within our control or not.
