6.
Disputes &amp.
Arbitration
If you have a dispute with Dharati Whole Foods, you agree to contact us first and attempt to work it out amicably.


For residents of the United States, you agree to the following mandatory arbitration provisions:
Mandatory Arbitration: If weâre unable to work out a solution amicably, both you and Dharati Whole Foods agree to final and binding arbitration as the sole method of resolving any disputes, claims, or causes of actions arising out of your use of the Services or these Terms.
CLASS ACTION WAIVER: TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE ACTION, OR NON-PAGA REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING (COLLECTIVELY âCLASS ACTION WAIVERâ).
THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS OR ENGAGE IN ANY CLASS ARBITRATION.
YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND Dharati Whole Foods ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
In any lawsuit in which (1) the complaint is filed as a class action, collective action or non-PAGA representative action.
and (2) the civil court of competent jurisdiction in which the complaint was filed finds the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable (and such finding is confirmed by appellate review if review is sought), the Class Action Waiver shall be severable from this Agreement and in such instances, the class action, collective action and/or non-PAGA representative action must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not as a class, collective or non-PAGA representative arbitration.
PAGA WAIVER: TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, THERE WILL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT, HEARD, OR ARBITRATED ON A GROUP BASIS OR IN ANY ACTION IN WHICH A PARTY SEEKS TO REPRESENT OTHER INDIVIDUAL(S) IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION (âPAGA WAIVERâ).
PAGA CLAIMS MAY ONLY BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.
In any lawsuit in which (1) the complaint is filed as a private attorney general action seeking to represent any individual(s) other than the named plaintiff.
and (2) the civil court of competent jurisdiction in which the complaint was filed finds the PAGA Waiver is unenforceable (and such finding is confirmed by appellate review if review is sought), the PAGA Waiver shall be severable from this Agreement and in such instances, the private attorney general action must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not as a private attorney general arbitration.
Notwithstanding any other clause contained in this Agreement, any claim that all or part of the Class Action Waiver or PAGA Waiver is invalid, unenforceable, unconscionable, void or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.
The Class Action Waiver and PAGA Waiver shall be severable when a dispute is filed as an individual action and severance is necessary to ensure that the individual action proceeds in arbitration.
Opt-out of Mandatory Arbitration: You can decline this mandatory arbitration provision within 30 days of accepting these Terms by emailing us at support@dharatiwholefoods.com with your first and last name and stating your intent to opt-out of the arbitration provision.
Note that opting out of this arbitration provision does not affect any other part of these Terms, including the provisions regarding controlling law or in which courts any disputes must be brought.
Arbitration Procedures and Location: The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS under its Comprehensive Rules in effect at the time the arbitration demand is made.
The current rules, effective July 1, 2014, can be found here: http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/.
JAMS arbitration rules can be found here: http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-clauses/.
In the event of any conflict between the rules and this Agreement, this Agreement shall apply.
The Parties agree to submit to the jurisdiction of a single neutral arbitrator selected in accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive Rules.
The arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or work, San Francisco, California, or any other location we mutually agree upon in writing.
Arbitration Fees: The JAMS rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees and each party will be responsible for their own fees under those rules.
However, Dharati Whole Foods will pay for your reasonable arbitration fees for claims: (a) where the claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, and (b) are not frivolous under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b).
Dharati Whole Foods will not seek attorneys' fees or costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b).
Exceptions to Mandatory Arbitration: Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above.
For such claims, both parties agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in Santa Clara County, California.

These Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflicts of laws principles.
Any claims arising out of or relating to these Terms or use of the Services that are not subject to Section 7 (Disputes &amp.

Entire Agreement &amp.
Severability
