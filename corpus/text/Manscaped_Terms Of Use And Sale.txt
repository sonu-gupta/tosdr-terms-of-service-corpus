Any cause of action or claim you may have arising out of or relating to the Terms or the Site, including the purchase of MANSCAPED products must be commenced within one year after the claim or cause of action arises.

17.
Arbitration and Class Action Waiver.

A.
Initial Dispute Resolution.
We are available at support@manscaped.com to address any concerns you may have regarding the Site or any purchases you make of our products.
Most concerns may be quickly resolved in this manner.
You and we agree to use best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.
B.
Agreement to Binding Arbitration.
If we do not reach a solution within 30 days from the time we begin informal dispute resolution, then either party may initiate binding arbitration.
All claims arising out of or relating to the Terms (including their formation, performance and breach), the partiesâ relationship with each other and/or your use of the Site shall be finally settled by binding individual arbitration administered on a confidential basis by JAMS, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class arbitration.
Each party will have the right to use legal counsel in connection with arbitration at its own expense.
The parties shall select a single neutral arbitrator.
The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of the Terms, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of the Terms is void or voidable.
The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.
The arbitratorâs award shall be in writing and provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions, shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
The interpretation and enforcement of the Terms shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act.
The JAMS rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at jamsadr.com/adr-rules-procedures.
If you initiate arbitration, to the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds Two Hundred and Fifty U.S.
Dollars ($250.00), we will pay the additional cost.
If we are required to pay the additional cost of the filing fees, you should submit a request for payment of fees to JAMS along with your form for initiating the arbitration, and we will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to JAMS.
We will also be responsible for paying all other arbitration costs arising in connection with the arbitration.
You will not be required to pay fees and costs incurred by MANSCAPED if you do not prevail in arbitration.
The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.
They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.
C.
Class Action and Class Arbitration Waiver.
You and MANSCAPED further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in your respective individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and you and MANSCAPED each expressly waive your respective right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis.
If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver in this paragraph is void or unenforceable or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision in this section shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.
D.
Exception - Small Claims Court Claims.
Notwithstanding the partiesâ agreement to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that courtâs jurisdiction.
E.
30 Day Right to Opt Out.
You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth in Sections 15(B), 15(C), and 15(D) by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following email: legal@manscaped.com.
The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of creation of an account or placing your first order with us.
otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those sections.
If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, we also will not be bound by them.
NO CLASS ACTIONS 
TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PURSUE DISPUTES ON A CONSOLIDATED OR CLASSWIDE BASIS.
THAT IS, TO EITHER JOIN A CLAIM WITH THE CLAIM OF ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY, OR ASSERT A CLAIM IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF ANYONE ELSE IN ANY LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION, OR OTHER PROCEEDING.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER, YOU MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
