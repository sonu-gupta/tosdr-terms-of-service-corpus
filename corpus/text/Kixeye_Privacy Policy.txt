By using the Services, you consent to the transfer of your Personal Data and non-personal data to the United States and other countries which may not offer the same level of privacy protections as the laws in your country of residence or citizenship.

You may at any time access or correct your Personal Data, restrict collection or processing of your Personal Data, and in some cases, request the deactivation or permanent deletion of your Personal Data.

and EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield Principles issued by the U.S.
Department of Commerce, both available at https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework (the âPrivacy Shield Principlesâ), or (ii) the Standard Contractual Clauses

KIXEYE Inc.

On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union issued a judgment declaring as âinvalidâ the European Commissionâs Decision (EU) 2016/1250 of 12 July 2016 on the adequacy of the protection provided by the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield.
As a result of that decision, the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework is no longer a valid mechanism to comply with EU data protection requirements when transferring personal data from the European Union to the United States.
The U.S.
Department of Commerce and the European Commission are discussing the potential for an enhanced EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework to comply with the July 16, 2020 decision by the CJEU.
The Department of Commerce is continuing to administer the Privacy Shield program while those discussions proceed.
On September 8, 2020 the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) of Switzerland issued an opinion concluding that the Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework does not provide an adequate level of protection for data transfers from Switzerland to the United States pursuant to Switzerlandâs Federal Act on Data Protection (FADP).
In the interim, in addition to adhering to the Privacy Shield principles, KIXEYE using/relying upon (existing or implementing) the Standard Contractual Clauses with its data processing partners, and it is actively reviewing the operational adequacy of its technical security measures, internal privacy and security protocols to evaluate what, if any, additional safeguards are appropriate with respect to Personal Data.
However, in parallel with these good faith steps by KIXEYE, by using the Services you are consenting to, and accepting the risks associated with the transfer of your Personal Data and non-personal data to the United States and other countries which may not offer the same level of privacy protections as the laws in your country of residence or citizenship.

and other foreign governmental agencies and authorities, or otherwise, in accordance with applicable local laws including local laws authorizing mass and/or covert digital surveillance.
