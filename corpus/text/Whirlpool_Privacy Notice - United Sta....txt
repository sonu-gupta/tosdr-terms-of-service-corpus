You may provide your Personal Information in a variety of situations, including when you sign up for a Whirlpool account, contact us, sign up to receive communications from us, purchase a product or service, submit your product registration, submit a customer service request, enter a sweepstakes or contest entry, provide us feedback or survey responses, or otherwise use any of the Services.
Personal Information you provide may include:

Usage Information.
Whirlpool, our business partners, and our service providers may use technologies that collect information about how you interact with our Services, emails, advertising, and content (âUsage Informationâ).
