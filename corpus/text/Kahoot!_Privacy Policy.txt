WHAT IS KAHOOT?

Kahoot provides a game-based learning tool that can be played through most web browsers (at http://kahoot.it) and through our App.
A Kahoot game (referred to as a âKahootâ) consists of players answering multiple-choice questions presented on the screen of the user who hosts the particular game or, in un-hosted games, on the screens of the participants in the particular game itself.

PERSONAL INFORMATION

âPersonal Informationâ is information that identifies an individual or relates to an identifiable person, including:

Name
Email address (required)
Date of birth (required for students and social users)
Company or organization (of work-related users)
Financial information (required when signing up for Kahoot Plus âthe Paid Subscriptionsâ)
School or university (of students and teachers)
Biographical information (for teachers who elect to provide it)
Chosen username and password for Kahoot account (required)
Profile picture
Your interests (such as arts, biology, chemistry, history, music, law etc.)
Your teaching level, if you are a teacher (such as kindergarten, grade level, higher education, etc.)

We need to collect and process Personal Information marked as ârequiredâ in order to provide the requested Services to you, or because we are legally required to do so.
If you do not provide the information that we request, we may not be able to provide the requested Services.
If you submit any Personal Information relating to other people to us or to our service providers in connection with the Services, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Personal information we collect

We do not collect any Personal Information from a person who merely plays a Kahoot except if you participate in a Kahoot! which is hosted using the Player Identifier feature.
Further information regarding Player Identifier is included below.
In order to be able to create and host a Kahoot, however, a user (âaccountholderâ) must create an account at https://create.kahoot.it/account/register/ or through our App.
As described in more detail below, we may collect, use and disclose Personal Information from adult accountholders.
An âadult accountholderâ is a U.S.
user who is age 13 or older or a user from outside the U.S.
who is age 16 or older.
Our information practices are different with respect to younger users.
Specifically, when a U.S.
user who is under the age of 13 or a user from outside the U.S.
who is under the age of 16 creates an account (a âchild accountholderâ), we collect his or her email address only for the purpose of providing password reminders to him or her.
We collect no other Personal Information from child accountholders, and we immediately and permanently alter the email address such that it can only be used as a password reminder and cannot be reconstructed into its original form or used to contact the child accountholder.
Kahoot also collects a user name and password from child accountholders, which are used for login purposes only.

Player Identifier

Player Identifier is a game option that allows a host to track progress and scores of the players who have permitted you to do so.
By default, the Player Identifier is toggled off, but can be enabled if your payment plan permits use of Player Identifier.
Player Identifier enables the host, and Kahoot!, to see the email address linked with the nickname of the player as well as the Kahoot! answers provided by such players.
If you are a participant in a Player Identifier enabled Kahoot!, you accept that your nickname and email address or any other Personal Information requested by the host are connected and your answers being visible for the host (e.g.
your employee number and your last name).
This means that when you participate in a Player Identifier game, both Kahoot! and your host can see and store the email address or any other Personal Information you have connected with your nickname, as well as your Kahoot! answers.
We process your Personal Information for the purpose of providing the Player Identifier functionality to the host.
The Personal Information will not be visible for other players during or after the game.
Please note that the host using Player Identifier feature is the data controller of all personal data provided by the players in the hostâs Kahoot! and therefore responsible for ensuring that such personal data is lawfully collected and processed in accordance with applicable legislation.
Kahoot! will only act as a data processor with respect to any such personal data and will process and store this data on behalf of the host.
The host is responsible for ensuring that any collection and processing of personal data from participants in a Player Identifier enabled game is carried out in accordance with applicable law, including e.g.
having obtained consent from the participant, if required.

OTHER INFORMATION

Other Information We Collect

âOther Informationâ is any information that does not reveal your specific identity or does not directly relate to an individual, such as:

Browser and device information
App usage data
Information collected through cookies, pixel tags and other technologies
Demographic information and other information provided by you
Aggregated information

If we are required to treat Other Information as Personal Information under applicable law, then we may use it for the purposes for which we use and disclose Personal Information as detailed in this Policy.

How We Collect Other Information

We and our third party service providers collect Other Information in a variety of ways, including:

Through your browser or device: Certain information is collected by most browsers or automatically through your device, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, language, Internet browser type and version and the name and version of the Services (such as the App) you are using.
We use this information to ensure that the Services function properly.

Through your use of the App: When you download and use the App, we and our service providers may track and collect App usage data, such as the date and time the App on your device accesses our servers and what information has been downloaded to the App based on your device number.

Using cookies: Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on the computer that you are using.
Cookies allow us to collect information such as browser type, time spent on the Services, pages visited, language preferences, and other anonymous traffic data.
We and our service providers use the information only to support the internal operations of the Services, such as for security purposes, to facilitate navigation, to display information more effectively, to personalize your experience while using the Services and to recognize your computer in order to assist your use of the Services.
We also gather statistical information about use of the Services in order to continually improve their design and functionality, understand how they are used and assist us with resolving questions regarding them.
If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies or be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer to your computer of a particular cookie (or cookies) from a particular site.
You may also wish to refer to http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html.
If, however, you do not accept cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of the Services.
For example, we may not be able to recognize your computer, and you may need to log in every time you visit.

Using pixel tags and other similar technologies: Pixel tags (also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) may be used in connection with some Services to, among other things, track the actions of users of the Services (including adult accountholders that may receive emails from us), measure the success of marketing campaigns and compile statistics about usage of the Services and response rates.

Analytics: We use third parties, including Google Analytics, which use cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information about use of the Services and report on activities and trends.

An IP address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user accesses the Services, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited.
Collecting IP addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites, applications and other services.
We use IP addresses for the purposes of providing support for the internal operations of the Services, such as calculating usage levels, diagnosing server problems, and administering the Services.
We may also derive your approximate, general, location from your IP address.

From you: Information such as communications preference may be collected from adult accountholders when they voluntarily provide it.

By aggregating information: Aggregated Personal Information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Services.

How We Use and Disclose Other Information

In some instances, we may combine Other Information with Personal Information.
If we do, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information as long as it is combined.

We do not knowingly seek or collect Personal Information from users under the age of 13 (for U.S.
users) or 16 (for non-U.S.
users).
If we determine we have inadvertently gathered Personal Information from users under the age of 13 (for U.S.
users) or 16 (for non-U.S.
users), we will promptly delete any and all such Personal Information from our records.
We and our service providers collect information that is reasonably necessary to support the internal operations of the Kahoot! Service, as described below.
When a user who is under the age of 13 (for U.S.

To permit the child accountholder to use the Services, we also collect a username and password, which are used for login purposes only.
We and our service providers collect the information described above, under âOther Information,â from child accountholders.
however, we restrict the use of persistent identifiers for children accountholders.
Specifically, we utilize pseudonymous identifiers to understand, among other things, the volume of unique users using our Services, and we limit the geolocation information that we collect to no more precise than a city-wide area.
Our collection persistent identifiers from child accountholders does not allow us to identify, contact or create a profile of such users.
The Childrenâs Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (U.S.), the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (U.S.), the General Data Protection Regulation (E.U.) and other data privacy laws have been established to protect the privacy of minors.
We take our compliance obligations under such laws, and the privacy of our users generally, very seriously.

In your request, please include your name and your childâs Kahoot! username and specify the action you would like us to take.
For your childâs protection, we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request.
