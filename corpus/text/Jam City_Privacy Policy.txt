Cookies, Pixel Tags/Web Beacons, Analytics Information, Mobile Device Identifiers, and Interest-Based Advertising

We, as well as third parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on the Services, may use cookies, pixel tags, local storage, and other technologies (âTechnologiesâ) to automatically collect information through the Services.
Technologies are essentially small data files placed on your computer, tablet, mobile phone, or other devices that allow us to record certain pieces of information whenever you visit or interact with our Services.

Cookies.
Cookies are small text files placed in visitorsâ device browsers to store their preferences.
Most browsers allow you to block and delete cookies.
However, if you do that, the Services may not work properly.

Pixel Tags/Web Beacons.
A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is a piece of code embedded on the Services that collects information about usersâ engagement on that web page.
The use of a pixel allows us to record, for example, that a user has visited a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement.
We may also include web beacons in e-mails to understand whether messages have been opened, acted on, or forwarded.

Mobile Device Identifiers.
We may share the advertising identifier associated with your mobile device or tablet (such as the Apple IDFA and Google Advertising ID) with advertisers.
An advertising identifier is an alphanumeric string that can be used to identify your device so that advertisers can serve relevant ads to you.
We use the Apple IDFA only as permitted by Apple, and we use the Google Advertising ID only as permitted by Google.
An advertising identifier is assigned, and ad tracking is turned on, by default on your mobile device.
You may limit the use of or reset your advertising device ID using the privacy settings on your mobile device.
In some cases, you may need to reset the operating system to reset the advertising device ID.

Analytics.
We may also use Google Analytics to collect information regarding visitor behavior and visitor demographics on our Services.

You may stop or restrict the placement of Technologies on your device or remove them by adjusting your preferences as your browser or device permits.
Please note that cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on mobile applications.

In addition, for some devices you may use your deviceâs platform controls in your settings to exercise choice (e.g., Android, iOS, and others).
You may also email us at ccpaoptout@jamcity.com and we will do our best to assist you with your request.
The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt out of receiving targeted ads from data partners and other advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs.

17.
DISPUTE RESOLUTION &amp.
ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.
Please read this section following section carefully as it limits the manner in which we can seek relief from each other.&nbsp.
This Section 17 only applies to you if you are a resident of the United States or if you commence any action against Company in the United States.


Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes.
We each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Software or User Submissions (collectively, âDisputesâ) will be resolved solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding.
You and Company agree that the U.S.
Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement, and that you and Company are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.
This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.

Exceptions and Opt-out.
As limited exceptions to Section 17(a) above: (i) you may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies.
and (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.
In addition, you
will retain the right to opt out of arbitration entirely and litigate any Dispute if you provide us with written notice of your desire to do so
by email at legal@jamcity.com within thirty (30) days following the date you first agree to this Agreement.


Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules.
The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ) in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules&nbsp.
(the âAAA Rulesâ) then in effect, except as modified by this Dispute Resolution section.&nbsp.
The AAA Rules are available on the AAA website and are hereby incorporated by reference.
The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state where the arbitration hearing is to be conducted, and will be selected by the parties from the AAAâs roster of consumer dispute arbitrators.&nbsp.
If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.&nbsp.
A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules.



Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you live, unless we both agree to a different location.
The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement.

Arbitration Costs.
Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
If you initiate the arbitration, the only fee you will be required to pay is a non-refundable $200 filing fee.&nbsp.
If we prevail in arbitration weâll pay all of our attorneysâ fees and costs and wonât seek to recover them from you.
If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneysâ fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.
Class Action Waiver.&nbsp.
YOU AND COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.&nbsp.
Further, if the partiesâ dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another personâs claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.&nbsp.
If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.
Effect of Changes on Arbitration.
If Company changes any of the terms of this Section 17 âDispute Resolutionâ after the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to legal@jamcity.com) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the âLast Updatedâ date above or in the date of Companyâs email to you notifying you of such change.
By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Company in accordance with the terms of this Section 17 âDispute Resolutionâ as of the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement).
Severability.
With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 17(e) of this Agreement (âClass Action Waiverâ), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement will still apply.


18.
GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE.&nbsp.
Disputes will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, federal arbitration law, and the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions.&nbsp.
Except as otherwise expressly set forth in Section 17 âDispute Resolution,â you agree that the California state and U.S.&nbsp.
federal courts located in the County of Los Angeles shall have exclusive jurisdiction over all Disputes that you and Company are not required to arbitrate and you agree to the venue of such courts.

19.
FORCE MAJEURE. Company shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside the reasonable control of Company, including without limitation any failure to perform hereunder due to unforeseen circumstances or cause beyond Companyâs control such as acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, strikes, or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials.
