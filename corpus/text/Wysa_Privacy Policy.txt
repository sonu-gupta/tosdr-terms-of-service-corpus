 What Data do We collect and how do We Use it?




How do We handle Your Personal Data?

No identifiable information is solicited or stored in the Wysa app.
As data is not
related to an identifier or identifiable natural person, it will no longer be
Personal
data or Special Category of Personal data.
There is no user registration nor are You
asked to share Personal data when You install and use the Wysa App and Services.We
collect, transfer and securely store the unique vendor specific ID provided by the
Apple App Store or Android Play store when You install Wysa App on Your device.
This
is done for the purpose of generating a random pseudonymised user identifier.
This
pseudonymised identifier generated becomes the userId that is referred to for all
subsequent data transfers and linking Your data within the Wysa databases.
This
processing is based on Our Legitimate Interest.
Refer here to understand how
we protect Your data.


If Wysa App is integrated with Your Institution system, Your Institution may
securely share a unique random user identifier with Us.
This random identifier is
processed by Us on behalf of Your Institution for the purpose of accurately linking
You with Your provided data when You repeatedly access the Institution System and
the Wysa App and to provide the agreed analytics with Your Institution.
This processing will be based on Your Institutions contract
with Us.

If You inadvertently share any personal identifier such as full name, dates,
locations,
phone numbers, email identifiers or medical terms during Your conversation with the
Wysa
App and Services, it is Our responsibility to redact such personal identifiers to
make
the data non-personal.
To ensure that no personal identifiers get stored in Our
systems,
We have developed a high recall AI-NLP algorithm that detects and irreversibly
redacts
identifiers, which include all numbers more than 2 digits, urls, emails, dates,
locations, names and medicalized terms, from Our storage systems.
Within 24 hours of
starting Your session, Our algorithms will process Your data, detect any personal
identifiers and irreversibly redact them.
None of Your conversation messages will be
lost, and only the specific personal identifier will be irreversibly redacted in Our
systems.
You can view
such
obfuscation in the Journey tab within the Wysa App.
This obfuscation processing is
based
on Our Legitimate Interest.
This is to ensure that no personal identifier and hence
no
Personal data inadvertently creeps into Our system and Wysa App is able to maintain
complete anonymity.

You can always write to Us at the contact provided here.
if You want to
clarify, rectify or delete specific personal data that You shared with Us.

also
read Your data protection rights here.

user-centered
mental wellbeing best practices globally.

encrypted
during transmission and storage.

levels.

population-level research and statistical purposes as per Our Legitimate Interest (here of this Policy).

is voluntary and You can opt to not report any of the assessments.

the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD7) - to self-report any symptoms of
anxiety, and the Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS)- to self-report
the intensity of distress currently experienced.

If Wysa App is integrated with Your Institution system, Your Institution may additionally
share Your PHQ9 and GAD7 score, that Your Institution may collect, with Us.
This screening
data is processed by Us on behalf of Your Institution for the purpose of understanding Your
emotional Well-being, providing You the necessary Well-being tools and techniques and to
provide the agreed analytics with Your Institution.
This processing will
be based on Your Institutions contract with Us.

You will also be asked to share how You cope with day to day activities as part of the
assessments.
Assessments are a proven way to baseline and track the progress of Your
self-reported symptoms.
Processing of Your assessment response is based on Our Agreement
and used for the purpose of determining if escalation is required and to provide You
access to scientific-evidence based tools and techniques to manage emotions and
encourage mental well-being in a self-help context.
YOUR RESPONSES TO THESE ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS ARE NOT PROCESSED TO FORM A DIAGNOSTIC
OPINION NOR PROCESSED FOR ANY MEDICAL PURPOSES OR FOR GIVING CLINICAL ADVICE.
We DO NOT
collect or process Your sensitive medical data or Protected Health data (PHI), as
defined under the US law, that can directly or indirectly Identify You.
We use Your
anonymized assessment scores for population-level research and statistical purposes as
per Our Legitimate Interest (here of this Policy).We apply
