California Residents: Your California Privacy Rights Under the laws of the State of California (US), California Residents who have an established business relationship with us may choose to opt out of our disclosure of personal information about them to third parties for direct marketing purposes.
As detailed above, our policy is not to disclose personal information collected online to a third party for direct marketing purposes without your approval.
If you choose to opt-out at any time after granting approval, email privacyofficer@pikpok.com.
In September 2013, California enacted amendments to the California Online Privacy Protection Act (California Business &amp.
Professions Code Â§Â§22575-22579) which require operators of websites to disclose how they respond to âdo not trackâ (DNT) signals from browsers used by consumers or other mechanisms that provide consumers a choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable information about the consumerâs online activities over time and across different websites or online services.
While some newer browsers have incorporated âDo Not Trackâ features which, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the web sites you visit indicating that you do not wish your online activity to be tracked, a DNT protocol that can be implemented across multiple devices and sites has not yet been widely adopted.
Currently, our computer system does not support, and cannot act on DNT signal headers that we may receive.
accordingly, the choices that we provide you concerning out collection and use of personally identifiable information will continue to operate as described in this policy.
PikPok complies with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).
This was enacted in 2018 and takes effect on January 1, 2020.
This landmark piece of legislation secures new privacy rights for California consumers.
