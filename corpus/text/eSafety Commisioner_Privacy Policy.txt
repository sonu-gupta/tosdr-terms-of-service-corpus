Collection
eSafety usually collects personal information (including sensitive information) from you or your authorised representative in order to undertake a regulatory action, such as assess a complaint or manage a report, or for activities consistent with a regulatory function.

eSafety uses this information to improve the eSafety website, receive feedback from the community and increase engagement with you.
Use and disclosure

  Privacy policy The eSafety Commissioner is responsible for promoting online safety for all Australians.
This policy describes how the eSafety Commissioner and staff assisting her (eSafety) handles, manages and protects personal information.
The Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (the Privacy Act) contains 13 Australian Privacy Principles (the APPs) that regulate how private sector organisations and government agencies collect, use, disclose, hold and de-identify or destroy personal information, and how individuals may request to access and correct their personal information.
The Privacy Act defines personal information as information or an opinion about an identified individual or an individual who is reasonably identifiable.
It also defines sensitive information, which is a subset of personal information that is generally afforded a higher level of protection than personal information.
This includes health information and information relating to a personâs racial or ethnic origin and sexual orientation or practices.
The eSafety Commissioner is covered by the Privacy Act.
Collection of personal information
Purposes of collection
eSafety collects personal information if it is reasonably necessary for, or directly related to, one or more of the eSafety Commissionerâs functions or activities.

The main reasons we would collect personal information would be to:


handle a complaint or manage a report
provide education
conduct communication and awareness campaigns
run our website, or
correspond and engage with you through newsletters and social media.

How personal information is collected
eSafety collects personal information by lawful and fair means.
eSafety usually collects personal information directly from you, for example, when you provide us your details in relation to a complaint or report through an enquiry form.

However, eSafety may obtain information about you from third parties in certain circumstances, including where:


the eSafety Commissioner is required or authorised by law, for example, obtaining information for the purposes of handling a complaint or report (from a complainant, parent, guardian or school)
the eSafety Commissioner has your consent to do so, or
it is not reasonably practicable to collect the information from you.

Kinds of personal information collected and held
eSafety collects personal information to enable us to carry out our regulatory functions and activities.
Complaints and reports
eSafety investigates complaints in relation to cyberbullying and in relation to offensive and illegal content.
It also manages complaints in relation to image-based abuse.
The kinds of personal information collected in order to investigate these complaints and reports varies between the schemes, but generally includes:

your name (you may choose to make some complaints and reports anonymously)
your contact details (unless you choose not to provide your name)
your images
whether you reside or are a business in Australia, and/or
a URL that may lead to images that are personal information.

Personal information collected may also relate to the person making the complaint or report or to other parties involved, including the person alleged to have posted the material.
Investigating complaints and managing reports may require eSafety to collect sensitive information about you.
This will only occur if you have consented or if the collection is otherwise permitted under the Privacy Act or the Enhancing Online Safety Act 2015.
Procurement
eSafety collects and holds personal information as part of our procurement processes.
This includes the names and contact details of tenderers or contracting parties and is done to ensure we comply with the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (the PGPA Act) and the Commonwealth Procurement Rules.
More information on the PGPA Act and the Commonwealth Procurement Rules is available at the Department of Financeâs PGPA associated instruments and policies page.
Public consultation and engagement
eSafety engages with the public and our stakeholders through a number of mediums, including consultations, surveys, conferences and forums.
When eSafety undertakes formal consultation, the documentation will make clear the purpose of the consultation and the purpose of the collection of personal information.
Generally, eSafety publishes the submissions we receive, including any personal information, unless otherwise claimed as confidential.
If you wish to make a submission anonymously or through the use of a pseudonym, you should contact eSafety to see whether it is practicable to do so.
Each confidentiality claim is assessed by eSafety on a case-by-case basis.
Use of services
eSafety collects and holds personal information used to register for a service, such as an online safety program or newsletter subscription.

For example, with your consent, we might provide relevant information (like the location of the image) to the content host identified in your report to get the image taken down or use a tool that allows us to search whether your image is available in certain other locations online.
Part 9 of the Enhancing Online Safety Act permits the eSafety Commissioner to disclose information in certain circumstances and with certain conditions, including to an authority of a foreign country responsible for regulating matters relating to online safety for children, provided it is not prohibited by Part 13 of the Telecommunications Act 1997.
The eSafety Commissioner may also disclose information to an authority if satisfied that the information will enable or assist the authority to perform or exercise any of the authorityâs functions or powers, provided the information was obtained as a result of a function or power conferred on the eSafety Commissioner under the Enhancing Online Safety Act or the Broadcasting Services Act.
