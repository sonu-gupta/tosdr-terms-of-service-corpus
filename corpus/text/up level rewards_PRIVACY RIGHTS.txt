RIGHTS OF CALIFORNIA USERS WITH REGARD TO
THEIR INFORMATION





California users have several rights regarding
the collection, use, disclosure, and sale of their information under the CCPA.
One of these rights, notice of collection of Information, is described above.
the balance of these rights are described below and include the following
rights:





Disclosure of information collected and sold
Opt-out from the sale of Information
Deletion of Information
Access and portability of Information collected
Non-discrimination


Exercising Your Rights, Verification, and
Timing. To exercise your
CCPA rights, click on the âDo Not Sell MyPersonal Infoâ link on the bottom
of the Website page where we collect Information, or send an email to help@myprivacyrequest.com.
To prevent an unauthorized third party from
accessing or making decisions regarding a userâs Information, we verify all
requests to exercise these rights (a verifiable consumer request).
We do not
charge a fee to process or respond to a verifiable consumer request unless it
is excessive, repetitive, unfounded, or abusive.




In general, we will verify a request by
matching the identifying information supplied by the user with the Information
we already have for the user.
If we cannot verify the user using the foregoing
method, we may request additional information, which we will not retain or use
for any other purpose.




For all verifiable consumer requests, we
strive to respond within forty-five (45) days of receipt.
If we require
additional time, which can be up to ninety (90) days in the aggregate, we will
provide written notice.
Any disclosures we provide will cover only the 12-month
period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt and will be
delivered electronically in a secure fashion.
If, for some reason, we cannot
fulfill or comply with your request, our response will explain that
decision. 





Disclosure of Information Collected and Sold. While users have the right to request
different levels of disclosure regarding the collection, use, disclosure, and
sale of Information, we have elected to treat all requests from California
residents as an exercise of expanded disclosure requests by businesses that
sell Information.
Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request,
we will disclose to you for the 12 months prior to your request:





The categories and sources of Information collected;
Our business and commercial purposes for collecting and selling that Information;
The categories of third parties with whom we shared that Information;
The specific pieces of Information collected;
If we sold or disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, we will disclose:
For sales - the Information categories for each category sold and the categories of third parties to whom the Information was sold.
and
For disclosures - the Information categories for each category disclosed and the categories of third parties to whom the Information was disclosed. 






Right to Opt-Out. Users have the right to opt-out from the sale
of their Information.
We provide a âDo Not Sell My Personal Infoâ link on each
Website page where we collect Information that links to an online request form.
You can access the form here or you can send an email to help@myprivacyrequest.com and elect to opt-out from the sale of
your Information.&nbsp.
We reserve the right to verify all opt-out requests
using the methods described above. 




While our agreements with third parties to
whom we sell or disclose Information prohibit the further sale or use beyond
the scope of our agreement with them, if a California user opts-out, we will
notify all third parties to whom we have sold or disclosed the California
userâs Information within the previous 90 days and remind them not to further
sell the Information.
We will not ask a California user who has opted out to
re-opt-in for one year after the California user opts-out.
If the user requests
a transaction with us that requires the sale of their Information, we will
inform them that they have opted out and if they want to proceed with the
transaction, we will offer the opportunity to opt-in by completing a two-step
process.





Deletion of Information.
You have the right to request that we delete
any of your Information that we collected from you, subject to certain
exceptions.
Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request using
the process set forth above, we will delete or deidentify (and direct our
service providers, vendors, and other applicable third parties to delete) your
Information from our system other than from our archive servers (which we maintain
for compliance purposes), unless there is an applicable exception.  




We may decline to process your deletion
request if the Information is necessary for us or our service providers,
vendors, or other applicable third parties for a number of reasons.
For
example, we may decline your deletion request if the Information is required
to:





Complete the transaction for which we collected the Information or provide the goods or services you requested;
Detect security incidents, protect, investigate and respond to malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities;
Identify and correct errors that negatively impact intended functionality.
and
Comply with a legal obligation, including Federal and/or State tax liability and reporting.

If we do not comply with a deletion request,
we will provide the grounds for our denial.





Access and Portability. California users have the right to access the
Information we have collected about them in the previous twelve (12) months.
Upon receipt of verified consumer request, we will provide the information in a
readily usable format.
You cannot request access more than twice in any
12-month period.  





Nondiscrimination. We are committed not to discriminate
against California users who exercise their CCPA rights.
As such, unless
otherwise permitted by the CCPA, we will not deny, charge you different prices
or rates, or provide a different quality level of goods or services, including
through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties, and/or
suggest that you may receive a different price, rate, or quality level of goods
or services.
While we do not provide financial incentives for users who do not
exercise their CCPA rights, please note that some of the functionality of the
Website may be unavailable if consumers exercise their rights to have their
personal information deleted.





Authorized Agent. The CCPA enables California users to
appoint an authorized agent to act on their behalf to submit disclosure requests
and or deletion requests under the CCPA.
The authorized agent must register
with the California Secretary of State.
We will honor a request from an
authorized agent provided you provide written authorization to the authorized
agent to act on your behalf and we can verify your identity and the agent
submits proof of authorization.  




CCPA Metrics. We are required to compile certain annual metrics regarding the CPPA including the number of disclosure, deletion and opt-out requests we receive, the median number of days it takes us to respond, and how many of each were denied.
The metrics for the period of 1/1/2020 from 12/31/2020 are displayed below.

information and online behavior to be tracked and used, for example, for
interest-based advertising.
As required by CalOPPA, we are required to inform

behavior when a user to one of the Website has activated the âdo-not-trackâ
setting on her/his browser.
