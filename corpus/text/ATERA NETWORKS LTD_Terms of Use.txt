7.2.
Service Fees.
Your access to and use of the Service is subject to your payment in full of the subscription and other fees according to Ateraâs then-current price list as published on the Site (âFeesâ).
You acknowledge and agree that the Fees are based on the number of Permitted Users designated in the Order Form, even if a smaller number of Permitted Users ultimately use the Service in a given Subscription Period (however, use of the Service or your Account by more Permitted Users than permitted in the Order Form may incur additional Fees, result in suspension or termination of this Agreement, your Account or access by the applicable Permitted Users or other penalties, or any combination of the above, as determined by Atera in its sole discretion).
You shall make such payments, and the Fees shall be charged, in advance of each month or year, as applicable, for which you have subscribed to the Service.
We may at any time change the Fee amounts, but such changes will not take effect until the completion of the billing cycle in which such change is made.
We will make reasonable efforts to notify you at least two weeks prior to any changes in price for the services for which you subscribe.
Failure to pay applicable Fees may result (at our sole discretion) in termination or suspension of your access and use of the Service or portions thereof.
 
7.3.
Payment Terms.
All Fees are stated, and shall be paid, in US Dollars, are non-refundable and, unless otherwise stated in the Order Form, are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties, which are your responsibility.
If you are located in a jurisdiction which requires you to deduct or withhold taxes or other amounts from any amounts due to us, you must notify us in writing.
In such a case, we reserve the right to assess the withheld amount or to increase the gross amount of the applicable payment so that, after the deduction or withholding for taxes, the net amount paid to us will not be less than the amount we would have received without the required deduction or withholding.
The available payment methods and the required payment schedule are set forth in the Order Form.
 
7.4.
Payment Processing.
The Order Form may enable you to purchase a subscription and pay the Fees online by using your credit card or other online tools or services.
If you choose to do so, such payment will be processed through a third party payment processing service, and additional terms may apply to such payments.
We currently engage a third party, BlueSnap, Inc.
(âBlueSnapâ), for online payment processing services, and in addition to these Terms, you agree that BlueSnapâs terms and conditions shall apply to your online payments of the Fees.
BlueSnapâs terms are available at www.bluesnap.com.
We reserve the right to use other third party payment processing services for such purposes in the future.
 
7.5.
Free Trial Subscription.
We may offer a free, no-obligations trial subscription of the Service (âTrial Subscriptionâ).
The Trial Subscription, if any, shall come commence on the date that you commence access or use of, as applicable, the Service and will conclude at the end of the trial period displayed on the Order Form, or sooner if: (i) you upgrade your subscription by beginning to pay the applicable fees for the Service, or (ii) your use of the Service is terminated in accordance with these Terms.
You acknowledge and agree that these Terms are applicable and binding upon you during the Trial Subscription period and that Atera: (i) does not make any commitments in connection with the Service during the Trial Subscription period.
and (ii) may send you, subject to your opting out, communications and other notices about the Service to your email address.
We reserve the right to modify, cancel and/or limit this Trial Subscription offer at any time.

Such Updates shall be made available in Ateraâs and its Third Party Providerâs sole discretion.
 
7.7.
Web Browser requirements.
You acknowledge that use and access of the Service requires (i) a supported web browser as specified in the Documentation and, (ii) a web browser version that supports HTML5.
You are solely responsible for using a supported web browser and upgrading to the then-current minimum web browser requirements that we define from time to time.
