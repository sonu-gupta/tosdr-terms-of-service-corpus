        Honey Privacy and Security PolicyLast updated June 25, 2020A letter from our founders As users of the internet, we care about privacy just like you do.
And as fellow human beings, we think you deserve to know exactly what you can expect from your Honey experience.
Before you read our privacy policy, weâd first like to tell you how we think about privacy in simple terms.
 We do not sell your personal information.
Ever.
 Honey works by finding you the best deals.
When you buy something with a Honey coupon, promo code, or offer, the store sometimes pays us a fee.
Thatâs how we make money.
We do not need to (or want to) sell your information.
 So how do we use your data?
 First and foremost, we analyze some information on the retail website youâre on so that we can find the best coupons for that site or product.
Also, we collect limited shopping data to support the Honey community.
That means Honey members share real-time information about deals, prices, and products with the rest of the community to help everyone save time and money.
 Want to know which promo code works? Sure, another member just tested all of the codes with Honey five minutes ago.
Want to see when a product youâre interested in goes on sale? Another Honey member is helping us update the price right now.
When shoppers hunt for deals together, rather than on their own, everyone saves time and money.
 Our stance on privacy is simple: We will be transparent with what data we collect and how we use it to save you time and money, and you can decide if youâre good with that.
 If this sounds fair, then letâs start shopping smarter, together.
 P.S.
If you have any questions or comments, just email us at privacy@joinhoney.com.

 If we ever need additional personal information for a specific reason, we will tell you and ask for your permission.
Also, to the extent that Honey has links to other websites (like retailers), please note that we do not own, operate, or control them, and they have their own controlling privacy policies that you should review.
