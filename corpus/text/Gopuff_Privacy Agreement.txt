How We Use Cookies and Automatic Data Collection Tools
We also collect information, via cookies, web beacons, pixels, tags or other tracking technologies, such as your Internet Service Provider and IP address, the date and time you access our website or mobile app, the pages you accessed while visiting our
website or mobile app, and the Internet address from which you accessed our website or mobile app.
Some cookies exist only during a single session and some are persistent over multiple sessions over time.
We and our partners use these technologies to
ensure basic functionality of our website and mobile app, to remember user preferences (including regarding your preferences regarding tracking technologies), maximize the performance of our website, mobile app, and services, provide you with offers that
may be of interest to you, measure the effectiveness of our website, mobile app, and email campaigns and to personalize online content.
These cookies and other technologies may be used to track you over time and across devices.
When required by law, we
only use these tracking technologies, when you have given us your consent to do so.
To provide you with a more relevant and interesting experience, we may work with third party companies to display ads or customize the content on our website or mobile app.
These companies may use cookies and similar tracking technologies as described
in this Notice to gather information about your visits to the website or mobile app, as well as your visits elsewhere on the Internet.
These companies also may use this information to provide you with more relevant advertising known as interest-based
advertising.
For more information about third-party advertisers and how to prevent them from using your information, please visit https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/.
This is a site offered
by the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") that includes information on how consumers can opt-out from receiving interest-based advertising from some or all of NAI's members.
The Digital Advertising Alliance (âDAAâ) also offers
a choice mechanism with respect to certain types of data collection and use by third parties available at www.aboutads.info.
Opting out of interest-based advertising will not opt you out of all advertising, but
rather only interest-based advertising from us or our agents or representatives.
Similarly, asking our mobile apps not to track you/not agreeing or rejecting tracking technologies in our cookie banner/preference center/mobile app selection screen will
only opt you out of those technologies, but not all advertising.
Some browsers have incorporated Do Not Track (âDNTâ) preferences.
Most of these features, when turned on, send signals to the website you are visiting that you do not wish to
have information about your online searching and browsing activities collected and used.
As there is not yet a common agreement about how to interpret DNT signals, we do not honor DNT signals from website browsers at this time.
However, you may not accept
to/refuse or delete cookies.
If you do not accept/refuse or delete cookies, some of our website functionality may be impaired or some of the advertising served to you may not be relevant for you anymore.
If you change computers, devices, or browsers,
or use multiple computers, devices, or browsers, and delete your cookies, you may need to repeat this process for each computer, device, or browser.
Please refer to your browserâs Help instructions to learn more about how to manage cookies and the
use of other tracking technologies.
You can also find more information on managing cookies at All About Cookies - Manage Cookies.
Our websites use Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google Inc.
(âGoogleâ).
Google Analytics cookies collect your IP address.
however, because IP anonymization is used on this website, your IP address will be shortened (and
therefore anonymized) as soon as technically possible and before it is stored or otherwise used in connection with Google Analytics.
The anonymization process takes place within the European Union or the European Economic Area, except in exceptional cases,
where your full IP address may be sent to a Google server in the United States and shortened there.
We use the information collected by Google Analytics cookies to find out about how visitors use our website, to throttle request speed and for advertising
tracking.
Google will not combine the IP address sent by your browser in connection with Google Analytics with other data.
You can prevent Google Analytics cookies from being stored by setting your browser software accordingly or opting-out of Google
Analytics by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available here: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
You can also change settings regarding which cookies and tracking
technologies placed on your device you allow us and our partners to read, in our cookie preference center.
Changing these settings will not delete these cookies, but we will no longer be able to utilize them for the purposes you decided to turn off.
