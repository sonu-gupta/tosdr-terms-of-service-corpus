        Privacy PolicyLast Updated: January 1, 2020
This Privacy Policy applies only to the websites, apps, and services controlled by CuriosityStream Inc.
("we," "our," "us" or "CS") or a third party agent of CS, and other websites, apps, and services where this Privacy Policy is posted (collectively, the "Sites").
PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY BECAUSE BY USING THE SITES, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND OUR PRIVACY PRACTICES.
IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SITES.
Your use of the Sites is also expressly subject to our Terms of Use, available at https://curiositystream.com/terms/.
Those with disabilities may also access this Privacy Policy in an alternative text-based format, such as HTML, RTF, or PDF by clicking here.
Please note the arbitration provision set forth below, which may, except where and to the extent prohibited by law, require you to arbitrate any claims you may have against CS on an individual basis.
ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS MEANS THAT YOU WILL NOT HAVE, AND YOU WAIVE, THE RIGHT FOR A JUDGE OR JURY TO DECIDE YOUR CLAIMS, AND THAT YOU MAY NOT PROCEED IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY.
We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to keep up to date on how we are handling your personal information.A.
Information CollectedWe collect two types of information from visitors to the Sites: (1) personal information.
and (2) non-personal information.
"Personal information" is information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with you, your household, or device, such as your name, address, telephone number, email address, or company name.
"Non-personal information" is information that does NOT identify you or your household personally.
We note, however, that throughout time, non-personal information could become personal information through regulatory developments, technological advancements, or co-mingling with personal information.
Where personal information and non-personal information are combined, we treat the combined set of information as personal information.(1) Active CollectionWe collect and store personal information from you directly, at the time you supply information to us via the Sites.
For instance, if you sign up for an account or contact us with a question, we may store your communications, including any personal information you include in them, so we can effectively respond to you.
The information we actively collect from you may include:

Email address, first and last name, mailing address and billing information if you subscribe to the Sites.
Email address if you contact us with a question or seek more information about us through the Sites.
Name and email address if you enter or otherwise communicate in a chat room, blog or other public area on the Sites or on one of CS's social networking pages.
Email address and name if you sign up to receive a newsletter from one of the Sites or if you otherwise request information from the Sites.
Demographic Information, which may include your gender, age, zip code and interests, which you voluntarily provide to us on the Sites.
We use this information to provide you with personalized services and to analyze trends to ensure the information provided by the Sites meets your needs.
Social media information, political affiliations, and interests, to get a better idea of how to serve you.
Location information if you choose to allow us to track your location through the Sites or if your personal information indicates a certain geographic location.
This information may help us provide recommendations to you based on your location, serve you with advertisements, or direct you to products or services that we believe may be of interest to you and that is marketed to people near your location.
(2) Passive CollectionWe may collect information passively while you are visiting or interacting with the Sites.
We call this âpassiveâ collection because you may not know that this information is being collected.
The information we passively collect from you may include:

Internet Protocol (IP) address.
Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data - such as the webpages you view.
We use this information to deliver our webpages to you upon request, to tailor our Sites to the interests of our users and to measure traffic within our Sites.
Cookies and other similar technologies.
One way that we collect information passively is through cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies.
For more information on cookies and similar technologies, please see section K below.

To vendors, affiliates, and other third parties to process your request for a subscription.
If you choose to subscribe to the Sites, we may collect information from you such as your credit card number, billing address and other information related to such purchase, and we may use such collected information in order to process your payment.
We may also provide such information, or other personal information provided by you, to unaffiliated third parties as necessary to complete your subscription (for example, to process your credit card).
To vendors, affiliates, strategic partners, agents, third party marketers or other unaffiliated parties for advertising and marketing purposes, including generating web analytics and compiling user information for marketing purposes, advertising, conducting marketing analysis, providing you with recommendations for products or services based on your profile, and promotional material planning and distribution.
If you do not want us to share your personal information in this manner, please do not provide us with this information, or please inform us that you would like to opt out of this type of sharing by contacting us at the address provided at the bottom of the Privacy Policy.
To affiliates, strategic partners, agents, third party marketers or other unaffiliated parties who are offering products or services that we believe may be of interest to you or who require your personal information for research, administrative and/or internal business purposes.
These parties may use your personal information, such as your first and last name and email address, to contact you with an offer or advertisement related to a product or service, or they may use such information for their own research, administrative, or business purposes.
If you do not want us to share your personal information in this manner, please unsubscribe or contact us below to change your preferences.
To unaffiliated third-party service providers, agents or independent contractors who help us maintain our Sites and provide other administrative services to us (including, but not limited to, credit card processing services, providing customer service, maintaining and analyzing data, sending customer communications on CS's behalf, and entry collection, winner selection and prize fulfillment for contests, sweepstakes and other promotions).
We seek to ensure that these unaffiliated third parties will not use the personal information for any other purpose than to provide the administrative services for which they are responsible.
Because such unaffiliated third-party service providers that help us administer our Sites will have access to users' personal information, if you do not wish for our unaffiliated third-party service providers to have access to your information, please do not register or submit any personal information to us.
To fulfill a request made by you.
For example, if you email us a question or otherwise inquire about one of our services, we may use your email address to process your request and respond to your question.
Also, if you are entering a sweepstakes or contest, we may use your personal information in order to fulfill the terms of that promotion.
This means that we may share the information for prize fulfillment purposes or mail carriers.
We also may share your information with the co-sponsor of that promotion.

In the course of such verification, we may receive personal information about you from such services.
In particular, if you use a credit card or debit card to subscribe to the Sites or otherwise make a purchase through the Sites, we may use card authorization and fraud screening services to verify that your card information and address matches the information that you supplied to us, and that the card has not been reported as lost or stolen.

International Transfer of InformationIf you choose to provide CS with personal information, and with your prior consent, CS may transfer that information to its affiliates and subsidiaries or to other third parties, across borders, and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.
If you are visiting from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S.

Cookies and AdsWe use, and may allow certain third parties (including advertisers, third party ad networks, and other ad companies) to use, cookies and other similar technologies to provide our services, serve advertisements on the Sites, and to improve the performance of CS's advertising across the Internet.
Please be advised that such advertising companies may gather personal information about your visit to the Sites or other sites to enable such advertising companies to market products or services to you, to monitor which ads have been served to your browser and which webpages you were viewing when such ads were delivered.
Here are some examples of information that is collected via the Sites and a description of how this information is used:

Cookies and Web Beacons - We may use certain kinds of technology such as cookies and web beacons or work with third party web analytic service providers to collect information about how you use the Sites.
Among other things, the use of cookies and web beacons enables us to improve our services by seeing which areas and features are most popular, to count the number of computers or mobile devices accessing our services, to personalize and improve your experience, to record your preferences, to allow you to visit our Sites without re-entering your username and/or password, and to improve the performance of our advertising across the Internet.
A cookie is a small amount of data which is sent to your browser from a website's computer and stored on your computer's hard drive or your mobile device.
Most browsers automatically accept cookies as the default setting.
You may be able to set your browser not to accept cookies, or to warn you when a cookie is being placed on your computer.
However, if you choose not to accept cookies, your ability to use our Sites may be hindered.
A web beacon is an electronic image, also called a "gif," that may be in the form of a "png" image, as well as iframe, script, input link, embed, object, and other tags to track usage.
These web beacons may be used on our web pages to deliver cookies, count visits and compile statistics on usage and effectiveness of our Sites.
Google Analytics - To help facilitate the delivery of relevant content, we use Google Analytics and have implemented all Google Advertising Features, including Remarketing, Impression Reporting, and Demographics, and Interest Reporting.
Google Analytics uses cookies to report on user interactions on our and others' websites.
We use the data collected for optimizing marketing, refining advertising and/or programming strategies, and generally making advertising more effective.
Google provides a complete privacy policy and instructions on opting out of Google Analytics here: https://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html.
Note that the opt-out is specific to Google activities and does not affect the activities of other ad networks or analytics providers that we may use.

Depending on the particular advertising services they provide, these third party advertising companies may employ first-party cookies or third-party cookies.
Unlike third-party cookies, first-party cookies are hosted on CS's servers.
You can opt-out of first-party cookies by clicking here (https://curiositystream.com/privacy/ad-opt-out-confirmation).
