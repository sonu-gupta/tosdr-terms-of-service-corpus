THE SOLUTION.

McGraw Hill has developed a web-based solution (the "Solution") that enables users to access certain online products and services ("Services") and related courses, content and information (together with the Services, the "McGraw Hill Content") offered by McGraw Hill through our website (the "Website") by purchasing a subscription.
McGraw Hill hereby grants Subscriber a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to access and use the Solution, and allow each administrator, faculty member, and student enrolled by Subscriber (each a designated "End User") to access and use the Solution, through the Website, solely for educational purposes.
End Users may access the Solution and the McGraw Hill Content in accordance with an access method offered by McGraw Hill and selected by Subscriber.
All End Users other than K-12 students will be required to agree to the Terms of Use in order to access the Solution and the McGraw Hill Content.
Payments of applicable fees to McGraw Hill are due within thirty (30) days of the date of invoice unless otherwise agreed to in writing.




ADDITIONAL TERMS.

All use of the Solution and McGraw Hill Content is subject to this Agreement and any additional terms agreed to by the parties in connection with the Solution and McGraw Hill Content, including, without limitation, any prohibitions on distribution of the McGraw Hill Content to students or third parties.
Subscriber is responsible for its End Users' use of the Solution and the McGraw Hill Content.




ADDITIONAL SERVICES.

McGraw Hill may enhance and/or expand the features of the Solution from time to time at no additional cost to Subscriber, or may provide additional content, performance or features that may, but are not required to, be added by Subscriber at additional cost to Subscriber.
Any professional services to be provided by McGraw Hill to Subscriber in connection with the Solution shall be set forth in a separate Professional Services Agreement between McGraw Hill and Subscriber.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.
DISCLAIMER.


Each party represents and warrants that this Agreement constitutes its valid and binding obligation and is enforceable against it in accordance with its terms.
MCGRAW HILL DOES NOT WARRANT THE COMPLETENESS, ADEQUACY, ACCURACY, OR USEFULNESS OF THE SOLUTION, THE MCGRAW HILL CONTENT OR ANY OTHER MATERIALS PROVIDED HEREUNDER (COLLECTIVELY, THE "MATERIALS").
THE MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS WITH ALL DEFECTS.
MCGRAW HILL EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED OPERATION AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.
WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, MCGRAW HILL MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT (i) THE MATERIALS WILL MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF SUBSCRIBER, (ii) THE MATERIALS WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE, (iii) THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE USE OF THE MATERIALS WILL BE ACCURATE OR RELIABLE, OR (iv) ANY ERRORS IN THE MATERIALS WILL BE CORRECTED.
NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR COMMUNICATIONS GIVEN BY MCGRAW HILL, ITS EMPLOYEES, OR AGENTS WILL INCREASE THE SCOPE OF THE ABOVE WARRANTY OR CREATE ANY NEW OR ADDITIONAL WARRANTIES.

LIABILITY.

IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY (OR TO ANY OTHER PERSON CLAIMING RIGHTS DERIVED FROM SUCH PARTY'S RIGHTS) FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOST TIME, LOST MONEY, LOST DATA, LOST PROFITS OR GOOD WILL, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DAMAGES ARE FORESEEN OR UNFORESEEN WITH RESPECT TO ANY USE OF THE MATERIALS OR OTHERWISE ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE AND IN NO EVENT SHALL THE LIABILITY OF MCGRAW HILL OR ITS LICENSORS FOR WHATEVER CAUSE EXCEED THE FEES PAID BY YOU IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE MATERIALS EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
To the extent the foregoing exclusion of liability is not permitted under applicable law, McGraw Hill's liability in such case will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.




INDEMNIFICATION.

McGraw Hill shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Subscriber from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, related to or arising out of any claim by a third party that the technology platform underlying the Solution infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property rights of such third party.
To the extent permitted by law, Subscriber shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless McGraw Hill and its parent, affiliates, successors and assigns and their respective officers, employees and agents from and against any and all liabilities, claims, demands, losses, damages, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, related to or arising out of use of the Solution by Subscriber, except to the extent that such claim is subject to indemnification by McGraw Hill hereunder.



MISCELLANEOUS.

The Agreement contains the entire understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and commitments with respect thereto.
provided, however, that if Subscriber has entered into a separate written agreement with McGraw Hill regarding the subject matter hereof, that agreement will supersede this Agreement to the extent of any conflict.
There are no other oral or written understandings, terms or conditions with respect to the subject matter of the Agreement, and neither party has relied upon any representation, express or implied, not contained in the Agreement.
The rights and remedies of the parties are cumulative and not alternative.
No waiver of any rights is to be charged against any party unless such waiver is in writing signed by an authorized representative of the party so charged.
Neither the failure nor any delay by any party in exercising any right, power, or privilege under the Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right, power, or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power, or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power, or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege.
No modification of or amendment to the Agreement will be effective unless in writing signed by authorized representatives of both parties.
If any provision of the Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of the Agreement will remain in full force and effect, and, if legally permitted, such offending provision will be replaced with an enforceable provision that as nearly as possible effects the parties' intent.
Subscriber may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under the Agreement without the prior written consent of McGraw Hill, which consent McGraw Hill may grant or withhold in its sole and absolute discretion.
Subject to the foregoing, the Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted successors and assigns.
Any purported or attempted assignment or other transfer or delegation in violation of this Section shall be null and void.
