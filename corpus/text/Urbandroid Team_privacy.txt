Sending of a debug report requires user action (needs to be explicitly send from the userâs mail application) and user may review all the information before sending and decide whether they want to share it with us or not.

Location
We do not read device location in our apps unless it is absolutely necessary for the core functionalities of our apps.
We try to use the most coarse information needed for that purpose and retrieve the data in a battery efficient way.
In most of our apps this information never leaves the device by default, unless not specified differently below.
Location in Twilight
The Twilight app which needs to timely react on any changes in location with respect to local sunrise and sunset times and adjust screen filtering accordingly.
For this the apps need to access location in background.
Twilight does not collection location and the location information never leaves the device.
Twilight is basically completely offline and the Internet permission is only used to allow Twilight to talk to smart light devices on the local network.
Location retrieval can be disabled in the main screen under Sun &amp.
Location &gt.
Automatic location.

Location in Air
The core feature of Air is to notify the usersâ about worsening in pollutant levels at their current location automatically without touching the app.
This can only be done though retrieving location regularly though out the day.
The location information is not stored, but only used to quite the pollutant level server for local data.
Location retrieval cannot be disabled in-app as this would break appâs core functionality.
But users may decide to not grant the location permission to the app.
Location in Sleep as Android
Sleep as Android only retrieves location when the app is used.
typically when sleep tracking starts.
It stores s very coarse geo cell location ~+/-10km at each sleep record to allow users to compare their sleep quality in different locations.
The location does not leave the device unless users explicitly install the SleepCloud Backup addon and decide to send those data to their selected services.
Location gathering and storing at sleep records can be disabled in Settings &gt.
Privacy.
Sleep as Android may query a weather service to show you current weather at your location in the morning.
