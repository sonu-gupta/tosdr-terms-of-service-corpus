We may ask you to specifically consent to the collection, use and storage of your biometric data during the verification process, where privacy regulations require it in your jurisdiction.
If you do not consent, we offer alternate methods to verify your identity which may take longer.
We will not disclose or disseminate any biometric data to anyone other than our identity verification providers, or when required by applicable laws and regulations, or pursuant to a valid order from a court.
We never sell, lease, trade or otherwise benefit from your biometric data.

How we protect your personal information



3.1 We take the safeguarding of your information very seriously. The transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.
Although we do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data during transmission, and any transmission is at your own risk.
Once we have received your information, we use strict procedures and security features to ensure it stays secure, including:

Communications over the Internet between you and Wise systems are encrypted using strong asymmetric encryption.
This makes it unreadable to anyone who might be listening in;
We update and patch our servers in a timely manner;
We run a Responsible Disclosure and bug bounty program to identify any security issues in Wise services;
Our technical security team proactively monitors for abnormal and malicious activity in our servers and services;
When information youâve given us is not in active use, it is encrypted at rest.

You can find out more from our Security page.

3.2 We are regularly audited to confirm we remain compliant with our security certifications, including SOC 2 and PCI-DSS.
As part of these audits, our security is validated by external auditors.

3.3 We restrict access to your personal information to those employees of Wise who have a business reason for knowing such information and third party service providersâ processing data on our behalf.
All Wise employees who have access to your personal data are required to adhere to this Policy and all third-party service providers are requested by Wise to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place.
In addition, contracts are in place with third-party service providers that have access to your personal data, to ensure that the level of security and protective measures required in your jurisdiction is in place, and that your personal data is processed only as instructed by Wise.

3.4 We continuously educate and train our employees about the importance of confidentiality and privacy of customer personal information.
We maintain physical, technical and organisational safeguards that comply with applicable laws and regulations to protect your personal information from unauthorised access.

It may also be processed by staff operating outside of your jurisdiction.

Profiling and automated decision making



9.1 We may use some elements of your data to customise our Services and the information we provide to you, and to address your needs, including your country of residence and transaction history.
For example, if you frequently send funds from one particular currency to another, we may use this information to inform you of new product updates or features that may be useful for you.
When we do this, we take all necessary measures to ensure that your privacy and security are protected - and we use pseudonymised data wherever possible.
This activity has no legal effect on you.

9.2 We use automated processes to check that your application to access Wise services and your use of Wise services meet our required standard, including verifying your identity, and to help prevent fraud or other illegal activities.
These processes may make an automated decision to reject your application or a proposed transaction, to block a suspicious attempt to login to your Wise account, or to close your account.
If this happens, you will be notified and offered the opportunity to provide further information and challenge the decision through an appeal mechanism, which includes a manual review.
In any case, if you feel that an automated process may have impacted you, please contact Wise Customer Support.

Your rights



13.1 Laws applicable in your jurisdiction may grant you certain rights regarding the information we hold about you.
If you have any questions in relation to our use of your personal information, contact us at privacy@wise.com.

13.2 Your exercise of these rights may be subject to certain exemptions, including to safeguard the public interest (including the prevention or detection of crime), where it is in our interests (including the maintenance of legal privilege), and where the rights of other persons are involved (including where your request relates to information about other individuals).

13.3 We may need to retain certain information for record-keeping purposes and to comply with our obligations under applicable laws and regulations, including but not limited to our anti-money laundering obligations, and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting a change or deletion.

13.4 You will not normally have to pay a fee to access your personal data or to exercise any of the other rights.
However, we may charge a reasonable fee where permitted by local laws or if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.
Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

13.5 We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and your right to access your personal data or to exercise any of your other rights.
This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

13.6 If you no longer want to receive marketing-related emails from us, you may opt-out by following the instructions in any such email.
We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable.
Please note that if you opt-out, we may still send you important administrative messages, from which you cannot opt-out.

13.7 If you would like to make a request, the best way to do so would be to contact us at the contact details listed in the Appendix.

13.8
Subject to some country-specific variations, you have the right to:



Request a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.


Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. We may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.

Ask us to delete personal data where there is no good reason for us to continue to process it. You may also have the right to ask us to delete your personal data where (i) you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), (ii) where we may have processed your personal data unlawfully or (iii) where we are required to delete your personal data to comply with local law.
We may not always be able to comply with your deletion request for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, in our response to your request, including financial regulations that may require us to hold your personal data for a period after the closure of your account.

Withdraw your consent for us to process data, where our lawful basis for processing is based on that consent. Note that withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing which may have taken place prior to withdrawal of consent.
If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you.

Request us to cease direct marketing to you, or profiling you for the purpose of direct marketing, by contacting us or adjusting your notification preferences in the settings section of your account.

Where we use wholly automated decision making-processes, request that we provide information about the decision-making methodology and ask us to verify that an automated decision that results in a legal impact on you has been made correctly.
