UPDATES

11.1 3Commas may provide you, at no additional cost, with updates which contain
11.1.1 Enhancements.
From time to time digital content requires further development and adaptation to new technical possibilities or changes in user environment/infrastructure.
To the extent this does not adversely affect the subjective or objective conformity requirements of the Software or your access or use of the Software (i.e.
which are no debuggings or modifications), 3Commas may provide you with updates, new software versions and releases that include technical adaptations or additional services, functions, links, integrate additional (module) services or redesign and recompile services, as well as change the name and appearance of the Software.
3Commas is not obliged to supply enhancements.
11.1.2 Debuggings.
3Commas will provide you with updates, including security updates that contain debuggings which keep the Software in conformity with the subjective or objective requirements including legal, regulatory and judicial requirements for the period of your use of the Software.
3Commas shall inform you about the availability of updates with debuggings and the consequences of the failure to install such updates, as well as provide you with an installation instruction.
This Section 11.1.2 does by no means limit your remedies for lack of conformity according to Section 11.2
11.1.3 Modifications.
3Commas may provide you with updates that contain modifications to the Software beyond what is necessary to maintain conformity of the Software.
3Commas may make modifications if and to the extent that (a) functions of the Software or parts thereof are no longer used to an extent that justifies their maintenance and continued operation, (b) (new or amended) legal, regulatory or judicial requirements would require adjustments of the Software which would be economically unreasonable to 3Commas, (c) changes in the technical conditions of the Software environment or infrastructure that are beyond 3Commas's control and that complicate maintenance and continued operations of the Software to an extent which would be economically unreasonable to 3Commas.
3Commas shall inform you of Modifications.
If the Modification negatively impacts the your access to or use of the Software, and the impact is not only minor, the following applies to such information: 3Commas shall inform you via the Software in advance of the features and time of the Modification and bring to your attention if it is possible for you to maintain without additional cost the Software without the Modification or if you have the right to terminate the contract in accordance with Section 12.3 of these Terms of Use.

11.2 Remedies for lack of conformity
11.2.1 In the event of a lack of conformity of the Software, you are entitled to have the Software brought into conformity with the conditions set out in these Terms of Use, e.g.
via update.
If (i) 3Commas refuses or fails to achieve conformity within a reasonable period of time and without significant inconvenience to you, (ii) or where the lack of conformity is of such serious nature that it is unreasonable for you to apply for rectification first, are entitled to (a) a proportionate reduction of the price, if any, for the period of time during which the digital content or digital service was not in conformity and (b) unless the lack of conformity is only minor, terminate the contract in accordance with Section 13.3.
A price reduction or refund is proportionate if it reflects the decrease in the value of the Software compared to the value that the digital content or digital service would have if they were in conformity.
11.2.2 To assert your rights under this Section 11, you can contact 3Commasâs Customer Care.
The contact details of Customer Care are support@3commas.io.
