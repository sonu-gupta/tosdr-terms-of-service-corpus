Data protection Based on Article 13 of the Federal Constitution and the provisions of Swiss data protection legislation, everyone has the right to the protection of privacy, as well as to protection from misuse of their personal details.
The Section Communication complies with these provisions.
Personal details are treated in the highest confidence and are neither passed on nor sold to third parties.
In close cooperation with our hosting provider, we make every effort to protect the databases from outside access, data loss, misuse or falsification.
No personal details are stored when you access our websites.
Our hosting providerâs web server merely registers impersonal site usage data (log files) for the purpose of tracking trends for the Section Communication in order to improve the information offering.
Site usage data is in no way linked with personal data.
In order to make regular improvements to the service we offer, we use a web analytics system known as eTracker.
As part of this service, the company eTracker GmbH in Hamburg processes the required data according to our instructions.
No data is supplied for any other purpose or to any third parties. 
In addition to testing eTracker, we are also looking at the web analysis solution Matomo (formerly Piwik).
Matomo provides us with additional useful information and also delivers better data protection.
For the sake of comparison we will initially be using both tools.
However, no data will be used for other purposes, or be passed on to third parties.
In order to indicate the addresses of federal authorities on online maps, we use Google Maps.
If you access a page with an online map, certain data will be transmitted to Google, but not personal data.
