Other Information You may choose to provide other information directly to us.
For example, we may collect information when you fill out a form, participate in contests, sweepstakes or promotions, apply for a job, communicate with us via third-party sites and services, request customer support or otherwise communicate with us.


Information We Collect Automatically When you access or use our Services, we may also automatically collect information about you.

Your use of these features enables the sharing of certain information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the third party that provides the social sharing feature.
For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the third parties that provide these social sharing features (e.g., Tumblr, Facebook, Pinterest, and Twitter).

Improve the service and make business decisions about possible future features or improvements using aggregate, non-identifying information about user usage trends, and other aggregate methods;

These third parties may collect information sent by your computer, browser, or mobile device in response to a request for content, such as unique identifiers, your IP address, or other information about your computer or device.
For example: Advertisers and Ad Networks Our ad partners and network may use cookies and use related technologies to collect information when ads are delivered to you on our Services, but Adventurerâs Codex does not link to or provide your actual Adventurerâs Codex account details to these advertising partners.

As an example, we may use analytics partners to analyze and measure, in the aggregate, the number of unique visitors to our Services.
For more information about how you may control the collection and/or use of information for advertising and analytics purposes, please see âYour Choices.â Security We take reasonable measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

Account Information You may delete your account information at any time by logging into your account profile and click the âDelete Accountâ button.
We may also retain certain information about you as required by law.
Deleting your account will begin the process of removing your data from the Adventurerâs Codex system.
Due to the nature of our system, fully removing all your personal data from our system can take up to 10 days, though your account will be inactive and unusable immediately after cancellation.
