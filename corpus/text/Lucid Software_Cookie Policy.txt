On August 27, 2020, Lucid Software Inc.
updated this Cookie Policy to provide additional information about your ability to disable certain types of cookies, other similar tracking technologies, and analytics services. 

What are Cookies?

Like most websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to remember things about you so that we can provide you with a better experience.

Cookies are small pieces of data stored on your browser or device.
They may be served by the entity that operates the website you are visiting (âfirst-party cookiesâ) or by other companies (âthird-party cookiesâ).
Web beacons (sometimes called âtracking pixelsâ or âclear gifsâ) are small images that contain a unique identifier that is embedded in our website or in emails or other communications that are sent through our services.
Web beacons are used to collect information about your browser or device and can set cookies.
SDKs are blocks of code provided by our partners that may be installed in our mobile applications.
SDKs help us understand how you interact with our mobile applications and collect certain information about the device and network you use to access the application.


How We Use Cookies

We use cookies for a number of reasons, like helping us see which features are most popular, counting visitors to a page, improving our usersâ experience, keeping our services secure, and generally providing you with a better experience.
The cookies we use generally fall into one of the following categories.

Category of Cookies

For example, we may use these cookies to remember your language preferences.
Security

For example, we may use these cookies to determine if you have interacted with a certain page and how well the page performed.
Analytics
We use these cookies to help us understand improve our services.
For example, we can use these cookies to learn more about which features are the most popular with our users and where we may need to make improvements.
Advertising
We and our advertising partners use these cookies to deliver advertisements, to make them more relevant and meaningful to visitors to our website, and to track the efficiency of our advertising campaigns, both on our services and on other websites.
Device IDs: If you access our mobile app, the advertising identifier associated with your device or other identifiers may be recorded and used for purposes similar to those of cookies. 

Your Choices

You have a number of options to control or limit how we and our partners use cookies and similar technologies, including for advertising.


By Blocking Web Browser Cookies.
Although most browsers and devices accept cookies by default, their settings usually allow you to clear or decline cookies.
If you disable cookies, however, some of the features of our services may not function properly.
As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browserâs configuration documentation for more information.

By Using Industry-Developed Opt-Out Tools. For information on how our advertising partners allow you to opt out of receiving ads based on your web browsing history, please visit the Digital Advertising Alliance or the Network Advertising Initiative.
European users may opt out of receiving targeted advertising through the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance.
Additionally, California consumers may use the Digital Advertising Allianceâs CCPA tool to send requests for a web browser to opt out of the sale of personal information by some or all of that frameworkâs participating companies by accessing the DAAâs tool here: https://www.privacyrights.info.

Google and Facebook. To opt out of ads on Facebook or Google that are targeted to your interests, use your Facebook or Google Ads settings.
To prevent your data from being used by Google Analytics, you can install Googleâs opt-out browser add-on.

Mobile Platform Opt Outs. Check your mobile device for settings that control ads based on your interactions with the applications on your device.
