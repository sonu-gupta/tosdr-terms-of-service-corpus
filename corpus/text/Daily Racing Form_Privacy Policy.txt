If you do not wish to participate, simply click the "No, Thank You" link and you will not see this window again.
If you choose to participate, you'll be prompted to answer a series of online questions.
You will be prompted to enter your e-mail address for validation purposes but no other personal information (name, address, etc.) will be collected as part of the survey.
In some cases, however, you may be offered a free gift for your participation.
We will need your name and address, which will be used exclusively to fulfill your gift request.
 

Cookie Technology

We also employ cookie technology to help subscribers move faster through our site.
When a subscriber signs on to DRF Online, we pass several cookies to that user's computer.
A cookie is a string of information that's sent by a Web site and stored on your hard drive or temporarily in your computer's memory.
This avoids the potentially time-consuming task of checking our registration database each time a page is requested.
The cookie is deleted when a user chooses the log out feature to terminate their session.
We also employ cookie technology to store subscribers' User Names and Passwords.
