         Grand jury subpoena for Signal user data, Eastern District of Virginia 04 Oct 2016
In the âfirst half of 2016â (the most specific weâre permitted to be), we received a subpoena from the Eastern District of Virginia.
The subpoena required us to provide information about two Signal users for a federal grand jury investigation.
Weâve designed the Signal service to minimize the data we retain about Signal users, so the only information we can produce in response to a request like this is the date and time a user registered with Signal and the last date of a userâs connectivity to the Signal service.
Notably, things we donât have stored include anything about a userâs contacts (such as the contacts themselves, a hash of the contacts, any other derivative contact information), anything about a userâs groups (such as how many groups a user is in, which groups a user is in, the membership lists of a userâs groups), or any records of who a user has been communicating with.
All message contents are end-to-end encrypted, so we donât have that information either.
This is the first subpoena that weâve received.
It originally included a broad gag order that would have prevented us from publishing this notice, but the ACLU represented us in quickly and successfully securing our ability to publish the transcripts below.
Weâre committed to treating any future requests the same way: working with effective and talented organizations like the ACLU, and publishing transcripts of our responses to government requests here.
Below is the transcript for this request.
