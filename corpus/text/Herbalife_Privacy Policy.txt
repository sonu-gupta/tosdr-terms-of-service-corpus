Herbalife Privacy Policy

Last Revised: January 1, 2020

 This Privacy Policy (âPolicyâ) applies to Herbalife International of America Inc.
and its U.S.
affiliate entities (âHerbalifeâ).
It applies to all information collected by Herbalife through its online properties and mobile applications (the âSitesâ) where this Privacy Policy is posted.
It also applies to information that Herbalife collects through offline methods.
Unless otherwise indicated, this Policy does not apply to an Herbalife Independent Distributorâs (âDistributorâ or âHerbalife Distributorâ) collection or use of information obtained by the Distributor directly from you or from sources other than Herbalife, unless it then is shared with and retained by Herbalife.
 The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you of the kinds of information we may collect, how such information may be used, with whom such information may be shared, your choices regarding the collection, use and sharing of such information, your ability to access and correct such information and the security procedures we use to protect this information.

(The downline organization consists of all Distributors and Preferred Members that were personally sponsored by a particular Distributor, and in turn, all other persons sponsored by the subsequent Distributors.) To the extent the Lineage Report contains data from residents outside of the United States, including residents of the European Union, we have taken appropriate measures to protect the data in accordance with applicable law.
Lineage Reports are provided to Distributors in strict confidence and for the sole purpose of supporting the Distributors in further developing their Herbalife businesses, including for use in marketing tools and platforms.

 We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we collect about you remains accurate, timely and secure.

Using the Sites demonstrates your consent to the processing of information as described in this Policy.

8.
Childrenâs Information.

The Sites are general audience websites that are not directed to children younger than 13.
We do not knowingly collect, use or disseminate any personal information from children under the age of 13, unless permitted by law.
If you believe we may have collected personal information from your child on the Sites, please contact us at privacy@herbalife.com and we will make reasonable efforts to delete it from our records, when required by law.

9.
Cookies and Tracking.

 Herbalife, as well as certain third parties that provide content and other functionality on our Sites, use cookies, web beacons, session replay/screen capture, and other similar technologies for various purposes, including to analyze trends, administer the website, track usersâ movements around the Sites and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
 Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored on computer hard drives.
A cookie enables the entity that put the cookie on your device to recognize it across different websites, services, devices, and browsing sessions.
For example, we may use cookies to recognize you when you return to the Sites in order to provide you with a better user experience.
We may allow third parties to use cookies on the Sites, but we do not control the use or contents of third-party cookies.
Web browsers often allow you to configure the browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is sent.
If you elect to reject cookies, please note that you may not be able to take full advantage of the features and functions of the Sites.
To learn more about cookies and how to manage them, please visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org/.
 Web beacons and similar technologies are small bits of code, which are embedded in web pages, advertisements, and emails, that communicate with third parties.
We use web beacons, for example, to count the number of users who have visited a particular webpage, to deliver or communicate with cookies, and to understand usage patterns.
We also may include web beacons in emails to understand whether messages have been opened, acted on, or forwarded.
 There are other local storage and internet technologies, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as âFlash cookiesâ), HTML5 local storage and embed scripts, which can operate similarly to the cookies discussed above.
Please note that these technologies are distinct from cookies, and you may not be able to control them using standard browser tools and settings.

Mobile devices that have enabled Bluetooth can receive a signal when in range of a beacon.
The signals will not be received unless the user has turned on Bluetooth, installed an Herbalife mobile application and enabled push notifications.
The beacon functionality may allow for notifications, customer check-ins, and payments.
You can disable the beacon functionality in the appâs settings.

10.
Do Not Track.

 Web browsers may allow you to send âDo Not Trackâ requests.
We do not currently take actions to respond to Do Not Track signals because there is no current industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals.
We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard if and when one is created.

11.
Online Advertising.

 We may display advertising on our website and partner with third parties to manage advertising on other websites for our products and services.
We may also partner with third parties, including business partners, advertising networks, and other advertising service providers, who gather information about you on our Sites and other sites to provide you with advertisements on the Sites and elsewhere online based on your browsing history and tailored to your interests, preferences, and characteristics.
Cookies or other similar technologies may be used to provide you with advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests.
We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties, and the information practices of these third parties are not covered by this Policy.
 Some third parties collect information about users of our Sites to provide interest-based advertising on our Sites and elsewhere, including across browsers and devices.
These third parties may use the information they collect on our Sites to make predictions about your interests in order to provide you ads (from us and other companies) across the internet.
Some of these third parties may participate in industry-developed programs designed to provide consumers with choices about whether to receive targeted advertising.
Due to differences between using apps and websites on mobile devices, you may need to take additional steps to disable targeted ad technologies in mobile apps.
Many mobile devices allow you to opt out of targeted advertising for mobile apps using the settings within the mobile app or your mobile device.
For more information, please check your mobile settings.
You also may uninstall our apps using the standard uninstall process available on your mobile device or app marketplace.
 To opt out of interest-based advertising across browsers and devices from companies that participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance or Network Advertising Initiative opt-out programs, please visit the websites operated by the Network Advertising Initiative (//www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (//www.aboutads.info/choices/).
You may also be able to opt out of interest-based advertising through the settings within the mobile app or your mobile device, but your opt-out choice may apply only to the browser or device you are using when you opt out, so you should opt out on each of your browsers and devices if you want to disable all cross-device linking for interest-based advertising.
Further information in local languages may be available at www.youronlinechoices.com/.
If you are located in the European Union, more information is available at http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/.
Please note that even if you use an industry-based opt-out for interest-based advertising, you will continue to receive generic advertisements and your experience on our Sites may be degraded.

Herbalife is not responsible for the privacy practices of these entities.
 If you access third-party services, such as Facebook, Google, or Twitter, through the Sites, to log in to the Sites or to share information about your experience on the Sites with others, these third-party services may be able to collect information about you, including information about your activity on the Site, and they may notify your connections on the third-party services about your use of the Site, in accordance with their own privacy policies.

Information excluded from the CCPAâs scope, like:


health or medical information covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA) or clinical trial data;
personal information covered by certain sector-specific privacy laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FRCA), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) or California Financial Information Privacy Act (FIPA), and the Driverâs Privacy Protection Act of 1994




Rights


If you are a California resident, you may have certain rights.
California law may permit you to request that we:



Provide you the categories of personal information we collect or disclose about you.
the categories of sources of such information.
the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information.
and the categories of third parties with whom we share personal information


Provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you


Delete certain information we have about you


You may have the right to receive information about the financial incentives that we offer to you.
You also have the right to not be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for certain exercising of your rights.
Certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law.
We need certain types of information so that we can provide the services to you.
If you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access or use the Site.


Some of our Sites allow you to review and update your personal information or cancel certain provisions of your Herbalife Nutrition Distributorship.
If you are a California resident and you want to exercise any of the rights listed in this provision or for assistance with any of these rights, please make your request at privacy@herbalife.com or call 1-888-926-8905.
This line is open Monday to Friday from 8:00 a.m.
to 5:00 p.m.
Pacific Standard Time.


If you are asserting your right to access a copy of certain information or your right to delete certain information, you will be asked to verify your identity before we fulfill your request.
This verification process may require you to provide your Distributorship ID, or other pieces of personal information that we already hold on you, or, in certain circumstances, a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that you are the consumer whose personal information is the subject of the request.


We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.
If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.


You can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf.
To do so, you must provide us with written authorization or a power of attorney, signed by you, for the agent to act on your behalf.
You will still need to verify your identity directly with us.


The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) sets forth certain obligations for businesses that âsellâ personal information.
