easy breakdown.
These highlighted bits will do precisely that! Note: the framed explanations arenât legally binding and are meant to help you understand the legal language.
This Privacy Policy explains how Surfshark B.V., address: Kabelweg 57, 1014BA Amsterdam, the Netherlands processes your personal data when you use our Services or interact with our Website.
The Privacy Policy will remain in effect until a new policy supersedes it.
We may choose to update this policy at our discretion, so you should check this page periodically as the terms may change from time to time.
The most recent version of the policy will be reflected by the âlast updatedâ date noted at the bottom of the page.
Your continued use of the Website and our Services will constitute your acknowledgment of the policy in its current version and your understanding of the terms of the policy.1.
What information is collected and why?Weâre established in the Netherlands and we keep our Services logs-free.
We donât collect any information that could lead us to know what youâre up to online.
Surfshark respects your privacy, therefore we are committed to not process any information related to the online activity of our users.
Surfshark is based in the jurisdiction, which does not require information storage or reporting.
We do not collect any information about what you do online (your visited IP addresses, browsing history, session information, used bandwidth, connection time stamps, network traffic or any other similar information).
Our servers do store information about your connection to a particular VPN server (user ID and connection time stamps), BUT this information is automatically deleted within 15 minutes after termination of your session.
And be assured that no information is stored about the websites you visit.

When you visit our Website or navigate within our app (collectively referred to as âWebsiteâ), we collect and use some information to improve the performance of our Website.
The information we collect on our Website may include anonymous âtraffic informationâ provided by the host or similar provider of such information (e.g.
Google Analytics) that does not personally identify you.
This information is statistical and includes information about which pages on Surfsharkâs Website visitors visit and how long visitors stay on a particular page.
It also provides information about what browser, network, or device is used to visit our Website.
To learn more about Google Analytics and how to opt out, please visit https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-analytics-opt-out/fllaojicojecljbmefodhfapmkghcbnh?hl=en.
Also, when you visit our Website, we may retain your IP address and a unique identifier of your device.
This helps us identify problems with our server, to administer our Website, or to display the content according to your preferences.
The legal basis for such processing is our legitimate interest to analyse and improve the performance of our Website and user experience.
That does not mean that we track your online activity while you use our Services.
When you use our Services, we collect and use the information for the following purposes:
To provide our Services.

We process limited information related to the use of our Services (registration information: e-mail, account registration date, information about subscription, encrypted password, when you use our Smart DNS feature â your IP address, when you use our Search tool â aggregated number of performed searches).
For provision of our antivirus service (currently available for Windows and Android users) we also collect information about your devices on which you use the antivirus service.
This information is needed to ensure the compliance with a limitation for the number of devices that one client may use for the antivirus service as provided in our Terms of Service.
If you choose to use the Webcam Protection feature, we will not have access to your webcam, microphone, apps or files on your device.
We will retain statistical information about the usage of this feature, including the number of times you received a request to access your camera or microphone, which preference you selected, whether this feature is turned on or off, how many apps you have included in the exclusion list.
If you use our Alert service, you may enter email addresses which you would like to monitor for breaches.
In such case we will retain this information.
You may also enter your personal identity number (or social security number) and/or credit card number to monitor for related security breaches.
When you choose to monitor your email address, you authorize us to look up additional information (usernames, passwords, full names, country, physical address or IP addresses) related to that email in known data breaches, which, if found, is provided to you in the platform.
We do not look up for such additional information when you choose to monitor your credit card or social security numbers.
As regards this data, we retain it in encrypted form and even we cannot use or review it.
Legal basis for the processing of information is performance of a contract to which you are a party.
Please note that this information is necessary to enter into a contract and if you do not provide this information (or if we cannot retain this information), we will not be able to provide you with our Services.

Analysing and improving the performance of our Services and user experience (when you use our Services).

To maintain a perfect quality of our Services and provide you with efficient support, we collect diagnostics information and monitor crash reports on our apps and extensions.
The information we collect contains aggregated performance information, the frequency of use of our Services, unsuccessful connection attempts and other similar information.
Please note that diagnostics information does not contain uniquely identifiable information.
However, if you face some problems when using our apps, to solve these problems we may require your device information.
We will access this information only if you provide a separate consent for that.
When you permit us through a pop-up within our app, we collect your location data, i.e.
only your WiFi name (Service Set Identifier), which is stored on your device for the purpose of enabling âAuto-connectâ feature, which extends to âTrusted WiFiâ networks.
This feature allows our app to automatically connect to a server without your worry about it.
However, please rest assured that we do not share this information to any third party.
In fact we do not store this information on our end and it is stored only on your device.
In case we would process your personal information, legal basis for such processing is our legitimate interest to analyse and improve the performance of our Website/Services and user experience.

Offering our Services.

We may contact you via email for this purpose, but we also encourage you to contact us via our online contact form to get the best VPN offer for you.
For us to be able to address your requests effectively, we may ask you to provide some information about you.
We will also use the provided information to contact you regarding any future offers that may be of interest to you.
If you do not wish to receive emails from us, you can opt-out from receiving emails or unsubscribe at support@surfshark.com or click âunsubscribeâ at the bottom of any correspondence.
If you have multiple email addresses, you will need to opt-out for each address in order to be removed from our active database.
Legal basis for the processing of personal information is your consent, your relationship with Surfshark or our legitimate interest to conduct marketing activities.

Communicating with users and customer support.

We use user email address to: i) send important updates and announcements related to the use of our Services.
ii) respond to user requests or inquiries.
In addition to user email, we process your inquiry and other information that is provided by you during the conversation.
When a user contacts us through a live chat on our website, we are able to see the userâs IP address.
This information is needed to determine if the user is connected to our servers so that we can assist in solving related issues.
Legal basis for the processing of personal information is performance of contract with you (in case of important communication related to our Services) or your consent (in case you submit an inquiry with our customer support).

To interact with you via social media.

Where you interact with us via social media, we will process social media profile information, inquiry information, post information and other information you provide us with.
Legal basis for the processing of personal information is your consent.

Advertising.

We may receive certain information about you (cookie id, mobile device id, when you use our Trust DNS app â advertising IDs, in app events, such as in-app purchase or amount and type of ads watched, information about what browser, network, or device is used to access and use Trust DNS) from certain advertisers and advertising partners for advertising purposes.
Our advertising partners help us deliver more relevant ads and promotional messages to you, which may include interest-based advertising and account-based advertising.
Legal basis for the processing of personal information is our legitimate interest to deliver relevant ads and promotional messages to you.

Accounting, payment, legal requirements and legal processes.

We are subject to accounting, tax and other statutory requirements.
We may have to protect our legitimate interests and legal rights.
In these cases we may be required to collect and store a limited amount of certain information: email address, subscription information, payment related information, legal documents.
As for payment related information, our payment processing partners collect usual data necessary for payment processing and/or refund requests (transaction date, payerâs IP address, credit card number, credit card ownerâs full name, in some jurisdictions also personal identity code, passport or identity card number and/or residence address).
We process only very small part of this payment related information (part of the credit card number, payerâs IP address, payment amount, currency, date of payment and card expiry date) for solving payment related issues (such as fraud prevention cases).
We also collect information about your residence country (and your state) as this information is needed to calculate applicable VAT/sales tax.
If you elect so, we may retain your data which is used to generate and issue invoice for the rendered Services.
If you choose the open banking payment method to pay for our Services, we will collect your name and surname, as well as your bank details.
Legal basis for the processing of personal information is a legal obligation to which we are subject (in case we need to collect your information statutorily) and our legitimate interest to defend our rights and interests (in case of other legal processes related to you, if any).2.
How long do we store your personal information?Information Retention

How do we secure your information?We really care about your security &amp.
privacy and do a lot to protect it.
However, anyone who tells you that 100% anything-proof security is possible either doesnât know much about it or is trying to mislead you.
Please keep that in mind.
We have implemented various security measures, including SSL/TLS encryption for data transfers, hashed passwords, firewalls, and regular audits.
We take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your information is treated securely.
While we implement security measures on our Website and through our Services, you should be aware that 100% security is not always possible.
Whenever you give out your information online there is a risk that a third party may intercept and use that information.
While we strive to protect your information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online.
By using the Services, you expressly acknowledge and agree that we cannot guarantee the security of any information provided to or received by us through the Services and that any general information, other information or information received from you through the Website or our Services is provided at your own responsibility.9.
Does our Website respond to do-not-track signals?Currently, it doesnât.
You can tweak your specific browser settings to achieve very similar things.
At this time Surfshark does not recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, which may include âdo-not-trackâ instructions.
However, you can change your privacy preferences regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies through your browser.
You may set your browser to accept all cookies, block certain cookies, require your consent before a cookie is placed in your browser, or block all cookies.
Please note that blocking all cookies will affect your online experience and may prevent you from enjoying the full features offered by our Website.10.
What if I access the Website or your Services from my mobile phone, tablet or laptop?The same things stand that we talked about in section âWhat information is collected and why?â at the very top of this Privacy Policy.
Basically, we donât collect much, and you can opt out of most of it.
If you are a visitor of our Website, but not a user of our Services, we collect and use information about you in the same way and for the same purposes as specified above in Clause 1 notwithstanding the device or application you use.
If you are a user of our Services and access our Website using one or more of our applications notwithstanding the device, application, or browser extensions, we collect and use information in the same way and for the same purposes as specified above in Clause 1.11.
