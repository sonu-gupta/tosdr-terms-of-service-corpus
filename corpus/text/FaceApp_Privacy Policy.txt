        Privacy PolicyEffective as of December 03, 2019.
Last updated June 04, 2020
This Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices of FaceApp in connection with the FaceApp mobile application (the âAppâ) and FaceApp.com website (the âSiteâ).
Welcome to FaceAppâs Privacy Policy!
If you decide not to read this entire Privacy Policy, we want you to walk away with a few key points about FaceAppâs privacy practices:

The App is a photo and video editor that allows users to edit portraits based on neural network technology that automatically generates highly realistic facial transformations.
We use third-party cloud providers â specifically, Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services â to process and edit photographs.
The App only uploads to the cloud the photographs that you specifically select for editing.
Photographs are temporarily cached on the cloud servers during the editing process, and encrypted using a key stored locally on your mobile device.
Photographs remain in the cloud for a limited period of 24-48 hours after you have last edited the photograph, so that you can return to the image and make additional changes if you so choose.
We do not use the photographs you provide when you use the App for any reason other than to provide you with the portrait editing functionality of the App.
Videos are edited locally on your device, so you donât provide us with videos when you use the App, and we donât collect, use and share your video information.

If you have any questions about our privacy practices, please email privacy@faceapp.com.
Hereâs more on our privacy practices.
Individuals located in the European Economic Area should also read our Notice to European Users below.Personal Information We CollectWhen you use the App, we may collect information about you, including:

Photographs you provide when you use the App, via your camera or camera roll (if you have granted us permission to access your camera or camera roll), the in-App internet search functionality, or your social media account (if you choose to connect your social media account).
We obtain only the specific images you chose to modify using the App.
we do not collect your photo albums even if you grant us your access to them.
We encrypt each photograph that you upload using the App.
The encryption key is stored locally on your device.
This means that the only device that can view the photo is the device from which the photograph was uploaded using the App â the userâs device.
Please note that while we do not require or request any metadata attached to the photographs you upload, metadata (including, for example, geotags) may be associated with your photographs by default.
We take steps to delete any metadata that may be associated with a photograph you provide when you use the App.
App usage information, such as information about how you use the App and interact with us, including your preferred language, the date and time when you first installed the App and the date and time you last used the App.
Purchase history, if you choose to purchase an App subscription, such as confirmation that you are a paid subscriber to the App.
Social media information, if you choose to login to the App via a third-party platform or social media network (for example, Facebook), or otherwise connect your account on the third-party platform or network to the App.
We may collect information from that platform or network, such as your social media alias, first and last name, number of âfriendsâ on the social media platform and, if depending on your Facebook or other network settings, a list of your friends or connections (though we do not use or store this information).
Our collection and processing of the information we obtain from social media platforms is governed by the requirements these social media platforms impose on us in their relevant terms and conditions.

This information may be collected on our Site using cookies, browser web storage (also known as locally stored objects, or âLSOsâ), web beacons, and similar technologies.

Many browsers accept cookies by default until you change your settings.

Similarly, your browser settings may allow you to clear your browser web storage.
