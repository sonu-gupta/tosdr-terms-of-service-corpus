 Yello Privacy Policy 

Effective Date: August 20, 2021


RECSOLU, Inc., DBA Yello (âYelloâ or âweâ or âusâ or âourâ) is committed to protecting the privacy of visitors and users of the yello.co website (the âSiteâ) and our mobile and web recruiting applications (the âAppsâ).
We want our Customers and their Authorized Users (collectively, our âCustomer(s)â) and Candidates (âCandidate(s)â) to have a positive experience while using the Site or Apps.
We respect and protect our Customersâ and Candidatesâ rights to privacy as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy applies to both the Site and the Apps. 
To provide some background to our Customers and Candidates, we primarily process personal information on behalf of and in accordance with the instructions of our Customers, who may collect such information from Candidates during the employment recruitment process or otherwise.
In addition, we act as a data controller with respect to some Candidate personal information that we make available to our Customers upon authorization from such Candidates.
We and our Customers collect such information from Candidates using the Site or the Apps.
We also work with partners, who obtain information from Candidates, and offer this information to our Customers.
The personal information from the Candidate(s) is concurrently and automatically stored and backed up from the Site and/or the Apps to servers that are under the control and in the possession of our hosting provider, who acts as our sub-processor.
It is important to note that the provision of personal data by Customers or Candidates is not mandatory, and Customers and Candidates can refrain from such provision at any time and still maintain access to the Site and Apps.

Changes to our Privacy Policy



How do we collect Candidate and Customer personal information?
Yello collects information relating to Candidates and Customersâ use of the Site and Apps in the following ways: 


Directly from Customers.
We collect information from our Customers when they sign up to use our services or interact with us. 

Directly from Candidates.
We collect information from Candidates when they register an account with us, request information, send us email, send us postal mail, speak with us on the telephone, or otherwise interact with us.
When Candidates register an account on our Site or Apps, Candidates will be prompted to give their consent to our processing of their personal data.
By indicating their consent, Candidates expressly authorize Yello to collect and process their personal data consistent with the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. 

From our apps.
We may collect information from mobile devices when our Apps are installed on mobile devices or when Candidates or Customers provide information to us via the Apps.
When Candidates install our Apps on their mobile device and sign up, they will be prompted to give their consent to our processing of their personal data.

By indicating their consent, Candidates expressly authorize Yello to collect and process their personal data consistent with the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. 


From other third party sources.
We may receive information about Candidates and Customers from our third-party service providers ( and may include sourcing partners), who help us to provide our services.
Our sourcing partners may provide us with Candidate information, collected from the Candidates, which we may share with our Customers.

Automatically as Customers and Candidates navigate the websites and apps.
Information collected automatically may include usage details, email address, IP addresses, and information collected through cookies and other tracking technologies.

What personal information do we collect?

Candidate Personal Information 

We collect Candidate personal information when Candidates register on the Site and enter their personal information and/or upload their resume.
We may collect sensitive personal information of Candidates such as ethnic origin, race, religion, and gender.
Our Customers and sourcing partners may also transfer Candidate personal information to us to enable us to share such personal information with our other Customers for recruitment and hiring purposes.
Our sourcing partners may collect and share personal information, including sensitive personal information of Candidates such as ethnic origin, race, religion, and gender. 

Customer Personal Information

Through the Site and Apps, we automatically gather certain information about the use of the Site and Apps, such as how frequently certain areas of the Site or Apps are visited or interacted with, and the date and time of Site or Mobile App visits, IP addresses and browser information, including through the use of cookies, web beacons, pixels, and other technologies.
Through use of the Site and/or Apps, we may also collect personal information directly from Yello Customers who provide their personal data to Yello for marketing purposes.
If our Customers utilize Yello owned devices in connection with the Apps or the Site, we may track such iPads or tablets, and you, as a U.S.
based Customer, consent to us tracking such iPads or tablets using Global Positioning System (GPS) technology that is installed and active on such device(s).
Such tracking will be utilized for the following purposes: (i) locating device(s) in the event that they are lost or stolen.
and/or (ii) locating devices(s) in an anonymized fashion for use on a device heat-map to be used for internal and external marketing purposes and which constitutes a map of broad-scale user activity across the globe.
Such GPS tracking will not involve any access to your personal information nor will it involve the tracking of your activity or behavior on such device(s).
If you object to such tracking, please promptly contact us via email at privacy@yello.co.
How do we use Customer personal information?
We use Customer information in order to administer our Customersâ accounts and allow them to use the Site and Apps.
We use Customer information to support and enhance our Customersâ use of the Site and its features and the Apps, including, at times and as an example, tracking emails that our Customers send. 
We also use our Customerâs personal data for any purpose for which they provide it (for example, if a Customer wishes to share its email address or personal information with us for a particular purpose).
In addition, we may send our Customers service or promotional communications, including
notifying them of new services, offerings, or changes to the Site, Apps, or this Privacy Policy.
Our Customers can opt-out of receiving these emails by contacting us at privacy@yello.co. 
We may use Customer information to enable us to display advertisements to third partiesâ target audiences.
Even though we do not disclose your personal data for these purposes without your consent, if you click on or otherwise interact with an advertisement, the advertiser may assume you meet its target criteria.
How do we use Candidate personal information?
We use Candidate personal information that we obtain directly from Candidates, from third party providers or otherwise with Candidatesâ consent to share such personal information with our Customers so they can contact Candidates for recruitment and hiring purposes. 
Do we disclose any personal information to outside parties?
We do not sell, trade, or transfer your personal information to third parties, except in the circumstances described below. 
Our Customers
As part of our service offerings, we may disclose to our Customers any Candidatesâ personal information provided to us, if Candidates consent to such disclosure.
By providing Candidatesâ personal information to our Customers, our Customers will be able to contact such Candidates to inquire about potential future hiring or recruitment opportunities.
Other Companies
We may share de-identified information and reports and analyses based on de-identified information publicly and with other companies.
Third-Party Service Providers
We may disclose personal information to our vendors and other third-party service providers that help us provide our services. 
The purpose of such disclosure is to provide our services to our Customers, and may include: the sub-processing of such personal information between our Site, the Apps, and our and our Customersâ networks.
the parsing of such personal information to allow our Customers to filter through the information that the Candidates voluntarily provide to our Customers via the Site or Apps.
and, generally, allowing our Customers to build a work candidate database based on the information provided by Candidates and manage their recruitment process. 
We may also disclose aggregated, de-identified information, and analyses and reports derived from such information, to service providers, advertisers, merchants, consumer and market research companies and other organizations.
These service providers are responsible for their own compliance with data protection laws.
Legal Requirements and Business Transfers
We may disclose personal information (i) if we are required to do so by law, legal process, statute, rule, regulation, or professional standard, or to respond to a subpoena, search warrant, or other government official requests, (ii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss, (iii) in connection with an investigation of a complaint, security threat, or suspected or actual illegal activity.
(iv) in connection with an internal audit.
or (v) in the event that Yello is subject to mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, sales of assets, reorganizations, divestitures, dissolutions, bankruptcies, liquidations, or other types of business transactions.
In these types of transactions, personal information may be shared, sold, or transferred, and it may be used subsequently by a third party. 
What choices do you have about your personal information?
We offer certain choices about how we communicate with you and what personal information we obtain about you and share with others. 
Profile 
If you have created a profile or account on our Site or Apps, you can update your contact information after you log into your account. 
E-mail 
If you no longer wish to receive promotional or informational emails from us, you may opt-out from receiving future emails from us by following the instructions for unsubscribing in the promotional or informational emails we send you or by contacting us at privacy@yello.co.
This opt-out does not apply to information provided to us as a result of product service experience requests. 
Cookies 
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can change your browserâs settings to disable all or certain cookies if you wish.
Please note that by disabling or deleting cookies, you may not be able to access the full 
functionality of our Sites.
Disabling or clearing cookies also may affect cookie-based opt-outs by either preventing you from using such cookie-based
opt-outs or clearing opt-outs that you previously set.
For more information about how we use cookies, please see our Cookie Policy. 
Data Subject Access Requests 
To the extent provided for in applicable data protection laws of Candidatesâ countries of residence, upon written request from a Candidate, with proper verification of identity at our sole discretion (e.g.
via certification from a notary public), we can promptly destroy, correct, amend and/or return, to such verified Candidate, any and all personal data in our or our sub-processorâs control or possession, subject to both our right to retain such information as deemed necessary to comply with legal obligations and the obligations detailed in our written agreements with Customers.
We will use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to such requests within the prescribed period of time set forth in applicable data protection laws.
All requests in this regard should be submitted via email to privacy@yello.co. 
Contact by our Customers 
As described above, we will disclose to our Customers Candidatesâ personal information who provide their consent, which will enable our Customers to contact such Candidates for hiring and recruitment purposes.
If a Candidate does not wish to be contacted by our Customers regarding future hiring and recruitment opportunities, they can choose not to provide their consent when prompted by us or by contacting us at privacy@yello.co. 
Accessing and Updating Personal Information and Preferences 
Authorized users of our Customers may access, update, correct, and/or delete registration and other personal information by logging into the Site or Apps and modifying their user profile, or by sending us an email at privacy@yello.co.
Customers may also close their account at any time by contacting us at privacy@yello.co.
We will take commercially reasonable steps to implement our Customersâ requests promptly, but it may take some time to process. 
While we make efforts to accommodate requests to restrict our use of personal information, we reserve the right to erase all or any portion of a Customer or Candidateâs information if we are not able to reasonably accommodate a requested restriction.
Please note that in some instances, we may not be able to delete the personal information or our Customers or Candidates except by closing such Customerâs user account.
We will notify our Customers if we are not able to accommodate their requests or if we have elected to close a Customer account as a result of a failure to accommodate such request. 
Do Not Track 
Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring Do Not Track (âDNTâ) signals, we do not respond to them at this time. 
Location Data 
You may opt-out of having your location data collected by Yello at any time by editing the appropriate setting on your mobile device (which is usually located in the settings of your device). 
Location of our Site
Our Site is hosted and operated in the United States.
However, we and our service providers may store information about individuals in the United States, or we may transfer it to, and store it within, other countries.
In very limited circumstances and at our sole discretion, we may provide certain Customers with the option to elect that their data is hosted in Ireland.
Visitors from jurisdictions outside the United States visit us at their own choice and risk.
If you are not a resident of the United States, you acknowledge and agree that we may collect and use your personal information outside your home jurisdiction, and that we may store your personal information in the United States or elsewhere.
Please note that the level of legal protection provided in the United States from which you may access our Sites may not be as stringent as that under privacy standards or the privacy laws of other countries, possibly including your home jurisdiction.
How long do we retain your personal information?
We will keep your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is permitted or required by law. 
Third party links
Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our Site or Apps.&nbsp.
These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies.
We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites.
We urge you to read the privacy policies of other websites before submitting any information to those websites.
How do we protect your information?
We are committed to protecting the information we receive from our Customers and Candidates.
We have implemented commercially reasonable, appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of data stored on the Site and on the Apps, including from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, while considering the risks involved.
including, but not limited to, severity of foreseeable harm and likelihood that our processing could threaten the individual rights and freedoms of the Candidates.
While no computer system is completely secure, we believe the measures we have implemented reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved. 
In addition, only those employees and third parties who need access to personal information in order to perform their duties are allowed such access. 
Although we do our best to protect the personal information of our Customers and Candidates, we cannot guarantee the security of personal information transmitted to the Site or Apps.
Any transmission of personal data is at the Customerâs or Candidateâs own risk.
We are not responsible for the circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site or Apps.
The safety and security of personal information also depends on the Customers and Candidates.
Customers and Candidates are responsible for keeping their self-created passwords confidential, and Customers and Candidates must not share passwords with anyone.
Customers and Candidates must also take all reasonable steps to ensure the protection of their personal information and must be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Site or Apps or elsewhere. 
Your California privacy rights
California Civil Code Section Â§1798.83 permits Customers and Candidates who utilize the Site or Apps and who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
To make such a request, please send an e-mail to privacy@yello.co.

European residents
GDPR
If you are located in the EU, you have certain rights under EU data protection law with respect to your personal data, including the right to request access
to, correct, and delete your personal data.
You may also have the right to receive a copy of your personal data in a commonly used and machine-readable format, and to transmit such data to another controller.
You also may object to processing of your personal data, or ask that we restrict the processing of your personal data in certain instances. 
Upon written request from a Candidate or Customer, with proper verification of identity at our sole discretion (e.g.
via certification from a notary public), we can promptly destroy, correct, amend and/or return to such verified Candidate or Customer any and all personal information in our or our sub-processorâs control or possession, subject to our right to retain such information as deemed necessary to comply with legal obligations.
We will use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to such requests within thirty (30) days of receipt of such request and proper identity verification.
All requests in this regard should be submitted via email to privacy@yello.co.
Please note that not all requests can be honored. 
Our legal basis for processing the personal data of Candidates is that processing is necessary for the performance of a contract, or in order to take steps at the request of the Candidate.
Yello processes Candidate personal data in order to fulfill contractual obligations with its Customers, who are Data Controllers, and have instructed Yello, as a data processor, to process the personal data of their Candidates.
Our legal basis for processing personal data of Yello Customers is that the Yello Customer(s) has given consent to the processing of their personal data for one or more specific purposes including developing new services, management and completion of demo requests, the building of leads as related to product purchases, and/or the provision of thought leadership and blog content to those Yello Customers who are voluntarily subscribed (such subscription is revocable upon written request to marketing@yello.co). 
We have formally appointed a Data Protection Officer, Greg Leighton, reachable via email at Gregory.Leighton@quarles.com, who will, amongst other things: monitor compliance with the GDPR, applicable Union or Member State data protection laws, and our policies related to the protection of personal data.
provide advice, where requested and appropriate, regarding data protection impact assessments.
reasonably cooperate with applicable
supervisory authority.
and act as the contact point on issues related to our processing of personal information. 
In light of CJEU Case C-311/18 (Schrems ii), we are amenable to entering into the Commission Decision C(2010)593 Standard Contractual Clauses (processors) with any of our Customers that are authorized to use the Site or the Apps in the EEA.
Please contact us via email at contracts@yello.co to request entrance into the Standard Contractual Clauses or for more information regarding this topic. 
Candidates have the right to submit a GDPR complaint to their local data protection authority.

Do we collect information from children?
We do not solicit any personal information from children.
If a Customer or Candidate is not 16 or older, he or she must not use the Site or Apps.
Parents should be aware there are parental control tools available online that can be used to prevent children from submitting information online without parental permission or from accessing material that is harmful to minors.

If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 16, please contact us at privacy@yello.co. 
Pursuant to CCPA, we will not sell the personal information of any consumer less than 16 years of age, unless the consumer, in the case of consumers between 13 and 16 years of age, or the consumerâs parent or guardian, in the case of consumers who are less than 13 years of age, has affirmatively authorized the sale of the consumerâs personal information.

Privacy laws and guidelines are part of a constantly changing environment.
We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Privacy Policy at any time.
