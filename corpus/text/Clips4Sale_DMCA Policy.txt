DMCA Policy

Last Updated: July 6, 2021
Termination of User Account

We will terminate a userâs access to the service if, under appropriate circumstances, the user is determined to be a repeat infringer.
We reserve the right to decide whether material or activity violates our Terms of Service for reasons other than copyright infringement, such as child pornography, obscenity, or excessive length.
We may at any time, without prior notice and in our sole discretion, remove that material or terminate a userâs account for submitting that material in violation of our Terms of Service.

Removal of Material for Which Copyright Infringement Is Claimed
 We take claims of copyright infringement seriously.
We will respond to allegations of copyright violations under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).
The DMCA provides a process for a copyright owner to give notice to an online service provider concerning alleged copyright infringement.
When an effective DMCA notice is received, the online service provider responds under this process by taking down the offending content.
On taking down content under the DMCA, we will take reasonable steps to contact the owner of the removed content so that a Counternotification may be filed.
On receiving a valid Counternotification, we generally restore the content in question, unless we receive notice from the DMCA Notice provider that a legal action has been filed seeking a court order to restrain the alleged infringer from engaging in the infringing activity.
Our privacy policy does not protect any information contained in any DMCA Counternotification.
To File a DMCA Notification.
 If you are a copyright owner or an agent of a copyright owner and belief that any Content infringes on your copyrights, you may submit a notice under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) by providing our copyright agent with the following information in writing (see 17 U.S.C.
Â§ 512 for further detail):

A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of those works at that site.
Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material.
Providing URLs in the body of your DMCA notice is the best way to help us locate content quickly.
Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted.
A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
