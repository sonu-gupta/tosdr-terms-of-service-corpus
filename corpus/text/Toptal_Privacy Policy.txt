Toptal is used by professional freelancers (âFreelancersâ) who wish to offer their development, engineering and other services (âServicesâ) and clients who need the Services (âClientsâ).
Freelancers that have passed our screening process and are admitted to our network of professional Freelancers (âNetworkâ) are referred to as âTalentâ.
For purposes of this policy the term âFreelancersâ is broader in scope and includes both Talent and Freelancers who are not Talent.
The Personal Data we receive from Freelancers and Clients and how we handle it differs, so we explain our data practices for Freelancers and Clients in two distinct sections below.
