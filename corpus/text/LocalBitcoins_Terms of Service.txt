Identity verification may be required when you create advertisements, pass certain trade volume limits, during trade disputes, fraud investigations, and to ensure account ownership.
As part of our ID verification process we require you to provide us with your full name as well as documents and photographs that verify your identity (e.g.
valid passport).

 In certain situations (e.g.
due to the regulatory or legal requirements) we may require enhanced identity verification.
This may include requirements to verify details or sources of funds regarding payments you have made or received during trades on LocalBitcoins as well as bitcoin transactions that you have sent or received from your account.
 Bitcoin Trading  You can place one or more advertisements on our platform when you wish to offer to buy or sell bitcoins.
We have the right to restrict the number of your advertisements for security reasons and reasons of suspected misconduct or fraudulent activity.

 Bitcoin trades ("trade" or "contact") to either buy or sell bitcoins are initiated by responding with a trade request to advertisements created by other users.
With the trade request you are making a legally binding offer and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of the trade (such as exchange rate, bitcoin amount and terms of payment) as determined by the advertiser to whom you are sending the trade request to.
When sending the trade request, you may need to select from options made available in the advertisements or accept any freeform terms and conditions set out by the advertiser in the Terms of trade field and displayed on the advertisement page.
The terms and conditions of the trade must be accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
In case of discrepancy, the terms of this Agreement will have precedence.

 When you are selling bitcoin it is your responsibility to check that you have received payment for the full amount, that the payment is not made by a third party to the trade, and that it was made according to your instructions given to the buyer.
After you have released a trade to the buyer it is not possible to cancel, reverse, dispute or otherwise recover or return the bitcoins to you.

 Payments made by buyers must be sent by the same person or entity who is the holder of the account or the company account.
Receiving, making, providing, or attempting to receive, make or provide payments to or from third parties is forbidden and considered a violation of this Agreement.

 All communication relevant to the trade must happen in the trade chat on our platform in such a way that it is readily available for LocalBitcoins support staff to review.
Consequently, communications on our platform are not considered private communications between you and other users, but LocalBitcoins is also a party to such communications, and may access and otherwise process such communications in accordance with the Privacy Policy.

 Communication that has not occurred on our platform or that has been hidden, encrypted or otherwise obstructed from view is not taken into consideration during dispute review and dispute resolution.
 Disputing Bitcoin Trades  When a buyer and a seller are in disagreement over a trade either party or LocalBitcoins can start a dispute ("Disputed trade or "dispute") to initiate a mediation process on the bitcoin held in escrow.
Disputed trades are reviewed and resolved by LocalBitcoins support staff.

 Disputes can only be started on trades that are open and marked as paid by the buyer but not yet released by the seller.
Trades that are not marked as paid by the buyer, have been released by the seller, cancelled by the buyer, automatically cancelled, or already disputed and resolved are considered completed and cannot be disputed, reversed, or altered.
 Unresponsiveness  When you have placed advertisements which have not expired or you are involved in a bitcoin trade it is important that you remain active and available at least until the trade is completed, canceled, or resolved.
This means that you must be able to provide a response to a request by LocalBitcoins support in a disputed trade within twenty-four (24) hours or you may be deemed as unresponsive and the dispute may be resolved against you for this reason alone.
 Dispute review  During a dispute review LocalBitcoins support may give you instructions that you are required to follow.
The instructions given to you may require you to provide proof of payment, proof that you have or have not received payment (e.g.
bank transaction history), additional ID verification, photo.
audio.
or video evidence, or any other documents deemed relevant by LocalBitcoins.
Failure to follow the instructions may lead to the dispute being resolved against you.
 Dispute resolution criteria  A disputed trade is most commonly resolved by LocalBitcoins support moving the escrowed bitcoin to the buyer or the seller of the disputed trade once the dispute resolution criteria are met.

 In rare situations where neither party fulfill the criteria, or it is in other ways unclear or not possible to determine which party has fulfilled the dispute resolution criteria, LocalBitcoins may decide to resolve the dispute by splitting the escrowed bitcoin between the buyer and the seller evenly or unevenly.
 Dispute resolution criteria  LocalBitcoins can resolve a disputed trade in the favor of a bitcoin buyer when one of the following criteria are met: 

 The buyer has made payment according to the instructions provided by the seller in the trade chat, advertisement terms of trade, or advertisement payment details and the buyer has provided sufficient proof that the payment was made according to these instructions.

 The seller has become unresponsive.


 LocalBitcoins can resolve a disputed trade in the favor of a bitcoin seller when one of the following criteria are met: 

 The buyer has not provided payment or not provided payment in full 
 The payment made by the buyer has been held/frozen/stopped by the payment provider 
 The buyer has not provided payment according to the instructions provided to them by the seller in the trade chat, advertisement terms of trade or advertisement payment details.

 The payment is made by a third party to the trade OR the payment is made from a payment account not registered in the name of the buyer.

 The buyer is not responding 

 If the buyer or the seller of a disputed trade provides fraudulent information or fraudulent documents or makes false claims or otherwise tries to force a certain outcome of a disputed trade the dispute may be immediately resolved against the user.
 Incorrect dispute resolution  If you believe LocalBitcoins has resolved a dispute you are a party of in a way which is not in accordance with these terms you have a right to request a review.
To request a review you need to notify us and specifically request a review by contacting customer support no later than 120 days after the dispute resolution has been given.

 Advertisements  You can create bitcoin trade advertisements ("advertisement" or "ad" or "ads") to advertise that you want to buy or sell bitcoins.
Other users can send trade requests to you from the advertisements that youâve created.
When a trade request is sent to you a bitcoin trade is automatically started.

 Advertisements for buying with or selling against cash are not allowed.

 When you have advertisements enabled you are required to be active and available to reply to trades started from these advertisements.
If a dispute is initiated in a trade against an advertiser who is not active and available the advertiser may be deemed unresponsive within the meaning of this Agreement and the dispute may be resolved against them.

 Information and payment details you provide in advertisements and trades must at all times be correct and up to date.
Disputes may be resolved against you if you include out-of-date payment details and a buyer completes payment accordingly.
Refusal to complete trades or to provide payment details for trades opened from your advertisements is considered a violation of this agreement.

 The price or price equation that is defined in the advertisement details must contain any and all fees that the advertiser requires the buyer to pay.
After initiation of a trade the price is locked and cannot be changed or any additional fees added without consent from both parties of the trade.

 Multiple advertisements which are fully overlapping (e.g.
using the same trade limits with the same price in the same payment method category in the same country) are not allowed.

Account limitation results in a temporary or permanent loss of access to a certain specific part or parts of the services we offer.
Account suspension results in a temporary loss of access to most parts of the services we offer.
Account termination results in permanent loss of access to all services.

 This limitation may be applied specifically to your account in order to safeguard bitcoin stored in your wallet when we e.g.
suspect a third party has gained unauthorized access to your account.

if we are provided with valid legal request from an authority.
