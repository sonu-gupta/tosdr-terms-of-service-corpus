In addition, you agree that you will be responsible for any credit card chargeback fees as well as any reasonable collection costs we incur as a result of your failure to pay on a timely basis.
9.1. Our prices for a Paid Service do not include any of the third-party fees you incur in connection with using a Paid Service including, without limitation, fees charged by your Internet access provider, any wireless carrier charges for cellular or data services and any other third party applications or services with which you may use the Paid Service.
you are responsible for selecting and managing these other services, and paying the fees for such services.
9.2. We may change the price of any Paid Service from time to time, and add new fees and charges for certain features or to reflect a change in business or legal rules, but we will provide you with advance notice of changes in recurring subscription fees.
Any increase in charges for the same Paid Service would not apply until the expiration of your then-current billing cycle, unless otherwise specifically provided in our notice to you, and would become effective no sooner than the next time you would be charged for that Paid Service.
If you do not agree to pay the new price or other applicable charges, you may elect not to renew the Paid Service subscription before the price change goes into effect, which cancellation would be effective at the expiration of your then-current billing cycle.
See cancellation policy of the applicable App Platform Providers such as Apple App Store and Google Play for information on how to cancel a Paid Service subscription.
9.3. Alight Creative enables you to purchase and/or pay for Paid Services through Alight Creative-authorized payment processors (including, for example, an App Platform Provider such as Apple or Google).
Unless otherwise expressly provided in a separate agreement with you, your obligation for payment to, and relationship with, such payment processor is a contractual matter between you and such third-party.
Alight Creative is not a party to, or responsible on account of, such contract.
While we select our payment processors carefully and enter into detailed agreements imposing performance obligations (including confidentiality) on them, we cannot and do not guarantee their performance.
We encourage you to provide any feedback regarding any payment processor with which you do business to us, as we value and use your input in determining whether to continue or end such relationships.
If you have any concerns or problems with a payment processor, please contact our customer support team as promptly as you can.

If you have purchased a subscription basis Paid Service through an App Platform Provider, you may be required to use a subscription management tool provided by the App Platform Provider to cancel such subscription basis Paid Service, or you may be required contact the App Platform Provider to process your cancellation request, as Alight Creative may have no ability to process the cancellation for you.
When available, cancellation information can be found in the My Account screen in Alight Creative branded application in which you have purchased a subscription basis Paid Service.
Any cancellation of a subscription basis Paid Service will be effective as of the end of the then-current billing period, and you may continue to use the Paid Service through the end of the period for which you have already paid.
For subscription basis Paid Services purchased via Google Play, refund requests covered by Google Playâs refund policies may be handled directly by Google Play.

Any Paid Service subscription you have purchased may be cancelled if you fail to pay the applicable subscription fees and any applicable taxes in full and in a timely manner according to this Agreement or any agreement with a third-party payment processor.
A failure to pay occurs in any situation where the applicable App Platform Provider has not received timely payment, including where any credit card issuer or payer bank refuses to transmit the funds that are then due, or the payment processor or the App Platform Provider you have contracted with notifies us of your failure to pay.
In addition, if you fail to pay for a Paid Service, we may elect to suspend your rights to use that Paid Service or we may change the type of privileges you have to a non-paid version of the service (e.g., changing to basic non-paid service version).

Alight Creative Tokens.
Alight Creative may from time to time make available, directly or through a third party, Alight Creative Tokens.
Alight Creative Tokens provide our users enhanced flexibility to customize their Alight Creative experience.
Alight Creative Tokens may be redeemed to obtain a special feature or promotional items (e.g., Tickets, Assets) offered by Alight Creative and indicated as being available for purchase with Alight Creative Tokens (a âToken Purchaseâ).
Alight Creative Tokens may also be used as credits in connection with a Promotional Subscription or another eligible promotional event or campaign, subject to the applicable terms thereof (a âTokens Transactionsâ).
The number of Alight Creative Tokens required to consummate Tokens Transactions shall be determined by Alight Creative, in our sole discretion, and may change from time to time, without advance notice.
The terms and conditions for consummating any Tokens Transactions are set forth here and may be amended in connection with any particular item and/or features (e.g., Tickets, Assets) available for a Tokens Purchase.
Alight Creative Tokens associated with your account may only be redeemed for Tokens Transactions through your account, and Alight Creative Tokens associated with multiple accounts cannot be combined for any Tokens Transaction, even if those accounts belong to or are controlled by you.
You may review the number of Alight Creative Tokens in your account by the My Account screen in any Alight Creative branded application that provides Token Purchase.
10.1. Alight Creative Tokens have no cash value, cannot be tendered for any cash amount, are non-transferable and may specify an expiration date, after which such Alight Creative Tokens are void.
Alight Creative Tokens obtained in exchange for a Promotional Code that has an Expiration Date may automatically expire and become void either a predefined period after they are applied to your account, or the original Expiration Date of the Promotional Code, whichever is later.
Alight Creative is under no obligation to accept or provide any compensation on account of any expired Alight Creative Tokens.
If we have a good faith belief that you have acquired or are attempting to use Alight Creative Tokens in a fraudulent manner, we reserve the right to cancel the Tokens in question.
10.2. Token Purchases obtained using Alight Creative Tokens are not transferable.
If any items you obtain in a Tokens Purchase are returned to Alight Creative and a refund is available according to the terms of sale or applicable law, the Alight Creative Tokens used as payment for that Tokens Purchase are returned to your account, subject to any expiration or other applicable terms and conditions associated with the Tokens Purchase.
In no event shall Alight Creative provide you with any monetary refund for the portion of a purchase paid with Alight Creative Tokens.
When Alight Creative Tokens associated with your account are used in a Tokens Transaction, you will be deemed by Alight Creative to have caused that Tokens Transaction, inasmuch as the username and password for that account are required in order to consummate the Tokens Transaction.
Accordingly, Alight Creative will not reinstate any Alight Creative Tokens once they have been applied, and Alight Creative shall not have any liability for such use, even where you claim such use was unauthorized.
10.3. Alight Creative does not authorize the use of Alight Creative Tokens to obtain any product, service or other items from any party other than Alight Creative, and Alight Creative shall not provide any third party any compensation or items of value on account of any Alight Creative Tokens you may provide to such third party.
Alight Creative reserves the right, from time to time, to impose limitations on the use of Alight Creative Tokens including, without limitation, the maximum number of Alight Creative Tokens used in Tokens Transactions in any period of time and the maximum number of Alight Creative Tokens that may be accumulated in your Alight Creative Account.
Alight Creative reserves the right to carry out the following actions without notice if we determine that any Alight Creative Tokens used in a Tokens Transaction were fraudulently obtained or invalid: (i) setoff the value of all goods, products or services obtained in such Tokens Transaction against any amounts payable by Alight Creative to you.
(ii) bill to a credit card account registered to your account or invoice you the value of all goods, products or services obtained in such Tokens Transaction.
and/or (iii) pursue any other method of recovery permissible under law.
If you receive an invoice for payment from Alight Creative on account of the use of any invalid Alight Creative Tokens, you agree to pay the required amount promptly within 30 days of receiving such invoice.
If your Alight Creative Service account is deactivated or closed, you shall lose all rights relating to the Alight Creative Tokens attributed to your account, and you forfeit and waive the right to demand any compensation from Alight Creative relating to such deactivation or closure.

We use the term âPromotional Subscriptionâ to describe the specific subscription to a subscription basis Paid Service obtained with the Promotional Code and the term âPromotional Periodâ to describe the duration of a Promotional Subscription.
A Promotional Code may specify an expiration date (âExpiration Dateâ), after which such Promotional Code shall be void.
Alight Creative is under no obligation to accept an expired or otherwise invalid or void Promotional Code.
Promotional Codes have no cash value and, except where expressly permitted by Alight Creative, are non-transferrable.
Alight Creative is under no obligation to provide any compensation in connection with a Promotional Code.
In order to obtain a Promotional Subscription, you must be a registered Alight Creative Account holder and use the registration or redemption process, and satisfy any eligibility requirements, established by Alight Creative in connection with the Promotional Code.
At the conclusion of the Promotional Period, you will be required to pay the then-applicable charges for the Paid Service in order to continue using such Paid Service.

Unless you have a separate contract with Alight Creative permitting you to distribute Alight Creative Tokens or Promotional Codes, you are prohibited from selling or otherwise distributing or transferring Alight Creative Tokens or Promotional Codes.
Alight Creative reserves the right to invalidate any Alight Creative Tokens or Promotional Codes that have been improperly issued or distributed, and we do not owe you any compensation with respect to such Alight Creative Tokens or Promotional Codes.
If a Promotional Code has been distributed to you by a third party (for example, connection with a third-party promotion), Alight Creative has no responsibility with respect to any third party product or service provided, or any marketing claims or promotional offers made, by the third party.
Alight Creative has no obligation to provide you with any compensation, or to modify the Promotional Subscription or the Promotion Requirements in connection with any Promotional Codes you obtained from a third party that was acting improperly.
