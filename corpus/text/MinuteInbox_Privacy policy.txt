This page explains our approach to privacy on all our ,websites and how it affects you.,Short version,ï·We collect anonymous statistics about your visit, like which of our pages you viewed.,ï·Some 3rd parties like Facebook, Google and Twitter may know you visited this website, if you ,use their services.
We canât control them but we donât believe this knowledge poses any ,threat to you.,ï·If you sign up with us we take great care to keep your information safe and weâll never share ,it with others without your express permission.,ï·We never share your data with 3rd parties except to help us deliver our own services.,These are just the key points.
