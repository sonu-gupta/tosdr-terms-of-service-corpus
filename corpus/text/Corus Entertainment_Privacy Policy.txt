and its affiliates understand and appreciate the concerns that parents and families may have with regard to personal information gathered on our Sites.
Corus has adopted this Privacy Policy to provide transparency to you and to ensure the confidentiality of such personal information.
INTRODUCTION
We respect your privacy and believe the best way to serve you through a Site is with honesty, accountability and adherence to legal standards.
We are extremely sensitive to the issue of privacy and have structured the features of Corusâ Kids Sites to minimize the requirement to collect personal information, and to maximize your control over the collection, use and disclosure of any personal information.

By visiting or interacting with our Sites, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy.
We may change this Privacy Policy at any time, and your continued use of our Sites indicates your agreement to the revised terms.
Accordingly, you should review this Privacy Policy from time to time to keep informed of such amendments.
The most recent date of revision will be indicated prominently at the top of the Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy applies to the Sites where this Privacy Policy is posted, and does not apply to other Sites operated by third parties.
Please read the respective Sitesâ terms of use and policies when accessing such third party sites or using such third party applications.
Please also make sure to read Corusâ Terms of Use as it supplements and forms part of this Privacy Policy.
By using the Site you are agreeing to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.
If you do not agree to the terms of this policy or any revised policy, please do not register as a user or further interact with the Site.
PRIVACY OF CHILDREN
We encourage parents and guardian to be aware of and participate in their Childrenâs online activities.
Minors (persons under the age of majority in their province or territory of residence) may not use the Site unsupervised and we ask that you do not allow your child to submit any personal information to us.
We do not knowingly collect the personal information of minors or Children.
If you believe your child has provided personal information, and you would like it deleted, please contact Corusâ Privacy Office at privacy@corusent.com.
Parents are requested to review this Privacy Policy and discuss its main features with their children, in a manner that the child will understand.
For more information and tips on how to protect your childrenâs privacy, please visit the Canadian Marketing Associationâs Special Considerations in Marketing to Children guidelines.

Throughout this Privacy Policy, references to âyouâ and âyourâ refer to the user as supervised by their parent or guardian.
PARENTAL SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS
There are software programs that allow parents to block certain websites from their kids.
Some programs are more flexible than others, so you may want to shop around to find one that youâre comfortable with.

WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?
We may collect two types of information from visitors to the Sites: Personal Information and Non-Personal Information.
The website will collect Personal Information with consent or only where it is voluntarily provided by the parent or guardian.
Non-Personal Information is any information that cannot be associated with an identifiable individual, such as aggregated statistical information (e.g.
the average length of time users spend visiting the site), or other anonymous information, such as the type and version of browser being used to access the website or application.
Your computer and its operating systems, browsers, and memory contain vast quantities of transaction data and records of your use of it.
We may also collect information about you from a social network site you may have connected from, in order to provide you with a more personalized experience.
In some cases, we will collect psychographic data from third parties that help us better understand our users.
If you send an e-mail to us, or fill out our âfeedbackâ form through the Site, we will collect your e-mail address and the full content of your e-mail, including attached files, and other information you provide.
We may use and display your full name and email address when you send an email notification to a friend through the Site or the social network from which you have connected to the website or application (such as in an invitation, or when sharing your content).
PERSONAL INFORMATION REQUIRED FOR CONTESTS
A user may be able to enter a contest through the Site.
However, only parents or those who have reached the age of majority in their province of residence may enter contests on the Site.
On the online entry form, we ask for personal information such as the entrantâs name and address.
Unless otherwise specified in the applicable contest rules, this personal information is collected, used and/or disclosed solely for the purpose of awarding contest prizes, tracking compliance with the official rules and regulations and for internal feedback purposes.
We will only use and disclose a contest winnerâs name and photograph after receiving prior written consent from the winner (or their Parent, if the winner is under the age of majority in his or her Province of residence) and the appropriate release forms are fully completed by a Parent and returned to us.
WHAT ARE YOUR CHOICES?
We do not sell or otherwise share personally identifiable information about individual users without the prior approval of the user.
On the page where we ask for that information, there is a prominently displayed method to indicate to us that you do or do not want to receive promotional and/or marketing information about products, services and offerings.
Itâs always your choice, if you choose not to receive promotional and/or marketing information we consider it an opt-out.
User consent to use Personal Information can be withdrawn at any time by unsubscribing in the manner provided on each piece of promotion and/or marketing information we send to you or by emailing our Privacy Officer at privacy@corusent.com.
WHAT ARE COOKIES AND HOW ARE THEY USED?

Cookies and other technologies, such as your deviceâs unique identifier, are used on our website to maximize the website-browsing experience.
For example, they allow us to track a browserâs movement through the website over several sessions.
Through these technologies, the website can recognize repeat visitors, facilitate the visitorâs access to and use of the website and allows the website to track usage behaviour that will allow content and service improvement and enable us to tailor our website and advertising to better match your interests and preferences.

We may use third-party advertising and analytics companies to collect Non-Personal Information and/or serve ads to users when they visit our Sites through the use of Cookies or similar technologies.
These companies may use Non-Personal Information (i.e.

Rest assured that we nor any third parties acting on our behalf collect browsing information respecting the use of the site by children, nor do we target advertising to children based on browsing activity.
We may also infer information about an adult user or a Parent based on the information you provide to us or information we receive from third parties, including information we may receive from social media sites, in accordance with your privacy settings on such Sites.
We may also collect demographic, psychographic and lifestyle profile data from third parties, which may be predictively associated with you, the adult user or Parent, based on what we know about you.
For example, data may be available suggesting common interests or attributes of people living in your postal district.
Any such information that is considered to be Personal Information, will be treated as such according to this privacy policy.
If you would prefer that we not associate such third party data with you, you may opt-out by visiting http://youradchoices.ca/choices.

WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE INFORMATION?
We work closely with a number of parties who may perform functions on our behalf, including fulfilling orders, providing streaming services or other third party content, providing promotional materials to our users, sending e-mail, managing, compiling and processing data, administering contests, processing credit card payments or providing customer service.
Data, including Personal Information, may be stored or processed outside Canada or in the cloud where it will be subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which it resides.

Where such a transaction is completed, your Personal Information may be among the transferred assets.
In such event, the purchaser will continue to be subject to the confidentiality obligations posted herein.

SHOW/CONTENT SUBMISSION
Occasionally, you will have the opportunity to submit ideas or content such as pictures, videos or audio for inclusion on the Site for airing on one of our services.

We will then send your friend an email on your behalf inviting him or her to visit the relevant webpage or check out the Site.

We make social media sharing buttons available only on portions of the Site directed to adult users and Parents.
however, the child âfocused portions of the Site do offer video content through the use of third party video-sharing widgets, which may contain sharing functionality.

Your interactions with those features are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide them.
