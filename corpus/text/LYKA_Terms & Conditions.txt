Wallet &amp.
Our Service Fee 

It is important to understand that we are not a bank and that we do not act as a fiduciary or escrow holder in respect of any balance in your Wallet.
The Wallet functionality is provided by Blue Cat and is subject to Blue Cat T&C.

In order to fund a Wallet with GEMs, payments for the issuance of GEMs by Blue Cat must be made through any permitted payment method available from time to time under âBUY GEMSâ in the account owned by the relevant registered LYKA user.
Payments to, and surrenders from Wallet will be handled by Blue Cat and any of its third party payment processors, such as PayPal.
LYKA will at no time hold or handle your debit or credit card or bank account information.
All legal compliance matters relating to anti-money laundering and/or data privacy, including implementation of Know-Yoour-Client protocols are governed by the terms and conditions of Blue Catâs chosen payment processing provider at any given time.
AS such, any concern relating to the same must be coursed through the chosen payment processing provider directly and not with LYKA.
LYKA will reflect the GEMs in your Wallet once Blue Cat confirms with LYKA the receipt of payment in cleared funds, or when another user sends you GEMs in accordance with this Agreement.


No LYKA app user may be the user of more than one Wallet registered through the LYKA App.


Payments received by Blue Cat for GEMs bought by a user is not considered income of Blue Cat, instead it is a fund kept in trust by Blue Cat until the GEMs are used by the user for the purchase of goods or service with a LYKA Merchant.
Payment by Blue Cat will be directed by LYKA to such LYKA Merchant upon surrender by the latter to Blue Cat of the GEMs used by a user to pay for goods or services.
Please note that no interest will be paid on any balance in your Wallet.
In using the LYKA app, you warrant and accept responsibility in paying any and all taxes that arise from your personal transactions through any LYKA Service.
Blue Cat, from time to time, may issue you more GEMs (than the value paid for in GEMs) as a marketing strategy or promotion to convince you and other users to use the GEMs.
These marketing GEMs do not earn interest, neither are they interest earned from existing GEMs in youâre Wallet, nor are they a gift or donation by Blue Cat to you.


In order to surrender GEMs for conversion to fiat currency, we or any LYKA Merchant may require you to provide at least one (1) valid government-issued photo ID (such as a passport or driverâs licence), in case of doubt as to the legality of your transactions or the identity of the true owner of the GEMs, which ID may likewise be shared with Blue Cat.
Please note that the surrender options of GEMs, from your Wallet may vary depending upon your country of residence and may also vary from time to time.


Blue Cat will try to process all conversions of GEMs to fiat currency upon surrender as soon as possible, but neither Blue Cat nor LYKA can or shall be responsible for payment processing, banking clearance or other matters that may delay conversions.
Please ensure you provide your account details accurately to us and Blue Cat and/or its third party payment processors.
You are solely responsible for any errors in information we receive from you.


All payments to and from an Wallet must be made in your Wallet's base currency (i.e.
the currency in which your Wallet is maintained).
The base currency used shall be reflected in the LYKA app as â1 GEM = base currencyâ.


The timings of all transactions which take place using the LYKA Service will be logged in our records.
You may check your transactions and balance of your Wallet when accessing your account.

We reserve the right to deduct any applicable taxes for any payments due to you under this Agreement as may be required by law.
You remain responsible for all taxes which are payable as a result of any revenue or income you receive as a result of your using the LYKA Service.


In return for allowing the use of the GEMs to facilitate transactions between you and LYKA Merchants, Blue Cat will deduct and retain (either for itself or to share with its contractors and partners) a service fee of an amount equal to 5% from all payments to a LYKA Merchant made by users using GEMs, to be shouldered by the LYKA Merchant.
Blue Cat may change the amount it charges from time to time by notifying you or the LYKA Merchant through the LYKA Service in accordance with Clause 12.3.
Please note that Blue Cat may charge further and additional fees for certain Wallet- related activities.
You should confirm with Blue Cat the details of any such fee prior to you incurring it but in no circumstances will LYKA be responsible to you for any such fee or cost.

If you fail to provide us or Blue Cat with bank account information to enable this and LYKA is unable to make contact with you within one (1) year of the effective date of termination of this Agreement, LYKA or Blue Cat reserves the right to donate any outstanding balance in your Wallet to a charity selected by LYKA.




LYKA may at any time suspend with immediate effect the provision to you of all or any element(s) of the LYKA Service in the event that you fail to comply with any provision set out in this Agreement or in Blue Cat T&C and/or if LYKA otherwise considers it necessary to protect the security and integrity of the LYKA Service or to comply with its legal obligations.
By way of example, in the event that you fail to provide information and documentation sufficient for LYKA and/or Blue Cat to comply with its respective legal obligations relating to anti-money laundering, then LYKA would be entitled to deny you access to all financial and transactional elements of the LYKA Service but may (in LYKA' discretion) still allow you to use the instant messaging elements of the LYKA Service.

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate any user if LYKA reasonably believes that such complaint is substantiated and/or that the relevant user is in breach of their agreement with us.
We also reserve the right to pass a complaint to Blue Cat if we deem it appropriate to do so. 12.
General Terms 

LYKA reserves the right to discontinue all or any aspect of the LYKA Service at any time.


You may only use the LYKA Service in accordance with these Terms &amp.
Conditions and the rest of the Agreement (as may be amended from time to time).


Unless otherwise specified, any notices that you are required to give us under this Agreement should be sent to our email address published from time to time on the LYKA app or LYKA website (support@mylyka.com).
We will send any notices that we are required to give you under this Agreement by sending an email to the email address you gave us when you registered or have subsequently updated and/or by notifying you of a change when you next start the LYKA app and/or by uploading notices on to the LYKA website.


We may transfer our rights and obligations under this Agreement to another organisation, and we will always notify you in writing if this happens, but this will not affect your rights or our obligations under this Agreement.
We will wherever possible provide you with prior notice.


This contract is between you and LYKA.
No other person shall have any rights to enforce any of its terms.
However, please note that the Wallet functionality is provided by Blue Cat and is subject to Blue Cat T&C, thus, is a contract between you and Blue Cat, or you and the chosen payment processing provider, whichever is applicable.


The unenforceability or invalidity of any clause in this Agreement shall not have an impact on the enforceability or validity of any other clause.
Any unenforceable or invalid clause shall be regarded as removed to the extent of its unenforceability and invalidity.
Therefore, this Agreement shall be interpreted and enforced as if it did not contain the said clause only to the extent necessary to make this Agreement enforceable and valid.


If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under this Agreement or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have given up or waived our rights against you and it will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations.
If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.


This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between the parties involved to this Agreement, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous negotiations and understandings between the parties, whether oral or written, expressed or implied.


We cannot be responsible for any failure or delay in providing the LYKA Service because of factors which could be reasonably considered outside our control such as public communications network performance, congestion and connectivity, the performance of your handset or other equipment and unpredictable events such as adverse weather conditions or technical failures (including where such technical failures are as a result of the activity of hackers) which might disrupt our business despite our reasonable preventative measures and steps to overcome them.


We will try and solve any disagreements quickly and efficiently.
If you are not happy with the way we deal with any disagreement you and we may agree to refer the matter to arbitration but you and we are not restricted from bringing court proceedings in HK-SAR, where the terms herein shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, HK-SAR law.
