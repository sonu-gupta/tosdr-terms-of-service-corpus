Data Processing.
In order to provide the Service, UpCloud may process personal data on behalf of the Customer as a data processor for the purposes of providing the Service.
UpCloud processes certain personal data also as a data controller.
Such personal data includes, inter alia, data of the Customerâs contact persons, invoicing details and other personal data of Customerâs contact persons which UpCloud processes in order to maintain the customer relationship.
The requirements relating to the personal data UpCloud processes as data controller are set out in our Privacy Policy available on UpCloudâs website.
In this section, âPersonal Dataâ refers to any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person the Customer enters into the Service and UpCloud processes on behalf of the Customer in the course and within the scope of providing the Services.
In connection with the use of the Service, the Customer may transfer various data to UpCloud for processing on behalf of the Customer.
Such data might include Personal Data.
The Customer shall be considered as the sole data controller and UpCloud as the sole data processor with respect to such data.
The following terms and conditions set forth in this section concern the data processing activities of UpCloud as a data processor with respect to the Personal Data it processes on behalf of the Customer.

This does not include any personal data you store on your cloud servers, which are not accessible by us and under your sole discretion.

General requirements relating to processing of Personal Data.
The Customer shall be responsible for the lawful collection, processing and use, and for the accuracy of the Personal Data, as well as for preserving the rights of the individuals concerned.
If and to the extent legally required, the Customer shall inform the individuals concerned regarding the processing of their Personal Data by UpCloud, and shall obtain their consent if necessary.
The Personal Data processed by UpCloud on behalf of the Customer may include e.g.
Personal Data of the Customerâs employees and end-customers, such as contact details of the aforementioned data subjects.
The Customer acknowledges that due to the nature of the Service, UpCloud cannot control and has no obligation to verify Personal Data the Customer transfers to UpCloud for processing on behalf of the Customer when the Customer uses the Service.
The Customer ensures that the Customer is entitled to transfer the Personal Data to UpCloud so that UpCloud may lawfully process the Personal Data on behalf of the Customer in accordance with this Agreement.
UpCloud shall not use Personal Data for any purpose other than that of rendering and providing the Service and will not assert liens or other rights over, or sell or disclose the Personal Data to any third parties, without the Customerâs prior written approval.
UpCloud shall process Personal Data in accordance with this Agreement and documented instructions from the Customer.
The Customerâs instructions must be commercially reasonable, compliant with applicable data protection laws and consistent with this Agreement.
UpCloud shall not be obliged to verify whether any instructions given by the Customer are consistent with applicable laws, as the Customer is responsible for such compliance verification of its instructions.
However, if UpCloud detects that any instruction given by the Customer is non-compliant with the requirements of any data protection legislation applicable to UpCloudâs operations, UpCloud shall inform the Customer in writing.
UpCloud and the Customer shall comply with the EU Regulation 2016/679 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (âRegulationâ) and any applicable European or foreign data protection laws as amended, as well as data protection authoritiesâ orders and guidelines.
UpCloud and the Customer shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect the Personal Data within their area of responsibility, in order to safeguard the Personal Data against unauthorised or unlawful processing or access and against accidental loss, destruction or damage.
Such measures include where necessary and appropriate, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons the following measures:

access right controls to systems containing Personal Data;
the pseudonymisation and encryption of Personal Data;
the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services;
the ability to restore the availability and access to Personal Data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident;
a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures for ensuring the security of the processing.



tl;dr If you collect or process any personal data using our services, you are required to follow the General Data Protection Regulation.

UpCloudâs assistance obligations.
To respond to requests from individuals exercising their rights as foreseen in applicable data protection law, such as the right of access and the right to rectification or erasure, the Customer shall primarily use the corresponding functions of the Services, such as the UpCloud Control Panel.
UpCloud shall provide the Customer with commercially reasonable assistance, without undue delay, taking into account the nature of the processing.
UpCloud shall further provide the Customer with commercially reasonable assistance in ensuring compliance with the Customerâs obligations to perform security and data protection assessments, breach notifications and prior consultations of the competent supervisory authority, as set out in the applicable data protection law, taking into account the nature of the processing and the information available to UpCloud.
In case such assistance requires extensive measures from UpCloud, the Customer shall pay additional reasonable remuneration to UpCloud for handling such assistance requests.
In addition, UpCloud shall, and shall procure that its personnel (including its subcontractorsâ personnel) shall:

only process Personal Data in accordance with the Customerâs written instructions and not for UpCloudâs own purposes;
ensure that individuals processing Personal Data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.



tl;dr You can exercise your right to view, modify, or delete your personal data through the UpCloud control panel.
In cases where you collect and process any personal data, we can help you to ensure compliance with GDPR.
Please note that extensive work may include additional costs.

Transfers of Personal Data.
The Customer accepts that UpCloud may have Personal Data processed and accessible by its subprocessors outside the Customerâs country of domicile to provide the Service.
In case the processing is subject to any EU data protection law and Personal Data is transferred from the European Economic Area (âEEAâ) to a subprocessor for processing in any country outside the EEA that is not recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data, UpCloud provides for appropriate safeguards by standard contractual clauses, adopted or approved by the European Commission and applicable to the processing by the non-EEA subprocessor or by any other appropriate safeguard as foreseen under Regulation.


tl;dr If we need to transfer your personal data to another country outside the EU weâll ensure the data remains secure.

Audits.
The Customer shall have the right to audit the facilities and processing activities of UpCloud under this Agreement to examine the level of protection and security provided for Personal Data processed under this Agreement and to assess the compliance of UpCloud with the terms and conditions relating to Personal Data set out herein.
Each Party shall bear its own costs for any such audit.
Where an audit may lead to the disclosure of business or trade secrets of UpCloud or threaten intellectual property rights of UpCloud, the Customer shall employ an independent expert to carry out the audit, and the expert shall agree to be bound to confidentiality to UpCloudâs benefit.


tl;dr You have the right to audit our personal data protection and security processes.
If the audit would contain confidential information, you will need to employ an independent expert to do the audit.

Subprocessors.
General authorization.
The Customer gives its general authorization to allow UpCloud to involve UpCloudâs affiliated companies and other subcontractors as subprocessors to process Personal Data in connection with the provision of the Service, to the extent such appointment does not lead to non-compliance with any applicable law or UpCloudâs obligations under this Agreement.
UpCloud ensures that the involved subprocessors are properly qualified, will be under a data processing agreement with UpCloud, and comply with data processing obligations similar to the ones which apply to UpCloud under this Agreement.
UpCloud shall be liable towards the Customer for the processing of Personal Data carried out by UpCloudâs subprocessors.


tl;dr We might use third-parties that need to process your personal data to provide you with our services.
In such case weâll make sure they secure your data according to the same requirements as we do.

Change of subprocessor.
UpCloud is free to choose and change its subprocessors.
Upon request, UpCloud shall inform the Customer of subprocessors currently involved.
In case there is a later change of subprocessor (addition or replacement), UpCloud shall notify the Customer of such change.
In case the Customer objects such change of subprocessor on reasonable grounds, the Customer has the right to request change of the subprocessor.
If UpCloud is not willing to change the subprocessor the Customer has objected, the Customer shall have the right to terminate the Service and this Agreement.


tl;dr We can change partners when needed.
You can ask about our current partners that might process your personal data and weâll let you know if they change in the future.

Breaches.
UpCloud shall, without undue delay after having become aware of it, inform the Customer in writing about any data breaches relating to Personal Data and any other events where the security of Personal Data processed on behalf of the Customer has been compromised.

description of the nature of the breach;

Deletion and return of Personal Data.
UpCloud shall not take any action to intentionally erase any Personal Data processed on behalf of the Customer, without the Customerâs explicit request.
Personal Data shall be processed under this Agreement until the Customer has ceased to use the Service.
Within a reasonable time after the termination or expiry of this Agreement, or after the Customer has permanently ceased to use the Service, UpCloud shall permanently delete Personal Data from its storage media, except to the extent that UpCloud is under a statutory obligation to continue storing such Personal Data.
On the Customerâs request, UpCloud shall confirm the deletion in writing.
The obligation to delete Personal Data shall not apply to Personal Data contained in regular back-up copies of comprehensive datasets from which the individual deletion of Personal Data would not be possible without significant efforts or costs.


tl;dr We will delete your personal data if requested, to the extent we are allowed to, and confirm it to you in writing.

Confidentiality.
The Parties may exchange confidential information during the performance of this Agreement.
Confidential information shall mean any information which is marked as confidential or which should be understood as confidential, irrespective of its form of storage or disclosure.
All confidential information shall remain the property of the disclosing Party and the receiving Party shall keep confidential and refrain from using such confidential information otherwise than for the purposes of this Agreement, during the term of this Agreement and after the termination of this Agreement.
For the avoidance of doubt, any information of or relating to a Party or that Partyâs personnel, suppliers, contractors, customers or end-users, which information is obtained or detected by the other Party or processed or generated in the course of providing or receiving the Service shall be deemed confidential information of that Party.
Each Party shall promptly upon termination of the Service cease using confidential material and information received from the other Party and use reasonable means to destroy such material.
Each Party shall, however, be entitled to retain the copies required by law or regulations.


tl;dr We will keep any confidential information we have exchanged between each other secured, and we expect you to do the same.

Limited Liability.
UpCloud will not be liable for indirect damage or consequential damages caused to the Customer.

Force Majeure.
Force Majeure is an event that prevents, or makes unduly difficult, the performance of the Service or the fulfilment of the provisions of the Agreement, such as war, rebellion, natural catastrophe, general interruption in energy distribution or telecommunications, fire, strike, embargo, or another equally significant and unforeseen event independent of the parties.
Each Party shall be entitled to suspend its duties without liability thereof in case of Force Majeure affecting the Party either directly or through its subcontractor.


tl;dr Neither of us can be held responsible in a case of a major issue that is out of our hands.

Severability.

The Parties shall attempt through negotiation in good faith to replace the unenforceable provision with such provisions that correspond as closely as possible to the original intention of the Parties.

Service Level Agreement

Scope. This service level agreement (âSLAâ) is an integral part of the Contract between UpCloud and the Customer.

Service Guarantee. UpCloud will guarantee 100% virtual server and network availability to the Customer.

Scheduled Interruptions. UpCloud will notify the Customer by e-mail or on UpCloudâs website about scheduled interruptions in the provision of the Services at least 24 hours in advance, with the exception of important security updates and patches which UpCloud may deploy without prior notice.

Error Notifications. In case of an interruption in the Services, the Customer has to notify UpCloud by e-mail to outages@upcloud.com.

Payment of Compensation. When a failure in the Services has been corrected, UpCloud will offer the Customer compensation which the Customer may reclaim within 15 days.
