Privacy Shield Framework and Related Information

Slashdot complies with the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S.
Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data.
For purposes of this Policy, âPersonal Dataâ means information that (i) is transferred from the EU to the United States, (ii) is recorded in any form, (iii) is about, or relates to, an identified or identifiable individual, and (iv) can be linked to that individual.
Slashdot has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.
If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.
To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, visit the U.S.
Department of Commerceâs Privacy Shield List.
[https://www.privacyshield.gov/list]
Slashdot is responsible for the processing of Personal Data it receives, under the Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf.
Slashdot complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of Personal Data from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.
With respect to Personal Data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, Slashdot is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S.
Federal Trade Commission.
In certain situations, Slashdot may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

EU and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact Slashdot at: Slashdot Media LLC, PO Box 2452, La Jolla, CA 92038 or email us at privacy@slashdotmedia.com.
Further, we require service providers to whom we disclose Personal Data and who are not subject to laws based on the European Union General Data Protection Regulation to either subscribe to the United States / European Union Privacy Shield principles or agree to provide at least the same level of protection for Personal Data as is required by the relevant Privacy Shield principles, for instance by entering into Standard Contractual Clauses, as promulgated by the European Commission.
If the third party does not comply with its privacy obligations, Slashdot will take commercially reasonable steps to prevent or stop the use or disclosure of Personal Data.
Slashdot has further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to European Data Protection Authorities (EU DPAs) or the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC), alternative dispute resolution providers located in each EU country or Switzerland, respectively.

We may disclose information submitted by or concerning any visitor or user as we reasonably feel is necessary to protect our systems, servers, networks or business, to protect and defend our rights or property and/or the rights or property of third parties (as permitted by law), and/or to detect, prevent or otherwise address security or technical issues;
We may also disclose your Personal Information as required by law or regulation, such as to comply with legal processes and/or to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate and address fraud, or respond to a government request.
We cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who may be using our systems, servers, networks or the Services for illegal activities.

EEA Rights under the GDPRUsers who are resident in the European Economic Area (EEA) have additional rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and applicable law.
EEA users benefit from our certification to Privacy Shield, which is described at the beginning of this Privacy Policy.
To make this section more reader-friendly, we use everyday words such as use, transfer and storage to describe what we do with your Personal Information â but this Notice covers processing of any kind that is subject to EEA data protection law.
Slashdot processes Personal Information as a âprocessor,â âjoint controller,â and as a âcontrollerâ under the European Unionâs General Data Protection Regulation.
A âcontrollerâ is an entity that determines the purposes for which and the manner in which any personal information is processed.
Any third parties that act as our service providers are âdata processorsâ that handle your Personal Information in accordance with our instructions.
With respect to your Personal Information that you enter or that is received through our Sites, Slashdot is the controller.

How we will use and share your Personal Information: We will use and share your Personal Information as described in this section and elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.

How we secure your data: See our description of our security practices here.

Basis for processing of your Personal Information: We rely on three primary bases for processing EEA Personal Information.

The first one is our legitimate interests, which we weigh against any risks to your rights.
By âlegitimate interests,â we mean the ordinary needs and objectives of a business that offers the types of services available on our Sites, including security, quality assurance (such as preventing the dissemination or malware and misuse of our Sites and services), customer service, communicating with users to better serve them, and improving and developing new products and services.
The second one is when processing is necessary to enter into or perform a contract with you.
The third basis is consent â you will know when we are relying on consent because we will have expressly asked you for your consent (and if you donât give us consent, we wonât perform the processing in question).
Also, the sections titled âHow we use Personal Informationâ and âHow we share information we gatherâ flag the uses that are based on consent by marking them with an asterisk.
We may also process your Personal Information on the basis that we need to do so to fulfill our legal obligations.
We expect this would be a rare situation.


Revoking your consent: If you have given us consent to process your Personal Information, you can withdraw it by emailing us at privacy@slashdotmedia.com.
You can withdraw your consent at any time, although your withdrawal will not apply to processing that took place with your consent before you withdrew it.

âSpecialâ or âsensitiveâ personal data: We do not intentionally collect any Personal Information that is considered âspecialâ or âsensitiveâ under the GDPR, including racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade-union membership, genetic data, biometric data or data concerning health or anything to do with a personâs sexuality.
We also do not collect information about criminal convictions or offenses.
We request that you refrain from sharing any such Personal Information via the Sites or in connection with our Services.

Access, correction, restriction and deletion. Your right to access your data and/or correct your data, and how to make a request, is described in the section titled âAccess.â You may request a copy of your Personal Information, and we reserve the right to charge a reasonable administrative fee for providing a copy to you, as permitted by applicable law.
You may also request that your data be deleted, and we will comply with your deletion request unless applicable law permits us to refuse the request, in which case we will tell you that we have rejected your request and give you the reasons why.
You may request that the use of your Personal Information be restricted, subject to Article 21 of the GDPR.
If you make a data restriction request, we will discuss it with you and, in any event, we will comply with any obligations we may have under Article 21 of the GDPR.
Where appropriate, we may address your request by de-identifying the data such that it no longer identifies you, consistent with applicable law.

Data Portability.
The GDPR provides certain rights relating to data portability.
You may request data portability to the extent provided by applicable law.

Profiling. Paragraph (b) under the section titled âHow we share information we gatherâ describes how we use Personal Information for profiling, and how we share profiles with third parties.
You can opt out of profiling for direct marketing at any time by contacting us at privacy@slashdotmedia.com and we will honor your request.
When we engage in profiling for other purposes that donât involve direct marketing, we will consider your request and honor it unless we determine that we have compelling legitimate in continuing the profiling that override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, or the continued profiling is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
We expect that this would be rare, but one example might be profiling to prevent fraud or the misuse of our Sites and Services.
We will explain our reasoning to you if we reject your request to stop profiling.
