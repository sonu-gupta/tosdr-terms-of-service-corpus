California law requires us to disclose how the Services respond to these kinds of âDo Not Trackâ signals.
Like many websites, the Services currently are not designed to respond to âDo Not Trackâ signals from visitors' browsers.
To learn more about âDo Not Trackâ you may wish to visit this site.

Information You Disclose Publicly or to Others.
The Services may permit you to post or submit User Generated Content (âUGCâ) including, without limitation, written content, user profiles, audio or visual recordings, computer graphics, pictures, data, or other content, including personal information.
If you choose to submit UGC to any public area of the Services, your UGC will be considered âpublicâ and will be accessible by anyone, including Student Brands.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, unless otherwise explicitly agreed by us, personal information included in UGC is not subject to our usage or sharing limitations, or other obligations, and may be used and shared by Student Brands and third parties to the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law.
We encourage you to exercise caution when making decisions about what you disclose in such public areas.
For more information on how UGC is treated under the Services' Terms of Use click https://www.cram.com/about-us/terms.

California minors should see the âMinorsâ section below regarding potential removal of certain UGC they have posted on the Services. 5.
Third-Party Content, Third-Party Services, Social Features, Advertising and Analytics.

 Third-Party Services.

Third-Party Services may use their own Tracking Technologies to independently collect information about you and may solicit personal information from you.
For example, Student Brands maintains its own branded pages on various social networks.
When you visit these branded social media pages, the provider of the social network and other Third-Party Services may set Tracking Technologies on your browser or device.


 Social Features.

Certain functionalities on the Services may permit interactions that you initiate between the Services and certain Third-Party Services, such as third-party social networks (âSocial Featuresâ).
Examples of Social Features include: enabling you to send content such as contacts and photos between the Services and a Third-Party Services.
âlikingâ or âsharingâ Student Brands content.
logging in to the Services using your Third-Party Services account (e.g., using Facebook Connect to sign-in to the Services).
and to otherwise connect the Services to a Third-Party Services (e.g., to pull or push information to or from the Services).
If you use Social Features, and potentially other Third-Party Services, information you post or provide access to may be publicly displayed on the Services (see âInformation You Disclose Publicly or to Othersâ section above) or by the Third-Party Services that you use.
Similarly, if you post information on a third-party service that references the Services (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with Student Brands or its affiliates in a tweet or status update), your post may be used on or in connection with the Services or otherwise by Student Brands and its affiliates.
Also, both Student Brands and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of the Services and any Third-Party Services.


 Advertising.

We may engage and work with Service Providers and other third parties to serve advertisements on the Services and/or on Third-Party Services.
Some of these ads may be tailored to your interest based on your browsing, across time, of the Services and elsewhere on the Internet, which may include use of data from cross-device usage, sometimes referred to as âinterest-based advertisingâ and âonline behavioral advertisingâ (âInterest-based Advertisingâ), which may include sending you an ad on a third-party service after you have left the Services (i.e., âretargetingâ).
Our advertisers' and ad networks' use of Tracking Technologies are governed by their own privacy policies.


 Your Tracking Technologies Choices.

Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some instances blocked in the future by selecting certain settings.
Browsers offer different functionalities and options so you may need to set them separately.
Also, tools from commercial browsers may not be effective with regard to some Tracking Technologies, such as HTML5 cookies.
Please be aware that if you disable or remove these technologies, some parts of the Services may not work and that when you revisit the Services your ability to limit browser-based Tracking Technologies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.
Some App-related Tracking Technologies in connection with non-browser usage (e.g., most functionality of a mobile app) can only be disabled by uninstalling the app.
To uninstall an app, follow the instructions from your operating system or handset manufacturer.
Apple and Google mobile device settings have settings to limit ad tracking, and other tracking, but these may not be completely effective.
Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a âDo Not Trackâ signal to online services you visit.
Note, however, there is no consensus among industry participants as to what âDo Not Trackâ means in this context.
Like many online services, we currently do not alter our practices when we receive a âDo Not Trackâ signal from a visitor's browser.
To find out more about âDo Not Track,â you can visit https://www.allaboutdnt.com, but we are not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of this third-party information.
You have the right to request information from us about the Services that currently do not respond to "do not track" mechanisms featured in any Internet browser by contacting us according to the âHow to Contact Usâ section below.
Many advertisers and service providers that perform advertising-related services for us and third parties participate in voluntary programs that provide tools to opt-out of such interest-based advertising such as the Digital Advertising Alliance's (âDAAâ) Self- Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising.
To learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding Interest-based Advertising for DAA members, visit here and here for information on the DAA's opt-out program for mobile apps.
Some of these companies also are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (âNAIâ).
To learn more about the NAI and your opt-out options for their members, see here.
You can also go to here to adjust your advertising preferences with our service provider, NextRoll, Inc.
(which used to be called AdRoll), or here to opt out of the use of your data by one of our other service providers, LiveRamp.
Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads.
Opting out only means that those selected, participating members should no longer deliver certain interest-based advertising to you but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks).
Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit these opt-out webpages, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different device or web browser or use a non-browser-based method of access (e.g., mobile app), your browser-based opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective.
We support the ad industry's 2009 Self-regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ven-principles-07-01-09.pdf) and expect that ad networks that we directly engage to serve you interest-based advertising will do so as well, though we cannot guaranty their compliance.
We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties' opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.
In addition, we may serve ads on third-party services that are targeted to reach people on those services that are also identified on one of more of our databases (âMatched List Adsâ).
This is done by using Tracking Technologies, or by matching common factors between our databases and the databases of the third-party services.
We are not responsible for these third-party services, including without limitation their security of the data.
We are not responsible for such third parties' failure to comply with your or our opt-out instructions as they may not give us notice of opt-outs to our ads that you give to them, and they may change their options without notice to us or you.


 Analytics.

We may use Third-Party Services such as Google Analytics and Sailthru to help us analyze our performance and our delivery of services and advertising to you.
For example, we may use Remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting.

You may exercise your choices regarding the use of cookies by Google Analytics by using the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on or by going to https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ and following the instructions.
You may exercise your choices regarding the use of cookies by our other analytics vendor, Sailthru, by going to https://www.sailthru.com/legal/privacy-statement and following the instructions.
We and third-party vendors, including Google, may use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to report how your ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our site.




 6.
Opting Out of Promotional Communications.
You can make choices about how your information may be used by us to provide information and offers to you.
You may opt out of commercial messages by clicking on the "opt out" or "unsubscribe" link provided with each message.

Opting Out of Providing Personal Information Through the Apps.
You may be able to enable or disable certain permissions features (e.g., allowing the App to: read, modify, or delete the contents of your USB storage.
take pictures and videos.
view Wi-Fi connection) by adjusting the permissions in your device.
If you no longer want to provide any information to us through the Apps, you may uninstall them from your device. 8.
Accessing and Changing Information.
We may provide web page(s), other mechanisms or processes allowing you to delete, correct, or update some of the personal information that we collect from you, and potentially certain other information about you (e.g., profile and account information).
We will make good faith efforts to make requested changes in our then-active databases as soon as practicable, but it is not always possible to completely change, remove or delete all of your information or public postings from our databases and residual and/or cached data may remain archived thereafter.
Further, we reserve the right to retain data: (a) as required by applicable law.
and (b) for so long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes for which the data is retained except to the extent prohibited by applicable law.

We will then make reasonable, good faith efforts to remove the post from prospective public view or anonymize it so the minor cannot be individually identified to the extent required by applicable law.

For instance, third parties may have republished or archived content by search engines and others that we do not control.

 Your California Privacy Rights.
The California Consumer Privacy Act (âCCPAâ), which provides California Consumers certain rights regarding their Personal Information (âPIâ) as those terms are defined in the CCPA, became effective on January 1, 2020.
We are providing you with notice of the PI we collect and our purposes for that collection for data that may be subject to the CCPA (âCCPA Noticeâ).
This CCPA Notice does not cover information that is outside of the scope of the CCPA.
This notice also does not apply to data collected from employees, applicants or contractors or to data collected from individuals acting as representatives of another business in connection with business communications or transactions.
We collect PI directly from you, your device or browser, your education institution, our service providers and suppliers, and our corporate affiliates.
We use and share PI for the following business purposes:

to provide requested products and Services;
to advertise and offer new products and services;
to improve our products and services;
for quality assurance;
for research development;
for prevention of fraud and illegal activity.
and
for marketing purposes.

We may also collect, use and share PI for our operational purposes as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
We collect the following categories of PI from Consumers which we share with our service providers, agents and licensees who perform services on our behalf, with our affiliates, and with your education institution: 

identifiers (e.g., name, phone number, email address, I.P.
address);
personal records (e.g., name, phone number, email address);
customer account details / commercial information (e.g., your order history);
internet usage information (e.g., information regarding your interaction with our online services);
geolocation data (e.g., your general location based on your I.P.
address).
and
inferences from PI collected (e.g., your preferences, your performance).

If you are a California Consumer and would like to register a request under your âright to know about personal information collected, disclosed or soldâ (including right to obtain copies of specific pieces and/or information about categories of PI practices), âright to request deletion of personal information,â or âright to opt-out of the sale of personal information,â you can contact us at CaliforniaPrivacy@BNED.com or toll-free at 833-729-0427.
You may opt out of cookies and other tracking technologies by clicking on the CA Do Not Sell My Personal Information link at the bottom of this website.
You have the right to not receive discriminatory treatment in a manner prohibited by the CCPA as a result of your exercising your rights under the CCPA.
To fulfill your CCPA request, we may require you to provide sufficient information to reasonably verify you are the Consumer about whom we collected PI.
This verification process includes providing us at least two (2) unique data points, depending on the type of request.
Consumers have the right to exercise CCPA privacy rights via an authorized agent who meets the agency requirements of the CCPA.
Authorized agent requests must include a copy of the agency agreement between the authorized agent and the consumer.
We will ask the consumer to independently confirm the agency relationship.

Specific Pieces. You have the right, subject to statutory exceptions, to make or obtain a transportable copy, no more than twice in a twelve-month period, of your PI that we have collected in the period that is 12 months prior to the request date and are maintaining.

 The Right to Deletion You have the right, subject to statutory exceptions, to request that we delete your PI that we have collected directly from you and are maintaining.
Note also that we are not required to delete your PI that we did not collect directly from you.
You may alternatively exercise more limited control of your PI by instead by canceling or modifying our email marketing communications you receive from us.
