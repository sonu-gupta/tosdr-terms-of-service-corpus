Access and rectification: We strive to ensure that information we have about you is accurate and current.
You may obtain confirmation as to whether or not PII concerning you exists, regardless of whether PII has already been recorded, and to be communicated such information in a readily understandable form.
If you want to review the PII you have provided to us, or believe that the information we have about you is inaccurate, you should make a request by following the instructions below.
Choice &amp.
Objection to processing: With limited exceptions, you may choose to change how we use your PII at any time by following the instructions below on making a request.

You may object, in whole or in part, on legitimate grounds, to the processing of your PII, even where such processing is relevant to the purpose of the collection.
In addition, you may choose whether to share information about yourself and the use of our sites with third parties such as social media sites.
You can also choose whether to receive marketing messages from us (see your options in our âDo we use your PII to market to you?â section above) and you may object, in whole or in part, to such processing.
Restriction of processing: In specific cases (e.g., if you challenge the accuracy of the PII, while this is being checked), you can request a restriction on the processing of your PII, which can only be processed to file or defend claims.

b) of the purposes and methods of the processing.
