Cookies





Cookies are small web files that a site or its provider transfers to your deviceâs hard drive through your web browser that enables the siteâs or providerâs system to recognize your browser and remember certain information.





How We Use Cookies

2b.
Web Beacons





 Web beacons, also known as web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs, are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our Site to deliver or communicate with cookies, in order to track and measure the performance of our Site and Services, monitor how many web visitors we have, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising.
Unlike cookies, which are stored on the userâs hard drive, web beacons are typically embedded invisibly on webpages (or in an email).

Targeted Advertising





We (or our service providers) may use the information we collect, for instance, IP addresses and unique mobile device identifiers, to locate or try to locate the same unique users across multiple browsers or devices (such as smartphones, tablets, or computers), or work with providers that do this, in order to better tailor content and features and provide you with a seamless experience across devices.
If you wish to opt out of such cross device tracking for purposes of interest-based advertising, you may do so through your device settings.
We may also use cross-device tracking to help identify our users and serve advertising.
This type of advertising is often called âinterest-basedâ or âpersonalizedâ advertisingâand when it occurs on mobile apps, âcross-appâ advertising.



You can learn more about interest-based advertising and how to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising by visiting (i) the Network Advertising Initiativeâs Consumer Opt-Out link or (ii) the Digital Advertising Allianceâs Consumer Opt-Out link.
To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, you can visit the Google Ads Settings page.
California users can also opt-out of receiving interest-based advertising based on your browser by opting out using the Do Not Sell link on the DoorDash.com homepage.
That opt-out is only effective on the browser level and on www.doordash.com.&nbsp.
If you clear your cookies on this browser or use a different browser, you will need to renew your request. 



Please note that even if you opt-out, you may still receive advertisements from us.
However, in that case, the advertising will not be tailored to your interests.
Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs.





2e.
Mobile Applications





Depending on your permissions, we may receive your Personal Information from your Internet service and mobile device providers.
Users of mobile devices who do not want to receive interest-based advertising may opt-out in several ways.
Learn more about your choices for mobile devices by visiting http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices.
Each operating system, (iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices) provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements.
You should view your device or system âSettingsâ to determine how you can opt out of use of your device ID for âcross-appâ personalized advertising.
