This type of information may be collected in our log files each time you interact with (i.e., make a request to) the Services.
We use internal tools and third party applications and services (like Google Analytics) to collect and analyze this information.
Some of this information may also be associated with the Internet Protocol Address (âIP Addressâ) used to access the Services.
some may be connected with your Account.
and some may only be collected and used in aggregate form (as a statistical measure that wouldnât identify you or your Account).

your web browser stores these cookies in a way associated with each website you visit, and you can generally see your cookies through your browser settings, depending on what browser youâre using.
A web tag is code or a pixel embedded in a web page, or email, that allows Podyssey or a third party to see that you have looked at that page.
We use cookies and web tags to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you use the Services, as described above in âInformation Related to Use of the Services.â Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain information that personally identifies you, and we donât combine the general information collected through cookies with other such information to tell us who you are.
However, we do use cookies to identify that you have logged in, and that your web browser has accessed the Services, and we may associate that information with your Account if you have one.
We may also store unique or near-unique identifiers that we associate with your Account in our cookies.
This information, in turn, is sometimes used as described above in âInformation Related to Use of the Services.â Most web browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your web browser) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways.
Some services that we use (including Third Party Services), such as Google Analytics, use web tags and may also place their own cookies on your browser, and individual blogs on our network may contain code that places their own cookies.
We also run limited-time studies using web tags, sometimes with third parties, to, for example, measure the effectiveness of our advertising or email.
Note that, unless otherwise disclosed, this Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties.With Whom Your Information Is SharedWe never share information we receive from you unless: (a) we have your permission to share that information.
(b) we have given you prior notice that the information will be shared, and with whom (such as in this Privacy Policy).

Because this kind of information can be seen by anyone and may be indexed by search engines (like Google Search), you should be careful about what you choose to disclose publicly and make sure itâs information you want to share with everyone.
####Information You Share with Third Party Services You may access Third Party Services through the Services, for example by clicking on externally-pointing links.
You may also choose to share information that you provide to us, like blog posts, with those Third Party Services (for example, by sharing posts to Twitter or Facebook).

For example, we may share information with service providers in order to fight spam, and third-party consultants may have access to information in the process of improving our processes and technology.
Agents with whom we share such information for these reasons are generally bound by confidentiality obligations and, unless we tell you differently, our Agents do not have any right to use information we share with them beyond the scope and duration of what is necessary to assist us.Information Disclosed Pursuant to Business TransfersIn some cases, we may choose to buy or sell business assets.
In these transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets.
Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.
You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of OthersWe believe in freedom of expression, and, to the extent reasonable, we try to protect our community from baseless legal demands.
That said, we also reserve the right to access, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is necessary, in our sole discretion, to (i) satisfy any law, regulation, legal process, governmental request, or governmental order, (ii) enforce this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, trust and safety, or technical issues (including exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of improving security and preventing fraud, spam, and malware), (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect the rights, property, health or safety of us, our users, any third parties or the public in general, including but not limited to situations involving possible violence, suicide, or self-harm.Information We Share with Your Consent or at Your RequestIf you ask us to release information that we have about your Account, we will do so if reasonable and not unduly burdensome.Information Shared with Other Third PartiesWe may share or disclose non-private information, Aggregate Information, or other non-personally identifying information with people and entities that we do business with.The Security of Your InformationYour Account Information is protected by a password or through third party access (Facebook Login or Google Signin) for your privacy and security.

Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time.What Information You Can AccessIf you are a registered user, you can access most information associated with your Account by logging into the Services and checking your Account Settings page.
