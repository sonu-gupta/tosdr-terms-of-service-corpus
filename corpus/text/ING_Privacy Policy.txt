Safety and security.We have a duty to protect all personal data and to prevent, detect and contain a data breach or fraud involving personal data collected to comply with regulations against money laundering, terrorism financing and tax fraud.
To safeguard and ensure the security and integrity of ING, the financial sector, clients and employees, we may
Process your personal data to protect your organisationÂ´s assets from fraudulent activities, for instance in case your identity (e.g.

For example, know your customer (KYC) rules and regulations require ING to verify the identity before accepting you as a customer.
Upon request by authorities, ING may report the transactions carried out by customers.

When processing is not compatible with one of the above purposes, we ask for your explicit consent, which you may withhold or withdraw at any time.

Applicable laws require us to retain personal data for a period of time.
This retention period may vary from a few months to a several years, depending on the applicable local law.
When your personal data is no longer necessary for a process or activity for which it was originally collected, we delete it, or bundle data at a certain abstraction level (aggregate), render it anonymous and dispose of it in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations. 4.
Who we share your data with and why To offer you the best possible services and remain competitive in our business, we share certain data internally i.e., with other ING businesses and externally (i.e., outside of ING) with third parties.

Whenever we share your personal data externally (i.e., outside of ING) with third parties in countries outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) we ensure the necessary safeguards are in place to protect it.
For this purpose, we rely upon, amongst others: 
Requirements based on applicable local laws and regulations.

EU Model clauses, when applicable, we use standardised contractual clauses in agreements with service providers to ensure personal data transferred outside of the European Economic Area complies with GDPR.

International treaties such as the EU US Privacy Shield framework that protects personal data transferred to certain service providers in the United States.
For all customers: ING entities We transfer data across ING businesses and branches for various purposes (see section âWhat we do with your personal dataâ for the full list).
We may also transfer data to centralised storage systems or to process it at a central point within ING for efficiency purposes.
For all internal data transfers we rely on our binding corporate rules as defined in EC Regulation (EU) 2016/679, which is our Global Data Protection Policy (GDPP), and on the applicable local laws and regulations. Government, Supervisory and Judicial authorities To comply with our regulatory obligations we may disclose data to the relevant government, supervisory and judicial authorities such as: 

Public authorities, regulators and supervisory bodies such as the central banks and other financial sector supervisors in the countries where we operate.

 Tax authorities may require us to report customer assets or other personal data such as your name and contact details and other information about your organisation.
For this purpose, we may process your identification data like social security number, tax identification number or any other national identifier in accordance with applicable local law.

Judicial/investigative authorities such as the police, public prosecutors, courts and arbitration/mediation bodies on their express and legal request.
 Financial institutions To process certain payment and withdrawal services, we may have to share information about the customer or its representative with another bank or a specialised financial company.
We also share information with financial sector specialists who assist us with financial services like
exchanging secure financial transaction messages 
payments and credit transactions worldwide 
processing electronic transactions worldwide
settling domestic and cross-border security transactions and payment transactions.
Other financial services organisations, including banks, superannuation funds, stockbrokers, custodians, fund managers and portfolio service providers. Service providers and other third parties When we use other service providers or other third parties to carry out certain activities in the normal course of business, we may have to share personal data required for a particular task.
Service providers support us with activities like 
Designing, developing and maintaining internet-based tools and applications;
IT service providers who may provide application or infrastructure (such as cloud) services;
Marketing activities or events and managing customer communications.

Preparing reports and statistics, printing materials and designing products.

 Placing advertisements on apps, websites and social media.

Legal, auditing or other special services provided by lawyers, notaries, trustees, company auditors or other professional advisors.

Identifying, investigating or preventing fraud or other misconduct by specialised companies;
Performing specialised services like postal mail by our agents, archiving of physical records, contractors and external service providers.
or 
Carrying out securitisation arrangements (such as trustees, investors and the advisers). Account information and payment initiation services within the EU The revised EU Payment Service Directive (PSD2) allows you to instruct a third-party payment service provider (TPP) to retrieve account information or initiate payments on your behalf with respect to your accounts with ING.
The TPP may do so only if you have given your explicit consent to those services.
When we receive a request from a TPP on your behalf, we are obliged to carry out the request for payment or account information, as requested.

Additionally you can also use the PSD2 services to manage your accounts with other banks through your ING channels or apps.
You may use the ING app or channel to 
View account information of your current payment accounts with other banks;
Make online payments from your current payment account with other banks.
In this case, we will be the TPP and we may only offer these services if we receive your explicit consent.
If you decide that you no longer want to use these PSD2 services, you can simply turn off the feature in the ING online environment.


For individuals who are customers only:
 Independent agents, brokers and business partners We may share your personal data with independent agents, brokers or business partners who act on our behalf, or which jointly offer products and services with us, such as insurance.
They are registered in line with local legislation and operate with due permission of regulatory bodies.
 Researchers We are always looking for new insights to help you get ahead in life and in business.
For this reason, we exchange personal data (when itâs legally allowed) with partners like universities and other independent research institutions, who use it in their research and innovation.
The researchers we engage must satisfy the same strict requirements as ING employees.
The personal data is shared at an aggregated level and the results of the research are anonymous.
 Credit reporting bodies For customers who apply for a credit facility with us in Australia, you agree that we may exchange your personal data with a credit reporting body ("CRB"), including by sharing information about:
your identity
your credit worthiness
your credit history, including about the type of credit you have (like credit cards, personal loans and home loans), how much you have borrowed and if you've made your repayments (including repayments you're required to make under your ING credit facility with us) 
whether you have committed fraud or another serious credit infringement, and 
obtaining commercial credit information about you in order to assess an application by you for consumer credit.

The CRBs we use include Equifax Australia Information Services &amp.
Solutions Pty Limited ("Equifax") (equifax.com.au) and illion Australia Pty Ltd ("illion") (illion.com.au).
The privacy policy of each of Equifax and illion explains how it manages your personal information and can be found on its website.

CRBs may include information that we provide in reports to other credit providers to assist those credit providers to assess your credit worthiness.
We may ask a CRB to give us your overall credit score, and we may use credit information from CRBs together with other information to arrive at our own credit score of your ability to manage your credit obligations.



Pre-screening assessments
 Credit providers (like us) can ask CRBs to use your credit information to pre-screen you for direct marketing purposes, but you can tell CRBs not to do this.
However, by applying for a credit facility with us, you may still receive direct marketing from us (unless you ask us not to) that has not been 'pre screened'.
 Fraud - 'ban period' If you believe, on reasonable grounds, that you have been, or could be, a victim of fraud (for example, someone else may be using your name to apply for credit), you can ask CRBs not to use or give anyone your credit information during a 'ban period'.
 The 'ban period' is a period of 21 days starting on the day you make the request.
That period can be extended on your request where the CRB believes on reasonable grounds that you have been, or are likely to be, the victim of fraud.
By applying for a credit facility with us, you agree to us accessing your personal information held with a CRB, even if there is a ban period in place, for the purposes of assessing an application for credit or in order to collect overdue payments.
 Credit providers For customers who apply for a credit facility with us in Australia, you agree that we may disclose information about you (including about your credit worthiness, credit history and repayment history information) to other credit providers to assess an application by you for credit, to notify them of a default by you and to inform other credit providers who allege you are in default with them.
You also agree that we may disclose your information to any person reasonably necessary for the purposes of that person taking an assignment of any contract the lender has with you.
 Transfer of personal information overseas Sometimes we may send your information overseas - for example, where we send information to ING Group members overseas or outsource functions overseas.
If we do this, we make sure there are arrangements in place to protect your information.
For customers in Australia, the countries to which your information may be sent include the Netherlands, Philippines, Poland, Singapore, Slovakia and the United Kingdom.
