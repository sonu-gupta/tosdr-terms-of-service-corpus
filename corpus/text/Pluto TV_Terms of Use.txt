RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES: BINDING ARBITRATION.
NO CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS OR ARBITRATIONS

See our FAQS at https://corporate.pluto.tv/terms-of-use/arbitration-faq for more information.

19.1 Binding Arbitration and Exclusions from Arbitration.
EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW OR UNLESS YOU SUBMIT A VALID ARBITRATION/CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT NOTICE (AS DESCRIBED IN SECTION 19.5), ANY AND ALL CLAIMS BETWEEN YOU AND ANY PLUTO/VII ENTITY WILL BE RESOLVED IN BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT.
You and Pluto agree to submit to individual arbitration the resolution of any and all Claims by or between you and/or Pluto, except that you and Pluto agree that the following will not be subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions in this Section 19.1: (A) any Claim filed by you or Pluto with respect to any violation, enforcement or validity of patent, trademark, trade dress, service mark, copyright and/or trade secret rights of you, Pluto, or any third party, including, but not limited to, Claims related to content that you upload to or share on the Services and/or (B) you or Pluto may seek a preliminary injunction, restraining order or other provisional equitable relief in any court as provided in Section 20 in connection with any Claim whereby you or Pluto, as applicable, may suffer immediate and irreparable harm for which money damages may be inadequate and impossible to calculate (including, but not limited to, a Claim under Section 19.1(A)), where such Claim under this Section 19.1(B) will not be subject to the informal dispute resolution procedures described in Section 19.2 below.
provided, however, that, subsequent to obtaining such preliminary injunction, restraining order or other provisional equitable relief, the Claim will then be submitted to arbitration in accordance with Section 19.
You and Pluto agree that this Agreement affects interstate commerce, and that the enforceability of Section 19 will be governed by, construed, and enforced, both procedurally and substantively, by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.
sections 1â9 (âFAAâ).
Arbitration is the referral of a dispute to one or more impartial persons for a final and binding determination.
There is no judge or jury in arbitration, discovery is more limited than in court, there are no class or representative proceedings, and court review of an arbitration decision is limited.
An arbitrator must follow this Agreement and can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including, but not limited to, injunctive and declaratory relief, statutory damages, and attorneysâ fees).
âClaim(s)â means any dispute, claim or controversy by or between you and/or Pluto relating to the Services and/or this Agreement (including, but not limited to, this Servicesâ Privacy Policy and all Additional Terms, Rules, regulations, procedures and policies that we refer to in this Agreement), as may be modified from time-to-time, and the subject matter hereof, including, but not limited to, any contract, tort, statutory, or equity claims.
19.2 Informal Dispute Resolution.
Except with respect to Claims described in Section 19.1(B) above, before either you or Pluto pursue or participate in any Claim against the other party in arbitration or court proceedings, you or Pluto must notify the other party of the Claim in writing at least 60 days in advance of initiating the arbitration or court proceeding in order to provide a reasonable opportunity to resolve the Claim.
You may send a written notice of your Claim to Pluto at 1515 Broadway, New York, New York 10036, Attention: Viacom Inc.
General Counsel.
Pluto may send written or electronic notice of its Claim to your email address, your account or any physical or other address Pluto has for you.
The notice must describe the Claim in reasonable detail and set forth the relief requested so that the other party has an opportunity to adequately address the Claim.
Except with respect to Claims described in Section 19.1(B) above, you and Pluto agree to negotiate in good faith with each other to try to informally resolve the Claim and, if you and Pluto do not reach an informal resolution of the Claim within 60 days, then the Claim may be submitted to binding arbitration as set forth in Section 19 or court as permitted by Section 19.1.
19.3 Arbitration Proceedings and Costs.
Any arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ) pursuant to its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the âAAA Rulesâ), as modified by this Agreement.
The AAA Rules, and other information about the AAA, are available at the AAAâs website at www.adr.org.
A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAAâs website (see âDemand for Arbitration, Consumer Arbitration Rulesâ, under Rules and Forms, Consumer Forms, at https://www.adr.org, but contact the AAA if you have issues locating the form) and arbitration proceedings shall be initiated in the location described in Section 20.
As required by the AAA Rules, if you initiate the arbitration proceedings, you must send the original copy of the completed form to Pluto, which should be sent to Pluto at the following address: 1515 Broadway, New York, New York 10036, Attention: Viacom Inc.
General Counsel.
If your Claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely based on documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing under the AAA Rules.
In all cases, you and Pluto shall exchange documents and other information that you or Pluto intend to use in the arbitration.
Upon filing of an arbitration demand for Claims up to $75,000, Pluto will reimburse you for all necessary filing, administration and arbitrator fees paid by you to the AAA or, if you wish Pluto to pay such fees directly to the AAA, you must request payment of such fees by Pluto by mail to the AAA along with your form initiating arbitration and Pluto will make arrangements to pay such fees directly to the AAA.
In the event the arbitrator determines that the Claim(s) you assert in the arbitration are frivolous or vexatious, you agree to reimburse Pluto for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by Pluto on your behalf.
You agree that Pluto shall have no obligation to pay any other fees except as determined by the arbitrator.
For Claims that total more than $75,000, the AAA Rules will govern payment of filing, administration and arbitrator fees to the maximum extent permitted by law.
The decision of the arbitrator will be binding and conclusive on all parties, and judgment to enforce the decision may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction.
19.4 Class Action Waiver.
UNLESS YOU SUBMIT A VALID ARBITRATION/CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT NOTICE (AS DESCRIBED IN SECTION 19.5), YOU AND PLUTO AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR IN COURT WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.
You and Pluto expressly agree that any Claim is personal to you and Pluto, shall only be resolved by an individual arbitration (or individual court proceedings with respect to Claims excluded from mandatory arbitration as described in Section 19.1 of this Agreement), and shall in no event be brought as a class arbitration, a class action, or any other representative proceeding.
The arbitrator (or court if the Claim is excluded from mandatory arbitration as described in Section 19.1 of this Agreement) may only conduct an individual arbitration (or court action if the Claim is excluded from mandatory arbitration as described in Section 19.1 of this Agreement), and may not consolidate more than one personâs claims and may not preside over any form of representative or class proceeding.
If a court or arbitrator determines that this class action waiver is unenforceable in an action between you and Pluto, then this Agreement to arbitrate will be unenforceable.
Neither you nor Pluto consent to class arbitration.
19.5 Right to Opt Out of Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver.

IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THE MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER PROVISIONS IN SECTIONS 19.1, 19.3 AND 19.4, YOU MUST NOTIFY PLUTO IN WRITING (THE âArbitration/Class Action Waiver Opt-Out Noticeâ), WHERE THE ARBITRATION/CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT NOTICE MEETS ALL OF THE FOLLOWING REQUIREMENTS:

20.
GOVERNING LAW, ARBITRATION LOCATION, JURISDICTION, VENUE AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER.
With the exception of the provision above that the enforceability of Section 19 is governed both procedurally and substantively by the FAA, this Agreement and your use of the Services is otherwise governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York (without regard to that stateâs conflict of laws rules).
You or Pluto shall initiate arbitration in the United States county or territory in which you reside or, if you do not reside in the United States or one of its territories, in the non-United States country in which you reside.
provided, however, that (a) Pluto may request to transfer the arbitration to New York County, New York if it agrees to pay any additional fees or costs you incur as a result of the change in location as such additional fees or costs are determined by the arbitrator and to the maximum extent permitted by law and, upon such request, (b)(i) if you agree to such request, the arbitration shall be transferred to New York County, New York or (ii) if you do not agree to such request, Pluto shall have right to request that the arbitrator determine the location in which the arbitration shall be held.
You and Pluto agree that any Claim that is allowed to proceed in court as set forth in Section 19.1 of this Agreement (including, but not limited to, as a result of your submission of a valid Arbitration/Class Action Waiver Opt-Out Notice), or otherwise proceeds in court in the event the agreement to arbitrate above is found not to apply to you or a particular Claim as a result of a decision by the arbitrator or a court order, is subject to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the State or Federal Courts situated in the Borough of Manhattan, New York City, State of New York.
To the extent it may be applicable, you and Pluto agree to opt out from and expressly exclude any applicability of the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act.
If any Claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, YOU AND PLUTO WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.
