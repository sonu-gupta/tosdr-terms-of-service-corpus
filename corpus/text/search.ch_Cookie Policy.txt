 ðª Cookie Policy Introduction
We use various common technologies in order to collect, store, and analyze data when you use our Services.
This specifically includes cookies that can be used to identify your browser or device.
Where required under applicable law (such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation and/or other EU privacy laws, if applicable), we will ask you for your consent to our use of cookies that are not strictly necessary for the provision of our website and services ("Non-Essential Cookies") when you first visit our website. About cookies

What is a cookie: A cookie is a small file that is sent to your computer or is stored automatically on your computer or mobile device when you call up one of our services.
When you call up a service again, it can recognize your browser or your device using the cookie.

In addition, the information collected using cookies makes it possible for us to improve our Services according to customer desires, and to provide offers and advertising customized to you.
In addition to cookies, we can also make use of other technologies (e.g., pixels, web beacons, tags, advertising IDs) in order to analyze the use of our services, to personalize our services, and to display offers and advertising customized to you.
For instance, when we send newsletters and e-mails, we can use technologies that allow us to analyze what content is interesting to users and whether, when, and how they react to our offers (e.g., by downloading pictures in an e-mail, clicking on URLs in an e-mail or on a website, filling in form data, etc.).
Finally, we use various common web analysis and tracking tools to measure and evaluate the use of our services.
Such tools, which are usually provided by third parties, provide us with information and statistics on the use of our services that help us to better understand the use of our Services and to adapt them to User needs accordingly. Cookies that we use
