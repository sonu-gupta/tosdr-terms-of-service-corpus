B.
Community Usage Rules. As a user of the Service, these Community Usage Rules (âRulesâ) are here to help you understand the conduct that is expected of members of the Serviceâs online communities (âCommunitiesâ).


(i) Nature of Rules. Your participation in the Communities is subject to all of the Terms, including these Rules: 


Your User-Generated Content. All of your User-Generated Content either must be original with you or you must have all necessary rights in it from third parties in order to permit you to comply with these Terms and any Additional Terms.
Your User-Generated Content should not contain any visible logos, phrases, or trademarks that belong to third parties.
Do not use any User-Generated Content that belongs to other people and pass it off as your own.
this includes any content that you might have found elsewhere on the Internet.
If anyone contributes to your User-Generated Content or has any rights to your User-Generated Content, or if anyone appears or is referred to in the User-Generated Content, then you must also have their permission to submit such User-Generated Content to LCE.
(For example, if someone has taken a picture of you and your friend, and you submit that photo to LCE as your User-Generated Content, then you must obtain your friendâs and the photographerâs permission to do so.)

Speaking of Photos: No Pictures, Videos, or Images of Anyone Other Than You and Your Friends and Family. If you choose to submit photos to the Service, link to embedded videos, or include other images of real people, then make sure they are of you or of you and someone you know â and only if you have their express permission to submit it.

Act Appropriately. All of your Service activities must be venue appropriate, as determined by us.
Be respectful of othersâ opinions and comments so we can continue to build Communities for everyone to enjoy.
If you think your User-Generated Content might offend someone or be embarrassing to someone, then chances are it probably will and it doesn't belong on the Service.
Cursing, harassing, stalking, insulting comments, personal attacks, gossip, and similar actions are prohibited.
Your User-Generated Content must not threaten, abuse, or harm others, and it must not include any negative comments that are connected to race, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, or physical handicap.
Your User-Generated Content must not be defamatory, slanderous, indecent, obscene, pornographic, or sexually explicit.


Do Not Use for Commercial or Political Purposes. Your User-Generated Content must not advertise or promote a product or service or other commercial activity, or a politician, public servant, or law.

Do Not Use for Inappropriate Purposes. Your User-Generated Content must not promote any infringing, illegal, or other similarly inappropriate activity.


Be Honest and Do Not Misrepresent Yourself or Your User-Generated Content. Do not impersonate any other person, user, or company, and do not submit User-Generated Content that you believe may be false, fraudulent, deceptive, inaccurate, or misleading, or that misrepresents your identity or affiliation with a person or company.

Others Can See. We hope that you will use the Communities to exchange information and content and have venue appropriate discussions with other members.
However, please remember that the Communities are public or semi-public and User-Generated Content that you submit on the Service within a Community may be accessible and viewable by other users.
Do not submit personally identifying information (e.g., first and last name together, password, phone number, address, credit card number, medical information, e-mail address, or other personally identifiable information or contact information) on Community spaces and take care when disclosing this type of information to others.


Donât Share Other Peoplesâ Personal Information. Your User-Generated Content should not reveal another personâs address, phone number, e-mail address, social security or social insurance number, credit card number, medical information, financial information, or any other information that may be used to track, contact, or impersonate that individual, unless, and in the form and by the method, specifically requested by LCE and with the consent of that other person.


Donât Damage the Service or Anyoneâs Computers or Other Devices. Your User-Generated Content must not submit viruses, Trojan horses, spyware, or any other technologies or malicious code that could impact the operation of the Service or any computer or other Device.

If you submit User-Generated Content that LCE reasonably believes violates these Rules, then we may take any legally available action that we deem appropriate, in our sole discretion.
However, we are not obligated to take any action not required by law.
We may require, at any time, proof of the permissions referred to above in a form acceptable to us.
Failure to provide such proof may lead to, among other things, the User-Generated Content in question being removed from the Service.

(ii) Your Interactions With Other Users.
Disputes. You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Service, whether online or offline.
We are not responsible or liable for the conduct or content of any user.
We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor or become involved in disputes between you and other users.
Exercise common sense and your best judgment in your interactions with others (e.g., when you submit any personal or other information) and in all of your other online activities.

C.

Such resolution may include, without limitation, deleting or disabling access to accounts, Profiles, or any portion thereof, at any time without notice.

Procedure For Alleging U.S.
Copyright Infringement
A.
DMCA Notice. LCE will respond appropriately to notices of alleged U.S.
copyright infringement that comply with the U.S.
Digital Millennium Copyright Act (âDMCAâ), as set forth below.
If you own a U.S.
copyright in a work (or represent such a copyright owner) and believe that your (or such ownerâs) U.S.
copyright in that work has been infringed by an improper posting or distribution of it via the Service, then you may send us a written notice that includes all of the following: 

(i) a legend or subject line that says: âDMCA Copyright Infringement Noticeâ.


(ii) a description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed or, if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works.


(iii) a description of where the material that you claim is infringing or is the subject of infringing activity is located that is reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material (please include the URL of the Service on which the material appears).


(iv) your full name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address.


(v) a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.


(vi) a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that all the information in your notice is accurate, and that you are the copyright owner (or, if you are not the copyright owner, then your statement must indicate that you are authorized to act on the behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed).
and 

(vii) your electronic or physical signature.

LCE will only respond to DMCA Notices that it receives by mail, e-mail, or facsimile at the addresses below:
By Mail: Attn: Legal/Marketing, 2211 Woodward Ave, Detroit, MI 48201
By E-Mail: Click here
By Fax: 313-471-6171
It is often difficult to determine if your copyright has been infringed.
LCE may elect to not respond to DMCA Notices that do not substantially comply with all of the foregoing requirements, and LCE may elect to remove allegedly infringing material that comes to its attention via notices that do not substantially comply with the DMCA.

Please note that the DMCA provides that any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be subject to liability.
We may send the information that you provide in your notice to the person who provided the allegedly infringing work.
That person may elect to send us a DMCA Counter-Notification.
Without limiting LCEâs other rights, LCE may, in appropriate circumstances, terminate a repeat infringerâs access to the Service and any other website owned or operated by LCE.


B.
Counter-Notification. If access on the Service to a work that you submitted to LCE is disabled or the work is removed as a result of a DMCA Notice, and if you believe that the disabled access or removal is the result of mistake or misidentification, then you may send us a DMCA Counter-Notification to the addresses above.
Your DMCA Counter-Notification should contain the following information:

(i) a legend or subject line that says: âDMCA Counter-Notificationâ;

(ii) a description of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled (please include the URL of the Service from which the material was removed or access to it disabled);

(iii) a statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled;

(iv) your full name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and the username of your account;

(v) a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located (or, if the address is located outside the U.S.A., to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan), and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided DMCA notification to us or an agent of such person.
and

(vi) your electronic or physical signature.
Please note that the DMCA provides that any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification may be subject to liability.
If we receive a DMCA Counter-Notification, then we may replace the material that we removed (or stop disabling access to it) in not less than ten (10) and not more than fourteen(14) business days following receipt of the DMCA Counter-Notification.
However, we will not do this if we first receive notice at the addresses above that the party who sent us the DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice has filed a lawsuit asking a court for an order restraining the person who provided the material from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on the Service.
You should also be aware that we may forward the Counter-Notification to the party who sent us the DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice.

and
 g) your electronic or physical signature.

We will act on such notices in our sole discretion.
Any user of the Service that fails to respond satisfactorily to LCE with regard to any such notice is subject to suspension or termination.
We may send the information that you provide in your notice to the person who provided the allegedly infringing material.


B.
Counter-Notification. If access on the Service to a work that you submitted to LCE is disabled or the work is removed as a result of an infringement notice, and if you believe that the disabled access or removal is the result of mistake or misidentification, then you may send us a counter notification to the addresses above.

and

(vi) your electronic or physical signature.
Please note that if you knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification may be subject to liability.
If we receive a counter notification, then we may replace the material that we removed (or stop disabling access to it).
You should also be aware that we may forward the counter notification to the party who sent us the infringement notice.

Typographical Errors.
In-Service Orders and PurchasesWe do our best to describe every offer made on this Service as accurately as possible.

We reserve the right to change, add to or withdraw offers and coupons upon notice on the Service.
In the event of any errors relating to the pricing or specifications of our offers and coupons, LCE may refuse or cancel any orders in its sole discretion.
If we charged your credit card or other account prior to cancellation, we will reissue credit to your account.
If a product you purchased from us is not as described, to the extent permitted by local laws, your sole remedy is to return it to cancel the purchase and receive a credit for the purchase price.
Offers made off of the Service by our franchisees (which are independently owned and operated) do not apply to us or other stores not operated by that franchisee.
Additional Terms may apply.
Not all offers and services (e.g., delivery and drive-thru) will be available in all areas or stores and available quantities may be limited.
Some portions of the Service offer in-Service ordering and/or purchase options (e.g., ordering or purchasing a pizza through the Service) (collectively, âOnline Orderingâ).
You may only use Online Ordering if you are at least the age of majority where you reside.
Online Ordering may be subject to Additional Terms, which will be presented to you before the purchase transaction is made.
Where Online Ordering is used merely to order, and payment and pickup at one of our or our franchiseesâ stores is required, the actual offer and acceptance will occur when you arrive at the store and complete the transaction.
However, if Online Ordering is used to purchase product on the Service (âOnline Purchaseâ), the transaction is completed when we accept and process your order, even if you do not timely pick-up the product at the applicable store location.
It is your responsibility to timely pick up such orders.
Upon completing your Online Purchase, you will receive an order confirmation on your screen and an emailed confirmation, delivered to the email you provide us.
If you complete an Online Purchase on an App, you may also receive an in-App notification (if you have not disabled this function on your Device) confirming your order.
Each order confirmation will include an order number along with other information regarding your purchase, such as products and/or services ordered and amount paid.
Without limiting the generality of any other section of these Terms, LCE reserves the right to limit or refuse any order you place with us.
Further, we reserve the right to verify the validity of all orders and/or cancel any order if we find evidence of fraud and/or any other violation of these Terms.
All orders are subject to verification by LCE at any time and for any reason.
We reserve the right, in our sole and absolute discretion, to require proof of identity (in a form acceptable to LCE): (i) for the purposes of verifying the legitimacy of any order and/or other information.
and/or (ii) for any other reason we deem necessary, in our sole and absolute discretion, for the purposes of fulfilling an order in accordance with our interpretation of these Terms.
We may, in our sole and absolute discretion, limit or cancel quantities purchased per person, per household or per order.
These restrictions may include orders placed by or under the same account, the same credit card, and/or orders that use the same billing and/or shipping address.
In the event that we are unable to or choose not to complete an order, you will be notified accordingly and the amount for that order charged to you will be reduced accordingly.
In using Online Ordering, with respect to franchiseesâ stores, you acknowledge and agree that LCE (a) is only facilitating your transaction with the franchisee store that you have selected to provide you with the products and/or services you have ordered.
(b) does not provide you with any products and/or services.
(c) does not store any payment information and only facilitates online payments for the benefit of the franchisee store from which you have ordered products and/or services.
and (d) does not make any representations or warranties with respect to any products and/or services provided to you by the franchisee store.
You further acknowledge and agree that by using Online Ordering to order products and/or services from a franchisee store, you are entering into a contract for the purchased items with that store and not LCE, provided, however, you still agree to these Terms with respect to your use of the Service.
Any loyalty programs or stored value programs are subject to applicable Additional Terms.
For any purchases made through a third party, such as Apple, Google, or Vantiv, their terms, conditions and policies, also apply and you agree to look solely to them regarding any disputes related thereto.

Sections 12.A., 12.B., and 12.F.
do not apply to individual residents of Ontario, Saskatchewan or Quebec.
For Mexican residents, this Section 12 applies to the extent permitted by applicable Mexican law.
Certain portions of this Section 12 are deemed to be a âwritten agreement to arbitrateâ pursuant to the U.S.
Federal Arbitration Act.
You and LCE agree that we intend that this Section 12 satisfies the âwritingâ requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act.
This Section 12 can only be amended by mutual agreement.
All matters arising under or related to this Section 12 shall be conducted exclusively in the English language.

A.
First â Try To Resolve Disputes and Excluded Disputes. If any controversy, allegation, or claim arises out of or relates to the Service, the Content, your User-Generated Content, these Terms, or any Additional Terms, whether heretofore or hereafter arising (collectively, âDisputeâ), or to any of LCEâs actual or alleged intellectual property rights (an âExcluded Disputeâ, which includes those actions set forth in Section 12.D, then you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Dispute or Excluded Dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it.
Our notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us.
But if no such information exists or if such information is not current, then we have no obligation under this Section 12.A.
Your notice to us must be sent to: Little Caesar Enterprises, Inc.

Forums For Alternative Dispute Resolution


(i) Arbitration. If we cannot resolve a Dispute as set forth in Section 12.A within sixty (60) days of receipt of the notice, then either you or we may submit the Dispute to formal arbitration in accordance with this Section 12.B.
If we cannot resolve an Excluded Dispute as set forth in Section 12.A within sixty (60) days of receipt of the notice, then either you or we may submit the Excluded Dispute to formal arbitration only if you and LCE consent, in a writing signed by you and an Officer or legal representative of LCE, to have that Excluded Dispute subject to arbitration.
In such a case, (and only in such a case), that Excluded Dispute will be deemed a âDisputeâ for the remainder of this Section 12.B.

 Upon expiration of the applicable sixty-day period and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, a Dispute will be resolved solely by binding arbitration in accordance with the then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ).
If the Dispute has a claimed value of not more than $250,000, then the arbitration will be heard and determined by a single neutral arbitrator who is a retired judge or a lawyer with not less than fifteen (15) yearsâ experience as a practicing member of the bar in the substantive practice area related to the Dispute, who will administer the proceedings in accordance with the AAAâs Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes.
If the Dispute has acclaimed value of more than $250,000, or if LCE elects in its sole discretion to bear the costs of arbitration in excess of those that would occur for a proceeding before a single neutral arbitrator, then the arbitration will be heard and determined by a three-member panel, with one member to be selected by each party and the third (who will be chair of the panel) selected by the two party-appointed members or by the AAA in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules.
The arbitrator or arbitration panel, as the case may be, will apply applicable law and the provisions of these Terms and any Additional Terms, will determine any Dispute according to the applicable law and facts based upon the record and no other basis, and will issue a reasoned award.
If you and LCE do not both consent to the arbitration of an Excluded Dispute as set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph of this Section 12.B(i), then this paragraph and the remainder of this Section 12.B will not apply to the Excluded Dispute.
 If a party properly submits the Dispute to the AAA for formal arbitration and the AAA is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within sixty (60) days of the filing of a âdemand for arbitration,â then either party can elect to have the arbitration administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services Inc.
(âJAMSâ) using JAMSâ streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, or by any other arbitration administration service that you and an officer or legal representative of LCE consent to in writing.
The substantive practice area requirements for the arbitrator and the $250,000 threshold for a the number of arbitrators assigned to the Dispute set forth in the paragraph above for the AAA arbitration will also apply to any such arbitration under JAMS or another arbitration service.
 You can obtain AAA and JAMS procedures, rules, and fee information as follows:
 AAA: 800.778.7879 &nbsp.

(ii) Nature, Limitations, and Location of Alternative Dispute Resolution. In arbitration, as with a court, the arbitrator must honor the terms of these Terms (and any Additional Terms) and can award the prevailing party damages and other relief (including attorneysâ fees).
However, WITH ARBITRATION (A) THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY, (B) THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND ARBITRATION OUTCOME ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY RULES, AND (C) JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATION OUTCOME IS LIMITED.
All parties to the arbitration will have the right, at their own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other advocate of their choosing.
If an in-person arbitration hearing is required, then it will be conducted in the âmetropolitan statistical areaâ (as defined by the U.S.
Census Bureau) where you are a resident, or nearest to your place of residence at the time the Dispute is submitted to arbitration.
You and we will pay the administrative and arbitratorâs fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules.
but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require LCE to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this Section 12 to be enforceable, then LCE will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration, or to decline to do so and have the matter resolved through the courts.
Discovery will be permitted pursuant to the applicable arbitration rules.
The arbitratorâs decision must consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim of the Dispute, and must provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and any award (if any) is based.
Judgment on the arbitration decision and award (if any) may be entered in or by any court that has jurisdiction over the parties pursuant to Section 9 of the Federal Arbitration Act.


C.
Limited Time To File Claims. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU OR WE WANT TO ASSERT A DISPUTE (BUT NOT AN EXCLUDED DISPUTE) AGAINST THE OTHER, THEN YOU OR WE MUST COMMENCE IT (BY DELIVERY OF WRITTEN NOTICE AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 12.A) WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE DISPUTE ARISES â OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED.


D.
Injunctive Relief. The foregoing provisions of this Section 12 will not apply to any legal action taken by LCE to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in connection with, any loss, cost, or damage (or any potential loss, cost, or damage) relating to the Service, any Content, your User-Generated Content and/or LCEâs intellectual property rights (including such LCE may claim that may be in dispute), LCEâs operations, and/or LCEâs products or services.

Small Claims Matters Are Excluded From Arbitration Requirement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either of us may bring qualifying claim of Disputes (but not Excluded Disputes) in small claims court, subject to Section 12.G.

F.
No Class Action Matters. Disputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be consolidated with any other arbitration or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party.
But if, for any reason, any court with competent jurisdiction or any arbitrator selected pursuant to Section 12.B(i) holds that this restriction is unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement in Section 12.B to arbitrate will not apply and the Dispute must be brought exclusively in court pursuant to Section 12.G.


G.
Federal and State Courts in Detroit. For users of the Services who are not individuals resident in Quebec, except to the extent that arbitration is required in Section 12.B, and except as to the enforcement of any arbitration decision or award, any action or proceeding relating to any Dispute or Excluded Dispute may only be instituted in state or federal court in Detroit, MI.
