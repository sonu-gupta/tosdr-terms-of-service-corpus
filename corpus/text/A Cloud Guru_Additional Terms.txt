 Data Processing Addendum
A Cloud Guru Hands-On Feature TermsThese Hands-on Feature Terms of Use (these âFeature 
Termsâ) govern the access to and use of A Cloud Guruâs interactive Cloud Playground and Hands-on Lab features (the âFeaturesâ), which Features may be included as part of the overall services (the âServicesâ) offered by the A Cloud Guru entity providing you with the Services (âACGâ).
These Feature Terms supplement and are incorporated into the agreement (whether Terms of Sale, Terms of Use, Master Services Agreement, or other agreement) governing use of ACGâs Services (collectively, with these Feature Terms, the âAgreementâ) between ACG and the person or business subscribing to the Services (âSubscriberâ).
Capitalized terms not defined in these Feature Terms will have the same definition as within the Agreement.

BY USING THE FEATURES, SUBSCRIBER UNCONDITIONALLY AGREES TO THESE FEATURE TERMS.&nbsp.
IF SUBSCRIBER DOES NOT AGREE TO THESE FEATURE TERMS, SUBSCRIBER AND ITS USERS MAY NOT USE THE FEATURES.

GENERAL APPLICATION


1.1.&nbsp.
For all Subscribers.&nbsp.
All terms of Subscriberâs Agreement will also apply to the Features and, except as supplemented by these Feature Terms if Subscriber elects to use the Features, all terms of Subscriberâs Agreement remain in full force and effect.
If there is any conflict between these Feature Terms and the terms of the Agreement, the Agreement will control unless expressly stated otherwise in these Feature Terms.

1.2.&nbsp.
Business Subscriber Users.&nbsp.
For business Subscribers, the term âUsersâ has the meaning set forth in the applicable Agreement or, if not defined in that Agreement, it means any person that a business Subscriber has authorized to use the Services or Features or who uses the Services or Features by or through a business Subscriber, as permitted by the Agreement.
Any action taken by Subscriberâs Users with respect to the Features will be deemed an action taken by Subscriber.
as such, a breach of these Feature Terms by a User will be deemed a breach by Subscriber.
The term âUsersâ herein does not apply to individual (non-business) Subscribers of the Services.

1.3.&nbsp.
Compliance With Terms and Agreement. Subscriber and its Users (if applicable) agree to use the Features solely in compliance with these Feature Terms, the Agreement, and any other terms and policies identified herein (including the Cloud Provider Terms described below) and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

CLOUD PLATFORMS AND PROVIDERS


2.1.&nbsp.
Cloud Platforms. The Features allow Subscriber and its Users to access certain third-party cloud platform services, including, as available, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and Amazon Web Services (âCloud Platformsâ).
Each Cloud Platform is provided by its respective provider (each a âCloud Providerâ) and is governed by and subject to its own agreement or terms and conditions (and all âacceptable useâ or similar policies or terms linked to or referenced therein) (âCloud Provider Termsâ).
Each of the Cloud Provider Terms are listed and linked-to below and are hereby incorporated into these Terms by reference:

When using the Features, Subscriber and its Users are deemed to be end-users (or any similar term of the Cloud Provider Terms referencing the party making end-use of the Cloud Platform) of the Cloud Platforms.
Use of the Features is subject to all Cloud Provider Terms applicable to end-users of the respective Cloud Platform.
Subscriber agrees to, at all times, comply with and ensure its Users comply with, all Cloud Provider Terms applicable to end-users.
The Cloud Provider Terms may be subject to change at the Cloud Providersâ discretion as provided for by the Cloud Provider Terms, and any such changes will be automatically incorporated into these Feature Terms by reference.
Subscriber understands that ACG does not control any changes to Cloud Provider Terms made by a Cloud Provider.

2.3.&nbsp.

All materials, works, content, inventions, trademarks, information, data, and other intellectual property (including all copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights therein) that are not owned by ACG and are incorporated into or made available in connection with the Features (âThird-Party Materialsâ) are the exclusive property of their respective owners.
Nothing herein should be construed as granting any license or right to use any Third-Party Materials except as permitted by these Feature Terms.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

Subscriber represents and warrants to ACG and ACGâs licensors that: (a) Subscriber has read and understood these Feature Terms.
(b) Subscriber has, and any individual accepting on behalf of Subscriber has, full right and authority to accept these Feature Terms on behalf of Subscriber and to bind Subscriber to these Feature Terms.
and (c) Subscriber and its Users have secured any and all rights, permissions, and consents required to make use of all Interactive Content in the manner used in connection with the Features.

5.&nbsp.
FEATURE SUSPENSION.
TERMINATION

ACG reserves the right to, in ACGâs sole discretion, take any action to: (a) investigate, prevent, mitigate, or remediate any violations or suspected violations of these Feature Terms.
(b) maintain or restore the security of the Features or the Services.
and/or (c) comply with ACGâs obligations under the Cloud Provider Terms.
These actions may include but are not limited to: (i) editing or removing the applicable Interactive Content or portion thereof.
(ii) disabling or denying access to Interactive Sessions and/or associated User accounts.
and/or (iii) suspending or terminating Subscriberâs and/or a violating Userâs access to the Features.

6.&nbsp.
FEATURE CHANGES

The Features are currently provided as an add-on feature in connection with Subscriberâs subscription to the Services.
A subscription to the Services may allow Subscriber to access and use the Features, but a subscription does not guarantee access to or use of the Features in any particular form or at all.
and ACG may change, modify, suspend, or terminate all or part of the Features at any time.
For example, and without limiting ACGâs general rights, each Cloud Provider may have the right to change, modify, suspend, terminate, or take other action with respect to its Cloud Platform or ACGâs use of its Cloud Platform, in accordance with the Cloud Provider Terms (a âCloud Platform Changeâ).
and in the event of such a Cloud Platform Change, ACG will have the right to take action with respect to the Features commensurate with the Cloud Platform Change.
The Section will control over anything to the contrary in Subscriberâs Agreement.

(b) the acknowledgments, obligations, restrictions, and undertakings given or accepted by Subscriber in these Feature Terms are for the benefit of ACG and its third-party licensors, with such licensors being third-party beneficiaries with the right to enforce these Feature Terms directly against Subscriber or through ACG.
and (c) Subscriber is prohibited from bringing any claims related to ACGâs Services against ACGâs third-party licensors.

7.2.&nbsp.
Electronic Consent.&nbsp.
IF SUBSCRIBER AGREES TO THESE FEATURE TERMS ELECTRONICALLY (SUCH AS THROUGH A CLICKTHROUGH),&nbsp.
SUBSCRIBER AGREES THAT SUBSCRIBERâS ASSENT TO THESE FEATURE TERMS, GIVEN ELECTRONICALLY, WILL HAVE THE SAME LEGAL EFFECT AS IF THESE FEATURE TERMS HAD BEEN PERSONALLY SIGNED BY SUBSCRIBER.
TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THESE FEATURE TERMS ARE INTENDED TO SUPERSEDE ANY PROVISIONS OF APPLICABLE LAW, WHICH MIGHT OTHERWISE LIMIT THEIR ENFORCEABILITY OR EFFECT ON THE BASIS THAT THEY WERE ENTERED INTO ELECTRONICALLY.&nbsp.
