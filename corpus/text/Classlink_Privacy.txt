Not sell student personal information.

Not use or disclose student information collected through an educational/school service (whether personal information or otherwise) for behavioral targeting of advertisements to students.

Not build a personal profile of a student other than for supporting authorized educational/school purposes or as authorized by the parent/student.

Not make material changes to school service provider consumer privacy policies without first providing prominent notice to the account holder(s) (i.e., the educational institution/agency, or the parent/student when the information is collected directly from the student with student/parent consent) and allowing them choices before data is used in any manner inconsistent with terms they were initially provided.
and not make material changes to other policies or practices governing the use of student personal information that are inconsistent with contractual requirements.

Not knowingly retain student personal information beyond the time period required to support the authorized educational/school purposes, or as authorized by the parent/student.

Collect, use, share, and retain student personal information only for purposes for which we were authorized by the educational institution/agency, teacher or the parent/student.

Disclose clearly in contracts or privacy policies, including in a manner easy for parents to understand, what types of student personal information we collect, if any, and the purposes for which the information we maintain is used or shared with third parties.

Support access to and correction of student personally identifiable information by the student or their authorized parent, either by assisting the educational institution in meeting its requirements or directly when the information is collected directly from the student with student/parent consent.

Maintain a comprehensive security program that is reasonably designed to protect the security, privacy, confidentiality, and integrity of student personal information against risks â such as unauthorized access or use, or unintended or inappropriate disclosure â through the use of administrative, technological, and physical safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information.

Require that our vendors with whom student personal information is shared in order to deliver the educational service, if any, are obligated to implement these same commitments for the given student personal information.

Allow a successor entity to maintain the student personal information, in the case of our merger or acquisition by another entity, provided the successor entity is subject to these same commitments for the previously collected student personal information.

 A successful SOC 2 audit assures our customers of their reliance on ClassLink's controls to protect their data.

Data Sovereignty

Nearly all countries have laws that protect personal data privacy.
Some countries require that personal data be stored exclusively on servers located in-country.
Further, some countries limit the transfer of personal data outside of their jurisdiction.
ClassLink software and systems are designed to comply with these various regulations as follows:


ClassLink customers are always in control over the storage and transmission of their personal data.

ClassLink software enables the customer to control when and how their data is shared with third party vendors.

ClassLink customers have the option to host a dedicated ClassLink data server either within their internal data center or utilize a secure data center located within the jurisdiction.

ClassLink software and system processes can only transmit personal data with the express instruction of the customer.


European Union â General Data Protection Regulation (
GDPR
)
GDPR is the newest body of regulation regarding the handling of personal data for citizens of the European Union (EU).
The primary objective of the GDPR is to give citizens control of their personal data.

ClassLink customers are always in control over the storage and transmission of their personal data.
Customers located in the EU or UK 
utilize a secure data center located within the EU zone (Frankfurt, Germany).

Department of Commerce, the European Commission, and the Swiss Administration to help companies comply with data protection requirements of the EU and Switzerland.

On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union, invalidated the privacy shield as a substitute for compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
Privacy Shield continues to be in effect for Switzerland.
A key factor contributing to the invalidation was the permissible transfer of personal data from the EU to the US under certain circumstances.

ClassLink software and system processes can only transmit personal data with the express instruction of the customer.
ClassLink continues to participate in Privacy Shield and adhere to its guiding principles for the benefit of our customers in Switzerland.
