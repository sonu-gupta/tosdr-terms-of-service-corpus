 Advertising Revenue Share Program Advertising Revenue Share Program
General Info:
EmpireStreamingâs ad-insertion system operates using metadata triggers to trigger and specify the length of the ad break.
We provide pre-made 30, 60, 90, and 120 second trigger files upon service sign-up.
Or, you can create your own trigger files by putting these tags in the âartistâ or âtitleâ field using a metadata tag editor:
30 Second Trigger â ADWTAG_30000
60 Second Trigger â ADWTAG_60000
90 Second Triggers â ADWTAG_90000
120 Second Trigger â ADWTAG_122000


Broadcasters are required to run 4 minutes worth of ad-breaks per hour for streams which are not using audio pre-rolls, or 3 minutes and 30 seconds (3:30) worth of ad-breaks per hour for streams which are using audio pre-rolls.

A maximum of two (2) minutes is allowed pre ad break, with a separation of at least 15 minutes in-between each ad break.

You may not run two trigger files back to back.
Our system will not detect the 2nd trigger and therefore not inject any ads.

Broadcasters must point all listeners to the stream server that EmpireStreaming has provided.
Credit will not be given for listeners who are listening through a stream not provided by EmpireStreaming.
We highly suggest the use of PLS and ASX files to give to directories such as iTunes, TuneIn, etc.


How does it work?


Our ad-insertion servers look for the tags enclosed in the metadata of the trigger files, which specifies the length of the ad break.

Once our system sees the metadata, it will overlay our network spots over the top of your stream for the specified ad break length

Once the ad break finishes, it will go back to your stationâs stream.


Ad-insertion Setup:

 Once you are encoding and pointing your listeners to the stream server that we have provided you, and once we have verified that you are correctly running the ad-break trigger files, we will set up your stream(s) on our ad-insertion platform.
This can take up to 7 days from the point that you begin running the trigger files.


Reports and Payments:



Within 40-50 days following the end of each broadcast month, EmpireStreaming will provide a revenue/impressions report showing ad-insertion revenue for the specified month.

Ad impressions are calculated based on a CPM (cost per 1000 impressions).

Broadcasters are required to submit an invoice to EmpireStreaming for the amount specified in the revenue/impressions report within 3 months of receiving the report.
Revenue payments will not be sent unless an invoice is received by EmpireStreaming.

Ad revenue will be considered abandoned if broadcaster does not submit an invoice within 3 months of receiving the report.
It is the broadcasterâs responsibility to reach out if a revenue report is not received.

United States based broadcasters MUST have a valid form W9 on file with EmpireStreaming before any payments can be released.
Without a valid W9, any proceeds will be considered abandoned and future payments will not be paid out.
Broadcaster may submit proper form W9 and be paid, but only within a 3 month history of ad payments.
Example: Broadcaster submits W9 in September, only the months of June, July, and August will be added as account payments.

EmpireStreaming will distribute ad-revenue payments within 100-140 days following the end of corresponding month.
Only those Broadcasters whose EmpireStreaming accounts are current (i.e., active Advertising Supported Package and not delinquent) are eligible to receive payment from EmpireStreaming.

EmpireStreaming requires a minimum of $100 in accumulated revenues for payment via check.
There is no minimum revenue requirement for payment via PayPal.

EmpireStreaming has the right to modify the terms of the âAdvertising Revenue Share Programâ at any time.
