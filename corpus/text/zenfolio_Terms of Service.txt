GDPR Compliance: This GDPR Compliance section (the âADPL Provisionsâ) applies to you if you establish a Photographer Site and are subject to Regulation 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (the âGeneral Data Protection Regulationâ or âGDPRâ) (collectively, âApplicable Data Protection Lawâ or âADPLâ).
The terms âcontrollerâ, âprocessorâ, âdata subjectâ, âpersonal dataâ, âprocessingâ, âprocessâ, and âsubprocessorâ shall have the meanings given in the ADPL.
Personal Data: You acknowledge that the Photographer Services are designed and provided for the primary purpose of enabling you to exhibit, organize, print, sell, exchange, and share digital images, videos and related products, and not for the primary purpose of storage, management or processing of sensitive personally identifiable information.
Some personal data is required to provide and use the Photographer Services, such as email address, payment information, password, and a user name, and other similar non-sensitive personal information may be entered by you or visitors to your Photographer Site in the form of orders, posts, blogs, electronic communications, and other Photographer Site Content.
Processing: You expressly acknowledge that: (i) you are the controller of personal data included in the Photographer Site Content.
(ii) You hereby appoint Zenfolio as a processor to process the personal data included in the Photographer Site Content.
(iii) Zenfolio shall process personal data as a processor as necessary to perform its obligations under these Terms and strictly in accordance with your instructions as documented in these Terms, except where otherwise required by any applicable law.
and, Zenfolio shall comply with Applicable Data Protection Law in its processing of personal data of European Economic Area (âEEAâ) data subjects.
Limitations:&nbsp.
You acknowledge and agree that Photographer Site Features give you, not Zenfolio, control over access, additions, deletions, modifications and monitoring of personal data and that, accordingly: (i) the core activities of Zenfolio do not involve any monitoring of a data subject.
and (ii) Zenfolio does not have actual knowledge of the types of personal data that you may host using the Photographer Services.&nbsp.
Hence, the provisions of Article 11 of the GDPR apply to the processing conducted by Zenfolio.
and (ii) Zenfolio does not have to appoint a data protection officer as referenced in Article 37 of the GDPR or a representative in the European Union (âEUâ) pursuant to Article 27(2)(a) of the GDPR.
Transfers: You represent and warrant that: (i) you have obtained all consents, and have all necessary rights, to transfer personal data of European Economic Area (âEEAâ) data subject outside of the EEA as part of Photographer Services and in compliance with ADPL.  
Confidentiality: Zenfolio shall require that any sub-processor or individual that access to personal data is subject to a strict duty of confidentiality, and prohibited from using the personal data for any purpose other than providing the Photographer Services.
Sub-processors &amp.
Payment Processors: To the extent necessary for Zenfolio fulfill its contractual obligations under these Terms, you hereby authorize Zenfolio to engage sub-processors identified on Zenfolioâs list of sub-processors at the end of this document (the âSub-processor Listâ).
.Zenfolio will notify applicable Photographers of any changes to such list by updating the Sub-Processors List and will give them the opportunity to object to the engagement of the new sub-processor on reasonable grounds relating to the protection of personal data within 30 days after updating the Sub-Processors List.
If the Photographer does notify Zenfolio of such an objection, the parties will discuss Photographerâs concerns in good faith with a view to achieving a commercially reasonable resolution.
If no such resolution can be reached, Zenfolio will, at its sole discretion, either not appoint the new sub-processor, or permit the Photographer to suspend or terminate the affected Services in accordance with the termination provisions of these Terms.
Technical and Organizational Measures:&nbsp.
Zenfolio takes appropriate technical and organizational measures for its own systems to comply with data privacy in order to ensure a level of data protection appropriate to the risk resulting from the processing of personal data under these Terms, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing, as well as the severity and likelihood of realization of risks for the rights and freedoms of data subjects.  
Rights of EEA Data Subjects: Zenfolio shall provide reasonable and timely assistance to you to respond to any request from an EEA data subject for the correction, updating, or deletion of the EEA data subjectâs personal data.
Zenfolio shall follow only your instructions in this regard.
You hereby instructs Zenfolio to delete all personal data, to the extent technically feasible, that has been deleted at the data subjectâs request from third party social media web sites from whom Zenfolio has obtained the personal data.  
Data Impact Assessments: If Zenfolio believes that its processing of any EEA personal data is likely to result in a high risk to the data protection rights and freedoms of EEA data subjects, it shall promptly inform you and provide you with all such reasonable and timely assistance necessary to conduct a data protection impact assessment, and if necessary, consult with its relevant data protection authority.

At your sole cost and expense, and subject to your compliance with these Terms, including the ADPL Provisions, you may audit Zenfolioâs compliance with its obligations under these ADPL Provisions up to once per year and upon at least 14 days advance written notice to Zenfolio, with such notice to include a detailed proposed audit plan.
provided that to the extent required by the GDPR or applicable law, you or the relevant data protection authority may perform more frequent audits.
&nbsp.
The proposed audit plan must describe the proposed scope, duration, and start date of the audit.
Zenfolio will review the proposed audit plan and provide you with any concerns or questions and work cooperatively with you to agree on a final audit plan.

The audit must be conducted during regular business hours, may not unreasonably interfere with Zenfolio business activities, and be conducted subject to the agreed final audit plan and Zenfolioâs or the applicable sub processorsâ internal policies.&nbsp.
You will provide Zenfolio any audit reports generated as part of any audit under paragraph unless prohibited by ADPL or the applicable data protection authority.
You may use the audit reports only for the purposes of meeting your regulatory audit requirements and/or confirming compliance with the requirements of these ADPL Provisions.
The audit reports are confidential information of the parties under these Terms.
Where assistance requested of Zenfolio in conjunction with such audit requires the use of resources different from or in addition to those required of Zenfolio under these Terms, you shall pay for such additional resources at Zenfolioâs then-current rates.
Liabilities:&nbsp.
Liability of the parties under these ADPL Provisions is governed by these Terms, provided that except for the intentional misconduct of Zenfolio, you shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Zenfolio Parties, and their authorized distributors and resellers, from and against any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, penalties, fines, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneysâ fees and costs) arising out of these ADPL Provisions.&nbsp.
