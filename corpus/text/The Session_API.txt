The Session has a read-only API.
Information that is available through the website as HTML is also available in other formats.
To request a URL in another format, add ?format= to the URL with one of the these formats specified: Formats JSON
?format=json XML
?format=xml RSS
?format=rss Endpoints The following lists are available in multiple formats e.g. /tunes/new?format=json or /recordings/search?q=altan&format=rss
By default, 10 items will be returned in a list.
You can request up to 50 items by appending &perpage= e.g. /tunes/new?format=json&perpage=35
If you request an individual item, e.g. /tunes/27?format=xml, you will get back the details for that item and any comments that have been posted to it. Tunes New tune settings

/members/ID/notifications/discussions Data dumps You can download CSV and JSON files of data from The Session on Github (.zip).
These are updated about once a week.
That Githup repo also has the same data bundled up into a SQLite database.
You can run queries against that database at thesession.vercel.app.
The result of any query you run has its own URL and is also available as JSONâthat means you can use them as an API.
If you prefer to work with GraphQL, you can use thesession.vercel.app/graphql to try out GraphQL queries. menu Log in
