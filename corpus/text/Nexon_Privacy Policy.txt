Geolocation Information.
Your device may enable you to control the collection of your precise geolocation information, and whether this information is shared with third parties, through the settings on your device.

If you opt out of providing precise geolocation information, we may continue to derive your approximate location from your IP address and other information we may collect.
For more information, please review your device settings.

Some web browsers may transmit âdo-not-trackâ signals to the websites with which the user communicates.
Nexon currently does not take action in response to these signals.
Interest-Based Advertising.While it is not possible to turn off all advertising, you do have the ability to control whether you receive interest-based ads based on information collected or received about your online activities and interests over time and across unaffiliated sites and services and your different devices.
You can opt out of receiving interest-based ads from companies that participate in self-regulatory programs such as the Network Advertising Initiative (US) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (US), EDAA (EU), and DAAC (Canada) by following the instructions provided on their websites.

If you withdraw your consent, we will stop processing your information for such purposes, but it will not affect the processing of information previously covered by your consent.

A request to withdraw consent, restrict or stop processing your information, or delete your account or information may result in your inability to access the Services or some of its features.
