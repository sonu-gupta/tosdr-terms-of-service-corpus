 You must be 13 years old or older to use or access the Service, unless you are under 13 years old and your use of the Service is directly supervised by your parent or guardian or another authorized adult (e.g., a teacher) who agrees to be bound by this Agreement.&nbsp.
Any use or access to the Service by anyone under 13 who is not directly supervised by an adult is strictly prohibited and in violation of this Agreement.&nbsp.

Your User Content and Canvaâs use thereof as contemplated by this Agreement and the Service will not violate any law or infringe any rights of any third party, including but not limited to any Intellectual Property Rights and privacy and publicity rights.
Canva may exercise the rights to your User Content granted under this Agreement without liability for payment of any guild fees, residuals, payments, fees, or royalties payable under any collective bargaining agreement or otherwise.
There is no suit action or claim or other legal or administrative proceeding now pending or threatened which might directly or indirectly affect any of your User Content or which might in any way impair the rights granted by you hereunder.
If your User Content contains or incorporates in any manner any components including but not limited to design elements, fonts, clipart, sprites, vectors or brush tools and the like that are included in design programs, by uploading any such User Content to Canva, you represent and warrant that the end user license agreement, terms of service or the equivalent license agreed to by you allows you to incorporate such elements in the User Content created by you, and to license such User Content to Canva for the purposes set forth herein.
Your User Content is neither obscene, sexual or pornographic, defamatory, or otherwise objectionable.
To the best of your knowledge, all your User Content and other information that you provide to us is truthful, not misleading and accurate.
You will not transmit unsolicited emails or engage in spamming to publicize or promote your relationship with Canva.

Upon making or learning of any claim that is inconsistent with any of the representations or warranties made by you, Canva shall send you written notice of such claim, using the email address provided by you to Canva, specifying the details of the claim as then known to Canva.
Pending the determination of such claim, Canva may withhold from royalties and/or other compensation due to you hereunder, such sums as are reasonably related to the probable value of the claim as determined by Canva.
Canva takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content that you or any other User or third party posts, publishes or prints over or using the Service.
You shall be solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of posting, publishing and printing it, and you agree that we are only acting as a passive conduit for your online distribution and publication of your User Content.
You understand and agree that you may be exposed to User Content or Stock Media that is inaccurate, objectionable, inappropriate for children, or otherwise unsuited to your purpose, and you agree that Canva shall not be liable for any damages you allege to incur as a result of User Content, Stock Media or your use of either in printed form.
In the event that your User Content is alleged to be offensive, inappropriate for children, unlawful or otherwise in breach of these terms, you agree that Canva may disclose such User Content to law enforcement or other government authorities.
4.3 User Content on Canva Print
In some countries, you may be eligible to order prints of your User Content on Canva Print, as part of the Services.
Your use of Canva Print is subject to these terms.
Canva has engaged third party supplies who will be responsible for completing your print order once you submit a print order using the Service.
We do not control these third party supplies and your order may, from time to time, be affected by circumstances outside of Canvaâs control. If you experience any issues, please visit Canva Print Customer Service.
 Please do not provide our third party suppliers with your personal information at any time.
You may order using Canva Print at your own cost, with such cost to be calculated and included as part of your fee.
Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee delivery times for orders using Canva Print.
If we provide you with a delivery time, it is an estimate only and we are not responsible or liable for any delays with shipping.
You agree to hold harmless Canva and its third party suppliers for any loss, cost or expense that you incur in connection with your use of Canva Print.
By printing User Content on Canva Print, you agree to take steps to verify that the User Content does not contain or consist of anything that is prohibited under these terms or is otherwise unlawful. You agree that this is not the responsibility of Canva or its third party suppliers, despite Canva and its third party suppliers having the right to refuse your order (which right you acknowledge).
4.4 User Content in the Community
4.4.1 Community
The Community is a forum located at http://community.canva.com (âCommunityâ) for Users that wish to discuss or view online discussions on Canvaâs services and products.
Community members can share and view information, questions and comments from other Users, as well as follow, message and recognise other Users and review and recognise their posts (âCommunity Contentâ).
Community Content will become public globally (including places without the same data protection as where you live).
4.4.2 Community Guidelines
To participate in the Community, you must be over 16 and comply with the Community Guidelines, as amended from time to time.
4.4.3 Retention of Community Content
Please carefully consider the information you include on the Community and understand that even after you close your account on the Community or Canva, your posts and other information will remain in anonymised form.
To request removal of your information from the Community, please contact privacy@canva.
If we are unable to remove any of your information, we will let you know why.
4.4.4 Free Community Content
Your Community Content will be offered for free to Users under the licence in clause 5.
You will not receive a royalty for Community Content.
4.4.5 Moderation
The rules applying to User Content under clause 4.1 apply to Community Content.
Canva may comment on, move, correct, delete, edit or refuse to publish your Community Content to ensure it is accurate, not misleading and complete, to comply with these Terms of use and our Community Guidelines or maintain the quality of the Community in Canvaâs sole discretion.
4.4.6 Third Party Content
If you share a third partyâs content on the Community, you must ensure you are permitted to do so under the laws applicable to you (including having a licence or their consent) and provide attribution (unless the third party waives this right or hasnât consented to their personal information being shared on the Community).


We welcome you to upload content to Canva, but we donât allow anything that is offensive, obscene, or could constitute or contribute to a criminal or civil offense, including copyright and other Intellectual Property Right violations.
If you want to contribute content to Canva to be licensed to other Users in exchange for royalties, you must agree to the Canva Contributor Agreement.
You promise that you have all necessary permissions and rights to submit the content you provide to us, and that your content wonât infringe anyoneâs rights or violate any laws.
You promise that your information is truthful.
Weâre not responsible for your content in any way.
Youâre also promising:
â You have sufficient rights to use everything you submit.
â Your content is appropriate for use on our Service.
â You wonât spam people.
â You wonât compete with Canva for advertising clicks to promote your Canva profile.
If we think youâre violating this Agreement, we may freeze your account until we figure it all out.
Canva Print lets you print the awesome designs that you have created on Canva and you can get them delivered to you directly.
Basically, if you canât upload or publish something on Canva, you canât print it using Canva Print.
Canva Print may not be available in your country and since we work with third parties, delivery times are estimates only.
 5.
User Content License Grant
By publishing any designs or content containing User Content using the Service, you expressly grant, and you represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to grant to Canva a multi-use, sublicensable, transferable, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide license to use, reproduce, modify, publish, list information regarding, edit, translate, distribute, syndicate, publicly perform, publicly display, and make derivative works of all such User Content and your name, voice, and/or likeness as contained in your User Content, in whole or in part, and in any form, media or technology, whether now known or hereafter developed, for use in connection with the Service and Canvaâs (and its successorsâ and affiliatesâ) business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Service (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels.

The foregoing limitation of liability shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by law in the applicable jurisdiction.

Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you.

Governing Law
You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in California.
and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over Canva, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California.
This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles.
The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Santa Clara County, California for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below.
If you are a consumer, this agreement does not exclude any rights you may have under the national consumer laws of your jurisdiction.

These terms are governed by the laws of California but donât exclude your rights under national consumer law.
If we need to enforce our Intellectual Property Rights against you, you agree to have the issue resolved only in the courts of Santa Clara County, California.
 19.
Arbitration.
For any dispute with Canva, you agree to first contact us at support@canva.com and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally.
In the unlikely event that Canva has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any Canva claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to this Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, âClaimsâ), by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ) under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein.
The arbitration will be conducted in Santa Clara County, California, unless you and Canva agree otherwise.
Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules.
The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneysâ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of that partyâs data security, Intellectual Property Rights, or other proprietary rights.
All claims must be brought in the partiesâ individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding, and, unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one personâs claims.
You agree that, by entering into this agreement, you and Canva are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.


If you have any disagreements, contact us first.
Weâre decent people, but if we canât work it out, then you agree to submit the dispute to arbitration in Santa Clara County, California (except in certain circumstances relating the protection of Intellectual Property Rights.)
