KC is a virtual currency issued by the Company to be used solely in connection with the Kitely Services.
KC may be purchased from Company, and may not be refunded, traded, exchanged, transferred, or sold except within Kitely Services at Company's discretion.
Company may give and take away KC from time to time, without warning, and without compensation, for reasonable causes determined at its sole discretion such as fraud, accounting error, legal orders, and/or alleged violation of these Terms.
Company's prices are listed at https://www.kitely.com/services (the "Services Page").
Company will charge your account's KC balance ("KC Balance") a certain storage fee of KC per calendar day ("Day") per nonupgraded virtual world stored in your account ("Stored World").
When copying an existing virtual world or changing a world to be a Stored World, Company will immediately charge your KC Balance the current Day's storage fee for the resulting Stored World.
If Company is unable to bill you for Stored Worlds for more than 60 consecutive Days, Company may, at its sole discretion, delete all your Stored Worlds without notice or compensation.
It is your sole responsibility to make sure that your KC Balance contains enough KC to continue paying for world storage.
Upon termination of your use of Kitely Services, we will close your account and you will no longer be able to retrieve Content contained in that account.
Upon termination of your account all KCs contained in your Account shall be canceled and of no further force and effect.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, we shall, however, refund such KCs or any portion thereof if required by law or otherwise at our discretion. Kitely Market Kitely Services include a marketplace ("Kitely Market") where you can buy Items from Users ("Merchants") and sell Items you create to Users ("Buyers").
Kitely Market allows selling products for US Dollars ("USD") or KC.
When Items you sell via the Kitely Market are purchased using KC you receive the KC net of Kitely Market Fees (as defined below) into your KC Balance immediately.
When Items are purchased using USD, the money net of Kitely Market Fees ("Withheld Money") accumulates in your USD balance ("USD Balance"), and it will be transferred to you, following the Withholding Period (as defined below), at regular weekly intervals ("Weekly Payout Date").
You must have a working Verified PayPal account ("Your PayPal Account") in order to receive Withheld Money.
Until you provide the Company with the details of Your PayPal Account, the USD that you receive will keep accumulating in your USD Balance.
If you don't setup Your PayPal Account, or there's a problem with Your PayPal Account, then the Company won't be able to transfer Withheld Money from your USD Balance to you.
If at a Weekly Payout Date the amount of Withheld Money scheduled for transfer is less than 10 USD ("Minimum Payout Amount") then the transfer of that Withheld Money will be delayed until the next Weekly Payout Date in which at least the Minimum Payout Amount is scheduled for transfer.
You agree that if Withheld Money can't be transferred from your USD Balance to Your PayPal Account for more than 90 days, Company may remove that Withheld Money from your USD Balance, use it to buy KC (at the rate of 200 KC for each 1 USD) and add those bought KC to your KC Balance.
Company won't buy back, refund or otherwise convert money back from KC to USD under any circumstances.
The Company will withhold sales revenue from Items sold for USD for a period of 45 Days ("Withholding Period") to get past the PayPal transaction dispute window.
If no payment dispute is received from PayPal during the Withholding Period and the Company doesn't have a reason to suspect the Withheld Money is connected to activities that are against the Terms, the Company will schedule the Withheld Money for transfer to Your PayPal Account in the next Weekly Payout Date.
You agree that Company may, at its own discretion, delay transferring Withheld Money to Your PayPal Account if it suspects that it will need to keep the money in order to offset future losses resulting from PayPal disputes or credit card chargebacks connected to your Kitely Market transactions.
If Company suffers losses from your Kitely Market transactions it will deduct the sum of those losses from your current and future USD Balance and, at the Company's discretion, take additional actions to recuperate its losses.
All Kitely Market fees are listed in https://kitely.atlassian.net/wiki/display/doc/Kitely+Market+Fees ("Kitely Market Fees").
All sales in Kitely Market are final, the Company will not refund PayPal transactions.
Merchants can refund payment for a bought Item during the 30 Days following the time the Item was bought.
When a Merchant refunds a bought Item, the Company will also refund the sales commission it collected for that sale.
All Merchant-issued refunds are in KC, even if the Buyer paid in USD.
When a Merchant issues a refund for an Item bought for USD the Company will remove the money earned from the sale from the Merchant's USD Balance and will give the Buyer 200 KC for each 1 USD that he or she paid for the Item.
Real Money Processing Fees will not be refunded.
License rights to use bought Items are contingent upon the transfer of money from the Buyer to the Merchant.
All license rights terminate immediately and without notice if a sale is reversed for any reason.
The Company reserves the right to remove Buyer access to Items for which the Merchant does not retain payment.
You may not sell Items that contain brands, trademarks, copyrighted content, or any other sort of intellectual property for which you do not have an explicit license from the intellectual property owners to sell in the Kitely Market.
You must mention the existence of such a license in the Kitely Market Item listings of any Items that include third-party content which was not bought in Kitely Services.
You agree to provide the Company with documentation proving the existence of these explicit licenses upon request.
You agree that, except inside Virtual Worlds, you will not use Kitely Services to specify how to obtain your Items that are listed in Kitely Market outside of Kitely Services. Money Back Guarantee If you aren't fully satisfied with your Virtual World then let us know within 14 days of when you created that Virtual World and we'll refund what you paid us to host it.
Refund requests must be sent from the email address you had used to create your Kitely Account, to the email address that is listed at https://www.kitely.com/contact (the "Contact Page").
