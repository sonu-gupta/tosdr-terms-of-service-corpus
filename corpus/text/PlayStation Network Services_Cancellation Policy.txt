How to request a Refund

In addition to the rights set forth below, you may have additional rights under applicable local law.
nothing in the policy below limits or replaces any such rights under local law. Games, game add-ons, season passes, in-game consumables and PlayStationÂ® Video titles
You can cancel a digital content purchase within 14 days from the date of purchase and receive a refund, provided that you have not started downloading or streaming it.
Digital content that you have started downloading, or streaming, and in-game consumables that have been delivered, are not eligible for a refund unless the content is faulty.
You can cancel your purchase of a season pass within 14 days from the date of purchase, and receive a refund, provided that you have not started downloading or streaming any digital content (e.g.
game add-ons) included in the season pass.

If you purchase in-game consumables on the PlayStationâ¢Store, they will be delivered when you next launch the game, until then you will have up to 14 days from the date of transaction to cancel.
If you purchase in-game consumables during gameplay, they will be delivered immediately so you will not be able to cancel the purchase.
In-game consumables are items such as virtual currencies (e.g.
FIFA packs or GTA Cash Packs), boosts and other items that are depleted during gameplay.
 Pre-Orders
You may cancel a pre-order of digital content at any time before the release date and receive a refund. If the release date has passed, you can still change your mind and request a refund up to 14 days after payment was taken for the pre-order, provided that you have not started downloading or streaming the content to your device.  See more information about cancelling a pre-order here. Promotional Bundles such as â3 for 2â
You can cancel your purchase of a promotional bundle (e.g.
3 games for the price of 2) within 14 days from the date of transaction and receive a refund, provided that you have not started downloading or streaming any part of the bundle. Subscription Services
You can cancel your purchase of a subscription service and request a refund within 14 days from the initial transaction date, even after you start using the subscription.
The refund may be reduced pro-rata to reflect the use you have had of the service.
This may show as two transactions in your account transaction history: a refund to your wallet of the full amount originally paid and then a debit of a charge for the period of the service you received.
If you take advantage of a free trial when you sign up to a service, the 14-day cancellation period will commence on the day we accept your order of the free trial and the duration of the free trial will be included in the 14-day period.
For example, you sign up for a free trial which lasts 7 days and your wallet is debited for the subscription at the end of the trial, you will have 7 days after your wallet was debited to cancel.
Note: When you purchase a subscription service such as PlayStationÂ®Plus, you agree to a rolling subscription with periodic billing (e.g.
annual billing).
You can stop making payments at any time by turning off [Auto-renewal] (click here for more information) but, beyond the initial 14-day cancellation period, you will not receive a refund for payments already made.
When you turn off [Auto-renewal], your subscription will continue until the next payment is due, at which point it will end. Wallet top ups
You cannot cancel a PSN Wallet top-up.
 When you ask us to top up your PSN Wallet using your credit / debit card, mobile phone, PayPal or other accepted payment method, we seek your consent to perform the top up immediately and, therefore, you cannot cancel the top up. Change of Online ID
You can revert to a previous online ID for free but you cannot cancel or obtain a refund for your purchase of a change of online ID unless faulty. Purchases made outside of PlayStationâ¢Store
We do not provide refunds for purchases made outside of PlayStationâ¢Store, such as voucher codes for PlayStationÂ®Plus and specific games. Further Information
We recommend that you take care when you top up your wallet or make a purchase on PlayStationâ¢Store.
A number of account features are available so you can keep track of your account activity.
