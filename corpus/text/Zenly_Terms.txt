Last modified: October 6th, 2021
Welcome :)
In case youâre not familiar, Zenly is an app that makes it fun and easy to know what your friends and family are up to and keep memories of your real life interactions.
Want to see how much you really know about your hometown? Show off how much of the world youâve explored? Lost your friends at a festival, on the beach, or on the slopes? Weâve got you covered! With Zenly, you can keep up with the people you care about the most, both near and far, create a personal diary of where youâve been, or publicly showcase the places youâve visited.
Weâve drafted these Terms of Service (which we aptly call the âTermsâ) so youâll know the rules that apply when you use the Zenly app or any of our other products or services that link to these terms (we refer to these simply as the âServicesâ).
Although weâve tried our best to strip the legalese from the Terms, there are places where these Terms may still read like a traditional contract.
Thereâs a good reason for that: these Terms do indeed form a legally binding contract between you and Zenly S.A.S.
(âZenlyâ).
So please read them carefully.
ð
In order to use the Services, you must have accepted these Terms, which are presented to you (i) when you first open the app and (ii) when we make any material changes to the Terms.
Of course, if you donât accept them, then donât use the Services.
ð¤ 1.
Who Can Use the Services
No one under 13 is allowed to create an account or use the Services.
Additionally, you must be old enough to consent to the processing of your information in your country.
By using the Services, you state that you can form a binding contract with Zenly and will comply with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules, and regulations.
The Services should not be used for business or commercial purposes.
If you wish to use the Services for businesses or commercial purposes please contact love@zen.ly.
ð 2.
Your account
In order to use the Services you are required to create an account.
Creating an account is easy: just follow the steps in the app! Here is some important information about your account:
ð¡ Name and Username
We ask you to pick a name when you create an account.
This is the name that will displayed when you use the app.
If you want your friends to easily recognize you we recommend that you use a nickname if thatâs what your friends call you.
You will also be able to pick a username after creating your account, so you can show your creativity to your friends later on with aliases such as StarlightUnð¦corn! Remember: most of the information in your profile is public and will be visible to the Zenly community.
This means that friends of friends can find you via the public friend lists and if you use social features your profile may be visible to larger Zenly community.
âï¸ Phone number and verification
You will need an active phone number to create an account.
To make sure other people donât start creating accounts with your phone number, we ask you to verify your phone number when creating an account.
We do this by sending a text message with a verification code to the phone number you specify when registering an account.
To complete the registration you will need to enter the verification code in the Zenly app.
We also ask for your phone number if you want to use our web based services, and will send a notice to your device to confirm youâre the one requesting access.
Please remember, your Zenly account is tied to your phone number, so make sure that your phone number remains valid in order to continue using the Services.
If your phone number becomes invalid you will no longer be able to access the Services.
If you want to keep your data when changing your phone number, please contact us at love@zen.ly.
ð Geolocation
Zenly is a location based app.
Therefore, we need to access and store your location data in order to provide the Services to you.
During registration we will request access to your deviceâs location.
You can turn your deviceâs location data on and off at any time through your device settings.
Just remember that the Services only work when device location is turned on.
We understand, of course, that there may be times that you donât want to share your location data with all your friends.
With that in mind, we have built some cool features in the app that allow you to select different levels of location sharing on a per friend basis.
We provide more details on this in Section 3 of these Terms and in our Privacy Policy.
Have a look: we think youâll like them! ð
ð Address book and friends
Zenly is the most fun when youâre interacting with your friends! Because of this, we ask for permission to access your address book.
This will give you the ability to add friends that are already on Zenly as well as invite pals in your address book who have not yet joined Zenly.
If youâre inviting friends to Zenly keep in mind that youâll be inviting them via text message, so be aware that your carrier may charge you for sending those text messages depending on your phone plan.
Also, when inviting friends, please be considerate and donât spam your entire address book.
ð
ð® Notifications
You can turn on notifications to get updates when friends accept your requests, when friends receive messages, when friends add you to a widget, and interesting tidbits on your friendsâ whereabouts.
For example, when theyâve traveled to another country like Monaco or Fiji.
ðâ Account Security
Once you have created your account, you remain responsible for any activity that takes place on your Zenly account.
Since creating a Zenly account doesnât require a password, make sure you protect your phone with a strong password.
Also, donât give your phone to someone else if you donât want them interacting with your account.
If you suspect fraudulent use or hijacking of your account please inform us immediately at love@zen.ly.
We will do our best to help you out as soon as possible.
ð®ð¿âð®ð»
ð 3.
Location based service
You understand that Zenly is a location-based service.
In order to provide the Services, Zenly requires access to the location data of your device and needs to keep a record of your location history.
You will first have to grant permission to Zenly before we can access your location data.
This is done via the Android and iOS permission screens and/or device settings.
Unless you have selected a different device permission or app setting, your device location will be shared when the app is running in the background and the foreground.
This means that, once proper permissions are granted, you don't have to actively open the app to share your position.
For example, it will allow your friends to find you easily in festivals, even while doing that crazy moonwalk you like to do sometimes!
If you want to stop sharing your location data, you can do so at any time in your device settings.
When you disable location sharing through your device settings you will be unable to use the Services.
Keep in mind that weâve also implemented some cool features in the app that allow you to limit your location sharing on a person by person basis.
Visit your profile to see what we mean.
You understand the Services work under normal conditions, but that the accuracy of location data depends on a number of factors such as sufficient network coverage, wifi connection, and so on.
For example, if youâre in a building or area with low network coverage the map might not display correctly and your position in the app may not reflect your accurate location in real life.
This point may be obvious, but remember that your location on the map is the location of your device.
For example, if you forget your device somewhere or lent it to a friend, your location on Zenly will not display your physical location, but instead the location of your device.
Zenly is a social network.
This means that by default we share your actual location with new friends you accept and you will in turn be able to see the location of your new friend unless you or your friends changes location sharing preferences through either their device settings or the app itself.
Because Zenly is a social network, we believe that most features and products work best when they are on by default.
For example, if you check-in at a place or tag a friend at a place, that information will be displayed on a public leaderboard visible to the Zenly community.
Donât want that information on the leaderboard, then there are always options to remove yourself.
Because of these inherently social components of Zenly, you should only add friends to Zenly who you trust.
Are friends spamming or stalking you? Then they probably arenât good friends, and you should consider removing them immediately and report them from their profile.
You understand that for our Services to work, we need to store your location data as long as you are actively using the Services.
We have provided more details on our deletion and retention periods in our privacy policy.
Have a look here.
The maps we use to show your location in the app are sourced from third parties.
There may be geographical areas throughout the world that have not yet been processed and/or changes made in the world that the maps do not yet reflect such as new streets or changed street names, and so on.
We love receiving feedback, so if you do spot any issues with the map please let us know: love@zen.ly.
We will do our best to fix bugs and other issues you may flag.

ð´ 8.
Third-party services
If you use a service, feature or functionality that is operated by a third party and made available through our Services (including Services we offer jointly with the third party), each partyâs terms will govern the respective partyâs relationship with you.
Zenly is not responsible or liable for a third partyâs terms or actions taken under the third partyâs terms.
âï¸ 9.
Modifying the Services and termination
Weâre relentlessly improving our Services and creating new ones all the time.
This means that we may add or remove features, products, or functionalities, and we may also suspend or stop the Services altogether.
We may take any of these actions at any time, and when we do, we will try to notify you beforehandâbut this wonât always be possible.
Though we hope you remain a lifelong member of the Zenly community, you can terminate these Terms at any time and for any reason by deleting your account.
You can delete your account by contacting love@zen.ly.
ð¢
Zenly may also terminate these Terms with you if you fail to comply with these Terms, the law, or for any reason outside of our control.
And while weâll try to give you advance notice, we canât guarantee it.
Our right to terminate these Terms means that we may stop providing you with any Services, or impose new or additional limits on your ability to use the Services.
For example, we may deactivate your account due to prolonged inactivity (12 months).
Regardless of who terminates these Terms, both you and Zenly continue to be bound by Sections 2, 6, 9 â 17 of the Terms.
