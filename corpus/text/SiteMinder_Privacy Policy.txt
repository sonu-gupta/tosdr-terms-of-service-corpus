We may from time-to-time make certain personal information available to strategic partners that work with SiteMinder, such as the following:

Various affiliates of SiteMinder, which means our current subsidiaries and our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries.
It also includes such other affiliates as we may add in the future;

and
In the event of merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of our assets, in which case personal data we hold about our customers will be among the assets transferred to the buyer.


If we engage a third party to process an individualâs personal data on our behalf, that third party will be bound by our data privacy policies or have similar contractual obligations in relation to the storage and processing of your personal information.

International transfers of personal data 
From time to time, we may transfer your personal information to our group companies, suppliers or service providers based outside of the EEA for the purposes described in this policy.
If we do this, your personal information will continue to be subject to one or more appropriate safeguards set out in the law.
These might be the use of model contracts in a form approved by regulators, or having our suppliers sign up to an independent privacy scheme approved by regulators (like the US âPrivacy Shieldâ scheme).
Our data is stored in the cloud using Amazon Web Services in the USA.
If you are accessing any of our systems from outside the USA, you acknowledge that your personal information will be transferred to the USA, a jurisdiction which may have different privacy and data security protections from those of your own jurisdiction, to be processed and stored.


Your rights 
You have the right to ask us not to process, or to stop processing, your personal data for marketing purposes.
We will usually inform you (before collecting your data) if we intend to use your data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes.
You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your data.
You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us on the details set out below in the âContact Usâ section.
Our website may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates.
If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies.
Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.


How you can access and update your information 
You have the right to access the personal information that we hold about you in many circumstances.
This is called a subject access request.
If we agree that we are obliged to provide personal information to you (or someone else on your behalf), we will provide it to you or them free of charge except in exceptional circumstances.
Before providing personal information to you or another person on your behalf, we may ask for proof of identity and sufficient information about your interactions with us so that we can locate your personal information.
We strive to maintain accurate, complete, and relevant personal information for the purposes identified in this privacy statement.
If any of the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate or out of date, you may ask us to correct it.
You have the right to object to us processing your personal information if we are not entitled to use it any more or to have your information deleted or have its processing restricted in certain circumstances.
You also have the right to port your personal data in certain circumstances.
If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the details set out below in the âContact Usâ section.
You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory data protection body that regulates us if you have concerns about how we use your personal information.
For information on how to do this, please see the âContact Usâ section.


Security precautions in place to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of your information 
We have implemented reasonable measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration and disclosure.
These include:

physical security and access to all SiteMinder premises;

Otherwise in accordance with SiteMinderâs Data Protection Policy.

We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of any of the website.
You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of your content, including personal information, that you contribute to be shared, published or displayed on a website, or transmitted to other users of a website, may remain viewable in cached and archived pages.
