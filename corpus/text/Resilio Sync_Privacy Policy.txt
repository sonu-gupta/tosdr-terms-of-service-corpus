As such, we have established and implemented this privacy policy to inform visitors to the Sites and users of the Services how we use and protect the information we collect.
If you have any questions regarding this information or our privacy practices, please see the section entitled âQuestions? Contact Usâ at the end of this privacy policy.In this Privacy Policy, Resilioâs software called the âResilio Clientâ application or the âResilio Connectâ application are sometimes collectively referred to hereunder as the âResilio Client.â Resilioâs other applications, including, but not limited to, Connect Management Console and Connect Agents, are sometimes referred to hereunder as âResilioâs Other Applications.â The Resilio Clients and Resilioâs Other Applications are sometimes collectively referred to as the âSoftwareâ.
What information does Resilio, Inc.
collect and how does Resilio use it?How the Resilio Client Works
Resilio software (the âResilio Clientâ) is a software application on your machine that manages downloads.
It downloads files quickly by trading pieces with other users who are also downloading (or have downloaded) the same content.
Your use of the Resilio Client to download files will, in turn, enable other Resilio users to download pieces of those files from you.
Although your IP address is associated with your piece of the file, other users will not have access to any other personal information about you.We do not track which files you transfer with the Resilio Client.
Merely using the Resilio Client does not cause a record of which files you transfer to be kept by Resilio or Resilio on behalf of any third party.

Most cookies contain a unique identifier called a cookie ID: a string of characters that websites and servers associate with the browser on which the cookie is stored.
This allows websites and servers to distinguish the browser from other browsers that store different cookies, and to recognize each browser by its unique cookie ID.
The use of cookies is standard on the Internet and many web sites use them.
Cookies allow web site operators to better customize visits to the site to the visitor's individual preferences.
For example, by setting a cookie you would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time.
