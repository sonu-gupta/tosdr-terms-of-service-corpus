Open Trade Statistics is an independent project that values reproducible research and provides tidy trade data.
We are heavily inspired by R community values and Open Licenses views on freedom.
We focus on commodities data and our added value, unlike many other good trade data projects, is that we focus on data processing and reproducibility instead of data visualization.
We advocate for openness and collaboration, so our contribution is focused on:

Releasing all of our source code on GitHub
Releasing snapshots of the software we use
Sharing curated data (direct download and API)

Besides open data we donât track users, we donât want your personal information and we use https to protect your navigation and our service.
Our goal is to ease data analysis, promote a reproducibility culture, and do something towards a better internet.
