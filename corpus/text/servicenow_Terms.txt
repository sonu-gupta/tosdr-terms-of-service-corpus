Minimum Requirements.
You must procure separate permission from us to use the ServiceNow Products, including: (a) any specific ServiceNow Product that may be required to run an App, including, without limitation, any ServiceNow Product required to use custom applications that run on the ServiceNow Platform.
and (b) any ServiceNow Product with which the App is intended to be used.
If you have no Subscription Agreement with us, then you may not use Apps.

Rights to Apps subject to App Conditions.
The user posting an App subject to App Conditions, and not ServiceNow, has sole responsibility for the terms and obligations of the App Conditions.
Your access, use or download of a Conditional Shared App or Store App is subject to the App Conditions presented to you prior to your access, provided that to the extent that the App Conditions conflict with these Terms of Use, these Terms of Use shall control to the extent of such conflict.
Notwithstanding any contrary term or condition in any App Conditions, you may not transfer, sublicense, distribute or otherwise provide third parties access to any App that you acquire through Store or Share.
ServiceNow has no responsibility for the contents of any App Conditions.

Rights to ServiceNow Apps.
You shall have, with respect to any purchased ServiceNow Store App, the rights and obligations applicable to âSubscription Serviceâ under your current Subscription Agreement, subject to the disclaimers set forth in these Terms of Service.
You shall have, with respect to any downloaded ServiceNow Shared App, a nonâexclusive, nonâtransferable, perpetual right to copy, use, and make derivative works of the ServiceNow Shared App solely to evaluate, customize, configure or use the ServiceNow Shared App in conjunction with ServiceNow Products that you are otherwise permitted to use under a separate Subscription Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a ServiceNow Store App or ServiceNow Shared App is subject to App Conditions, such App Conditions shall apply to your use of the App.
In the event of any conflict between App Conditions applicable to a ServiceNow App and these Terms of Use, the App Conditions shall govern to the extent of such conflict with respect to your use of the corresponding ServiceNow App.

Restrictions on Use of Store and Share Contributions.
Notwithstanding any contrary term or condition in any App Conditions, you may not: (a) transfer, sublicense, distribute or otherwise provide a thirdâparty access an App.
(b) use an App to develop a product that is operable apart from the ServiceNow platform.

or (d) use an App other than in connection with a ServiceNow Product that you are permitted to use under a separate Subscription Agreement.

Certification.
Certain Apps may be advertised as Certified, meaning that the App successfully passed a number of compatibility tests designated by us.
The identification of an App as Certified shall not be construed as making any representation, warranty, guarantee or promise apart from those set forth in these Terms of Use, nor that a contributorâs provision of, or your use of, an App is permitted by third parties or any applicable laws and regulations.

Testing.
The user posting an App, and not ServiceNow (with the exception of ServiceNow Apps), is the provider and grantor of access rights and has sole responsibility for the content of the corresponding App.
All Apps must be thoroughly tested by the user in a testing environment before use in a production environment.
You agree not to rely on any statements, claims, comments or other discussion on or through the Website by any person with respect to Apps.
Except as otherwise offered in any App Conditions pertaining to an App, you are solely responsible for independently testing and validating any App before deploying it in a production environment.
Accordingly, you shall not assert any claim for breach of warranty or contract or misrepresentation against any thirdâparty user based on the performance of an App.

Disclaimer of Support, Indemnification and Security. Your use of an App, or incorporation of an App (even a ServiceNow App) into any ServiceNow Product constitutes a modification or customization of that ServiceNow Product by you for purposes of any Subscription Agreement or other agreement between you and ServiceNow relating to the ServiceNow Product, and such customization or modification (or malfunction or loss of function caused thereby) shall not be subject to any warranty under a Subscription Agreement.
You are not entitled to support, service credits, refunds, service level agreement or other service entitlements under any Subscription Agreement or other agreement of any kind with respect to your use of any App except as expressly granted by us in any App Conditions.
Indemnification or security obligations imposed on us in a Subscription Agreement shall not apply to Apps that you implement or use in connection with a ServiceNow Product.
Except as otherwise provided in any App Conditions, the App contributor does not provide support, whether that contributor is us or a thirdâparty user of the Website.
To create an environment in which users are encouraged to contribute materials for discussion and testing by other users, refrain from making demands for support to the originator of the content.

Disclaimer of Contributor Liability.
You must review and thoroughly test in a nonâproduction environment any App prior to its use in any production instance of the ServiceNow Products.
You agree that you bear all risks associated with using any App.
EXCEPT FOR LIABILITY TO SERVICENOW OR AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED OTHERWISE IN ANY APPLICABLE APP CONDITIONS, IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY CONTRIBUTOR OR SERVICENOW HAVE ANY LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY HEREUNDER TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY LOSSES OR DAMAGES WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF AN APP, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, COVER, OR DAMAGES BASED ON LOST PROFITS, DATA, OR USE, HOWEVER CAUSED AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, IN TORT OR UNDER ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SERVICENOW OR THE THIRDâPARTY ORIGINATOR OF THE APP REVIEWED, MODERATED, COMMENTED ON OR PROMOTED SUCH APP.

No Warranty to User.
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED OTHERWISE IN ANY APPLICABLE APP CONDITIONS, APPS ARE PROVIDED TO YOU âASâISâ AND âAS AVAILABLE,â WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.
WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, EACH USER OF THE WEBSITE MAKES NO REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY OR GUARANTY, EXPRESS, STATUTORY OR IMPLIED TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSONS TO THE RELIABILITY, USEFULNESS, COMPLETENESS, TIMELINESS, QUALITY, SUITABILITY, AVAILABILITY OR ACCURACY OF THE APP.
NO USER WARRANTS THAT ALL OR ANY PORTION OF THE APP IS ERROR FREE OR WILL OPERATE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION.
WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, EACH USER SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL STATUTORY OR OTHER W ARRANTIES INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARISING FROM USAGE OF TRADE, COURSE OF DEALING OR COURSE OF PERFORMANCE.
ADDITIONAL DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTY AND LIABILITY BY SERVICENOW ARE PROVIDED BELOW IN THESE TERMS OF USE WITH RESPECT TO APPS. 5.
Posting Apps The terms of this Section 5 apply to any App that you post to the Website, including Store and Share, or otherwise make available to a third party.

Grant of rights to Shared Apps.
By posting a Shared App in the form of an update set, you hereby grant to each user of Share a nonâexclusive, nonâtransferable, perpetual license (to the extent of your rights in the Shared App) to copy, use, and make derivative works of the Shared App solely to evaluate, customize, configure or use the App in conjunction with ServiceNow Products that such user is otherwise permitted to use under a separate Subscription Agreement.

You shall not assert any patent right against ServiceNow or any thirdâparty user based on an alleged infringement that is caused in whole or part by their authorized use of any App that you created or posted to the Store.

ThirdâParty Materials.
You represent and warrant that you own or otherwise rightfully possess all intellectual property and other rights necessary to allow you to grant access to or license (as applicable) to any App that you post to the Store.

Service Interference.
