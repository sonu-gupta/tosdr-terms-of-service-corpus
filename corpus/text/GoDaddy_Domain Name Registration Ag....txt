Unless otherwise noted, the provisions below in this Section 2 are generally applicable to all TLDs that we offer.
Special provisions specific to any TLD or ccTLD (those in addition to posted Registry Policies) are identified elsewhere below in this Agreement.






Registry Policies.
 You agree to be bound by all Registry Policies (defined above in this Agreement) applicable to your domain name registration (at any level).
IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO VISIT THE APPLICABLE TLD SITE AND READ AND REVIEW ALL APPLICABLE REGISTRY POLICIES PRIOR TO YOUR REGISTRATION IN THE TLD.
REGISTRY POLICIES FOR EACH TLD CAN BE FOUND BY VISITING THE CORRESPONDING TLD LINK LISTED HERE.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Registry Operator of the TLD in which the domain name registration is made is and shall be an intended third party beneficiary of this Agreement.
As such the parties to this agreement acknowledge and agree that the third party beneficiary rights of the Registry Operator have vested and that the Registry Operator has relied on its third party beneficiary rights under this Agreement in agreeing to GoDaddy being a registrar for the respective TLD.
The third party beneficiary rights of the Registry Operator will survive any termination of this Agreement.








Registration Requirements.
 To the extent any TLD or ccTLD requires you meet eligibility (e.g., residency for .JP, .EU, etc.), validation (e.g., DNS validation) or other authentication requirements as a condition to registering a domain name in the TLD, you agree that by submitting an application or registering or renewing your domain name, you represent and warrant that: (a) all information provided to register or renew the domain name (including all supporting documents, if any) is true, complete and correct, and is not misleading in any way, and the application is made in good faith.
(b) you meet, and will continue to meet, the eligibility criteria prescribed in the Registry Policies for the applicable TLD for the duration of the domain name registration.
(c) you have not previously submitted an application for the domain name with another registrar using the same eligibility criteria, and the other registrar has rejected the application (if applicable).
(d) you acknowledge and agree that even if the domain name is accepted for registration, your entitlement to register the domain name may be challenged by others who claim to have an entitlement to the domain name.
and (e) you acknowledge and agree that the Registry or the registrar can cancel the registration of the domain name if any of the warranties required are found to be untrue, incomplete, incorrect or misleading.






Ownership.
 You acknowledge and agree that registration of a domain name does not create any proprietary right for you, the registrar, or any other person in the name used as a domain name or the domain name registration and that the entry of a domain name in the Registry shall not be construed as evidence or ownership of the domain name registered as a domain name.
You shall not in any way transfer or purport to transfer a proprietary right in any domain name registration or grant or purport to grant as security or in any other manner encumber or purport to encumber a domain name registration.






ICANN Requirements.
 You agree to comply with the ICANN requirements, standards, policies, procedures, and practices for which each applicable Registry Operator has monitoring responsibility in accordance with the Registry Agreement between ICANN and itself or any other arrangement with ICANN.
For additional ICANN-related helpful information, please see ICANN Education Materials and ICANN Benefits and Responsibilities.






Indemnification of Registry.

You shall not enter into any settlement or compromise of any such indemnifiable claim without Registrarâs or Registry Operatorâs prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, and you agree that these indemnification obligations shall survive the termination or expiration of the Agreement for any reason.
IN NO EVENT SHALL THE REGISTRY OPERATOR BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFIT OR GOODWILL, FOR ANY MATTER, WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY IS ASSERTED ON THE BASIS OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ITS INCORPORATED AGREEMENTS AND POLICIES YOUR INABILITY TO USE THE DOMAIN NAME, YOUR LOSS OF DATA OR FILES OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF THE REGISTRY OPERATOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

3.
FEES AND PAYMENTS




(A) GENERAL TERMS, INCLUDING AUTOMATIC RENEWAL TERMS

You agree to pay any and all prices and fees due for Services purchased or obtained at this Site at the time you order the Services.
GoDaddy expressly reserves the right to change or modify its prices and fees at any time, and such changes or modifications shall be posted online at this Site and effective immediately without need for further notice to you.
If you have purchased or obtained Services for a period of months or years, changes or modifications in prices and fees shall be effective when the Services in question come up for renewal as further described below.

Unless otherwise specifically noted (for reasons such as those highlighted in Section 2(x) above), the renewal price for any domain name in any TLD will be the same as the list (non-sale) price shown when you search for and select a domain, and again in the cart prior to purchase.
For example, if the list price is $9.99, and a different renewal price is not specifically identified, then the renewal price is also $9.99.
Likewise, if a domain name has a sale price of $8.99, with the list (non-sale) price shown (as a strike-through) at $9.99, the renewal price will be $9.99*.


* Renewal price subject to change prior to actual date of renewal.

For all other terms and conditions relating to fees, payment, refund and billing, etc.
applicable to the Services offered under the scope of this Agreement, please refer to the âFees and Paymentsâ section of our Universal Terms of Service.


(B) DOMAIN NAME RENEWAL TERMS_

When you register a domain name, you will have the following renewal options: 



Automatic Renewal. Automatic Renewal is the default setting.
Domain names will automatically renew, for a period equivalent to the length of your original domain name registration, and payment will be taken from the Payment Method you have on file with GoDaddy, at GoDaddy's then current rates.
Thus, if you have chosen to register your domain name for one (1) year, GoDaddy will automatically renew it for one (1) year.
If you have chosen to register your domain name for two (2) years, GoDaddy will automatically renew it for two (2) years, and so on.
If you wish to change your automatic renewal term to a different period from your original term, as of 16 July 2020, you may manually renew the domain registration to establish a new default automatic renewal term for the domain.



Manual Renewal. If you have elected to turn off automatic renewal and cancel the product (i.e., cancel the domain name registration) effective at expiration of the then current term, you may nonetheless elect to manually renew the domain name at anytime prior to its expiration date by logging into your Account Manager and manually implementing the renewal or by calling customer service (should you in fact want the domain name to be renewed).
If you fail to manually implement the renewal before the expiration date, the domain name will be cancelled and you will no longer have use of that name.


All renewals will be subject to the terms of this Agreement, as it may be amended from time to time, and you acknowledge and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement (as amended) for all renewed domains.
Domain name renewals will be non-refundable.
In the event that we are unable to automatically renew your domain name for the renewal option selected for any reason, we may automatically renew your domain name for a period less than your original registration period to the extent necessary for the transaction to succeed.
If for any reason GoDaddy is not able to take the payment from the Payment Method you have on file, and you fail to respond to our notices, your domain name registration will expire.
It is your responsibility to keep your Payment Method information current, which includes the expiration date if you are using a credit card.

For certain ccTLDs (.am, .at, .be, .br, .ca, .cn, .com.cn, .net.cn, .org.cn, .de, .eu, .fm, .fr, .gs, .it, .jp, .ms, .nu, .nz, .co.nz, .net.nz, .org.nz, .tc, .tk, .tw, .com.tw, .org.tw, .idv.tw, .uk, and .vg), renewal billing will occur on the first day of the month prior to the month of expiration.
For certain ccTLDs (.am, .at, .be, .ca, .cn, .com.cn, .net.cn, .org.cn, .de, .eu, .fm, .fr, .gs, .it, .jp, .ms, .nu, .nz, .co.nz, .net.nz, .org.nz, .tc, .tk, .tw, .com.tw, .org.tw, .idv.tw, .uk, and .vg), renewal will occur, or must occur manually if the product was previously cancelled, no later than the 20th of the month prior to the expiration date, or your domain name will be placed in non-renewal status.
For some ccTLDs (.es) renewal must be processed no later than seven days before the expiration date, or your domain name will be placed in non-renewal status.
When the domain name is in non-renewal status, you can renew the domain name only by calling GoDaddy and requesting that the domain name be renewed.
You cannot renew the domain name through your Account Manager.
If you fail to manually implement the renewal of any cancelled product before the expiration date, the domain name will be cancelled and you will no longer have use of that name.

You agree that GoDaddy will not be responsible for cancelled domain names that you fail to renew in the timeframes indicated in this Agreement.
In any case, if you fail to renew your domain name in a timely fashion, additional charges may apply.
If you signed up for privacy services, protected registration, or any other similar service, with your domain name registration, these services will automatically be renewed when your domain name registration is up for renewal, and you will incur the applicable additional renewal fee unless you cancel in advance.

If you fail to renew your domain name in the timeframes indicated in this Agreement, you agree that GoDaddy may, in its sole discretion, renew your expired domain name on your behalf.
If GoDaddy decides to renew your expired domain name on your behalf, you will have a Renewal Grace Period during which you must reimburse GoDaddy for the renewal and keep your domain name.
The Renewal Grace Period is currently twelve (12) days but subject to change under the terms of this Agreement.

For certain ccTLDs (.am, .at, .be, .cn, .com.cn, .net.cn, .org.cn, .de, .eu, .fm, .fr, .gs, .it, .jp, .ms, .nu, .nz, .co.nz, .net.nz, .org.nz, .tc, .tk, .tw, .com.tw, .org.tw, .idv.tw, .uk, and .vg) there is no Renewal Grace Period after the expiration date of the domain name.
If you do not reimburse GoDaddy for the renewal during the Renewal Grace Period your domain name will be placed on Hold and flagged for deletion after which you may have up to a 30-day redemption period to redeem your domain name, provided that your domain name is not subject to an expired domain name auction bid and you pay GoDaddy a Redemption fee.

The Redemption fee is currently $80.00 USD and is subject to change under the terms of this Agreement.
If you do not redeem your domain name prior to the end of the 30-day redemption period GoDaddy may, in its sole discretion, delete your domain name or transfer it to another registrant on your behalf.
During the redemption period your domain name may be parked.
If your domain name is deleted, the Registry also provides a 30-day Redemption Grace Period during which you may pay GoDaddy a redemption fee and redeem your domain name.
The redemption fee is currently $80.00 USD and is subject to change under the terms of this Agreement.
If you do not redeem your domain name prior to the end of the Registry's Redemption Grace Period the Registry will release your name and it will become available for registration on a first-come-first-served basis.
Renewal Grace Periods and Redemption Grace Periods vary for different ccTLDs.
Please refer to the specific terms for the applicable TLD.
In the event there is a conflict between the provisions of this paragraph and the ccTLD terms, the ccTLD terms shall control.
Our registration expiration notification policy and associated fees are described here.


(C) FREE PRODUCT TERMS

In the event you are provided with free products with the registration of a domain name, you acknowledge and agree that such free products will only be available with a valid purchase and may be terminated in the event the domain name is deleted or cancelled.
For free domain names, you acknowledge and agree that you may not change the account associated with such free domain for the first five (5) days after registration.
In the event a free domain name is offered with the registration of another domain and if the paid domain name registered fails, then we may, in its sole discretion, either delete the registration of the free domain or refund the difference between the amount paid and the value of the free domain.
Failed registrations associated with promotional offers may result in the deletion of the free or discounted item or an adjustment between the registered domain price and the value of the discounted item, in our sole discretion.



4.
TERM OF AGREEMENT.
TRANSFERS.
DOMAIN TASTING

The term of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect as long as you have any domain name registered through GoDaddy.

You agree that you will not transfer any domain name registered through GoDaddy to another domain name registrar during the first sixty (60) days after its initial registration date.
You agree that you may not transfer any domain name for ten (10) days after a Change of Account.

You further agree that you will not engage in "domain tasting" by using the five (5) day grace period in which a registrant may choose to cancel a domain name and get a full refund of the registration fee as a vehicle to test the marketability or viability of a domain name.
If GoDaddy determines (which determination shall be made by GoDaddy in its sole and absolute discretion) that you have been engaging in "domain tasting", then GoDaddy reserves the right to (a) charge you a small fee (which fee shall be deducted from any refund issued) or (b) refuse your cancellation/refund request altogether.
GoDaddy will not charge you a fee if GoDaddy cancels your domain name during the five (5) day grace period due to fraud or other activity outside of your control.
The five (5) day grace period does not apply to Premium Domains, which are non-refundable.

You agree that GoDaddy shall not be bound by (i) any representations made by third parties who you may use to purchase services from GoDaddy, or (ii) any statements of a general nature, which may be posted on GoDaddy's website or contained in GoDaddy's promotional materials.

5.

USE OF INFORMATION AND EXPIRATION

You agree to notify GoDaddy within five (5) business days when any of the information you provided as part of the application and/or registration process changes.
It is your responsibility to keep this information in a current and accurate status.
Failure by you, for whatever reason, to provide GoDaddy with accurate and reliable information on an initial and continual basis, shall be considered to be a material breach of this Agreement and a basis for suspension and/or cancellation of the domain name.
Failure by you, for whatever reason, to respond within five (5) business days to any inquiries made by GoDaddy to determine the validity of information provided by you, shall also be considered to be a material breach of this Agreement and a basis for suspension and/or cancellation of the domain name.
You agree to retain a copy for your record of the receipt for purchase of your domain name.


You agree that for each domain name registered by you, the following contact data is required: postal address, email address, telephone number, and if available, a facsimile number for the Registered Name Holder and, if different from the Registered Name Holder, the same contact information for, a technical contact, an administrative contact and a billing contact.

You acknowledge and agree that domain name registration requires that your contact information, in whole or in part, be shared with the registry operator, for their use, copying, distribution, publication, modification and other processing for the purpose of administration of the domain name registration, which may require such information be transferred back and forth across international borders, to and from the U.S.

You hereby consent and give permission for all such requirements and disclosures.
Further, you represent and warrant that, if you are providing information about a third party, you have notified the third party of the disclosure and the purpose for the disclosure and you have obtained the third party's consent to such disclosure.
Registrar will not process data in a way that is incompatible with this Agreement.
Registrar will take reasonable precautions to protect data from loss or misuse.

DEFAULT SETTINGS.
PARKED PAGE


Choosing Your Domain Name Settings. When you register a domain name with GoDaddy, you will be prompted to choose your domain name settings during the checkout process.
If you plan on using another provider for your website or hosting needs, then you should enter the name servers of such provider when you choose your domain name settings.
This will direct your domain name away from GoDaddyâs name servers.
If you are an existing GoDaddy customer and have already set up a customer profile designating your domain name settings for new domain name registrations, you will not need to complete this step again during the checkout process.


GoDaddyâs Default Settings. If you do not direct your domain name away from GoDaddyâs name servers as described above, GoDaddy will direct your domain name to a âParked Pageâ (âDefault Settingâ).
You acknowledge and agree that GoDaddy has the right to set the Default Setting.


Parked Page Default Setting. GoDaddy's Parked Page service is an online domain monetization system designed to generate revenue (through the use of pay per click advertising) from domain names that are not actively being used as websites.
If your domain name is directed to a Parked Page, you acknowledge and agree that GoDaddy may display both (a) in-house advertising (which includes links to GoDaddy products and services) and (b) third-party advertising (which includes links to third-party products and services) on your Parked Page through the use of pop-up or pop-under browser windows, banner advertisements, audio or video streams, or any other advertising means, and we may aggregate for our own use, related usage data by means of cookies and other similar means.
In addition, you acknowledge and agree that all in-house and third-party advertising will be selected by GoDaddy and its advertising partners, as appropriate, and you will not be permitted to customize the advertising, or entitled to any compensation in exchange therefor.
Please note that the third-party advertising displayed on GoDaddyâs Parked Pages may contain content offensive to you, including but not limited to links to adult content.
GoDaddy makes no effort to edit, control, monitor, or restrict the content and third-party advertising displayed on GoDaddyâs Parked Pages, and expressly disclaims any liability or responsibility to you or any third party in connection therewith.



Changing GoDaddyâs Default Settings. You may change GoDaddyâs Default Settings at any time during the term of your domain name registration.


Content Displaying On Your Parked Page. You can not modify the content displaying on your Parked Page.
You may select one of the other options listed below.

Participating In Domain Name Monetization. If you wish to participate in the domain monetization potential presented by GoDaddyâs Parked Page service, please review and consider purchasing our CashParkingÂ® service.

No Content. If the options listed above are not acceptable to you, please contact customer support to learn what other options might be available to you.




Return To Parked Page Default Setting Upon Domain Name Expiration. Upon domain name expiration, and regardless of how you use your domain name during the term of your domain name registration, your domain name will automatically return to the Parked Page Default Setting described above.
As used in this paragraph, âexpirationâ is deemed to include any ârenewal periodâ or âredemption periodâ immediately after the domain name expires, but before the domain name is returned to the registry.
Once your domain name has returned to the Parked Page Default Setting described above, the only way to opt out of the Parked Page service is to renew, redeem, or re-register your domain name in accordance with Section 2(B), Domain Name Renewal Terms, of this Agreement.

(B) PROVISIONS SPECIFIC TO .CA REGISTRATIONS


You acknowledge and agree that registration of your selected domain name in your first application to CIRA shall not be effective until you have entered into and agreed to be bound by CIRA's Registrant Agreement.



CIRA Certified Registrar
.
The registrar shall immediately give notice to you in the event that it is no longer a CIRA Certified Registrar, has had its certification as a CIRA Certified Registrar suspended or terminated, or the Registrar Agreement between CIRA and the Registrar is terminated or expires.
CIRA may post notice of such suspension, termination, or expiry on its website and may, if CIRA deems appropriate, give notice to the registrants thereof.
In the event that the registrar is no longer a CIRA Certified Registrar, has had its certification as a CIRA Certified Registrar suspended or terminated or in the event the Registrar Agreement between CIRA and the Registrar is terminated or expires, you shall be responsible for changing your Registrar of Record to a new CIRA Certified Registrar within thirty (30) days of the earlier of notice thereof being given to you by (i) the Registrar or (ii) CIRA in accordance with CIRA's then current Registry PRP.
provided, however, that if any of your domain name registrations are scheduled to expire within thirty (30) days of the giving of such notice, then you shall have thirty (30) days from the anniversary date of the registration(s), to register with a new CIRA certified registrar and to renew such domain name registration(s) in accordance with the Registry PRP.

You acknowledge and agree that should there be insufficient funds prepaid by the registrar in the CIRA Deposit Account to be applied in payment of any fees, CIRA may in its sole discretion stop accepting applications for domain name registrations from the registrar, stop effecting registrations of domain names and transfers, renewals, modifications, and cancellations requested by the registrar and stop performing other billable transactions requested by the registrar not paid in full and CIRA may terminate the Registrar Agreement between CIRA and the Registrar.


.CA ASCII and IDN domain variants
 are bundled and reserved for a single registrant.
Registrants are not required to register all variants in a bundle, but all registered variants must be registered and managed at a single registrar.
Each variant registered will incur a registration fee.
In addition, when registering multiple .CA domain (ASCII and IDN) variants in a bundle, your registrant information 
must be identical
.
If variants are registered at other registrars or if registrant information does not match, it may result in an "unavailable" search result, delayed or failed registration.
If information does not match, validation is required and may take up to seven business days and delay availability of domain.






(C) PROVISIONS SPECIFIC TO .CN REGISTRATIONS


.CN is a restricted TLD â applications are subject to both a domain name check 
and
 real name verification as required by the Peopleâs Republic of China.
Registrations in .CN are therefore subject to the following additional terms:


Verification, Registration and Activation
.
If a domain name is not permitted to be registered by the Chinese government, as determined by us, the Registry Operator and/or a 3rd party provider utilized for such services and determinations, in either partyâs discretion, the application for registration will not be successful.
In such event, the name will be deleted and you will be eligible for a refund as further described below.
If permitted, then the Registration may proceed, but a .CN domain name may not be activated (i.e., it will not resolve in the Internet) 
unless and until
 you have submitted (via the process described during registration) valid documents required of us and the Registry to perform real name verification.
The following are acceptable forms of documents for the purpose of verification:


China: Resident ID, temporary resident ID, business license or organization code certificate
Hong Kong/Macau: Resident ID, driverâs license, passport or business license
Singapore: Driverâs license, passport or business license
Taiwan: Resident ID, driverâs license or business license
Other Countries/Regions: Driverâs license or passport

Documents submitted to us are used by us and shared with the Registry solely for the purpose of real name verification, and are otherwise subject to our Privacy Policy.
By registering a .CN domain, you expressly agree that your data may be stored on servers in the U.S., or otherwise outside of the People's Republic of China.


Refunds
.
Refunds for .CN Registrations will only be allowed where (i) registration of the applied for domain name is not permitted by the Chinese government.
or (ii) you notify us of your intent to cancel for any reason within the first five (5) days after the Registration (i.e., after it is deemed permissible by the Chinese government).
For the avoidance of doubt, refunds will not be permitted under any circumstances after five (5) days from the date of Registration, including, for example, in the event real name verification is not successful or if the Chinese government determines after Registration that the domain name should not have been registered (and directs us to delete).






(D) PROVISIONS SPECIFIC TO .JP REGISTRATIONS



Registration Restrictions
.
You represent and warrant that you have a local presence in Japan with a home or office address.
You agree that certain domain names are reserved and can only be registered by certain parties.
These include: (i) TLDs, other than ccTLDs, as determined by ICANN.
(ii) geographical-type .JP domain names that are defined as metropolitan, prefectural, and municipal labels.
(iii) names of primary and secondary educational organizations.
(iv) names of organizations related to Internet management.
(v) names required for .JP domain name operations.
and (vi) character strings which may be confused with ASCII-converted Japanese domain names.
The complete list of .JP Reserved Domains is available here.
