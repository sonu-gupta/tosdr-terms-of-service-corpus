What rights you have over your data
If you have an account on this site, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us.
You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you.
This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.
Where we send your data
Visitor comments are checked through an automated spam detection service (Akismet Anti-Spam).
Akismet collects information about visitors who comment.
The information it collects includes the commenterâs IP address, user agent, referrer, and site URL (along with other information directly provided by the commenter such as their name, username, email address, and the comment itself).
Visitors are checked through an automated firewall (WordFence), which will collect your IP, location, and internet operator.
However, we only check this information if WordFence sends a spam alert or website breach-related to the IP, which is rare since the IP blocking in the circumstances above is an automated feature.
We also use reCaptcha.
ReCAPTCHA helps websites and mobile apps prevent spam and block âbots.â The program determines whether the user is a real person or a âbotâ to stop âautomated softwareâ from weighing down your site.
ReCAPTCHA works by implementing an algorithm to analyze a userâs activity by taking a userâs browser window screenshot.
If the activity is deemed as mechanical or a made-up word is used, the activity is flagged by the system.

Activity and user information reCAPTCHA collects and analyzes the following:

Typing patterns of the user
The amount of mouse clicks a user has done on the site or touches on an app
What language the userâs browser is using
Google cookies that have been placed on the site
The answers to question fields on the site
CSS information
Plug-ins installed on the browser

The algorithm also recognizes IP addresses that have been previously recognized as humans through cookies.
We use the version V3.
ReCAPTCHA v3 doesnât rely on users clicking checkboxes or pictures.
The version 3 collects and analyzes the interactions a user has with a site to create a score.
The final score indicates whether the activity is suspicious.
This version decreases âuser frictionâ by doing away with questions and creating a seamless user experience.
Registered users are also checked through the services above.
Your contact information
Any contact about your data should be done to reb@rbarata.com
Additional information

We do not receive data from third parties.
We are hosted in wordpress.com, which provides all automated security and spam options.
We also have an additional firewall and security software.
(WordFence)
In case of any breach, we will contact the registered users at the email address provided.
We donât use any automatic user data management.
The way your data can be registered/sent is also dependent on the plugins or other applications that you may have installed or operated in conjunction with your browser or equipment, which we are not responsible for and can not predict.
So, please use tracker blockers, VPN, or any other privacy tools in your browser that will protect you from it.
However, be aware that some functions may not be visible.
