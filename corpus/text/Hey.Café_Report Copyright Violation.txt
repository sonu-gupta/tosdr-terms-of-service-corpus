We want people to feel safe about contacting us when someone has stolen work and is hosted on Hey.CafÃ©.
We also want our users to know we will fully investigate and talk with both parties, we will then remove content if it's found to be in violation.


Sending in a request is easy, just email us at the following email and include the information listed below.


report@hey.cafe




Include links to the content violating your rights, as well as links showing the work as your own.
It's best to link to your content as it was before being hosted by someone on Hey.CafÃ©.
If the media is artwork it's best to take a photo of you with it and send that in also.
We also require your full name and location to the city, we don't need your home address just what city you live in.


Reports are NOT legal binding


We are not a USA company so we won't enforce takedowns as a LEGAL enforcement.
We will take down in good faith as long as all evidence from both parties shows ownership of the content to a single person.
If we don't feel confident about who is the owner of the content, we will not take the content down or ban users.
