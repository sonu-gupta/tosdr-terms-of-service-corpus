This Privacy Policy only concerns TGTGâs Customers and users of our Platform and Services.

What information do we collect?
TGTG collects information to operate our business and provide you with opportunities for reducing food waste.
We collect both Personal Data and Other Information in support of these efforts.

"Personal Data" is information that can be used, directly or indirectly, alone or together with other information, to identify you as an individual Customer.
This may include your precise Location Data.

Some examples include age, gender, browser and operating system, time spent using our Services, and webpages visited.
We collect and use this information to understand how you and our Customers as a whole use our Services and constantly tune, enhance, innovate and build products and services to reflect the needs of our Customers.
We also collect responses from trusted Payment Service Providers when you make purchases on the Platform.
Depending on payment method, this may include a subscription ID that is sent to the Payment Service Provider.
We DO NOT collect any credit card information.
When you are using a mobile device, we also collect and use your Apple Identifier for Advertising (IDFA) and Google Advertising ID (AAID) to recognize your device and support activities on our Services.
These number values are not permanently tied to your device and, depending on your operating system, you can reset it through your device settings.

You may choose to enable, log into or sign on to the Services through Facebook ("Social Networking Services").

Tailor our advertising and marketing

We use Personal Data and Other Information to assist us in our advertising and marketing campaigns, to provide you with information on the products and Services that we think are most relevant to you.
We may work with third parties who collect information on our website and on other properties through the use of cookies and similar methods in order to serve you with relevant advertisements on other websites and services or to determine that you have seen our advertisements on other services.
For example, if you visit our website, we may target an ad to you on Facebook since we know you have visited our website.
You do have the ability to control certain advertising practices.
We comply with the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising as administered by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA).
You can learn more about interest-based advertising and opt-out of targeted advertising from certain providers with whom we work by visiting the DAAâs consumer choice page.
The opt-out process through the DAA relies upon the placement of an opt-out cookie on your device, so you must repeat this process on each device or if your cookies are purged from your device.
Cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on certain mobile services.
Users may opt out of certain advertisements on mobile applications or reset advertising identifiers via their device settings as described below.
You may opt-out of being tracked online by certain companies who are listed at https://aboutads.info/choices OR https://networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp and may also learn more about online behavioral advertising at such websites.
If you opt-out, you will still receive advertisements, but they will not be delivered to you by such companies from whom you have opted-out based upon your behavioral data possessed by the companies from whom you have opted-out.

What are your rights?

Rigths for California users
California law provides California residents with specific rights regarding their personal information.
The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (âCCPAâ) defines âpersonal informationâ as information that identifies, relates to, describes, references, or is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.
This section describes the rights that California residents have with respect to such personal information and explains how to exercise those rights, subject in all cases to any limitations set forth in the CCPA.
Please refer to the section entitled âWhat Information Do We Collectâ above for more detail about the types of information collected, the purposes for which and sources from where we collect personal information, and the third parties with whom we share personal information.

California Specific Rights, Choices, and Opt-Outs: The CCPA provides California residents with specific rights regarding their personal information.
The subsections that follow describe the rights that you have under CCPA if you are a California resident and explain how you can exercise those rights.

Right to Know About Personal Information Collected, Disclosed, or Sold.
You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection, use, disclosure, or sale of your personal information over the past 12 months.
Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see Exercising Your Right to Know or Delete), and subject to certain limitations described below or set forth in the CCPA, we will disclose such information to you.
You have the right to request any or all of the following: 
The categories of personal information we collected about you.
The categories of sources from which the personal information is collected.
Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information.
The categories of personal information about you that we have sold or disclosed for a business purposes.
The categories of third parties to whom the information is sold or disclosed for a business purpose.
The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you.



Deletion Request Rights.
You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions.
Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see Exercising Right to Know or Delete), we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.
However, we may retain personal information that has been de-identified or aggregated.
Furthermore, we may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) in order to perform certain actions set forth under CCPA, such as detecting security incidents and protecting against fraudulent or illegal activity.

Exercising Your Right to Know or Delete.
To exercise your right to know or delete, please submit a request to us by emailing us at privacy@toogoodtogo.com

Only you, or a person or business entity registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf (an âauthorized agentâ), may make the requests set forth above.
The request should include your contact information and describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
In addition, you should provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify that you are the person about whom we collected the personal information or an authorized representative of that person.
For more information about verification, see Response Timing and Format immediately below.

Response Timing and Format.
In order to protect the security of your personal information, we will not honor a request if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.
The method used to verify your identity will depend on the type, sensitivity, and value of the information, including the risk of harm to you posed by any authorized access or deletion.
Generally speaking, verification will be performed by matching the identifying information provided by you to the personal information that we already have.

Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your request (and will not be made more than twice in a 12-month period).
If we cannot comply with a request, or cannot fully comply with a request, the response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply.


Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights.
We do not âsellâ personal information, as that term is defined in the CCPA.

Non-Discrimination.
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.
