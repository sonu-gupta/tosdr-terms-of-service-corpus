Your account security is important to us.
It's important you know what we're doing to ensure your accounts are protected, and how you can protect yourself.

What BECU Is Doing to Protect You
Our websites are secured using digital certificates and industry-standard encryption and time-sensitive session cookies in order to obtain personal information for member transactions.
We only support browsers that can provide industry-accepted encryption protocols.
These protections ensure that you are actually dealing with BECU, and not an imposter site impersonating us.
Your connection to our websites uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) to protect the contents of the message from eavesdropping and interception. 
What You Can Do to Protect Yourself
Our security measures are only a part of what it takes to make sure you're protected, because no security is perfect.
It's your responsibility to use up-to-date software, and to enable security features such as anti-virus, anti-malware, and only connect from trusted networks.
Your computer's browser communicates with our computer, systems and websites.
Frequently Update Your Browser
You will need to update your web browser periodically to ensure that your interactions with our website are safe and secureâand to ensure an optimal experience.
We recommend using the most up-to-date version of your web browser.
Setup Your Security Preferences in Online Banking
You can set your account security preferences any time in online banking.
We use these security options to verify your identity. Your Multi-Factor Authentication Security Options


You can select three security questions and provide answers that are easy for you to remember, but that only you know the answer.


You can set up convenient text verification with your mobile device.
If we ever need you to provide additional verification, you have the option to have a text with a one-time code sent to your mobile device.
You will then be prompted to enter that code into Online Banking.


You can update these security options at any timeâsimply log into online banking and go to Manage Security Options under your profile.
Create a Stronger Password
We may have prompted you to create a stronger password.
If you have not done so, we encourage you to help protect your account security by setting a more secure password that meets the following requirements:


8-32 characters long


One upper case letter


One lower case letter


Either a special character or number


Does not contain your user name, real name, or company name


Does not contain a complete word


Is significantly different from previous passwords


Additional Password Recommendations


Use the longest password you're comfortable using, password length adds significant security with every additional character.
We recommend a minimum of 16 characters. 


Combine letters (upper and lower), numbers, special characters to create your password, trying to avoid dictionary words and predictable patterns 


As always, use unique passwords across Internet services, especially financial services.


Monitoring
It's a good idea to regularly monitor debit and credit transactions.
You can sign up for transaction alerts for all of your banking accounts and credit cards.
Setting up alerts in online banking is quick and easy â just click on the Alerts tab and choose your options.

BECU's Money Manager is a great tool for managing all accounts â including those from other financial institutions â in one place.
Spending is automatically categorized and tracked from uploaded accounts, providing a holistic view of where, when and how you spend your money.
