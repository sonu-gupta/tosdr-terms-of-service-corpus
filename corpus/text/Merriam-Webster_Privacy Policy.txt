 Introduction Your privacy is important to us.
We understand that you are aware of and care about your privacy rights, and we take that seriously.
This Privacy Policy sets forth your privacy rights and applies to personal data we may collect: 

Through our free, ad-supported website products, services and platforms;
Through our free, ad-supported and subscription-based mobile applications (apps);
Through emails and other electronic communications between you and us (with your consent, where required by law).
and
Through any software provided on or in connection with our website products, services and platforms, apps, and emails (collectively, the Services).

This Privacy Policy covers Merriam-Webster products and services only.
While you may encounter links on the Services to other websites and apps, such as those belonging to our third-party sponsors, advertisers, and other partners, please note that these third-party websites and apps are not covered by this Privacy Policy (unless otherwise noted on the linked website or app, which may be the case if, for example, the website or app is also owned and operated by Merriam-Webster).
See Links to Third-Party Websites or Apps below.
Your decision to use the Services and provide your personal data is voluntary.
We indicate on our online, mobile, and other registration forms what types of personal data are requested.
You may choose not to submit requested information online, or may choose to restrict the use of cookies (see our Cookie Policy and Your Rights &amp.
Choices below for more information), but that may limit the services Merriam-Webster is able to provide to you.
The Services are a network of general audience sites, and are not targeted to, and do not knowingly collect personal data from, minors under 16 years of age.
We request that these individuals do not provide personal data through the Services.Please see COPPA Compliance below for more information.
We recognize that information privacy is an ongoing responsibility, and so we will from time to time update this Privacy Policy as we undertake new personal data practices or adopt new privacy policies. Cookie Notice &amp.

When we refer to cookies, this includes other similar technologies such as pixel tags, or web beacons.

Other Information and Your Rights &amp.
Choices below. COPPA Compliance In accordance with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly solicit, nor will we accept, personally identifiable information from users known to be under thirteen (13) years of age without the consent of their educational institution or the child's parent or guardian.
We do, however, use COPPA-compliant, third party services that automatically collect or share certain information and usage data with us to support our internal operations as described under How we use your information and Puku third-party service providers below.
If an educational institution with students that are under thirteen (13) years of age uses our Merriam-Webster Unabridged Service, the educational institution also may provide us with personally identifiable information about its students.
We use student information to provide this Service to the educational institution and its students, consistent with our Merriam-Webster Unabridged Privacy Notice.

 Purposes for processing (using) personal data provided directly by you As explained above, Merriam-Webster processes your data to provide you with the products and services you have requested or purchased from us, including special features, subscriptions, newsletters, and other content.
Sometimes we use third-party providers or work with co-sponsors to facilitate the delivery of the services or special features described above, and these third-party providers may be supplied with or have access to your personal information for the sole purpose of providing services to you on our behalf, such as Word of the Day or delivering the special feature.
Also, we may disclose your personal information in special legal circumstances.
For instance, such information may be used where it is necessary to protect our copyright or intellectual property rights, or if the law requires us to do so.

necessary to perform the contractual obligations in our Terms of Service and to provide the requested Services to you;
necessary for a third party's, or our, legitimate interests;
necessary to comply with a legal obligation or to defend legal claims;
necessary to protect the public interest or vital interest of others;
you have expressly made information public.
or
you have consented to the processing, which may be revoked at any time.

You can update your personal information and change your marketing preferences at any time by sending an email to privacy@m-w.com.

 Payment card information You may choose to purchase goods or services from Merriam-Webster using a payment card.
Typically, payment card information is provided directly by users, via the Services, into the PCI/DSS-compliant payment processing service to which the Merriam-Webster subscribes, and Merriam-Webster does not, itself, process or store your card information.
We strongly encourage you not to submit this information by email.
When Merriam-Webster employees receive payment card information from users by email, fax, phone, or mail, it is entered as instructed and then deleted or destroyed.

 Links to Third-Party Websites or Apps You may find advertising or other content on the Services that link to websites, apps, products, or services belonging to our third-party partners, suppliers, advertisers, sponsors, licensors and other third parties, or offer content, functionality, or apps developed and maintained by third parties not controlled by Merriam-Webster.
These third-party linked websites, apps, products, services and advertisements may use automated means to collect information about you and your use of these features.
Merriam-Webster provides these links solely as a convenience to you.
Merriam-Webster does not control and is not responsible for the practices employed by websites, apps, products, services, or advertisements linked to or from the Services.
Therefore, Merriam-Webster disclaims liability for any information, materials, products or services offered at any third-party website linked to or from the Services.
 Such third-party websites, apps, products, or services may have terms and conditions (as well as privacy policies) that are different from those set forth here.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to the activities of Merriam-Websterâs third-party sponsors, advertisers, and other partners that may collect your user information while you access or use such third partyâs services in connection with your use of the Services (e.g.
social media and sharing services).
Merriam-Webster is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these third-party linked services once you leave the Services, click an advertisement or sign up for a special offer.
We encourage you to read and review the privacy statement of each third-party service that you may choose to use and we urge all users of our Services to follow safe internet practices: Once you leave the Merriam-Webster Services, do not supply personal data to these third-party linked services unless you have verified their security and privacy policies.
 Use of Our Services - Information Collected Automatically &amp.
Other Information Like other commercial websites, Merriam-Webster and our authorized partners use cookies (small files transferred from a website to its users' hard drives or browsers for record-keeping purposes), including strictly necessary, performance, functional, and personalization cookies, software logs, and other similar information gathering technologies throughout our Services to collect certain information automatically and store it in log files to monitor the use of the Services, gather non-personal informational about our users, and for a variety of other legitimate business interests and purposes.
This information may include (but is not limited to) internet protocol (IP) addresses, mobile device identifiers, the region or general location where your computer or device is accessing the internet, browser type (for example, Firefox or Internet Explorer), operating system (for instance, Windows or Macintosh), your internet provider (for example, Comcast), and other usage information about your use of our Services, including a history of the pages you view.
We work with DigiTrust to set a cookie (DigiTrust Cookie) in your browser to enable us to collect web-viewing data that includes visits to a Merriam-Webster service and other non-affiliated websites over time.
We also work with third-party analytics providers, ad networks, and advertisers in order to track your online activities over time and across third party websites, apps and devices, by obtaining information through the automated means (including cookies) mentioned above.
The information received by us through these automated methods may include (but is not limited to) information about your activities across unrelated websites and mobile applications, information about the possible relationships between different browsers and devices, information that we receive from our third-party service providers, demographic data, information from social media providers, and information about your interests.
We may add this information to the data we have already collected through our Services.
Please refer to our Cookie Policy and Your Rights &amp.
Choices below for more information.

 Purposes for processing (using) information collected automatically &amp.
other information We may use and disclose information collected automatically through our Services and other information for any purpose, except if it is considered personal data under applicable law.
If we combine information collected automatically with the personal data provided by you, we treat the combined information as personal data and use it only in the manner described above.
See Purposes for processing (using) personal data provided directly by you above.
On the basis of legitimate interests, we use this information (or combined information) to help us design our Services to better suit our users' needs, to provide and improve our Services, for identification verification, to provide support, for statistical and market research purposes to tailor content to usage patterns, for analytic purposes through tools such as Google Analytics, and to personalize your experience by presenting content, products, and offers tailored to you.
This information, along with other information we gather when you login, also can be used to understand use across websites and devices to further improve our Services, and show you advertisements on the Services or other third-party websites and apps that may be tailored to your individual interests and enable us to offer the Services to you free of charge.
We also may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer our Services, analyze trends, track user movements and gather broad demographic information that assists us in identifying user preferences.



 Relevant content and recommendations We use Google Analytics Demographics and Interest reporting, which is a Google Analytics Advertiser feature that collects and stores standard internet log and user information on our behalf and gathers information about what pages you visit, how long you are on our sites, how you got here, and what you click on during your visit.
This Google Analytics data is not tied to personal information, so this information cannot be used to identify who you are.
For our legitimate business interests, we use the data provided by Google Analytics Demographics and Interest reports to develop our services and content around our user demographics, interests, and behavior on our Services.

We use Heap, Inc.
to collect and analyze data about how you interact with our Services.
Heap does this by collecting data on what our users are doing, including (but not limited to) what web pages you visit, what you click on, where you are located and what browser you are using.
Please see Heapâs privacy policy.

 Advertising and interest-based, behavioral advertising In order to provide you with premium content, free-of-charge, DigiTrust and the third-party ad networks and advertisers identified in our Cookie Policy help us deliver advertisements to you on the Services.
The third-party ad networks and advertisers with whom we work are able to limit the online ads you encounter to those we believe are consistent with your interests.
This type of advertising is called interest-based or behavioral advertising.
The data collected using the DigiTrust Cookie may be used to infer whether you share interests with other users, and deliver advertising relevant to those inferences.
Please visit DigiTrust Partners for more information.
We also rely on third-party service providers to do things like: take user-level information, anonymize it through hashing (a hashed email address might look something like this: e820bb4aba5ad74c5a6ff1aca16641f6) and match it against other anonymized, people-based identifiers â doing this helps us serve you personalized, relevant advertisements.&nbsp.
Specifically, when you use our ad-supported Services, we may share information that we may collect from you, including your email (in hashed form), IP address or information about your browser or operating system, with our third-party service providers, Index Exchange (IX) and LiveRamp Inc.
and its group companies (âLiveRampâ).
IX and LiveRamp may use our first-party cookie on your browser to match your shared information to their marketing databases in order to provide back a pseudonymous privacy-centric identifier for our use in real time bidding in digital advertising.
These third parties may in turn link further demographic or interest-based information to your browser.
You have the choice to opt-out of the use of your data by third-party service providers for this purpose at any time.&nbsp.
Please find more information about opting out below
Since our Services are provided to you free of charge, we have a legitimate business interest in monetizing the delivery of our premium content to you on the Services through the display of advertising.
To the extent required by applicable law or contractual obligations, we obtain your consent before using your information for interest-based, behavioral advertising â please see our Cookie Policy.
Merriam-Webster does not provide any personal information to third-party ad networks or advertisers about visitors to the Services, however these third parties may use automated means, such as cookies, to collect information, which may include your IP address, directly from you when you use our Services.
Our Privacy Policy does not cover the use of information that they may have collected from you on the Services or other websites or the use of data that you provide directly to such third-party partners.
that usage is governed by the third party partner's privacy policy.

 How we respond to âDo Not Trackâ signals When you visit a website in any browser, you automatically share information with that website, such as your IP address, and other standard PC information.
If the website contains content provided by a third-party website (for example a web measurement tools such as a web beacon or scripts), some information about you may be automatically sent to the content provider.
This type of arrangement has several benefits, such as allowing you to access third-party content from our Services conveniently.
Some internet browsers or other tools include âDo Not Trackâ (DNT) features that, when turned on, send a signal to websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked across websites over time.
However, since no technology standard for DNT signals has been developed or adopted to date, Merriam-Webster does not currently respond to DNT signals. Children's Privacy
