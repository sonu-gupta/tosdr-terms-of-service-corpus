You may view portions of the Site even if you are not an Registered User of the Service.&nbsp.

âNon-Personal Informationâ means data that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information.
Non-Personal Information does not, by itself, permit the identification of individual persons.&nbsp.
We collect Personal Information and Non-Personal Information, as described below.
Company collects Personal Information as required to offer Services, as listed in the Terms and Conditions, as voluntarily provided by you in the course of correspondence or registration, and as otherwise identified below.&nbsp.
In addition, we collect certain information which cannot be used to personally identify any user, such as anonymous, aggregate or statistical data.
In order to use some Services, you may be required to complete the applicable registration form accessible on the Site.&nbsp.
All persons who register are referred to as âRegistered Users.â&nbsp.
Some Services may not require registration.&nbsp.

For example, individual users who desire to order a Product (as defined in the Terms and Conditions) must provide certain contact information, shipping information, billing information, and financial information (e.g., a credit card number and expiration date) (which will be collected by us or our third party payment processing service providers).
For some Services, each Registered User may be provided a unique username and password that enable access to the Service.
We may track the use of those usernames and passwords in order to collect and maintain records of individual transactions conducted through the Services by Registered Users, and those records may be associated with each Registered Userâs individual account profile within the Company system.
We also collect other types of Personal Information that you provide to us voluntarily, such as your operating system and version, product registration number, and other requested information if you contact us via e-mail regarding support.

We collect additional information through the Site and the Service that is not associated with any online account or registration information, and that cannot be used to personally identify you.&nbsp.
Non-Personal Information ordinarily includes aggregate, summary, or other anonymous data, and may include, by way of example, statistics regarding popularity of particular pages within the Site, or information regarding types of Internet browsers used by Registered Users.
 âCookiesâ are small files placed on a userâs computer by a Web site in order to facilitate use of that Web site.&nbsp.
For example, a cookie may contain information about a userâs preferences, so that the Web site automatically complies with those preferences whenever the user visits that Web site. &nbsp.

Company uses Non-Personal Information in a variety of ways, including, by way of example, to evaluate the performance of the Site and Service and the general preferences of users, or to generate anonymous statistics for our benefit or for our business partners.&nbsp.
Because Non-Personal Information is entirely anonymous, and therefore can never be used by us to identify you, this policy does not limit our ability to use or disclose Non-Personal Information.

If another company acquires our company, business, or our assets, that company will possess the Personal Information collected by it and us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.
Under certain limited circumstances, we may cooperate with legal investigations and/or we may be subject to legal requirements to disclose information collected through the Site or Services, such as, by way of example, to a court or a governmental agency, and our policy is to provide such cooperation and comply fully with all such legal requirements.&nbsp.
We may also disclose Personal Information to protect or defend the rights or property of Company or users of the Services and/or to investigate any violation or potential violation of the law, this Privacy Policy, or Terms and Conditions.&nbsp.
The disclosures contemplated by this paragraph (âNecessary Disclosuresâ) are necessary if you wish to use the Service.&nbsp.
As mentioned above, Company may use and disclose Non-Personal Information without restriction.&nbsp.
If you do not want us to make such Necessary Disclosures, or to use Non-Personal Information without restriction, you must not use the Service.

We do not maintain responsibility for the manner in which third parties use or further disclose Personal Information collected from you through the Site or Services, after we have disclosed that information to those third parties.&nbsp.
However, we do require our third-party service providers to promise not to use such information except as necessary to provide the relevant services to us.&nbsp.

The Site contains links to other Web sites.&nbsp.
Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other Web sites.
We encourage our users to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site they visit.&nbsp.
This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by us through the Site.Access To Personal Information Collected From YouRegistered Users may access their Registration Profiles at any time to update Personal Information contained within that Registration Profile.&nbsp.
Subsequent uses or disclosures of information by us will reflect those changes, but we have no ability to update any information previously disclosed to any third party. 
You may request deletion of your Personal Information by us, but please note that we may be required to keep this information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in which case we will comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such requirements).&nbsp.
When we delete any information, it will be deleted from the active database, but may remain in our archives.
The Site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and unauthorized alteration of Personal Information in Company's possession and control.&nbsp.
For example, whenever the Service requests that Registered Users provide sensitive information, that information is encrypted with industry standard encryption techniques.&nbsp.
When you are viewing a secure page within the Site, such as our checkout form, an icon of a padlock will appear as âlockedâ at the bottom of web browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, but the same icon will appear as "un-locked" when the user is merely âsurfing.â We currently use an encryption program known as âSSL,â or âSecure Sockets Layer.â&nbsp.
To learn more about SSL, go to https://www.ssl.com/.
Credit card authorization requests are sent using the same encryption technology.
Furthermore, access to Personal Information is physically restricted within our own offices, so that only certain of our employees are granted access to information as appropriate to perform specific jobs and tasks (e.g., performing customer service).
Please be aware that, although we endeavor to provide security for information in our possession and control, no security system can prevent against all potential security breaches, and we bear no liability for uses or disclosures of Personal Information or Non-Personal Information arising in connection with the theft thereof.&nbsp.
Likewise, Registered Users are responsible for safeguarding the confidentiality of passwords to any Services, and we bear no liability for access to, or use or disclosure of, Personal Information, if such access, use or disclosure arises in connection with the theft or disclosure (whether intentional or negligent) of a password.
