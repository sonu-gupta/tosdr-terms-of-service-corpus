 f.lux Privacy Policy Overview When you visit the f.lux website or use our software, we work hard to protect your privacy.
Like most websites, our Website uses cookies and Google Analytics, and we also use communication services provided to us by companies including Facebook, Disqus, and Twitter.
Our Software uses online mapping services (including Google Maps) to find your location, usually just once when you set things up.
f.lux needs this information to calculate the times of your sunrise and sunset.
Since operating systems and hardware are changing quickly, f.lux also has an automatic update feature that does daily checks and sends some information about your computer configuration to us.
We collect information about which versions and features of the f.lux software are used.
When you tell us to, we integrate with your home lighting (and to make this work, sometimes we talk to web services owned and operated by other companies).
We intend that everything we do that could impact your privacy is visible to you.
For example, on our Website, you can see a Facebook Like button, and in the Software, you can see a Google Map displayed in a window, and updates to the software can be skipped.
You can read our full legal policy, below. f.lux Privacy Policy We at F.lux Software LLC (âCompanyâ) know you care about the information we may collect from you and that you may provide to us and how that information is used and shared.

Any terms we use in this Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the End User License Agreement. What does this Privacy Policy cover?

If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at support@justgetflux.com. Will Company ever change this Privacy Policy? Weâre constantly trying to improve our Software, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but we will alert you to changes by placing a notice on justgetflux.com, by sending you a Notification (as described in more detail below), and/or by some other means.
Please note that if youâve opted not to receive legal notices from us, those legal notices will still govern your use of the Software, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them.

We may also collect usage information such as your Software settings and preferences, and system information (including, without limitation, make and model of your computer, driver versions, and connected display types).
Certain information may be required to take advantage of some of our features.

We may also automatically collect information such as geo-location data based on the IP address of your device(s).
When we collect the usage information described above, we only use this data in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally.

Information Collected if you synchronize your settings Some versions of f.lux will allow you to synchronize settings with our networked servers.
This feature allows you to subscribe to networked lighting schedules, to use the same schedule across your devices, and to control third-party lighting products.

You will have the option to disconnect at any time. How will Company use information that it Collects?
