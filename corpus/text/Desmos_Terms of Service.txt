Our Services
The Desmos Services enable you to explore math.
You can use our calculators and tools to graph functions, plot tables of data, evaluate equations, explore transformations, construct and represent geometric relationships, and much more.
You can use our classroom activities to create, teach and learn mathematical concepts.
By using the Desmos Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and to the collection and use of your information as described in our Privacy Policy.
If you do not agree to these Terms, you are not permitted to use the Desmos Services.
2.
Eligibility and Authority
If you are agreeing to these Terms on behalf of a school, school district, or other educational institution (collectively, a âSchoolâ) for the purpose of providing the Desmos Service to students through student.desmos.com (âStudentsâ), you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the School and you agree to these Terms on the Schoolâs behalf.
The U.S.
Childrenâs Online Privacy and Protection Act (âCOPPAâ) requires that online service providers obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting personal information from children under 13.
If you are a School providing the Service to children under 13 (whether in the U.S.
or elsewhere), you represent and warrant that you have received consent from Parents, or have the authority to provide consent on behalf of parents, for us to collect information from students before allowing children under 13 to access Desmos Services.
We recommend that all Schools provide appropriate disclosures to students and parents regarding their use of service providers such as Desmos.
3.
Personal Information and Student Data
This Section 3 applies to a Schoolâs use of the Desmos Service through student.desmos.com.
If you are a School user, Student, or parent, you may also refer to the Student Data Privacy Statement.
When Desmos is used by a School for an educational purpose, Desmos may collect or have access to Student Data that is provided by the School or by the Student.
âStudent Dataâ is personal information that is directly related to an identifiable Student and may include âeducational recordsâ as defined by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (âFERPAâ), 20 U.S.C.
Â§ 1232(g).

Confidentiality.
Desmos agrees to treat Student Data as confidential and not to share it with third parties other than as described in these Terms, and in our Privacy Policy and Student Data Privacy Statement.

Student Data Access.
You authorize Desmos to access or collect Student Data for the purpose of providing the Service.
In the U.S., Desmos shall collect and process Student Data as a School Official with a legitimate educational interest pursuant to FERPA 34 CFR Part 99.31(a)(1).
As between the parties, the School or the Student owns and controls the Student Data.
Desmos does not own or control, or license such Student Data, except as to provide the Service and as described in these Terms.

Personal Information and Student Data Consents and Authority.
If you are School User, you represent and warrant that you have provided appropriate disclosures to your School and to parents regarding your sharing such Personal Information with Desmos.
Both Parties agree to uphold their obligations under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (âFERPAâ), the Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment ("PPRA"), and the Childrenâs Online Privacy and Protection Act (âCOPPAâ) and applicable State laws relating to student data privacy.
Desmos relies on each School to obtain and provide appropriate consent and disclosures, if necessary, for Desmos to collect any Student Data, including the collection of Student Data directly from students under 13, as permitted under COPPA.
We recommend that you provide a copy of the Desmos Student Data Privacy Statement to Parents.
You agree to comply with these Terms and all laws and regulations governing the protection of personal information, including childrenâs information, and the sharing of student education records.

Use of Student Data.
By submitting or providing us access to Student Data, you agree that Desmos may use the Student Data solely for the purposes of (i) providing the Service, (ii) improving and developing our Service, (iii) enforcing our rights under these Terms, and (iv) as permitted with the Schoolâs or the Userâs consent.
Desmos shall not use Student Data to engage in targeted advertising.


Use of Anonymized Student Data.
You agree that we may collect and use data derived from Student Data for our own purposes, such as for product development, research analytics, and marketing our Service, provided that such data will be de-identified and/or aggregated to reasonably avoid identification of a specific individual.

Use of Personal Information for Marketing.
You agree that Desmos may provide customized content, advertising, and commercial messaging to school or district administrative users and teachers from time to time, provided that such advertisements shall not be based on Student Data.
For emphasis, and without limitation, Desmos shall never use Student Data to engage in targeted advertising, nor shall Desmos direct advertising to student users on student.desmos.com.

Third-Party Service Providers.
You acknowledge and agree that Desmos may provide access to Student Data to our employees and service providers, which have a legitimate need to access such information in order to provide their services to us.
We and our employees, affiliates, service providers, or agents involved in the handling, transmittal, and processing of Student Data will be required to maintain the confidentiality of such data.

Student Data Retention and Deletion Requests.
Schools may request that we delete Student Data in our possession at any time by providing such a request in writing, except that Desmos shall not be required to delete content a Student shared to public areas of the Service.
We shall respond to the deletion request as soon as possible, but in most instances within 45 days, other than for data stored on backup tapes which shall be deleted in the ordinary course of business.
For inactive accounts, we delete or de-identify Student Data in our possession after a period of dormancy or at the request of a Parent.
A Parent seeking to modify, correct, or delete personal information in a Student Account that is connected to an active School account will be instructed to contact the School to discuss data deletion or modification.
We are not required to delete data that has been derived from Student Data so long as it has been anonymized such that it does not reasonably identify an individual.
Similarly, we are not required to delete information which a Student or parent has saved or transferred to a personal account.

Data Breach Notification.
We have implemented administrative, physical and technical safeguards designed to secure Personal Information, including Student Data, from unauthorized access, disclosure and use.
In the event we have a reasonable, good faith belief that an unauthorized party has gained access to or been disclosed Student Data (a âSecurity Eventâ), that we have collected or received through the Service, we will promptly notify the School.
If, due to a Security Event which is caused by the acts or omissions of Desmos or its agents, a notification to an individual, organization or government agency is required under applicable privacy laws, the School shall be responsible for the timing, content, and method of any such legally-required notice and compliance with such laws and Desmos shall indemnify the School for costs related to legally-required notifications.
With respect to any Security Event which is not caused by the acts or omissions of Desmos or its agents, Desmos shall reasonably cooperate with Schoolâs investigation of the Security Event, as School requests, at Schoolâs reasonable expense.
Desmos shall be responsible for the timing, content, cost and method of notice and compliance with such laws as they relate to User accounts that are not associated with a School account.
