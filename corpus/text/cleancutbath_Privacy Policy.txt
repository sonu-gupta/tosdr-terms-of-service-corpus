We employ reasonable and current security methods to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure correct use of information.
To use some of our services, you may be required to set up a password-protected account or profile on our website.
We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone.
It is your responsibility to keep your password protected.
Our personnel will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email.
Remember to sign out of your account, close your browser window, and delete your temporary Internet files when you have finished your session.
This helps ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place where others may have access to it.
Whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online â for example, on message boards or blogs, through email, or in chat areas â that information can be collected and used by others.
No data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be perfectly secure.
As a result, while we try to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.

A company may also comply with the law by disclosing in its privacy notice that it provides consumers choice (opt-out or opt-in) regarding sharing personal information with third parties for those third partiesâ direct marketing purposes (as we do), and information on how to exercise that choice.
If you are a California resident and you have questions about our practices with respect to sharing information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes and your ability to exercise choice, please send your request to us via the email address or the mailing address set forth in Section 7.
You must put the statement âYour California Privacy Rightsâ in the subject field of your email or include it in your writing if you choose to write to us at the designated mailing address.

Please be aware that such a request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information that you have posted and there may be circumstances in which the law does not require or allow removal even if requested.
