For example, PS may provide a client with data collected from a recent survey, with variables such as age, household income, or gender from the registration survey appended to the file.
This is primarily designed to save our panelists time and effort, so they do not need to re-answer these questions on each and every survey.
This appended data, however, will never include personally identifiable information such as your full name, mailing address, or email address.

Do Business Members receive my personal information connected with my online survey responses?
No.
Your Account Information is not disclosed to Business Members who send you surveys through the TW system.

Any demographic information given to Business Members regarding the responses to their survey questions is aggregated and not personally identifiable.
Cross tab reporting is available to the Business Member, however there is no voter id, name, email reference provided, unless the Voter provides this information themselves by inputting this as part of an answer.
A Voter Member can also let others know his/her answer if they do so in writing through a blog comment post on the Site or through other means by the Voter Member directly when answering a survey.
To illustrate: If a Business Member is interested in internet usage, they may post a survey which asks Voter Members questions like "How much time do you spend on the internet a week, that is not work or school related?" Answer options might be in ranges like 0 to 5 hours, 6 to 10 hours, etc.
TW tabulates the results which will then be available to the Business Member by broad categories such as gender, age, country, state, ethnicity and marital status or by answer when crosstab reporting is used.
