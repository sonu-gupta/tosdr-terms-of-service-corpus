accessing the Site from, your mobile device ID or Advertising ID if you visit our Site from a mobile device, the pages of our Site that you are navigating through, the date and time of your visit, how long you spend on our Site or certain pages of
our Site, and what website you go to after visiting our Site.
This information may be used to determine how many visitors visit our Site or certain areas of our Site, how long they remain on our Site, whether they use the hyperlinks we provide or
respond to advertising and to tailor our advertisements to you.
We may share this information with partners who referred you to our Site, and with advertising partners, who may use the information to optimize the traffic they send to us and for
delivering targeted ads to you when you visit other websites.
We, our service providers and third-party advertising partners collect information about Site visitors using cookies and other tracking technologies (including browser cookies, pixels and Adobe Flash).
We use these technologies to remember your

We and our service providers and third-party advertising partners also use these technologies to track your activities on our Site and other websites, including the websites and web pages that
you visited, the ads or content that you clicked on, any items you may have purchased and the search terms you used, in order to deliver tailored advertising to you.
We may also share a unique identifier linked to you (such as a hashed or encrypted
version of your email address or telephone number) with advertising partners so that you may be served with tailored advertising on our websites or other third party websites.
However, you may opt out of network advertising programs that track your
activities across multiple websites to deliver personalized advertising content to you by visiting Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada Opt-Out Page, Your Online Choices from the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance, NAI Opt-Out Page and the Ad Choices Opt-Out Page.

your browser to automatically reject any cookies.
You may also set your e-mail options to prevent the automatic downloading of images that may contain technologies that would allow us to know whether you have accessed our e-mail and performed
certain functions with it.
See Your Choices below for information about your choices about how we use and share your information.
We use Google Analytics to help us understand how our Site visitors use the Site, and as well as certain features of Google Analytics Display Advertising to advertise online, sell advertising and to develop content.
You can opt out of your usage
data being included in our reports from Google Analytics and customize Googleâs Display Network ads.
Please visit Googleâs Ad Settings and Google
Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
Please visit How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps for a description of how Google uses information sent by our browser and

Most modern web browsers provide the option to send a âdo not trackâ signal to the websites you visit, indicating that you do not wish to be tracked.
At this time, there is no generally accepted standard for how a website should respond to this
signal, and we do not take any action in response to this signal.
Our third party partners, such as web analytics companies and third party ad networks, collect information about your online activities over time and across the Sites and other
online properties.
These third parties may not change their tracking practices in response to âdo not trackâ settings in your web browser and we do not obligate these parties to honor âdo not trackâ settings. 4.

We may share information we collect about you in the following circumstances.
Advertising partners
We share information with our third-party advertising partners as described in the Cookies, tracking technologies and interest-based advertising section above.

For example, our service providers may host our Site, analyze data collected from our Site, provide customer service on
our behalf, administer our promotions, facilitate and process transactions and payments, provide marketing or promotional assistance, distribute emails and other communications, post our advertisements (including online through targeted advertising
campaigns), and collect your feedback on our Site and advertisements.

Once shared, your personal information will be subject to the privacy policy of
that third party.

property. 5.
How we store and protect personal information
The security of your information is important to us.
While we have implemented safeguards to protect the information we collect, no website or internet transmission is completely secure, and we cannot and do not guarantee the security of your
personal information.
We urge you to take steps to keep your personal information safe, such as choosing a strong password and keeping it private, as well as logging out of your user account, and closing your web browser when you have finished
using a Site on a shared or unsecured device.
We maintain personal information on our servers (or those of our service providers).
Certain accounts you create on our Sites are password protected.
If you create an account on the Site, you are responsible for maintaining the strict
confidentiality of your account password, and you shall be responsible for any activity that occurs using your account credentials, whether or not you authorized such activity.
Please notify us of any unauthorized use of your password or account or
any other breach of security.
In identified parts of our Sites, we use SSL-encryption in an effort to protect data transmissions.
Our policy is to limit access to sensitive personal information to employees, representatives and service providers
who require access in connection with their job or service responsibilities.
If you correspond with us by email, text message, or using web forms like a âcontact usâ feature on the Sites, you should be aware that your transmission might not be secure or considered confidential.
A third party could view the information you
send in transit by such means or we could disclose the information you send in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
We will have no liability for disclosure of your information, including due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties during
or after transmission. 6.
Links to external content
Our Site may link or direct you to other websites, services or external content provided by third parties.
 We do not exercise any control over these third party websites or services.
We are not responsible for the privacy practices of such
third party websites or services.
 We recommend that you read the privacy policy for any third party website that you visit or service that you use. 7.
Children
Our Sites are not directed to and we do not knowingly request or collect personal information from children - persons under 13 years of age, or another age if required by applicable law - without prior verifiable parental consent.
If we become
aware that we have unknowingly collected personal information about a child without verifiable parental consent, we will delete this information from our records or, if that is not reasonable, we will take reasonable available steps to de-identify
the information. 8.
Accessing or correcting your personal information
We encourage you to keep your personal information accurate and up to date.
If you have an account with us, you can access and correct certain of the information in your account or public user profile by logging in to your account or profile and
making the necessary edits.
You may request access to or correction of your personal information in our custody or control by contacting us as set out below.
We may take reasonable steps to authenticate your identity before providing you with access to your personal
information or making corrections.
