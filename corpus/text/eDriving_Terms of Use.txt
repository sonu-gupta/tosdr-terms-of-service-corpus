Dispute Resolution
If you are a citizen of the United States, you agree to the following dispute resolution terms:

Binding Arbitration

To the fullest extent permitted by law, any claim, controversy or dispute arising out of or relating to a Service, these terms or any other policies or other terms incorporated herein (including the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, enforceability, validity, or rights under any of any of the foregoing) (each, a âDisputeâ) will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New Jersey, without regard to its choice of law principles.
You and eDriving each agree to submit exclusively to confidential, binding arbitration in the event of a Dispute.&nbsp.
The arbitration will be held in New Jersey on an individual basis and not as a class action.
You expressly waive any right you may have to arbitrate a dispute as a class action.
You also expressly waive your right to a jury trial.
The arbitration will be administered by JAMS (http://www.jamsadr.com).
You may obtain a copy of the rules of JAMS by contacting the organization.
Each of us shall agree on one arbitrator to conduct the arbitration.
In the event the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, the arbitrator will be selected in accordance with the JAMS rules.
Each party shall be responsible for its own attorney, expert and other fees, unless such fees are awarded by the arbitrator to the prevailing party.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, to the extent either party in any manner has violated or threatened to violate the other partyâs intellectual property rights, the non-breaching party may seek injunctive or other appropriate relief in any state or federal court of competent jurisdiction.

Arbitration Final

The arbitratorâs award is final and binding on all parties.
The Federal Arbitration Act, and not any state law concerning arbitration, governs all arbitration under this clause.
Any court having jurisdiction may enter judgment on the arbitratorâs award.
If any part of this clause, other than waivers of class action rights, is deemed or found to be unenforceable for any reason, the remainder shall remain enforceable.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if the waiver of class action rights contained herein is not enforceable as to any person or persons, such non-enforceability shall apply to such person or persons only, and all other persons shall continue to be governed by the Arbitration Clause.

Giving Up Right of Class Action

As stated above, these terms provide that all Disputes will be resolved by binding arbitration and not in court or by jury trial.
IF A DISPUTE IS ARBITRATED, YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER ON ANY CLASS CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST THE EDRIVING PARTIES INCLUDING ANY RIGHT TO CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY CONSOLIDATION OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS.
WITHOUT LIMITATION, THIS INCLUDES GIVING UP YOUR RIGHTS TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AS SET FORTH IN ANY STATE STATUTE.

Additional Limit on Claims

Except as otherwise prohibited by law, any Dispute must be brought within one (1) year from the date the cause of action arises.
13.
Miscellaneous 
If any provision of these Terms is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that provision will be deemed severable and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions.
These Terms and any other policies or other terms incorporated herein, constitute the entire agreement between you and eDriving relating to your use of any other Service and the use, handling, and rights to personal information submitted or provided by you, superseding any other agreement between you and eDriving with respect to the subject matter hereof.&nbsp.
Section headings in these terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
If any provision of these terms or any other policies or other terms incorporated herein shall be found to be unenforceable, the other provisions shall still remain in full force and effect.
