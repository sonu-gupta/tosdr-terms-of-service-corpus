The Narrativ Ad Exchange uses cookies, Web beacons, pixels, etags, and similar technologies to give Publishers the possibility to offer, and Ad Exchange advertisers the ability to show, targeted ads on the device on which you are viewing this policy or a different device.
These ads are more likely to be relevant to you because they are based on inferences drawn from location data, web viewing data collected across non-affiliated sites over time, and/or application use data collected across non-affiliated apps over time.
This is called "interest-based advertising." In addition, certain third parties may collect data on the Narrativ website and combine this data with information collected from other websites over time for purposes that include interest-based advertising.Opting Out for Cookie-Based ServicesIf you would like to learn more about this type of advertising, or would prefer to opt out of website interest-based advertising enabled by Narrativâs Ad Exchange, European Union residents may opt-out of this form of advertising by companies participating in the EDAA at www.youronlinechoices.com and all other users may visit  www.aboutads.info/choices to opt out of this form of advertising by companies participating in the DAA self-regulatory program.
