Controller's Contact Information


Introduction 




Tracking technologies, such as cookies, tags, pixels, fingerprinting, web beacons, and similar script, are used to store and/or share information about website visitors, their systems, and browsers.
The information collected by cookies and tracking technologies varies depending on each website's components and can be of a personal nature (information that directly or indirectly can identify you) and of a non-personal nature (information that does not identify directly or indirectly any single individual, such as cookies used to enable language settings on a website).
Information of a personal nature may include, but is not limited to, details regarding the device you are using, the browser you are using, your IP address, the previous website you visited, whether you clicked on one of our ads, and your browsing behavior. 



Some of the cookies and tracking technologies that we use on our website are strictly necessary and they are there to technically enable the website and its components as well as to enable security measures.
Strictly necessary cookies are activated without user consent because these are necessary for the website to work properly and in a secure way.
All other cookies and tracking technologies not classified as strictly necessary are subject to consent from website visitors. 



This Cookies and Tracking Technology Notice (âCookie Noticeâ) details each of the cookies and other tracking technologies used on our website, as well as the categories of information we collect, the purposes for which the cookies and other tracking technologies collect information, and their classification into the four categories of tracking technologies that we use.
This Cookie Notice applies to onetrust.com and all its subdomains. 

Tracking technology we use

We use the following tracking technologies on our website: 
Type of Technology
Description
Purposes
Cookies
It's a type of data from a website in the form of a text command (e.g.
a script) stored within a web browser to remember information about you, such as language preference and login information, or to carry out the necessary communication transmissions (e.g.
HTTP requests) to provide a service or application that you have requested.
 

Delivering security features to enhance protection against multiple types of attacks or network abuse;
Assisting you in navigation, providing essential functionalities related to our service, application, and website (e.g.
displaying pages and visual elements);
Assisting you in registration to our events, login, and your ability to provide feedback;
Assessing your use of our products, services, or applications to provide us aggregated statistics (e.g.
number of visits and pages you visited on our website);
Assisting with our promotional and marketing efforts (including behavioral advertising).

Fingerprints
It's the process to collect a set of features and characteristics from a device (e.g.
navigator language, window screen, time zone, location, CPU vendor, memory size, or image processing) for several purposes, like enhancing security or adapting the user's experience on the website. 
 

Necessary usage to identify your device characteristics (UID, DoNotTrack Signal, Timezone, and Language) to provide the technical features of our CMP and collect user's cookies preference.
Analytics and Marketing regarding your device and browser used for purposes linked with our Google Tag Manager usage. 

Web Beacons
It's a small tag placed on a website resource or in an email to track how the user interacts with the content.
This interaction generates a "hit," counting your interaction with the HTML content.
For example, if you click on one of our ads on the website, a web beacon will record that interaction.

Acquiring essential insights into the performance of the content;
Evaluate the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns;

Web Tags or Tracking Pixels
It's a type of code (e.g.
JavaScript code in a tag manager) or pixel (a small 1x1 transparent image) loaded into the web page to enable website features, like the web design components, or to track user's behavior across websites and devices.
These are commonly associated with social media widgets such as a like button. 

Loading necessary features in our website, such as fonts, webpage layout, videos, and photos;
Analysis of user experience on our website;
Providing a better experience individually to our customers by loading personalized and enhanced content;


 


Why am I seeing third party cookies if I rejected non-essential trackers?

Be aware that even if you accept only "necessary cookies," you still may see third party trackers that are enabled by services we use in our ecosystem, including Google components like ReCaptcha and Tag Manager.
Third party trackers are enabled because these services may also have cookies or trackers that they have classified as strictly necessary to perform the services that we requested. 



These trackers collect aggregated information to e.g., identify security gaps.
The specific cookie related to Google reCAPTCHA anti-bot management (_GRECAPTCHA) is used for website security and protection.
This tool helps us inspect traffic to create scores based on users' interactions with our website.
Through defined intervals reCAPTCHA provides risk analysis with the personal data collected by this cookie.
To know more about reCAPTCHA and its risk analysis processing activity please read the section titled "Cookies Categories."



Another reason for seeing third party trackers on your browser is that you have already used or accessed a third-party service prior to visiting our website.
For example, if you landed on our website using a search engine like "Google Search" it is likely that Googleâs search engine may have enabled trackers on your browser (e.g.
related to your preferences with regards to Google's own tracking technologies).
You can read more details about how Google may use your personal information in this context by visiting Googleâs Privacy and Terms. 



To safeguard and respect your privacy we operate our sites on a strict opt-in basis with regards to all non-essential trackers.
Check the next section regarding Exercise your rights and opt-out for more details.
 

Exercise your rights and opt-out

To safeguard and respect your privacy we operate our sites on a strict opt-in basis.
This means that, to the extent that it is technically feasible and insofar as these trackers are not related to any strictly necessary purposes, we will block all non-essential trackers until you provide your consent to other trackers.
These include all trackers used for marketing or analytical purposes as well as targeted advertising.
Please note that accepting only necessary cookies may affect your browsing experience when compared with a user who accepted these functionalities.



If you do consent to the use of non-essential trackers, you can customize and withdraw your consent at any time (except concerning strictly necessary cookies) in our Cookies Preference Center.
You can choose whether you consent to some or all of our cookies and tracking technologies and this will not affect your access to the website and our resources.
However, please note that the user experience might be different depending on the categories of cookies you accept.
If you are a visitor from the European Union, we facilitate mechanisms for exercising your rights based on the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). 



You can check more details about your rights as a data subject and the corresponding legal basis in the table below:

Sometimes, when we cannot delete your personal information due to legal obligations or contractual commitments, we can fulfil this request instead of the right to erasure. 
GDPR Article 18
Right of data portability
You have the right to request data portability in situations where it's technically feasible and when there's logical reasonability to do it (e.g., reuse your personal information by another data controller in the same processing activities or co-related processing activities).

Right to withdraw consent
You have the right to request the withdrawal of your consent in case you have given to us to authorize processing your personal information,

Our content delivery network (CDN) 

In addition to the cookies and other tracking technologies described above, our website works with a Content Delivery Network (CDN) that enables our website to load correctly and securely reach website visitors. 



Our CDN is provided by Cloudflare, a company headquartered in the United States of America.
You can see OneTrust Privacy Notice for more information about our vetted vendors. Because of the function of a CDN (secure delivery of website content to the right website visitor), Cloudflare's systems collect payload data from HTTP requests, including website visitors' IP addresses.
Whereas payload is localised to the region where visitors come from, IP addresses are securely transferred to the Cloudflare servers in the United States, securely stored in volatile storage for a maximum of seven days, and then they are deleted.



Cloudflare uses the Anycast routing technology to enable its CDN functionalities without OneTrust needing to store or retain any payload data processed during an HTTP request and deliver content cached in the nearest Cloudflare's Edge Server.
We receive only the communication from Cloudflare about what kind of element is necessary to load (e.g.
HTML elements like text, fonts, and layout) due to a user's visit to our website.
