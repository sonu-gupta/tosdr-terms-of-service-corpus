If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to us via email at support@poshmark.com or via postal mail at 203 Redwood Shores Pkwy, 8th Floor, Redwood City, CA 94065.
You must put the statement âYour California Privacy Rightsâ in your request and include your name, street address, city, state, and ZIP code.
We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or do not have complete information.
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your rights under the CCPA, including, but not limited to (i) denying goods or services to you, (ii) charging different prices or rates for goods or services, or (iii) providing a different level or quality of goods or services to you.
