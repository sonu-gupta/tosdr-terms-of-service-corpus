Certain features within Mailchimp are offered as add-ons to your Mailchimp account.
Some add-ons have additional terms or restrictions (âAdditional Termsâ) associated with them.
Additional Terms for each of the add-ons can be found below, and Mailchimp Members agree to the applicable Additional Terms at the time they choose to add the corresponding add-on feature. For Connected Sites These Additional Terms apply to any Mailchimp account that has a website or store (âConnected Siteâ or âSiteâ) connected to their Mailchimp account.
Please read these Additional Terms carefully before adding, connecting, or re-authorizing a Connected Site.
By clicking âAcceptâ within the Mailchimp application and continuing to connect your Site to Mailchimp you are agreeing to these Additional Terms.
When you connect your Site with Mailchimp, you agree that Mailchimp may automatically install a JavaScript tracking snippet on your Site at the time of connection and/or re-authorization.
This snippet is necessary to enable several of Mailchimpâs powerful e-commerce automations and advertising features.
Some of these automations and features work by allowing you to track the activity of your subscribed contactsâ on your Site through the use of cookies or similar technologies, such as pixels.
The JavaScript snippet will allow cookies, pixels, and other technologies to be set by your Connected Site, giving you full access to the automations, features, and functionality offered by Mailchimp.
The specific cookies, pixels, or other technologies that will be set on your Site will depend on the particular automations and features within Mailchimp that you choose to use.
The following automations and features are enabled by the Javascript snippet:

Product Retargeting Emails: the Javascript snippet will allow your Site to deploy a Mailchimp cookie on a subscriberâs device when the subscriber clicks a link within a product retargeting email.
This cookie tracks attribution rates and browser activity, allowing Mailchimp to provide you with reporting on the success of your product retargeting emails.
Google Remarketing Ads: the Javascript snippet will install a Google tracking pixel on your Site and will allow your Site to deploy a Mailchimp cookie that recognizes visitors to your Site from the remarketing ads you place.
These technologies facilitate remarketing ad placement and reporting on the performance of your advertising campaigns.
Further information can be found in the Additional Terms of Use for Google Ads Through Mailchimp, which must be agreed to before placing a Google remarketing ad.
Facebook Remarketing Ads: the Javascript snippet will install a Facebook pixel on your Site.
These technologies facilitate remarketing ad placement and reporting on the performance of your advertising campaigns on Facebook and Instagram.
Further information can be found in the Additional Terms of Use for Facebook and Instagram Ad Buying Through Mailchimp, which must be agreed to before placing a Facebook remarketing ad.
Popup Forms: the Javascript snippet will allow your Site to deploy a Mailchimp cookie that recognizes whether a visitor to your Site has previously viewed your popup form and ensures the same visitor does not see your form again for a period of up to one year.

It is your responsibility to understand how your use of the available e-commerce automations and features will impact your Connected Site, including whether a particular e-commerce automation or feature will cause your Connected Site to deploy any tracking technologies.
You can visit Mailchimpâs Cookie Statement at any time for a description of the cookies and tracking technologies that can be employed by a Mailchimp user through the use of Mailchimp (see the Section entitled âCookies served through the Servicesâ).
If you choose to enable automations or features that rely on the JavaScript snippet once your Site is connected, you represent and warrant that (1) you have permission from your subscribed contacts to track activity via cookies, pixels, and other similar technologies, and to transfer information related to this tracking to Mailchimp, and (2) your Site adequately discloses your tracking practices and use of cookies, pixels, and similar technologies in a Privacy Policy, Cookie Statement, or other disclosure.
In addition to the above, you also understand and agree:

Mailchimp may modify, change, or discontinue the ability to integrate Connected Sites with your Mailchimp account at any time.
Mailchimp may refuse service or limit, suspend, or terminate your use of Connected Sites integrations at any time, with or without cause.
You may discontinue your use of Connected Site integrations at any time by disconnecting your Site from your Mailchimp account and removing the Mailchimp integration from your Site or e-commerce platform.
When you disconnect your Site from your Mailchimp account, any information obtained by the cookies, pixels, or similar technologies set by the Javascript tracking snippet on your Site will no longer be received by Mailchimp.
Mailchimp may modify or change these Additional Terms from time-to-time.
When we change these Additional Terms, we will post the revised Additional Terms here (www.mailchimp.com/legal/additional-terms).
For this reason, you should review these Additional Terms often.
Any changes will be effective immediately and will apply to your continued use of Connected Site integrations with your Mailchimp account.
To continue enabling the automations and features that you have chosen to turn on, Mailchimp may need to modify or change the code within the JavaScript snippet installed on your Site in the future.
These modifications or changes may cause your Site to deploy additional tracking technologies, or result in the deletion of cookies, pixels, or similar technologies being set by your Site.

If you have a Shopify Connected Site, you further understand and agree:

As between Shopify and Mailchimp only, Mailchimp is solely responsible for the Service offered by Mailchimp (as defined in our Standard Terms of Use), and Shopify is not liable for any fault in the Service or any harm that may result from installation or use of the Service.
Except where expressly stated by Shopify, Shopify cannot provide assistance with the installation or use of the Service.
As between Shopify and Mailchimp only, Mailchimp is solely responsible for any liability which may arise from your access to or use of the Service, including: (A) the development, use, marketing or distribution of or access to the Service, including support of the Service.
or (B) Mailchimpâs own access, use, distribution or storage of information relating to you or your Shopify store.

These Additional Terms do not replace Mailchimpâs Standard Terms of Use (including our Data Processing Addendum, Cookie Statement, Acceptable Use Policy, API Guidelines, Copyright and Trademark Policy, and Brand Guidelines), and the Standard Terms of Use continue to apply once you have connected your Site to your Mailchimp account.
The ability to connect a Site is considered part of the Service offered by Mailchimp.

 For Facebook and Instagram Ad Buying Through Mailchimp Introduction
Welcome to Facebook and Instagram Ad Buying Through Mailchimp.
Ad Buying Through Mailchimp allows you quickly and easily to create, purchase, and manage Facebook and Instagram advertisements (including Facebook remarketing ads) from within your Mailchimp account (collectively, the âAd Buying Featureâ).
Please read these Additional Terms carefully.
This is a legal agreement, and by clicking âI Agreeâ below and continuing to use the Ad Buying Feature you are agreeing to these Additional Terms.
These Additional Terms apply to your use of the Ad Buying Feature.
These Additional Terms do not replace Mailchimpâs Standard Terms of Use (including our Data Processing Addendum, Cookie Statement, Acceptable Use Policy, API Guidelines, Copyright and Trademark Policy, and Brand Guidelines), and the Standard Terms of Use also apply to your use of the Ad Buying Feature.
The Ad Buying Feature is part of the Service and your use of the Ad Buying Feature is considered part of your use of Mailchimp.
If you have questions about any of our terms, feel free to contact us.
Unless expressly stated otherwise, the capitalized words in this document mean the same thing as they do in our Standard Terms of Use.
Part A: Important Things for You to Know

Mailchimp may modify the Ad Buying Feature or discontinue its availability at any time.
Mailchimp may refuse service or limit, suspend, or terminate your access to the Ad Buying Feature at any time, with or without cause.
You may discontinue your use of the Ad Buying Feature at any time.
Mailchimp may modify or change these Additional Terms from time-to-time.
If we modify or change these Additional Terms, we will provide you notice of the fact that the Additional Terms have changed.
Any modifications or changes will be effective immediately and apply to your continued use of the Ad Buying Feature.
The Ad Buying Feature allows you to create, purchase, and manage Facebook and Instagram ads, including Facebook remarketing ads, from your Mailchimp account.
By using the Ad Buying Feature, you also agree to comply with Facebookâs Advertising Policies, Terms of Service, and Commercial Terms, and if your Site or Landing Page deploys the Facebook pixel, Business Tools Terms.
You are responsible for understanding and complying with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations and determining whether our Service, including the Ad Buying Feature, are suitable for you in light of such laws, rules, and regulations.
Facebook and Instagram are not affiliates, partners, agents, or representatives of Mailchimp.
You understand and agree that Mailchimp is an independent party and has no right, responsibility, or ability to control, direct, or influence any action, inaction, conduct, or decision made by Facebook or Instagram.

Part B: Advertising Review and Compliance
Your use of the Ad Buying Feature, including the content of any ads you might create, is subject to review by both Facebook and Mailchimp and you agree to comply with the terms and policies of both companies.
If you do not comply with both Facebookâs Terms (including the Facebook Advertising Policies) and Mailchimpâs Terms, any of the following actions may be taken: (1) your ad might be rejected by Facebook or Mailchimp.
(2) we might, in our sole discretion, revoke your ability to use the Ad Buying Feature.
and/or (3) we might suspend or terminate your Mailchimp account.
To use the Ad Buying Feature to create and place remarketing ads on Facebook or Instagram, your website or store must be connected to your Mailchimp account (âSiteâ), or you must create a landing page in your Mailchimp account (âLanding Pageâ).
When you elect to enable the Facebook pixel on your Site or Landing Page or create your first Facebook ad that links to your Site or Landing Page, a Javascript snippet deployed on your Site or Landing Page will install a Facebook pixel on your Site or Landing Page.
These tracking technologies facilitate the placement of your advertising campaigns on Facebook and Instagram and enable Mailchimp to provide reporting to you about the performance of your advertising campaigns.
You represent and warrant that your Site or Landing Page adequately discloses the use of tracking technologies, such as cookies and pixels, used by your Site or Landing Page in a Privacy Policy, Cookie Statement, or other disclosure and informs visitors to your Site or Landing Page that information collected by these technologies may be transferred to Mailchimp and Facebook.
By using the Ad Buying Feature, you are giving Mailchimp permission to install the Facebook pixel on your Site or Landing Page on your behalf.
Part C: Transfer of Data to Facebook
Certain options within the Ad Buying Feature, such as the custom audience option, allow you to pass data to Facebook.
The data that may be transferred through use of the custom audience option consists of hashed values of email addresses.
Only those emails addresses you expressly select will be hashed and passed to Facebook.
If you elect to enable the Facebook pixel on your Site or Landing Page to enable Facebook remarketing ads, the Facebook pixel will enable Facebook to collect data on visitors to your Site or Landing Page for purposes of creating a custom audience (without transferring hashed values of email addresses) and serving the remarketing ads.

If you choose to pass data to Facebook, you represent and warrant that you have the right to use the data in such a manner and that you have secured permission from any individuals whose data will be hashed to transfer the data to Facebook.
You further acknowledge and agree that you are the party transferring data to Facebook and that such data is being passed directly from you to Facebook.
Part D: Payment Terms
The Ad Buying Feature is an add-on to your Mailchimp account and will be billed as such (please see Section 12 of our Standard Terms of Use for more information regarding add-ons).
When creating an advertising campaign through the Ad Buying Feature, you will be asked to select a maximum budget for your advertising campaign.
You agree to pay the amount chosen as your maximum budget up front, and your credit card will be charged for this amount in its entirety.
Ads will then be placed by Facebook on your behalf according to the criteria you select using the Ad Buying Feature until your maximum budget is reached.
In certain circumstances, however, your entire budget may not be exhausted.
Any unused portion of your budget will be credited to your account as an âAd Creditâ and may be used toward the purchase of future advertising campaigns with the Ad Buying Feature.
Ad Credits may not be used to purchase or pay for email campaigns or other Mailchimp add-ons or services, and are only valid for the purchase of services available through the Ad Buying Feature.
Ad Credits do not expire.
If you violate these Additional Terms, Mailchimpâs Standard Terms of Use, or the Facebook Advertising Policies you will not receive a refund for any purchases you made through the Ad Buying Feature.

Updated May 30, 2019

Facebook Custom Audience Terms
Facebookâs custom audiences feature enables you to create an audience using your data such as email addresses and phone numbers.
When using Facebookâs custom audiences feature, your data is locally hashed on your system before you upload and pass such data to Facebook to be used to create your custom audience (the âHashed Dataâ).
Without limiting any agreement between you and Facebook, by clicking âI accept,â passing to Facebook the Hashed Data, or using custom audiences for advertising, you agree to the following:


You represent and warrant, without limiting anything in these terms, that you have all necessary rights and permissions and a lawful basis to disclose and use the Hashed Data in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and industry guidelines.
If you are using a Facebook identifier to create a custom audience, you must have obtained the identifier directly from the data subject in compliance with these terms.


If you are providing Hashed Data on behalf of an advertiser, you represent and warrant that you have the authority as agent to the advertiser to disclose and use such data on their behalf and will bind the advertiser to these terms.



You represent and warrant that the Hashed Data does not relate to data about any individual who has exercised an option that you have, directly or indirectly, committed to honoring or provided to opt out of having that data disclosed and used for targeted advertising.
To the extent an individual exercises such an opt-out after you have used data relating to that individual to create a custom audience, you will remove that data subject from the custom audience.



You instruct Facebook to use the Hashed Data for the matching process.
Facebook will not share the Hashed Data with third parties or other advertisers and will delete the Hashed Data promptly after the match process is complete.
Facebook will maintain the confidentiality and security of the Hashed Data and the collection of Facebook User IDs that comprise the custom audience(s) created from your Hashed Data (âyour custom audience(s)â), including by maintaining technical and physical safeguards that are designed to (a) protect the security and integrity of data while it is within Facebook's systems and (b) guard against the accidental or unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure of data within Facebook's systems.


Facebook will not give access to or information about the custom audience(s) to third parties or other advertisers, use your custom audience(s) to append to the information we have about our users or build interest-based profiles, or use your custom audience(s) except to provide services to you, unless we have your permission or are required to do so by law.


Facebook may modify, suspend or terminate access to, or discontinue the availability of, the custom audiences feature at any time.
You may discontinue your use of the custom audiences feature at any time.
You may delete your custom audience(s) from the Facebook system at any time through your account tools.


You may not use the custom audiences feature unless you are an advertiser (or an agency acting on behalf of an advertiser), Ads API or Custom Audiences API partner, a data partner uploading an audience on behalf of that advertiser, or have obtained express, written permission from Facebook.


You may not sell or transfer your custom audiences, or authorize any third party to sell or transfer custom audiences.
If you have entered into an independent agreement with a partner for licensing marketing information, you may use the custom audiences tools and sharing functionality to create and provide custom audiences for advertising based on that information, subject to the requirements of these terms and applicable law.


A note to EU and Swiss data controllers: To the extent the Hashed Data contains personal data relating to an individual who resides in the European Union or Switzerland, the parties acknowledge and agree that for purposes of creating the custom audiences, as described above, that you are the data controller in respect of such personal data, and you have instructed Facebook Ireland Limited to process such personal data on your behalf as your data processor pursuant to these terms and Facebookâs Data Processing Terms, which are incorporated herein by reference.
You hereby acknowledge and agree that Facebook, Inc.
may act as a sub-processor for and on behalf of Facebook Ireland Limited for the purpose of fulfilling Facebook Ireland Limitedâs obligations under these Custom Audiences Terms.
âPersonal data,â âdata controller,â and âdata processorâ in this paragraph have the meanings set out in the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679).

If you have any questions about these Additional Terms, feel free to contact us.

Part B: Eligibility
To use Transactional Email (except for the Transactional Email Demo), you must have an active Mailchimp account on either our Standard plan or Premium plan, which are both Monthly Plans with monthly auto renewing charges.
(If you have a Free plan, Legacy Free plan, or Essentials plan, you must upgrade to an eligible plan before you can utilize Transactional Email.) Mailchimp accounts suspended for violations of the Mailchimp Standard Terms of Use or for any other reason may be ineligible for Transactional Email.

You may demo a limited version of Transactional Email if youâre eligible and opt to use our Transactional Email Demo.

Part C: Loss of Access to Transactional Email
You will immediately lose access to Transactional Email if any of the following happens: 

You pause your Mailchimp account.

You cancel or close your Mailchimp account;
You downgrade your Mailchimp account to an Essentials plan or Free plan;
You disable your Transactional Email Add-on in your account settings;
Mailchimp suspends, cancels, terminates, or closes your Mailchimp account or Transactional Email Add-on for any reason.


Part D: Payment Terms
You understand and agree:

Your Transactional Email monthly cost varies based on: (A) the number of Transactional Email blocks (25,000 emails per block) you subscribe to, (B) the cost of your Transactional Email blocks, and (C) the number of Transactional Emails you send each billing month.
See our Transactional Email Pricing Calculator to learn more and estimate your cost.
The number of Transactional Email blocks you subscribe to will automatically renew at the start of your monthly billing cycle, which is the same monthly billing cycle for your paid Monthly Plan.
Pricing information and FAQs for Transactional Email is available at the following url: https://mailchimp.com/pricing/transactional-email/.
The pricing information and FAQs are expressly incorporated into and considered part of these Additional Terms.
When you sign up for Transactional Email, you agree to monthly recurring billing, starting on the date you sign up for Transactional Email.
Transactional Email blocks are billed monthly on a âuse it or lose itâ basis and do not roll over from month to month.
For example, if you subscribe to 10 Transactional Email blocks per month and you only send 40,000 Transactional Emails in a month, then you will still be billed for all 10 Transactional Email blocks even though you utilized less than 2 blocks that month.
The unused blocks also do not roll over to the following month.
Payments for Transactional Email are due in advance (not in arrears) on your Monthly Plan Pay Date.
Billing occurs on the same day each month, based on the date that you started your Monthly Plan.
If you reach your Transactional Email send limit allotted in your monthly subscribed Transactional Email blocks, then, based on your account settings, your account might either: (A) stop sending Transactional Emails when you reach your send limit or (B) continue to send Transactional Emails and automatically purchase additional Transactional Email blocks beyond your monthly subscription setting.
You may toggle between these options in your Transactional Email settings in your account.
Additional Transactional Blocks cost the same as blocks youâve subscribed to.
You can see the tiered pricing with our Transactional Email Pricing Calculator.
Charges for exceeding your self-selected Transactional Email block send limit will be immediately charged to your payment on file because those charges relate to your prior billing cycle.
The cost for your subscribed Transactional Email blocks and any additional Transactional Email blocks used will be detailed on your bill, which is viewable in your account.

If you have an existing Mailchimp account when you sign up for Transactional Email, then your Transactional Email block charges and email send volumes for your first billing month will be prorated based on the number of days remaining in your billing cycle.

If you choose to disable your Transactional Email Add-on then: (A) you will immediately lose access to sending Transactional Email and (B) you will still be responsible for paying for the full cost of your subscribed Transactional Email blocks for your last billing cycle (without any proration).

You agree to pay for your Transactional Email as stated in our Standard Terms of Use and you authorize Mailchimp to charge your payment method on file with us for all amounts owed associated with your Transactional Email use.

You may preview your upcoming estimated Transactional Email charges at any time by going to your billing information in your account.

If you use Transactional Email to send bulk emails or marketing emails in violation of our Acceptable Use Policy, then we may charge you for those emails at a rate thatâs comparable to what we charge under one of our paid Monthly Plans and/or terminate your account.

If you select a currency other than the US Dollar, your charges will be subject to an unpublished exchange rate of Mailchimpâs choosing at the time of payment processing and then applied in your chosen currency.
