You must call us at 1-800-422-7142 to request a Return Authorization ("RMA"). All returns and exchanges must be accompanied by an RMA number in order to be processed properly.
If your shipment arrives without an RMA number, you will not receive a refund.

We must receive your return package within 30 days from the date you received your purchase.

You are responsible for return shipping costs. For your convenience, there may be a UPS Prepaid Return Label contained in your shipment.
If you choose to use this UPS Prepaid Return Label, you will be charged the flat fee shown on your Returns slip, which will be deducted from your refund.
Simply affix that label to the outer carton, fill in your RMA number and give the package to your UPS carrier or drop it off at any store that accepts UPS parcels or at any UPS collection box.
You may also ship using your preferred carrier. You may return your purchase using a carrier other than UPS.
We recommend that you use a trackable method of shipment.
