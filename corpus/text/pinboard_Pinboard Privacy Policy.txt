         Privacy Policy 
I recognize that many users joined Pinboard especially for its privacy features.
Privacy bugs are second in priority only to data integrity bugs.
Pinboard runs on dedicated servers that only I have access to.
Wherever possible, the site uses SSL.
My goal is to have the site be SSL by default as soon as practicable.
I do not share individual user data with third parties under any circumstances.
The site will never show ads.
With the exception of Google Analytics on certain public pages, and payment buttons on the signup and upgrade pages, Pinboard does not serve third-party content anywhere on the site.
Google Analytics scripts are not served to logged-in users.
The site tracks clickthroughs on your bookmarks for the sole purpose of generating a 'history' page for your account.
This information is stored in the Pinboard database.
You can disable this behavior on your settings page.
If there is a privacy breach, I promise to disclose it as soon as possible on the site blog and Twitter account.
If you spot a privacy leak, please report it discreetly to support@pinboard.in.
Please do not store truly sensitive information on Pinboard.
