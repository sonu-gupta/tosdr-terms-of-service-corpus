How to submit a copyright complaint?
When a copyright ownerâs work is being infringed on or through a service providerâs service, the copyright owner may send a notification of claimed infringement to us at our DMCA Takedown Tool (https://www.fembed.com/dmca).
To submit a notice of claimed copyright infringement, you will need to provide us with the following information in DMCA Takedown:

A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site.
Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material.
Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted.
