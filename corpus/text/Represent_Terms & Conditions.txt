arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services.
Judgment on the award rendered

notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with
these Terms of Use.  You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate.

address you use for your account with us, and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration
agreement.  If and to the extent the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third

be null and void.
This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with us.

subject to this Seller Agreement.
Represent reserves the right to make available or withdraw any items at any time
in our sole discretion.
Please note that Represent may offer individual items or bundles/collections of Content For

Grant of Rights in Your Content.
When you submit Content to the Site YOU HEREBY
APPOINT REPRESENT AS A SELLER of that content AND GRANT TO US A WORLDWIDE LICENSE to use that design material in any
media and, specifically, to make that material available for sale via the Site and via mobile phone networks and any
other third-party platforms, media channels and/or distribution methods.
For the avoidance of doubt, such grant
includes (without limitation) a perpetual and irrevocable license for Represent to allow Users to purchase and
retain the Products.
You further agree to waive your moral rights for the purposes of this license.
Where necessary,
we reserve the right to cut, edit, crop or arrange your material as necessary for purposes related to the Site, and

your Content on not less than thirty (30) dayâs notice by emailing us at
campaigns@represent.com and specifying the relevant items but please note that any
Product orders manufactured using your Content before the expiration of such notice period will be charged to you at
cost price.
If there is a change of circumstance after delivery of an item to Represent which results in your
knowledge or reasonable belief that you no longer have the rights necessary to authorize Represent to use such
item(s), then you must notify us immediately â but please note that your liability for your Content will be
unaffected.

Proceeds.
Represent shall pay you
all of the Net Revenues received by Represent from purchases of your Products via the Site (âSeller Proceedsâ).

calculation of the Seller Proceeds, the âNet Revenuesâ shall be the amount we receive from purchasers of your
Product(s), less: sales tax (where applicable) and the cost price displayed on the site at the time you created the
relevant campaign less 2.4% of this amount (for payment processing services).
The suggested revenue displayed at the
time of creating the campaign is the minimum you will receive from a campaign, but if you sell more than the target
number of items, you will be offered a reduced cost price.
All Seller Proceeds shall be paid to you exclusive of any
applicable tax.
All sums payable to Sellers shall be paid only to the Sellerâs registered bank account.

if not queried within one year.
Represent shall not be required to provide any accounting for any period in which
less than one-hundred dollars (US$100) is payable.

A chargeback occurs when purchasers of your
Products contact their bank or credit card company directly to dispute a charge.
A chargeback can happen for a
variety of reasons, including unauthorized use of a financial instrument, double billing, or non-receipt of a
product.
Represent will pass on the cost of chargebacks to you if they happen within 90 days of the original

Represent and a purchaser involving your Product, Represent will seek to resolve such dispute as fairly and
reasonably as possible.

sole discretion to remove funds from the relevant Seller account to reimburse the purchaser for the cost of the
item(s) or, where insufficient funds are available, directly refund the purchaser and invoice the Seller for an
amount equivalent to the sum we paid to the purchaser.

terminate within a reasonable amount of time following such notice.
Represent may at any time terminate a Campaign
or this Agreement if, in our sole discretion, we believe that you may have breached (or acted in a manner indicating
that you do not intend to or are unable to comply with) any term herein, or if we are legally required to do so by
law, or if continuation is likely to be no longer commercially viable.
Termination of this Seller Agreement will not
release either party from any of its obligations hereunder which are intended to have a continuing effect.

third party vendor called Unite and its partner AppNexus to collect and manage such data and deliver the targeted
advertisements on unaffiliated websites around the Internet.
