You may contact them by phone at 1-800-255-3700, by email at useragreement@noa.nintendo.com, or by regular mail sent to Nintendo of America Inc., Attn: User Agreement, 4600 150th Ave NE, Redmond, WA 98052 USA.
Most matters are quickly resolved in this manner to our customersâ satisfaction.
Any matter we are unable to resolve and all disputes or claims arising out of or relating to the Nintendo Account Services or this Agreement, including its formation, enforceability, performance, or breach (each, a "Claim"), with the exception of the matters described in Section 16(c) below, shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the provisions of its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the supplementary procedures for consumer-related disputes of the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA"), excluding any AAA rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions or class arbitrations.
The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all Claims.
The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.
The arbitratorâs award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.
They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.
Any such arbitration shall be conducted by the parties in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis.
If any court or arbitrator determines that the class-action waiver set forth in the preceding sentence is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth in this Section shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate Claims.
b.
The rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at +1-800-778-7879.
To the extent the initial filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the initial filing fee for a lawsuit, we will pay the difference in fees.
If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, we will pay all of the actual filing and arbitrator fees for the arbitration, provided your claim is less than $75,000.
The arbitration rules also permit you to recover attorneyâs fees in certain cases.
c.
Section 16(a) does not apply to any Claim (i) in which a party is attempting to protect its intellectual property rights (such as its patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, or moral rights, but not including its privacy or publicity rights), or (ii) that may be brought in small-claims court, in each case solely to the extent that any such Claim is not styled in the form of a class action litigation.
d.
30-Day Right to Opt Out.
You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Section 16 by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: Nintendo of America Inc., Attn: CS Admin, 4600 150th Ave NE, Redmond, WA 98052 within 30 days from the date you created your Nintendo Account.
Such notice must include the name of each person opting out, contact information, and the email address registered to your Nintendo Account.
If you send timely written notice containing the required information, then Section 16 will not apply to you or Nintendo.
If you do not send such notice, then you agree to be bound by this Section 16. 17.
Severability If any part of this Agreement is determined to be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that part will be severed from this Agreement and the remainder of the Agreement will remain intact.
If we do not enforce any provision of this Agreement, that will not be considered a waiver of our rights.
Any waiver of this Agreement must be in a written document signed by an authorized representative of Nintendo. 18.
