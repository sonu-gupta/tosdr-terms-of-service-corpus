If you are only reading RationalWiki, the only information collected is what is normally collected in server logs.

If you write something on RationalWiki, it's here to stay and will be associated with either your user name or IP address.

If you do not create an account, or fail to log in before editing, your IP address is recorded and made available to everyone reading that edit.
That is why we recommend you create an account and remember to always log in before editing.

If you are logged in with an account then only the information you volunteer about yourself, and your identity, will be made available.

RationalWiki does not sell any information about its users to anyone.


And we will go to the Guantanamo Bay Detention Centre en masse as enemy combatants before revealing that information to any Government.
Unless we really have to.
Like pursuant to a subpoena lawfully issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or if we get sued and are required to turn it over in the discovery process.
