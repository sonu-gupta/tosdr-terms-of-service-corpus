The following privacy policy (âPrivacy Policyâ) describes the information we collect and how we use it.
By using this website (âSite,â âPlatform,â âWebsiteâ) or the service offered through our Site or any mobile application (the âServiceâ), you consent to our Privacy Policy.
We may periodically update this Privacy Policy to reflect material changes in how we collect, use, share or store your personal information.
We encourage you to refer to this Privacy Policy on an ongoing basis so that you understand our current Privacy Policy.
You consent to any changes we make to this Privacy Policy if you continue to use the Choozle service after receiving a notice of the change or upon our posting of the new Privacy Policy on this Site.
COLLECTING INFORMATION
Like many websites, we gather information about how visitors use our Site.
In general, you can visit many of our web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself.
We may track your visit for trends and statistics, but you will remain anonymous unless you tell us who you are.
Once you choose to give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us.
The following are the types of information we collect:



Information you give us:
 We receive the information you provide to us when you register for, or otherwise use, the Site such as your name, email address, business name, business URL, business industry, business type, phone number, address, credit card information and any feedback, questions, or recommendations you provide.
If you provide information directly to us in other ways, such as by sending us an email or filling out a form, we may retain that information and add it with the other information we have collected from you.
We may also collect information from you that is necessary for our legitimate interests, which will be disclosed to you at the time of collection.
Choozle will use this information for the purposes of which it was collected.


Information from third parties:
 We may receive information about you from other sources, such from friends who refer you to us, third-party sites, or services that you link your Choozle account with, or otherwise.
We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you.


Information shared with third parties:
 We may share information about you with other sources, who are both controllers and processors of data required for the management or use of the Choozle platform.
Choozle confirms with all third-parties to ensure the data is managed in a lawful manner.
Suppliers and service providers are required by contract to keep confidential the information received on our behalf, and may not use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for us.
When we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.


Automatically collected information:
 To make our Site and Services more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third-party service provider) may collect information from you, including browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name,  precise location data with GPS or lat/log, or a date and time stamp for your visit.
We also use Cookies (as defined below) and navigational data to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and which you viewed.
Like most Internet services, we automatically gather this information and store it in log files each time you visit our Site or access your account on our network.
âCookiesâ are small pieces of information that a Site sends to your computerâs hard drive while you are viewing a website.
Cookies are refreshed from the last time we see a user in order to retain up-to-date information.
We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site.
Persistent Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.
If you choose to disable cookies, some areas of our Site or portions of the Service may not work properly.
We also could use data from mobile applications, including advertising IDs and mobile device IDs, to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and which you viewed.
Mobile advertising IDs or Mobile Device IDs are a unique identifier which can be used to identify a mobile device.
Mobile applications and networks assign unique identifiers for mobile app developers can identify who is using their mobile apps as well as use for advertising purposes.
We interpret engaging with our brand as an indication of your interest in our products and services, and thus providing consent for this data collection.
Forms of engagement can be best exemplified by visiting our site, following us on social media, or interacting with our other marketing channels.


Information collected through our service:
 Our service allows our clients to collect information about their current or potential customers using cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, web bugs, televisions or OTT devices, and other collection technologies.
While we do not collect this information on our site, we want you to be aware of how our services can be used to collect your information using publically available data and other collection technologies.
Our clients may provide us with various data sets that typically reside within their customer resource management databases (which may include names, emails, addresses, or phone numbers), which we enable, on their behalf, and help link to applications that they use.
We may also collect your location information, such as your zip code or the approximate geographic area derived from your IP address or location positioning information provided by the location services and GPS features of your mobile device when location services have been enabled.
We also source matched or linked data that enables our clients to pseudonymously match users across channels.
The matched or linked data comes from reputable data providers, brands, and websites with the rights to share consumer data.
We combine and measure these data sets against each other to ensure a high level of accuracy.
When a consumer visits one of our match partner sites (such as a popular website), that partner sends us a unique identifier that has been de-identified using a hashing algorithm.
We then search our database of client data to determine whether any of our clients is requesting to match data for that particular consumer.
If a match occurs, we associate a cookie with de-identified data about the consumer on behalf of our clients based on the last time we saw a user.
Clients can then reach our matched non-personally identifiable users with relevant messages and advertisements.
They may also use this data for measurement purposes such as understanding how digital advertising spend impacts purchasing on their Site.
Sometimes, we use our mobile cookie or mobile ID data alongside our web-based cookie data, to help other platforms to âmatchâ or âmapâ users they have already âseenâ across multiple web and mobile platforms, on a de-identified basis.
This collected data may be used for personalized Advertising or Ad Delivery and Reporting which is further defined under the NAIâs Viewed Content Advertising Guidance. 



Information used for personalization:
 As required under the NAI Code, the Choozle discloses standard interest segments that are based on health-related information or interests and political information or interests that it makes available in the Platform where permitted by law and self-regulatory rules.
This information is used in the personalization of advertising efforts.
Choozle confirms that any data used or collected by Choozle and our partners is obtained from responsible sources that provide users with appropriate levels of notice and choice.
