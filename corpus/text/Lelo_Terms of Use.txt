If for any reason your relationship comes to an end within a year of the purchase date, you should contact LELO quoting the unique number printed on the gold ring on TIANIâ¢ 24K's body and the product serial number on the warranty card.
Once the claimant has returned their product under LELO Couplesâ Insurance policy, they will be offered a selection of LELO Bestsellers to choose from as a free replacement item.
While the shipping cost of the returned item will be at them claimant's expense, the replacement product will be delivered free of charge.
LELO Couplesâ Insurance policy is purely based on relationships, and does not refer to product faults, which are still subject to the normal LELO 1-year warranty and 10-year pleasure guarantee.
(If a product develops a fault within the same period, LELO owners will receive a replacement free of charge under our 1-Year Warranty policy.
Issues that develop within 10 years guarantee a 50% discount on subsequent purchases).
