Personally Identifying and Non-Personally Identifying Information Distinguished


Personally identifying information is information that individually identifies you (for example, your name, address, email address, or telephone number), as well as other information that is associated with you and may be used to locate, identify or contact you.
Non-personally identifying information (for example, your age, gender, or 5-digit zip code, unless applicable law provides otherwise) is information that does not personally identify you but may contain demographics such as your area of residence or your interests (as suggested by your uses of the Sites).


Our Collection of Personally Identifying Information


We collect personally identifying information in the following ways:

Directly from you, when you elect to participate in activities within the Sites.
For example, we may ask you to provide your personally identifying information when you register for an account on the Sites, participate in social media events involving our books or authors, sign up to receive email newsletters from us, make a purchase on the Sites, enter a contest or sweepstakes, participate in surveys or special promotions, submit content on any part of the Sites where user-generated submissions are permitted, or knowingly identify yourself to us in order to request a specific interaction with us (for example, by submitting a job application or a help desk request or similar request for customer service).


From your school, if you are a student or instructor.
For example, your name and/or school email address may appear on a class list we receive from an educational institution at which you have registered to take a course that uses one or more of our platforms.
If you are a student, we may collect such information as your roster of courses.
 if you are an instructor, we may collect information about what subjects and classes you teach.
 


From our Sites or from third parties who provide data and/or help us analyze transactions on our Sites in order to assess how customers are engaging with our products and services.
For example, we may use automatic forms of data collection such as cookies to determine your browsing preferences, purchase history, the length of time you spend on the Sites, and similar information.
We treat information collected in this manner as Personally Identifying Information when we are able to use it, alone or in association with other data, to determine or infer your identity.
 




Our Collection of Non-Personally Identifying Information


Non-Personally Identifying Information may be automatically collected by us (and our third-party providers) when you interact with the Sites or with emails you receive from us.
For example, both we and our third-party providers may use technologies that automatically collect information about your computer or another device you use to access the Sites.
Examples of this kind of information are IP addresses, geolocation information, unique device identifiers, browser types, browser languages, and other transactional information.
We may also collect information about how you use the Sites via log files, clickstream data, reading history based on the pages you view, search terms and results, and other âtraffic dataâ such as times and dates of access, software crash reports, session identification numbers and referring website addresses.
If you choose to enable the location feature, some of our applications may deliver content based on your location, and the location information will be stored on your device and used by the app.
If you choose to save a location-based search in your history, we will also store that information on our servers.
We will not collect or store location information if you donât enable the location-based service, or if an app does not include the location-based feature.
Subject to applicable law, by using our Sites, you consent to the use of tracking technologies as described in this section.


More Information About Cookies and Other Data Collection Technologies



Cookies: The term âcookieâ refers to a small text file that may be stored on your computer, phone, or other device when you visit certain web pages.
Web browser settings can usually be changed to decline cookies, although this option may result in limitations on your ability to access or use the Sites.
Most web browsersâ default settings accept cookies automatically, and if you do not change that setting we and our third-party service providers may place, view and/or use cookies, web beacons, local storage objects or similar technologies to learn about your use of the Sites and other websites, including information about web pages you view, links you click, and other actions you take on our Sites.
You should also be aware that cookies may be used to track responses to online advertising.
We do not currently respond to âdo not trackâ signals from browsers that offer this feature.


Other technologies that may be employed by us or by our third-party service providers include web beacons, flash cookies, and local storage objects.


A web beacon is a single pixel GIF that collects information such as the number of visitors to a Site, how users navigate a Site, and how users respond to emails (i.e., how many emails are opened, how many links are clicked).


A flash cookie is a data file that the Adobe Flash plug-in (which may be built into your device or downloaded by you) places on your device.
Flash cookies remember your preferences, among other functions.
Flash privacy settings can be modified by adjusting the settings on your computer or device, but modifying these settings may limit the functionality of certain functions of the Sites.


A local storage object stores information on your computer or device about how you use our Sites, products and services.
We use local storage objects and web beacons to analyze how our customers and other visitors to our Sites engage with us and how we can improve, including by customizing our products, services and offerings.

By using the Sites, you are consenting to these uses and others as specified in this Policy, on the Sites, and in our Terms of Use.





How We Use the Information We Collect When You Make Purchases on or Through Our Sites

We use the information you provide in this connection primarily for the purpose of processing the transaction, but we may also use it for other lawful purposes including creating and managing your account, evaluating and improving our services, determining the effectiveness of our marketing, and performing certain forms of market and consumer research.
Where other third parties, such as vendors who supply our software or perform web hosting and other services for the Sites, have access to your personally identifying information, they may not use such information for any purpose other than to provide services in connection with the Sites, unless they receive express permission from you.





Information We Share With Others


We may share your Personally Identifying Information as follows:
With your school, if you are a student, an instructor, or an individual otherwise affiliated with an educational institution.
For example, we may provide your school with information about the ways in which its students and instructors interact with our educational products and platforms, including information that compares instructors and students within the school.
With instructors and school administrators, if you are a student.
With the service providers we use to perform functions (such as hosting, billing, marketing, analytics, customer service and fraud protection on our behalf), subject to such providersâ obligation to maintain the confidentiality and security of the information and to use it for no purpose other than in accordance with our instructions to provide the requested services.
With third-party partners who provide services to you through the Sites, to the extent that you have authorized such sharing or have formed a relationship with the such partner, to permit your use of certain products or services and/or to validate the referrals and operate the platforms.
For example, we may share your information, including certain personally identifying information, with the third-party provider of an application that enables certain functionalities on the Sites, depending on your preferences as expressed in the privacy settings you choose.
Such third partiesâ own privacy policies, and not this Policy, will govern their use of information we share with them.
As necessary to comply with applicable laws and regulations, which may include laws and regulations outside of your country of residence, and as required or appropriate to cooperate with law enforcement and government or other public authorities.
For other legitimate purposes, such as enforcement of this Policy or the Terms of Use that govern our Sites, to protect our other rights or property, or for the safety of our users, authors, employees, customers, affiliates or others.
We may share your Non-Personally Identifying Information in any way that we deem necessary or appropriate.
For example, information that we have aggregated and/or anonymized in such a way that it can no longer be used to identify you or anyone else may be used by us for our own or othersâ research purposes, or to generate further data for our own use or that of third parties.
