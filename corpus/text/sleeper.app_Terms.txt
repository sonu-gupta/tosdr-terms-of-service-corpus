4 PAID ENTRY CONTESTS OF SKILL

4.1 The Services include paid entry contests of skill that include cash prizes (âContestsâ), which are subject to the additional terms in this Section 4.
Contests are games of skill and are not games of chance.
Winners are determined by the individuals who use their skill and knowledge of relevant sports information and fantasy sports rules to accumulate the most points according to the corresponding scoring rules.
The Services may not be used for any form of illegal gambling.
In addition to these Terms, we encourage you to read the official rules that govern each such Contest.

4.3 Sleeper may limit the amount a user can deposit into his or her account, including in accordance with state-imposed deposit limits.
Sleeper also reserves the right to impose an inactive account fee with advance notice through an update to these Terms or other communication to you.

4.6 All payments are final, and Sleeper is under no obligation to issue refunds or exchanges of any form.
In the case of a dispute regarding the identity of a user submitting payment, that payment will be deemed to have been submitted by the user in whose name the respective individual account was registered.
In the event of a disqualification or cancellation, Sleeper reserves the right to issue refunds or exchanges, in our sole discretion, without any restrictions as to the amount, timing, and/or method of delivery.
We may provide notification of such disqualifications or cancellations, but are under no obligation to do so.

Such refunds will be made available to users via their registered accounts.
In select cases, in which users submit requests for cancellation regarding their Contest entry fees prior to the start of the respective sporting events, Sleeper may choose to honor such requests, but is under absolutely no obligation to do so.
Moreover, we reserve the right to deny any requests to cancel any and all forms of user-submitted payments, including entry fees, without limitation, and completely at our own sole discretion.

Winners agree that from the date of notification of their status as a potential winner and continuing until such time when Sleeper informs them that they no longer need to do so, they will make themselves available to Sleeper for publicity, advertising, and promotion activities.
[4.13 Sleeper uses third party data providers to provide sports data for our Contests.
While Sleeper and the third parties use reasonable efforts to include accurate and up-to-date information, Sleeper cannot and does not guarantee the accuracy of the data used to allocate points scoring in all circumstances.
If we correct mistakes during or after the Contest, this may change the points have you have been awarded.
In cases where our third party data providers make corrections to the sports data, Sleeper retains sole and absolute discretion to make corrections or amend the scoring or points allocated during a Contest at any time before the winners of that Contest have been paid.
Such corrections will not be made to scoring or points allocation for a Contest after the winners have been paid.]

Most concerns are quickly resolved in this manner to our customers' satisfaction.
The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.
To the maximum extent permitted by law, you permanently and irrevocably waive your rights to bring any claim in connection with your use of the Services unless you bring it within one (1) year of the date of the event giving rise to such claim.
13.4 EXCEPT FOR DISPUTES THAT QUALIFY TO BE HEARD IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR ANY ASPECT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU, ON THE ONE HAND, AND SLEEPER OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, OR SUPPLIERS, ON THE OTHER HAND, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE, FRAUD, MISREPRESENTATION, OR ANY OTHER THEORY, WILL BE RESOLVED THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION BEFORE A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF IN A COURT BY A JUDGE OR JURY.
13.5 YOU AGREE THAT SLEEPER AND YOU ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY A JURY.
YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS ONLY AND THAT CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS AND OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED.

13.6 The arbitration will be administered by JAMS in accordance with the provisions of its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules or Streamlined Arbitrations Rules, as appropriate, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.
The JAMS Rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at http://www.jamsadr.com/ or by calling JAMS at (800) 352-5267.
The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is appropriate.
Any in-person appearances will be held at a location that is reasonably convenient to the parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances.
If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination will be made by the JAMS or by the arbitrator.
If you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will, to the extent required to make this Section 13 enforceable, pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.
The arbitrator will be bound by these Terms, when not in conflict with applicable law, and the arbitratorâs decision will be binding and final, subject only to limited right of judicial review provided under the Federal Arbitration Act.
The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of these Terms, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator.
If the arbitrator decides that either the substance of your claim or the remedy you asked for is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, we may use the applicable Rules to determine whether you are responsible for the filing, administrative and arbitrator fees.
The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in these Terms will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local government agencies or from seeking public injunctive relief in court where that right cannot be waived under applicable state law.
13.7 If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place in San Francisco County, CA.
For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in San Francisco County, California, and you and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in San Francisco County, California, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
13.8 To not be bound by the arbitration agreement set forth in this Section 13, within 30 days of using our Services, you must notify Sleeper in writing of your intent to opt-out of the arbitration provisions.
