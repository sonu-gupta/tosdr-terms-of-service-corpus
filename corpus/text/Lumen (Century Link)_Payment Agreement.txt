If you do not wish to be bound ,by this Agreement, you should not use or access Payment Services.
CenturyLink may modify this Agreement at any ,time without notice to you.
Modifications will be deemed effective immediately upon posting of the modified ,Agreement at http://www.centurylink.com or the designed link from that website.
,You should carefully read this Agreement, including the required use of arbitration on an individual basis to resolve ,disputes, rather than jury trials or class actions, and the limitations on the remedies available to you in the event of a ,dispute, as fully described in the âDispute Resolutionâ section of this Agreement.
,1.Invoice Charges.
We bill you for CenturyLink Products on a monthly basis based on current prices and charges ,provided to you or posted to http://www.centurylink.com or other CenturyLink marketing or other website, and as ,listed in any written information that we provide to you.
All applicable and associated charges, the method by ,which we assess such charges to you, and your obligation to pay all such charges are described in the applicable ,terms and conditions for your CenturyLink Products (each, a âCenturyLink Product Agreementâ).
Your payment ,due date will be listed on your CenturyLink invoice, and all payments must be made in U.S.
currency.
Payments ,you make using Payment Services on CenturyLink-designated websites provided to you (each, a âPayment ,Websiteâ) are processed within one business day, to the extent possible.
For each month in which any portion of ,your charges are not paid by the due date on your invoice, we may charge you a late payment fee or interest on those ,unpaid balances equal to the maximum amount or interest rate, respectively, allowed by law.
If we use a collection ,agency or initiate any legal action to recover amounts due, you agree to reimburse us for all expenses we incur to ,recover such amount or pay all such costs and expenses associated with such collections efforts, including attorneysâ ,fees.
We may charge you an insufficient funds or returned check fee, up to the maximum rate allowed by law, if ,your check, bank draft, electronic funds transfer, or other order for payment is dishonored or returned for ,insufficient funds or any other reason.
In addition to our right to assess late payment fees, interest, and any other ,costs arising from our expenses to recover amounts you owe us if your payment is not made by the due date on your ,invoice, we may begin procedures to cancel the affected CenturyLink Products.
You will be informed of such action ,if required by law.
CenturyLink also reserves the right to terminate access to Payment Services for any account at ,any time.
Certain CenturyLink offers or promotions may require you to enroll in specified Payment Services as a ,condition to receiving such offer or promotion.,2.
Partial Payment.
Partial payments are acceptable, however our acceptance of such payments are not to be ,construed as an acceptable payment arrangement that automatically extends your CenturyLink Product beyond the ,normal disconnect date.
Our acceptance of late or partial payments (even those marked, âPAID IN FULLâ) and late ,payment charges will not constitute a waiver of any of our rights to collect the full amount due under this Agreement ,or the CenturyLink Product Agreement.
If you are unable to pay an invoice in full prior to the due date, please ,contact CenturyLink customer service before the due date.
,3.
Questions about Your Invoice or Charges.

You accept all charges not disputed within 30 days.
However, you may dispute charges resulting ,from your failure to return equipment to us in the manner and according to the timelines described in the applicable ,CenturyLink Product Agreement after the 30-day period described in this section, but such disputes may only ,OnlinePayTs&Cs 11.15 ,2,specifically relate to the charges assessed for the equipment return.

CenturyLink also ,reserves the right to assess additional charges to you if you are enrolled in a Payment Service but request ,CenturyLink to provide you with a paper invoice on either a one-time or continuing basis.
,5.
Invoice Notification.
Certain Payment Services send an email notification to you each month when your new ,invoice is available for review.
However, if you are unable to view your invoice electronically or online for any ,reason, you are still required to make your payment on time.

In the event that any amount on a ,third party site does not match the same amount presented at the CenturyLink Website or on your printed ,CenturyLink invoice, CenturyLinkâs listed amount is deemed to be the accurate amount.
In the event the amount ,listed at the CenturyLink Website and on your printed CenturyLink invoice do not agree, the printed CenturyLink ,invoice should be considered the correct invoice and should be used to determine the amount to be paid.
For your ,convenience, you may elect to have CenturyLink retain your payment information, including but not limited to your ,billing name, address, telephone number, credit card/debit card/charge card information or numbers, bank or ,financial institution information, applicable expiration dates, and permit such information to be used in future ,transactions with CenturyLink that you authorize.

all Claims that arose prior to your receipt of CenturyLink Products (such as from ,advertisings) or prior to this Agreement.
all Claims that arise after the termination of CenturyLink Products ,to you or after the termination of this Agreement.
all Claims you may bring against CenturyLink's ,employees, agents, affiliates or other representatives.

The Notice must: (1) describe the nature and basis of ,the Claim.
and (2) set forth the specific relief sought (âDemandâ).
If CenturyLink and you do not ,reach an agreement to resolve the Claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, you or ,CenturyLink may commence an arbitration proceeding.
A single arbitrator engaged in the practice ,of law will conduct the arbitration.
The arbitration will be filed with the American Arbitration ,Association (âAAAâ), the arbitrator will be selected according to the AAAâs procedures and the ,Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.
Â§Â§ 1-16 (âFAAâ), and Claims will be resolved pursuant to this ,Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes provision and the AAAâs rules in effect when the Claim is ,filed.

The arbitrator has no authority ,to join or consolidate Claims, or adjudicate joined or consolidated Claims, unless you and ,CenturyLink agree in writing.
All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating ,to the scope and enforceability of the Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes provision are for the ,court to decide.
The arbitrator's decision and award is final and binding, and judgment on the ,award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction.
The arbitrator can award the same damages ,and relief that a court can award, including the award of declaratory or injunctive relief.
provided, ,however, that any declaratory or injunctive relief may only be in favor of the individual party ,seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that partyâs ,individual Claim.

No changes, however, that ,are made to this provision after either party has submitted a Notice of Dispute shall be effective as ,to your and CenturyLinkâs pending dispute and/or arbitration.
,(5)Governing Law, Enforcement, and Waivers.
The Federal Arbitration Act, and not state law, ,applies to this Dispute Resolution provision and its provisions and, governs all questions of ,whether a Claim is subject to arbitration.
If any portion of this Dispute Resolution provision is ,determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of the provision remains in full force and ,effect.
If for any reason, the above provisions on arbitration are held unenforceable or are found ,not to apply to a Claim, you and CenturyLink waive the right to a jury trial on your respective ,Claims, and waive any right to pursue any Claims on a class or consolidated basis or in a ,OnlinePayTs&Cs 11.15 ,5,representative capacity.
