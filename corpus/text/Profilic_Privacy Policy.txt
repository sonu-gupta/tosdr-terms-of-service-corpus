We do not pre-moderate or have any ,control over what you include in forum data, so we ask that you carefully consider ,your own privacy in deciding what to post, especially since forum posts are public ,and visible to anyone browsing the forum.
Because forum data is determined by ,you, it could potentially include special categories of data, such as data about ,race, ethnic origin, politics, religion, health, sex life or sexual orientation and if ,you post that data you consent to our processing it.
We will also record your IP ,address in relation to each forum post â this means that users who post unlawful ,or abusive content can be banned, and, if necessary, their ISP or law ,enforcement can be provided with an IP address for investigation.
