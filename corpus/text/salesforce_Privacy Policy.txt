  4.
What device and usage data do we process? &nbsp.
We use common information-gathering tools, such as tools for collecting usage data, cookies, web beacons, pixels, and similar technologies to automatically collect information that may contain Personal Data as you navigate our websites, our services, or interact with emails we have sent to you.

4.1 Device and usage data

As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically when individual users visit our websites.
This information may include identifiers, commercial information, and internet activity information such as IP address (or proxy server information), device and application information, identification numbers and features, location, browser type, plug-ins, integrations, Internet service provider, mobile carrier, the pages and files viewed, searches, referring website, app or ad, operating system, system configuration information, advertising and language preferences, date and time stamps associated with your usage, and frequency of visits to the websites.
This information is used to analyze overall trends, help us provide and improve our websites, offer a tailored experience for website users, and secure and maintain our websites.
In addition, we gather certain information automatically as part of your use of our cloud products and services.
This information may include identifiers, commercial information, and internet activity information such as IP address (or proxy server), mobile device number, device and application identification numbers, location, browser type, Internet service provider or mobile carrier, the pages and files viewed, website and webpage interactions including searches and other actions you take, operating system and system configuration information and date and time stamps associated with your usage.
This information is used to maintain the security of the services, to provide necessary functionality, to improve performance of the services, to assess and improve customer and user experience of the services, to review compliance with applicable usage terms, to identify future opportunities for development of the services, to assess capacity requirements, to identify customer opportunities, and for the security of Salesforce generally (in addition to the security of our products and services).
Some of the device and usage data collected by the services, whether alone or in conjunction with other data, could be personally identifying to you.
Please note that this device and usage data is primarily used to identify the uniqueness of each user logging on (as opposed to specific individuals), apart from where it is strictly required to identify an individual for security purposes or as required as part of our provision of the services to our customers.

4.2 Cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies on our website and in email communications

We use technologies such as web beacons, pixels, tags, and JavaScript, alone or in conjunction with cookies, to gather information about the use of our websites and how people interact with our emails.
When you visit our websites, we, or an authorized third party, may place a cookie on your device that collects information, including Personal Data, about your online activities over time and across different sites.
Cookies allow us to track use, infer-browsing preferences, and improve and customize your browsing experience.
We use both session-based and persistent cookies on our websites.
Session-based cookies exist only during a single session and disappear from your device when you close your browser or turn off the device.
Persistent cookies remain on your device after you close your browser or turn your device off.
To change your cookie settings and preferences for one of our websites, click the Cookie Preferences link in the footer of the page.
You can also control the use of cookies on your device, but choosing to disable cookies on your device may limit your ability to use some features on our websites and services.
We also use web beacons and pixels on our websites and in emails.
For example, we may place a pixel in marketing emails that notify us when you click on a link in the email.
We use these technologies to operate and improve our websites and marketing emails.
For instructions on how to unsubscribe from our marketing emails, please see Section 10.4 below.
The following describes how we use different categories of cookies and similar technologies and your options for managing the data collection settings of these technologies:
Type of Cookies
Description
Managing Settings
Required cookies
Required cookies are necessary for basic website functionality.
Some examples include: session cookies needed to transmit the website, authentication cookies, and security cookies.
If you have chosen to identify yourself to us, we may place on your browser a cookie that allows us to uniquely identify you when you are logged into the websites and to process your online transactions and requests.
Because required cookies are essential to operate the websites, there is no option to opt out of these cookies. Functional cookies
Functional cookies enhance functions, performance, and services on the website.
Some examples include: cookies used to analyze site traffic, cookies used for market research, and cookies used to display advertising that is not directed to a particular individual. 
Functional cookies may also be used to improve how our websites function and to help us provide you with more relevant communications, including marketing communications.
These cookies collect information about how our websites are used, including which pages are viewed most often.
We may use our own technology or third-party technology to track and analyze usage information to provide enhanced interactions and more relevant communications, and to track the performance of our advertisements.
For example, we use Google Analytics (âGoogle Analyticsâ), a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.&nbsp.
You can learn about Googleâs privacy practices by going to www.google.com/policies/privacy/âpartners/.
Google Analytics uses cookies to help us analyze how our websites are used, including the number of visitors, the websites from which visitors have navigated to our websites, and the pages on our websites to which visitors navigate.
This information is used by us to improve our websites.
We use Google Analytics with restrictions on how Google can process our data enabled.
For information on Googleâs Restricted Data Processing go to https://privacy.google.com/businesses/rdp/.
Salesforce may also use HTML5 local storage or Flash cookies for the above-mentioned purposes.
These technologies differ from browser cookies in the amount and type of data they store, and how they store it.
 
You can choose to opt out of functional cookies.
To change your cookie settings and preferences, including those for functional cookies, click the Cookie Preferences link in the footer of the page.
To opt out from data collection by Google Analytics, you can download and install a browser add-on, which is available here.
To learn how to control functional cookies via your individual browser settings, click here.
To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, click here. Advertising cookies
Advertising cookies track activity across websites in order to understand a viewerâs interests, and to direct marketing to them. 
We sometimes use cookies delivered by us or by third parties to show you ads for our products that we think may interest you on devices you use and to track the performance of our advertisements.
For example, these cookies collect information such as which browser you used when visiting our websites.
Salesforce also contracts with third-party advertising networks that collect IP addresses and other information from web beacons on our websites, from emails and on third-party websites.
Advertising networks follow your online activities over time and across different websites or other online services by collecting device and usage data through automated means, including through the use of cookies.
These technologies may recognize you across the different devices you use.
When we work with third party advertising networks, we require them to restrict their data processing to only what is necessary to provide us with the advertising services we request.
You can choose to opt out of targeting and advertising cookies.
To change your cookie settings and preferences, including those for targeting and advertising cookies, click the Cookie Preferences link in the footer of the page.
See Section 4.3, below, to learn more about these and other advertising networks and your ability to opt out of collection by certain third parties.

4.3 Notices on behavioral advertising and opt-out for website visitors

As described above, we or one of our authorized partners may place or read cookies on your device when you visit our websites for the purpose of serving you targeted advertising (also referred to as âonline behavioral advertisingâ or âinterest-based advertisingâ).
To learn more about targeted advertising and advertising networks please visit the opt-out pages of the Network Advertising Initiative, here, and the Digital Advertising Alliance, here.
To opt-out of targeted advertising that is provided to us and to third parties by Salesforce Audience Studio, click here.
To manage the use of targeting and advertising cookies on this website, click the Cookie Preferences link in the footer of the page or consult your individual browser settings for cookies.
To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, click here.
Various browsers may also offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 local storage.  

4.4 Opt-Out from the setting of cookies on your individual browser

In addition to using the user preference center, in many cases you may opt-out from the collection of non-essential device and usage data on your web browser (see the âWhat device and usage data we processâ section, above) by managing your cookies at the browser or device level.
In addition, if you wish to opt-out of interest-based advertising, click here (or, if located in the European Union, click here).&nbsp.
To opt-out of targeted advertising that is provided to us and to third parties by Salesforce DMP, click here.
Please note, however, that by blocking or deleting cookies and similar technologies used on our websites, you may not be able to take full advantage of the websites.
While some internet browsers offer a âdo not trackâ or âDNTâ option that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked, these features are not yet uniform and there is no common standard adopted by industry groups, technology companies, or regulators.
Therefore, we do not currently commit to responding to browsersâ DNT signals with respect to our websites.
Salesforce takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.

4.5 Social Media Features

Our websites may use social media features, such as the Facebook âlikeâ button, the âTweetâ button and other sharing widgets (âSocial Media Featuresâ).
Social Media Features may allow you to post information about your activities on our website to outside platforms and social networks.
Social Media Features may also allow you to like or highlight information we have posted on our website or our branded social media pages.
Social Media Features are either hosted by each respective platform or hosted directly on our website.
To the extent the Social Media Features are hosted by the platforms themselves, and you click through to these from our websites, the platform may receive information showing that you have visited our websites.
If you are logged in to your social media account, it is possible that the respective social media network can link your visit to our websites with your social media profile.
Salesforce also allows you to log in to certain of our websites using sign-in services like Facebook Connect.
These services authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain Personal Data from these services with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign-up form.
Your interactions with Social Media Features are governed by the privacy policies of the companies providing them.

4.6 Telephony log information

If you use certain features of our services on a mobile device, we may also collect telephony log information (like phone numbers, time and date of calls, duration of calls, SMS routing information and types of calls), device event information (such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser language), and location information (through IP address, GPS, and other sensors that may, for example, provide us with information on nearby devices, Wi-Fi access points and cell towers). 5.

If your data has been submitted to us by or on behalf of a Salesforce customer and you wish to exercise any rights you may have under applicable data protection laws, please inquire with them directly.
Because we may only access a customerâs data upon their instructions, if you wish to make your request directly to us, please provide us the name of the Salesforce customer who submitted your data to us.
We will refer your request to that customer, and will support them as needed in responding to your request within a reasonable timeframe. 

10.4 Your preferences for email and SMS marketing communications

If we process your Personal Data for the purpose of sending you marketing communications, you may manage your receipt of marketing and non-transactional communications from Salesforce by clicking on the âunsubscribeâ link located on the bottom of Salesforce marketing emails, by replying or texting âSTOPâ if you receive Salesforce SMS communications, or by unsubscribing here.
Please note that, notwithstanding the above, you will continue to receive marketing and non-transactional communications from MuleSoft unless you manage your receipt of such communications by clicking on the âunsubscribeâ link located on the bottom of MuleSoft marketing emails, replying or texting âSTOPâ to MuleSoft SMS communications, or unsubscribing here. 
You may also turn off push notifications on Salesforce and MuleSoft apps on your device, or unsubscribe by contacting us using the information in the âContacting usâ section, below. 
Please note that opting out of marketing communications does not opt you out of receiving important business communications related to your current relationship with us, such as communications about your subscriptions or event registrations, service announcements or security information.

10.5 Your preferences for telemarketing communications

If you want your phone number to be added to our internal Do-Not-Call telemarketing register, please contact us by using the information in the âContacting usâ section, below.
Please include your first name, last name, company and the phone number you wish to add to our Do-Not-Call register.
Alternatively, you can always let us know during a telemarketing call that you do not want to be called again for marketing purposes. 11.
How we secure your Personal Data We take appropriate precautions including organizational, technical, and physical measures to help safeguard against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, and unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, the Personal Data we process or use.

Changes to this Privacy Statement We will update this Privacy Statement from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, technologies, legal requirements, and other factors.
If we do, we will update the âeffective dateâ at the top.

California law requires that we detail the categories of Personal Data that we disclose for certain âbusiness purposes,â such as to service providers that assist us with securing our services or marketing our products, and to such other entities as described in Sections 5 and 6 of this Privacy Statement. We disclose the following categories of Personal Data for our business purposes:

If you are a California resident under the age of 18 and have registered for an account with us, you may ask us to remove content or information that you have posted to our website(s).
