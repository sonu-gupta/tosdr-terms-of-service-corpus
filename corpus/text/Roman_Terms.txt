Telehealth, Pharmacy, and At-Home Testing Services 
Telehealth Services. Telemedicine involves the delivery of health care services using electronic communications, information technology, or other means between a health care provider and a patient who are not in the same physical location.
Telemedicine may be used for diagnosis, treatment, follow-up and/or related patient education, and may include, but is not limited to:

Electronic transmission of medical records, photo images, personal health information, or other data between a patient and health care provider;
Interactions between a patient and health care provider via audio, video, and/or data communications.
and
Use of output data from medical devices, sound, and video files.

The electronic systems used in the Services will incorporate network and software security protocols to protect the privacy and security of health information, and will include measures to safeguard your data to ensure its integrity against intentional or unintentional corruption or unlawful access.
By accepting the Terms of Use, you agree and consent to Ro, the affiliated physician practices, the health care providers contracted or employed by the affiliated physician practices, and any other health care organization(s) or provider(s) with whom we partner to provide the Services to you sending you disclosures, notices, messages, reports, and other communications either in writing or electronically including without limitation through your account or by email.
It is your responsibility to monitor these communications.
You acknowledge and agree that you will not hold us, any affiliated physician practice, any health care provider contracted or employed by an affiliated physician practice, or any health care organization(s) or provider(s) with whom we partner to offer the Services to you liable for any loss, injury, or claim of any kind resulting from your failure to read these communications or for your failure to comply with any treatment recommendations contained in these communications.

The Consent to Telehealth is hereby incorporated into these Terms of Use by reference and constitutes a part of these Terms of Use.
Please also see Section 20 below for additional terms applicable to the use of certain services and products on the Services.

Your Relationship with Ro. Ro does not provide any medical services, including via the Services.
Rather, Ro provides a technology platform for you to access a health care provider who is employed or contracted with a Ro affiliated physician practice and obtain access to additional information, which you may or may not choose to utilize in planning your health care and wellness.
The health and wellness resources made available through our Services are for informational purposes only, and are not a substitute for direct in-person health care services in all cases.
nor are they an indicator of specific results.
The decision to focus on diagnosis, treatment recommendations, or both, rests with you and the health care provider.
You understand that by coordinating and consulting with an affiliated physician practice or its health care providers through the Services, you are not entering into a provider-patient relationship with Ro.
Except for specific communications received from an affiliated physician practice or its health care providers, none of the information you receive through the Services should be considered medical advice.

No Insurance Accepted.
Notice of Your Financial Responsibility. Ro and the affiliated physician practices do not accept commercial health insurance plans, are not in-network with any commercial health insurance plans, and are not enrolled with federal or state health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid.
By choosing to use the Services, you are specifically choosing to obtain products and services on a cash-pay basis outside of any commercial health insurance plan or federal or state health care program.
Thus, you are solely responsible for the costs of any services or products provided to you. If you are a federal health program beneficiary, you agree that neither you, Ro, the affiliated physician practices, or any of the health care organization(s) or provider(s) with whom we partner to provide health care and pharmacy services to you will submit a claim for reimbursement to any federal or state healthcare program for the costs of the services and products provided to you through the Services.
Please also see Section 14 below for additional terms applicable to your payment obligations.

Pharmacy Services. If you receive a prescription as a result of your use of the Services, you may select Roman Health Pharmacy LLC or one of our partner pharmacies (collectively, the âRo Pharmacy Networkâ) to ship your prescription.
You may also choose to have your prescription fulfilled through the pharmacy of your choice when prompted during your use of the Services.
You give us consent to send and disclose to the Ro Pharmacy Network or the pharmacy of your choice all information provided by you, health care records, and other applicable health care information and personal information (such as your name, location and demographic information) so that you may receive pharmacy services.

If you select to use the Ro Pharmacy Network to fulfill any prescriptions, you acknowledge that your medication will not be shipped in child-resistant packaging and that you must keep it out of the reach of children.



At-home Testing Services. At-home sample collection kits and laboratory services available through the Services may require a valid order by a licensed health care provider.
We or our subsidiaries have partnered with a health care provider who is licensed in your state to review your request for at-home testing (the âReviewing Providerâ).
You understand and agree that at-home testing services are intended for informational, educational, and wellness purposes only.
They are not intended to be diagnostic.
You further understand and agree that you do not establish a provider-patient relationship with the Reviewing Provider as a result of your use of the Services.


We will send or cause to be sent the requested test kit to your address after any required health care provider review and approval.
You must follow the instructions that accompany the kit to register your kit, collect the applicable biological sample(s), complete any required documentation, and return such biological samples and documentation to the applicable laboratory that performs the testing (the âLabâ).
Failure to follow the instructions may result in your samples not being processed by the Lab.
The Lab sends the results of the tests to the Reviewing Provider who releases the test results to us.
We provide the test results to you via the Services.
You understand and agree that it is your responsibility to bring your results to your primary health care provider for interpretation and to inform decisions made about your health and treatment.Registration and Account CreationAlthough certain parts of the Services are accessible without creating an account, you may be required to create an account to access and use certain parts of the Services.
If you create an account, you agree to provide information that is accurate, complete and correct, and to accurately maintain and update any information about yourself that you have provided to Ro.
If you do not maintain such information, or Ro has reasonable grounds to suspect as much, Ro has the right to suspend or terminate your account and your use of the Services.
You agree to keep confidential your username and password and to exit from your account at the end of each session.
You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account and for maintaining the confidentiality of your password.
You also agree to immediately notify Ro of any unauthorized use of your username, password or any other breach of security that you become aware of involving or relating to the Services by emailing Ro at care@ro.co.
Ro may take any and all actions it deems necessary or reasonable to maintain the security of the Services.
You are responsible for changing your password promptly if you think it has been compromised.
You may not transfer or share your password with anyone, or create more than one account.
You may not use anyone elseâs account at any time.
Ro explicitly disclaims liability for any and all losses and damages arising from your failure to comply with this section.
Our Apps are intended for use only on mobile phones that run an unmodified manufacturer approved operating system.
Using the Apps on a mobile phone with a modified operating system may undermine security features that are intended to protect your protected health information and other information from unauthorized or unintended disclosure.
As a result, you may compromise your information if you use the App on a mobile phone that has been modified.

Dispute Resolution.
Arbitration.
Venue.
SeverabilityIMPORTANT NOTE: PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU AND RO TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN US THROUGH BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM RO.
YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS OF USE, YOU AND RO ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.

Governing Law. These Terms of Use and your use of the Services shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws.
Subject to the requirement to arbitrate set forth in this Section 16, exclusive jurisdiction for all disputes that do not require arbitration will be the state and federal courts located in New York, New York, and you consent to the jurisdiction of those courts.

Binding Arbitration, Generally. Except as described in the âExceptionsâ section below, you and Ro agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms of Use, the Services, or communications from us will be resolved through binding arbitration.
Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, is less formal than a court proceeding, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts.
This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims whether based in contract, tort, statute, regulation, ordinance, fraud, misrepresentation, common law, constitutional provision, respondeat superior, agency or any other legal or equitable theory, regardless of whether a claim arises after the termination of these Terms of Use, and regardless of whether a claim arises before or after the effective date of these Terms of Use.
Any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement will be resolved by the arbitrator.

Exceptions. Although we are agreeing to arbitrate most disputes between us, nothing in these Terms of Use will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court.
(b) file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.
or (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in a state or federal court in New York, New York.

Arbitrator. This arbitration agreement, and any arbitration between us, is subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, âAAA Rulesâ) as modified by these Terms of Use.
The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at +1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Ro.


Commencing Arbitration. Before initiating arbitration, a party must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S.
Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (âNotice of Arbitrationâ).
Roâs address for Notice is: Roman Health Ventures Inc., 116 W.
23rd Street, 4th Floor, New York, New York, 10011 Attention: General Counsel.
A copy of all Notices of Arbitration must also be sent to Ro via email to arbitration-notices@ro.co.
The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) identify the name or account number of the party making the claim.
(b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.
and (c) set forth the specific relief sought (âDemandâ).
The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Ro may commence an arbitration proceeding.
If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Ro will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than US$10,000 or if Ro has received 25 or more similar demands for arbitration, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules.
If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules and Ro may seek reimbursement for any fees paid to AAA.

Arbitration Proceedings. Any arbitration hearing will take place in the county and state of your billing address unless we agree otherwise or, if the claim is for US$10,000 or less (and does not seek injunctive relief), you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.
(b) through a telephonic or video hearing.
or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.
During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Ro must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.
Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.

Arbitration Relief. Except as provided in the âNo Class Actionsâ section below, the arbitrator can award any relief that would be available if the claims had been brought in a court of competent jurisdiction.
The arbitratorâs award shall be final and binding on all parties.
Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.


No Class Actions. YOU AND RO AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
Further, unless both you and Ro agree otherwise in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one personâs claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

Limited Time to File Claims. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU OR RO WANTS TO ASSERT A DISPUTE AGAINST THE OTHER THAT IS SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO THESE TERMS OF USE, THEN YOU OR RO MUST COMMENCE SUCH DISPUTE BY DELIVERY OF A NOTICE OF ARBITRATION WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE DISPUTE ARISES -- OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED.

Severability. All parts of these Terms of Use apply to the maximum extent permitted by law.
Ro and you both agree that if we cannot enforce a part of this contract as written, then that part will be replaced with terms that most closely match the intent of the part we cannot enforce, to the extent permitted by law.
The invalidity of part of these Terms of Use will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions.
The section headings are for convenience only and do not have any force or effect.17.
Communications by Text Message and EmailBy opting-in to receive text (SMS) messages from Ro or by sending Ro an initial text message (an âSMS Enrollmentâ), you consent to receiving text messages regarding your Ro account and use of the Services.
These text messages may include order confirmations, shipping notifications, messages from your healthcare provider, and other transactional messages, as well as promotional and marketing notifications, to the extent you have opted-in to receive such messages from Ro.
With your SMS Enrollment, you represent and understand that: (1) you are the owner or authorized user of the mobile device you used in order to initiate the SMS Enrollment, (2) you are authorized to approve any applicable charges in connection with the text messages you send to and receive from Ro, (3) you will be responsible for all messaging and other data charges that may apply for any text messages sent to you from Ro, or from Ro to you, and (4) neither Ro, nor your or Roâs mobile carriers, will be liable for delayed or undelivered messages.
Note that access to the Services is not conditioned upon your consent to receive marketing or promotional text messages from Ro, and you can opt-out of any of Roâs SMS services at any time by texting âSTOPâ to the message received, from the mobile device that is subscribed to receive the SMS messages.
After you send the text message âSTOPâ to us, we may send you one final text message to confirm that you have been unsubscribed.
If you have opted-in to receive more than one type of text message from Ro, you will need to opt-out of each Ro SMS service to which you are subscribed.
Until you have done so, you may continue to receive the types of text messages from Ro that you have opted-in to receive but have not unsubscribed from.
You also understand that while Ro takes your privacy and the security of your health and other sensitive information very seriously, the transmission of information over the internet and mobile networks is not 100% secure.
Text messages and emails that you send to or receive from Ro are not encrypted, which means that it is possible they may be intercepted by third parties.
If you choose to send or receive information about your health or any other sensitive information by text message or email, you do so at your own risk.
By initiating an SMS Enrollment, you consent to sending text messages to Ro, and receiving text messages from Ro, that are not encrypted.
Likewise, by emailing Ro or giving Ro your email, you consent to receiving unencrypted emails messages from Ro.
If you are experiencing any issues with Roâs text messaging or email services, or if you have any concerns about sending or receiving any sensitive information through text or email, please contact us directly atcare@ro.co.
If you have questions specific to your text or data plan, please contact your wireless provider.18.
Miscellaneous Terms
No waiver. No waiver by Ro of any term or condition set forth in these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure by Ro to assert a right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

No agency relationship. Neither these Terms of Use, nor any Services Content, materials or features of the Services create any partnership, joint venture, employment, or other agency relationship between us and you.
You may not enter into any contract on our behalf or bind us in any way.

Remedies. You agree that any violation, or threatened violation, by you of these Terms of Use constitutes an unlawful and unfair business practice that will cause us irreparable and unquantifiable harm.
You also agree that monetary damages would be inadequate for such harm and consent to our obtaining any injunctive or equitable relief that we deem necessary or appropriate.
These remedies are in addition to any other remedies we may have at law or in equity.

Assignment. You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms of Use, and any such attempt will be null and void.
Ro and its affiliates may, in their individual discretion, transfer, without further consent or notification, all contractual rights and obligations pursuant to these Terms of Use if some or all of the business of Ro is transferred to another entity by way of merger, sale of its assets, or otherwise.

Notice for California Users. If you are a California resident, you hereby waive California Civil Code Â§1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor." This release includes the criminal acts of others.

Headings. The heading references herein are for convenience purposes only, and shall not be deemed to limit or affect any of the provisions hereof.

Entire Agreement. This is the entire agreement between you and Ro relating to the subject matter herein and supersedes all previous communications, representations, understandings and agreements, either oral or written, between the parties with respect to said subject matter, excluding any other agreements that you may have entered into with Ro.
