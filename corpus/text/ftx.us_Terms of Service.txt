,27.Death of Account Holder.
For security reasons, if we receive legal documentation confirming your death or other ,information leading us to believe you have died, we will freeze your FTX.US Account and during this time, no ,transactions may be completed until:(i) your designated fiduciary has opened a new FTX.US Account, as further ,described below, and the entirety of your FTX.US Account has been transferred to such new account, or (ii) we ,have received proof in a form satisfactory to us that you have not died.
If we have reason to believe you may ,have died but we do not have proof of your death in a form satisfactory to us, you authorize us to make ,inquiries, whether directly or through third parties, that we consider necessary to ascertain whether you have ,died.
Upon receipt by us of proof satisfactory to us that you have died, the fiduciary you have designated in a ,valid Will or similar testamentary document will be required to open a new FTX.US Account.
If you have not ,designated a fiduciary, then we reserve the right to (i) treat as your fiduciary any person entitled to inherit your ,FTX.US Account, as determined by us upon receipt and review of the documentation we, in our sole and ,absolute discretion, deem necessary or appropriate, including (but not limited to) a Will, a living trust or a Small ,Estate Affidavit, or (ii) require an order designating a fiduciary from a court having competent jurisdiction over ,your estate.
In the event we determine, in our sole and absolute discretion, that there is uncertainty regarding ,the validity of the fiduciary designation, we reserve the right to require an order resolving such issue from a ,court of competent jurisdiction before taking any action relating to your FTX.US Account.
Pursuant to the above, ,the opening of a new FTX.US Account by a designated fiduciary is mandatory following the death of a FTX.US ,Account owner, and you hereby agree that your fiduciary will be required to open a new FTX.US Account and ,provide the information required under these Terms in order to gain access to the contents of your FTX.US ,Account.

If this occurs, FTX.US will try to locate you at the address shown in our records, but if ,FTX.US is unable to locate you, it may be required to deliver any such funds to the applicable state or ,jurisdiction as unclaimed property.
,29.Governing Law and Forum Choice.
These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the Federal ,Arbitration Act, federal arbitration law, and the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws ,provisions.
Except as otherwise expressly set forth in Section 32 âDispute Resolution,â the exclusive jurisdiction ,for all Disputes (defined below) that you and FTX.US are not required to arbitrate will be the state and federal ,courts located in Alameda County in California, and you and FTX.US each waive any objection to jurisdiction ,and venue in such courts.
,30.Dispute Resolution.,(a)Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes.
We each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out ,of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the ,use of the Services (collectively, âDisputesâ) will be resolved solely by binding, individual arbitration and ,not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding.
You and FTX.US agree that the ,U.S.
Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and that you and ,FTX.US are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.
This arbitration ,provision shall survive termination of these Terms.,(b)Exceptions.
As limited exceptions to Section 32(a) above: (i) we both may seek to resolve a ,Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies.
and (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other ,equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual ,property rights.
,(c)Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules.
The arbitration will be conducted by the American ,Arbitration Association (âAAAâ) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the âAAA Rulesâ) then in effect, ,except as modified by these Terms.
The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling,1-800-778-7879.
A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to AAA ,and give notice to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules.
The AAA provides a form Demand for ,Arbitration at www.adr.org.
Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county, city (or parish) where you ,live, unless we both agree to a different location.
The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive ,authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this ,arbitration agreement.
To the extent the location of the arbitration hearing is more than 100 miles from a ,location of FTX.US offices, FTX.US reserves the right to appear by video conference to the fullest extent ,permitted by law.
,(d)Arbitration Costs.
Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the ,AAA Rules, and we wonât seek to recover the administration and arbitrator fees we are responsible for ,paying, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous.
If we prevail in arbitration weâll pay all of our ,attorneysâ fees and costs and wonât seek to recover them from you.
If you prevail in arbitration you will be ,entitled to an award of attorneysâ fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.
,(e)Injunctive and Declaratory Relief.
Except as provided in Section 32(b) above, the arbitrator shall ,determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either party and may award ,declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent ,necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.
To the extent that you or we prevail on ,a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of ,prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief ,must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration.
The parties agree that ,litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any ,individual claims in arbitration.
,(f)Class Action Waiver.
YOU AND FTX.US AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST ,THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS ,MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
Further, if the partiesâ ,dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person's claims with your ,claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
If this specific ,provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and ,void.
,(g)Effect of Changes on Arbitration.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3 âChanges to Terms or ,Servicesâ above, if FTX.US changes any of the terms of this Section 32 âDispute Resolutionâ after the date ,you most recently accepted these Terms, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice ,(including by email to support@ftx.us) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as ,indicated in the âLast Updatedâ date above or in the date of FTX.USâs email to you notifying you of such ,change.
By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and ,FTX.US in accordance with the terms of this Section 32 âDispute Resolutionâ as of the date you most ,recently accepted these Terms.
,(h)Severability.
