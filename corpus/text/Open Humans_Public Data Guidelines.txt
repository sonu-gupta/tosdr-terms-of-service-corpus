Use standard identifiers where possible to assist others interested in finding work related to a sample or data set, and to enable participants to track research derived from their contributions.
We encourage open access publication when possible.

Our data is offered "as is", without warranty of any kind.
Our database will change, as participants may choose to withdraw and/or remove data.
