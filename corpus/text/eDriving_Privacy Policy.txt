Throughout this policy, we use the term âpersonal informationâ to describe information that identifies or makes you identifiable.

By using our Services, you consent to the terms of this privacy policy.
We also may provide in-time notice or obtain consent for certain practices.
For example, we may obtain consent using standard permissions available on your device that apply to the Mentor App.
eDriving only collects your personal information if you have provided your consent in your capacity as a private individual using one or more of eDrivingâs Services, or in your capacity as an employee of a company who is providing you access to one or more of eDrivingâs Services:

Other Automatically Collected Device Information: When you install and activate the Mentor by eDrivingSM application (the âAppâ) on your mobile device, it collects the following information.

Location, travel and route information: When you are on a driving trip, the App gathers location and route information in the form of GPS signals.&nbsp.
This is NOT shared with your organization.

Information about the device: The App collects eDriving specific webpage views, IP address, browser type, and operating system information.


My Work Team Circles

If your organization has opted to use Mentor My Work Team Circles, your immediate team will see your 7-day rolling FICO Safe Driving Score and summary of events (shown only as red, amber, green â not the number of events).&nbsp.
The circle automatically includes all team members, as directed by the Data Controller.&nbsp.
If you wish to stop sharing summary information with your colleagues, you can set this by going to âEditâ at the top right of the screen and switch sharing to âoffâ.&nbsp.

The app does NOT record data, including driving activities and location, at any other time.
