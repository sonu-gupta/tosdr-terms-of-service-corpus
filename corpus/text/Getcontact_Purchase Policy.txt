Getverify LDA (âGetcontactâ âour,â âwe,â or âusâ) offers certain enhanced features of the Services which we offer for purchase as a monthly or annual subscription (âSubscriptionâ).
A description of features associated with any of our Subscriptions are available via our Services.
When you purchase a Subscription (each, a âTransactionâ), we may request from you to supply additional information relevant to your Transaction, such as your credit card number, the expiration date of your credit card and your address(es) for the purpose of billing and delivery (such information, âPayment Informationâ).
We do not store or process any Payment Information.
Each Transaction and Payment Information is tokenised by our fully licensed third party payment service providers to ensure the highest standards of payment security.
You represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use all payment method(s) represented by any such Payment Information.
The amounts due and payable by you for a Transaction through the Services will be presented to you before you place your order.&nbsp.
If you choose to initiate a Transaction via the Services, you authorise us to transfer your Payment Information to our third party service providers so we can complete your Transaction and agree (a) to pay the applicable fees and any taxes.
(b) that Getcontact via our partner payment service providers may charge your credit card or third party payment processing account, including, but not limited to, your account with the app store or distribution platform (like the Apple App Store or Google Play) where the App is made available (each, an âApp Providerâ), for verification, pre-authorisation and payment purposes.
and (c) to bear any additional charges that your App Provider, bank or other financial service provider may levy on you as well as any taxes or fees that may apply to your order.&nbsp.
A list of all our third party payment providers can be found in our Privacy Statement.
Your order is not binding on Getcontact until accepted and confirmed by Getcontact.
All payments made are non-refundable and non-transferable except as expressly provided in these Terms.
If you have any concerns or objections regarding charges, you agree to raise them with us first and you agree not to cancel or reject any credit card or third party payment processing charges unless you have made a reasonable attempt at resolving the matter directly with Getcontact.
Getcontact reserves the right to not process or to cancel your order in certain circumstances, for example, if your credit card is declined, if we suspect the request or order is fraudulent, or in other circumstances Getcontact deems appropriate in its sole discretion.
Getcontact also reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to take steps to verify your identity in connection with your order.
You may need to provide additional information to verify your identity before completing your Transaction (such information is included within the definition of Payment Information).
Getcontact will either not charge you or refund the charges for orders that we do not process or cancel.


Subscriptions Automatically Renew Until You Cancel &amp.
How to Cancel Your Subscription


All amounts are payable and charged: (i) for one-off purchase (e.g.
annual Subscription), at the time you place your order.
and (ii) For monthly or annual subscriptions, at the beginning of the subscription and, because each such subscription renews automatically for an additional period equal in length to the expiring subscription term until you cancel it, at the time of each renewal until you cancel, using the Payment Information you have provided.
You must cancel your monthly or annual Subscription before it renews to avoid the billing of the fees for the next Subscription period.
If you purchase your Subscription via our website, you can cancel the renewal of your subscription at any time by contacting us by email at support@getcontact.com.
If you purchase your Subscription via an App Provider, you can cancel the renewal of your subscription at any time with the App Provider.
You will not receive a refund for the fees you already paid for your current subscription period and you will continue to receive the Services ordered until the end of your current Subscription period.


Changes to Subscriptions


Getcontact reserves the right to change its pricing terms for Subscriptions at any time and Getcontact will notify you in advance of such changes becoming effective.
Changes to the pricing terms will not apply retroactively and will only apply for Subscription renewals after such changed pricing terms have been communicated to you.
If you do not agree with the changes to our pricing terms then you may choose not to renew your Subscription in accordance with our most up to date Terms of Service.
