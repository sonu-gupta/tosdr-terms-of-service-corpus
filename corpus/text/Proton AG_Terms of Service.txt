bulk signups, a large number of free accounts created by a single organization or individual).
Abusive registrations of aliases for third-party services is also not acceptable.
Free accounts must also only be created and maintained by their effective users (e.g.
it is not acceptable to create accounts in anyone elseâs name and later transfer credentials to that third party).
Any Account found to be committing the above-mentioned activities will be immediately suspended.
Trading or selling a Proton Mail account to a third party is prohibited and the Company reserves the right to suspend infringing accounts.
This rule does not apply to our Lifetime Accounts, which can be sold or traded exclusively through the Company.
The Company has no obligation to store or forward the contents of terminated accounts.
We also have no obligation to store messages or contents for accounts that exceed their storage quotas.
The Company reserves the right to terminate Accounts immediately if a fraudulent payment is detected, such as a payment with a stolen credit card.
The Company may also terminate Accounts which are being used for illegal activities that are not listed in the present section, particularly in response to orders from the competent authorities informing of such illegal activity.
Although it is not current practice, the Company reserves the right to suspend or delete free Accounts that have been inactive for a consecutive period of three months or more.
However, our current inactive Account policy is not as strict.Limited warranties and liabilityThe Company does not make any warranty about the reliability of the Services or guarantee the security of user data, despite best efforts.

Service level agreement (SLA)For users with Proton for Business Accounts, the Company aims to provide Service availability of 99.95% or better.
If downtime in any month exceeds 0.05% of that month, the Company will credit the userâs Account.
Service credits are applied at the userâs request and will apply toward the balance due at the end of the next billing cycle (either monthly or yearly).
 The Company calculates service credits in the following way:

 If the monthly uptime is less than 99.95% but equal to or greater than 99.0%, the service credit is equal to 10% of the Serviceâs monthly cost;
If the monthly uptime is less than 99.0%, the service credit is equal to 30% of the Serviceâs cost.

Some performance issues are excluded from downtime calculations, such as:

Issues caused by factors outside of the Companyâs reasonable control;
Issues that resulted from any actions or inaction by a user or a third party;
Issues that resulted from the userâs equipment and/or third-party equipment (not within the primary control of the Company).
For the avoidance of any doubt, the Company does not provide any internet or network services and any performance issues related to that type of services shall be deemed not in the primary control of the Company;
Issues that arise from the Companyâs suspension or termination of rights to use the Service in accordance with the Terms;
Downtime caused by reasonable scheduled maintenance that is announced in advance.
