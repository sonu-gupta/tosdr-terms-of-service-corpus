If you are a United States resident or otherwise make any claim against Rovio in the United States, you expressly agree that any legal claim, dispute or other controversy between you and Rovio arising out of or otherwise relating in any way to Services, including controversies relating to the applicability, enforceability or validity of any provision of these TOS or RovioÂ´s Privacy Policy (collectively âDisputesâ), shall be resolved in confidential binding arbitration conducted before one commercial arbitrator from the American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ), rather than in a court, as described herein.
The arbitration will be governed by the AAAâs commercial arbitration rules and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes (collectively âRules and Proceduresâ).
You acknowledge that you are voluntarily and knowingly forfeiting your right to a trial by jury and to otherwise proceed in a lawsuit in state or federal court.

Payment of arbitration costs will be governed by the AAAâs fee schedule, unless you are able to show that your portion will be prohibitive as compared to litigation costs, in which case Rovio will pay as much of your arbitration costs as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to litigation costs.
Rovio also reserves the right in its sole and exclusive discretion to assume responsibility for all arbitration costs imposed by the AAA.
Each party agrees to pay its own attorneysâ fees and expenses unless there is a governing statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid attorneysâ fees and expenses.
The arbitration may be conducted in Los Angeles, California or, upon your request, in the city closest to you location where AAA maintains an office.
The arbitratorâs award shall be final and binding on you and Rovio and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
For more information on AAA, its Rules and Procedures, and how to file an arbitration claim, you may call AAA at 800-778-7879 or visit the AAA website at www.adr.org.
As an exception to the binding arbitration rule, to the extent the Dispute arises from:

A violation of RovioÂ´s intellectual property rights in any manner;
Any claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, unauthorized use or a violation of the United States Computer Fraud and Abuse Act or Section âCode of conductâ of these TOS.
and
Any claim for equitable relief;

then both parties agree that a party may seek injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any court with jurisdiction over the other party.
In addition to the foregoing, either party may assert an individual action in small claims court for Claims that are within the scope of such courtâs jurisdiction in lieu of arbitration.
To the extent permissible under applicable law, all Disputes shall be resolved by binding confidential arbitration on an individual basis.
You expressly agree that no other Disputes shall be consolidated or joined with your Dispute, whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise.&nbsp.
You and Rovio agree that there is no right or authority for any dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures, there is no right or authority for any dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity or as a private attorney general, and no arbitration shall be joined with any other arbitration.

You may opt out of this obligation to arbitrate.
If you do so, neither you nor Rovio can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding.
To opt out, you must notify Rovio in writing within 30 days of the date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision.
You must use this address to opt out: Rovio Entertainment Corporation, ATTN: Legal Department, Keilaranta 7, 02150 Espoo, Finland.
