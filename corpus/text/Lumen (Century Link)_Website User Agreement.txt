Dispute Resolution.



Dispute Process
.
Most concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by contacting our customer service department or through the designated CenturyLink Website.
If our customer service department is unable to resolve a complaint you may have to your satisfaction or if CenturyLink has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally, then we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or small claims court, instead of in courts of general jurisdiction.


Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes.
You and CenturyLink agree to arbitrate any and all claims, controversies or disputes of any kind ("Claims") against each other, including but not limited to Claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or any CenturyLink Products, billings, or advertisings.
This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted and applies to, among others: all Claims regardless of whether they are based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory.
all Claims that arose prior to your use of a CenturyLink Website or prior to this Agreement.
all Claims that arise after you ceased using a CenturyLink Website or after the termination of this Agreement.
all Claims you may bring against CenturyLink's employees, agents, affiliates or other representatives.
and all Claims that CenturyLink may bring against you.
The sole exception to this arbitration agreement is that either you or CenturyLink may, in the alternative, bring Claims in a small claims court having valid jurisdiction.
You and CenturyLink agree, however, that neither CenturyLink nor you will join any Claim with a claim or claims of any other person(s) or entity(ies), whether in a lawsuit, arbitration, or any other proceeding.
You and CenturyLink agree that no Claims will be asserted in any representative capacity on behalf of anyone else, that no Claims will be resolved on a class-wide or collective basis, that no arbitrator or arbitration forum will have jurisdiction to adjudicate or determine any Claims on a class-wide or collective basis, and that no rules for class-wide or collective arbitration will apply.

(1) 
Arbitration Procedure.
A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice" or "Notice of Dispute").
The Notice to CenturyLink should be addressed to: 1801 California Street, Suite 900, Denver, Colorado 80202, Attn: Legal Department ("Notice Address").
The Notice must: (1) describe the nature and basis of the Claim.
and (2) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand").
If CenturyLink and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the Claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, you or CenturyLink may commence an arbitration proceeding.
A single arbitrator engaged in the practice of law will conduct the arbitration.
The arbitration will be filed with the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), the arbitrator will be selected according to the AAA's procedures and the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.
Â§Â§ 1-16 ("FAA"), and Claims will be resolved pursuant to this Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes provision and the AAA's rules in effect when the Claim is filed.
Claims also may be referred to another arbitration organization if you and CenturyLink agree in writing or to an arbitrator appointed pursuant to section 5 of the FAA.
The arbitration will be confidential, but you may notify any government authority of your Claim.
Arbitration hearings will take place in the federal judicial district of the location where you reside.

(2) 
Arbitrator's Authority.
The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement, and the arbitrator's authority is limited to Claims between you and CenturyLink alone.
The arbitrator has no authority to join or consolidate Claims, or adjudicate joined or consolidated Claims, unless you and CenturyLink agree in writing.
All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes provision are for the court to decide.
The arbitrator's decision and award is final and binding, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction.
The arbitrator can award the same damages and relief that a court can award, including the award of declaratory or injunctive relief.
provided, however, that any declaratory or injunctive relief may only be in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual Claim.

(3) 
Costs of Arbitration.
You will be responsible for paying your share of any arbitration fees (including filing, administrative, hearing or other fees), but only up to the amount of the filing fees you would have incurred if you had brought the Claim in court.
We will be responsible for any additional arbitration fees.
You are responsible for all additional costs that you incur in the arbitration, including, but not limited to, fees for attorneys or expert witnesses.
If the arbitration proceeding is decided in CenturyLink's favor, you shall reimburse CenturyLink for the fees and costs advanced to you only up to the extent awardable in a judicial proceeding.
If the arbitration proceeding is determined in your favor, you will not be required to reimburse CenturyLink for any fees and costs advanced by CenturyLink.
If a party elects to appeal an award, the prevailing party in the appeal shall be entitled to recover all reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in that appeal.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes p rovision, CenturyLink will pay all fees and costs that it is required by law to pay.

(4) 
Changes.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you agree that if CenturyLink makes any future change to this Dispute Resolution provision (other than a change to the Notice Address listed above) during the period of time that you are using or accessing CenturyLink Websites, you may reject any such change by sending CenturyLink written notice within 30 days of receiving notice of the change.
Your rejection notice must be sent to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above.
By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision.
No changes, however, that are made to this provision after either party has submitted a Notice of Dispute shall be effective as to your and CenturyLink's pending dispute and/or arbitration.

(5) 
Governing Law, Enforcement, and Waivers.
The Federal Arbitration Act, and not state law, applies to this Dispute Resolution provision and its provisions and, governs all questions of whether a Claim is subject to arbitration.
If any portion of this Dispute Resolution provision is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of the provision remains in full force and effect.
If for any reason, the above provisions on arbitration are held unenforceable or are found not to apply to a Claim, you and CenturyLink waive the right to a jury trial on your respective Claims, and waive any right to pursue any Claims on a class or consolidated basis or in a representative capacity.
If any party files a judicial or administrative action asserting a Claim that is subject to arbitration and another party successfully stays such action or compels arbitration, the party filing that action must pay the other party's costs and expenses incurred in seeking such stay or compelling arbitration, including attorneys' fees.
