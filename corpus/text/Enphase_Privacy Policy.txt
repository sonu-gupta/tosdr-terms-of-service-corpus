Once the IQ Gateway is connected to the internet, it begins reporting your energy production, consumption, and site information to us and will continue to do so as long as it is online.

Information We Obtain from Social Media Platforms. We may maintain pages for Enphase on social media platforms, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Google, YouTube, Instagram, and other third party platforms.
When you visit or interact with our pages on those platforms, the platform providerâs privacy policy will apply to your interactions and their collection, use and processing of your personal information.
You or the platforms may provide us with information through the platform, and we will treat such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Information We Obtain from Other Third Parties. We may receive personal information about you from third-party sources.
For example, a business partner, such as a solar energy system installer, a grid services aggregator, or a utility, may share your contact and energy-related information with us if you have expressed interest in learning specifically about our products or services, or the types of products or services we offer.
Similarly, a business partner may share profile or registration information if they assist you in setting up an Enphase Account.
We may obtain your personal information (including the categories listed above under âInformation you Provide to Usâ) from other third parties, such as marketing partners, publicly-available sources, existing Enphase customers, and data providers.
In certain circumstances, Enphase collects your personal information from your installer at your direction.
These third partiesâ privacy policies govern their sharing of information with Enphase and their other processing, so we advise you to contact the third parties for further information.

and information about your use of and actions on the Service, such as pages or screens you viewed, how long you spent on a page or screen, navigation paths between pages or screens, information about your activity on a page or screen, access times, and length of access.
Our service providers and business partners may collect this type of information over time and across third-party websites and mobile applications.
If it is an Enphase advertising partner that has collected your personal information, its privacy policy will govern its use of that information.
For more information on how we use your information, as collected in the manner described in this paragraph, please see the section below titled "To display advertisements."
On our webpages, this information is collected using cookies, browser web storage (also known as locally stored objects, or âLSOsâ), web beacons, and similar technologies.
Our emails may also contain web beacons.
In our mobile application, we may collect this information directly or through our use of third-party software development kits (âSDKsâ).
SDKs may enable third parties to collect information directly from our mobile application.
Additionally, see our Cookie Policy for more information.

Referrals. Users of the Service may have the opportunity to refer other individuals to us.
If you are an existing user, you may only submit a referral to us if you have permission to provide the referralâs contact information to us so that we may contact them.
How We Use Your Personal Information

To Send Marketing and Promotional Communications. We may send Enphase-related marketing communications as permitted by law.
Recipients of our marketing communications will have the ability to opt-out of our marketing and promotional communications as described in the Opt-out of Marketing Communications section below.

To Display Advertisements. We may work with advertising partners to display advertisements on the Service or elsewhere online.
Our third-party advertising partners (e.g.
Google Ads, Google Analytics, Facebook, and others) may automatically collect information about you when you use the Service through methods such as cookies and other tracking technologies (as further described below).
Such third-party advertisers may use such information about you to display advertisements on the Service or elsewhere online, and such advertising may be targeted to you based on your use of the Service or your activity elsewhere online.
To learn more about your choices in connection with advertisements delivered to you by our third-party advertising partners, please see the section below titled âTargeted online advertising.â
Targeted online advertising includes displaying advertisements on social media through programs offered by partners like Facebook Lookalike Audience.
Facebook Lookalike Audience enables us to target users of Facebook who âlook likeâ our existing or prospective customers.
A lookalike audience uses an existing custom/tailored audience group as a "seed," which may include identifiers that we provide them like your email, or online identifiers automatically collected by them like your usage information or device data.
To this end and as permitted by law, we may transfer your contact data to Facebook, so that an audience of similar users is built on that basis by Facebook.
Lookalike audiences help reach people who are similar to you for purposes such as customer acquisition, site registration and brand awareness.
We do not provide data subject to the GDPR for Facebook Lookalike Audience.

To Comply with Law. We use your personal information as we believe necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable laws, lawful requests, and legal process, such as to respond to subpoenas or requests from government authorities.

For Protection of Rights, Fraud Prevention, and Safety. We may use your personal information and disclose it to law enforcement, government authorities, and private parties as we believe necessary or appropriate to: (a) protect our, your or othersâ rights, privacy, safety or property (including by making and defending legal claims).
(b) enforce the terms and conditions that govern the Service.
and (c) protect, investigate and deter against fraudulent, harmful, unauthorized, unethical or illegal activity.

With Your Consent. In certain circumstances, we may specifically ask for you to consent to the collection, use or sharing of your personal information, such as when required by law or in connection with a specific offering in which you have elected to participate.

To Create Anonymous, Aggregated or De-identified Data. We may create anonymous, aggregated or de-identified data from your personal information and other individuals whose personal information we collect.
We make personal information into anonymous, aggregated or de-identified data by removing information that makes the data personally identifiable to you.
We may use this anonymous, aggregated or de-identified data and share it with third parties for our lawful business purposes, including to analyze and improve the Service and promote our business.
How We Share Your Personal Information
We share your personal information as described below with the following entities.

With Your Consent. We may share your personal information with your consent or as otherwise instructed by you.

To Fulfill Your Request. In order to carry out our obligation or contract to you, or fulfill your request, we may need to share your personal information.
For example, if you order a product then we need to share your contact information with our shipping partner.
if you wish to get a quote from an installer then we will need to provide them your information.
or if you wish to enroll in a Grid Services program then we may need to provide your contact and system information with a utility and/or aggregator.

Service Providers. We may share your personal information with third party companies and individuals that provide services on our behalf or help us operate our business (such as payment processors, customer support, hosting, analytics, email delivery, marketing, database management, as well as permit and rebate application preparation and submission services.)

Third-Party Energy Providers. At your direction, we may share or instruct our service providers to share your personal information with third-party energy provider partners or enable third-party energy provider partners to collect information directly via our Service.
For example, if you wish to sign up with a third-party energy provider (such as a utility company or an energy aggregator) or submit an application to a utility or governmental authority, we may share your information with such provider.
This may include, without limitation, your name, email address, system location information, meter identifier information, and augmented revenue grade meter data.

Installers and Energy Partners. We may share your information with installers or other energy partners for purposes of introducing you.

This sharing of information is done upon your written consent. 

Social Media Networks and Advertisers. Subject to your marketing preferences, we share information with social media networks, such as Facebook, and advertisers to present our ads to you on other platforms.
For example, we may share with Facebook actions that you take on our website such as your visits to our website, your interactions on our website, use of Facebook tools such as Facebook Connect, and information collected from cookies or similar technologies including the Facebook pixel.
This allows us to measure the effectiveness of our advertising, improve our marketing practices, and helps us deliver more relevant advertising to you (including on social media such as Facebook): for this activity, we are a joint data controller with Facebook.

We will tell you what information you must provide to receive the Service by designating it as required at the time of collection or through other appropriate means.
Other Sites, Mobile Applications and Services
The Service may contain links to other websites, mobile applications, and other online services operated by third parties.
These links are not an endorsement of, or representation that we are affiliated with, any third party.
In addition, our content may be included on web pages or in mobile applications or online services that are not associated with us.
We do not control third party websites, mobile applications or online services, and we are not responsible for their actions.
Other websites and services follow different rules regarding the collection, use and sharing of your personal information.
We encourage you to read the privacy policies of the other websites and mobile applications and online services you use.
Security Practices
The security of your personal information is important to us.
We employ a number of organizational, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the personal information we collect.
However, security risk is inherent in all internet and information technologies and we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information.
Retention
We retain personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, to establish or defend legal claims, or for fraud prevention purposes.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
When we no longer require the personal information we have collected about you, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
If we anonymize your personal information (so that it can no longer be associated with you), we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
International Data Transfers
We are headquartered in the United States and may have service providers in other countries.
Accordingly, your personal information may be transferred to the United States, or other locations outside of your state, province, or country, where privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your state, province, or country.
European Union users should read the important information provided below about transfer of personal information outside of the European Union.
Children
The Service is not directed to, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from, anyone under the age of 18.
If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should contact us.
We will delete such information from our files as soon as reasonably practicable.
We encourage parents with concerns to contact us.
Changes to this Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time.
If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by updating the date of this Privacy Policy and posting it on the Service.
We may, and if required by law will, also provide notification of changes to this Privacy Policy using additional methods that we believe are reasonably likely to reach you, such as via e-mail (if you have an Enphase Account where we have your contact information).
Any modifications to this Privacy Policy will be effective upon our posting the new terms and/or upon implementation of the new changes on the Service (or as otherwise indicated at the time of posting).
In all cases, your continued use of the Service after the posting or effective date as stated in the notification of any modified Privacy Policy indicates your acceptance of the terms of the modified Privacy Policy.
How to Contact Us
You may direct any questions or comments about this Policy or our privacy practices to our privacy office and your communication will be handled by our privacy team (including what is sometimes referred to as a Grievance Officer, Data Protection Officer, or Privacy Officer).

Important Information for United States Residents
This section applies only to United States residents.
It describes how we collect, use and share Personal Information of United States residents in operating our business, and their rights with respect to that Personal Information.
For purposes of this section, âPersonal Informationâ has the broadest interpretation of that term or any analogous term in any of the California Privacy Rights Act, Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, Colorado Privacy Act, Utah Consumer Privacy Act, and Connecticut Data Privacy Act.

Your privacy rights. Depending on your state of residence, you may have the rights listed below.
However, these rights are not absolute, and in certain cases we may decline your request as permitted by law.



Information. You can request the following information about how we have collected and used your Personal Information during the past 12 months:


The categories of Personal Information that we have collected.


The categories of sources from which we collected Personal Information.


The business or commercial purpose for collecting and/or selling Personal Information.


The categories of third parties with whom we share Personal Information.


Whether we have disclosed your Personal Information for a business purpose, and if so, the categories of Personal Information received by each category of third-party recipient.


Whether weâve sold your Personal Information, and if so, the categories of Personal Information received by each category of third-party recipient.





Access/Data Portability. You can request a copy of the Personal Information that we have collected about you during the past 12 months, including in a format that is easily understandable and, to the extent technically feasible, in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.



Deletion. You can ask us to delete the Personal Information that we have collected from you.



Opt-out of Sales. In conducting the Service, we do not âsellâ your Personal Information in the traditional sense of transferring Personal Information in return âfor monetary or other valuable consideration" without your specific consent or instruction.
We may share identifying information and performance data about your system to developers using our API, or to users of the Enphase App, upon your written consent.
Because your consent and actions in relation to those developers/users are a deliberate interaction directing us to provide this information to the developer/user we do not consider this sharing a âsale,â but because we are not always privy to the consent that you provide the developer/user or the nature of those interactions, in some cases our transfer of data may be classified as a âsaleâ under law.
We also may provide your personal information to installers or their partners for the purpose of introducing that installer or partner to you, but only when you consent or instruct us to do so.
Additionally, in certain circumstances, for example when the installer of your existing system is no longer available, we will pass on your contact information and site information to a follow-on installer to service your system at your direction.
You may nonetheless submit a request to opt-out.
In addition, if you direct us not to sell your Personal Information, we will consider it a request pursuant to Californiaâs âShine the Lightâ law to stop sharing your personal information covered by that law with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.



Opt-out of Sharing. We use certain advertising services that help deliver an improved advertising experience to you, such as providing interest-based ads to you.
We allow these services to collect information from our website users (specifically, online identifiers and browsing activity) and they use this data to serve interest-based ads to you.
You may submit a request to opt-out of such sharing.



Correction. You may request that we update or correct inaccuracies in your Personal Information.



Appeal. If we decline to take action on your data subject request for any reason, we will provide you a written statement of the reasons why.
you are entitled to an appeal by contacting us with information relevant to the issue, or by contacting your state Attorney General or other privacy protection agency, which may take up the matter depending on your state of residence.



Nondiscrimination. You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination in the form of legally prohibited increases in the price or decreases in the quality of our Service.



How to Exercise Your Rights

You may exercise your privacy rights by any of the methods listed in the âHow to Contact Usâ section above.
We reserve the right to confirm your residence to process your requests and will need to confirm your identity to process your requests to exercise your information, access/data portability, or deletion rights.
We generally seek to validate your request without collecting any additional personal information and seek to rely for example on information we already have in our possession -- the email address from which you sent the request and/or a recent monthsâ energy usage.
Consistent with law, you may designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf.
To designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf, you must provide a valid power of attorney, the requesterâs valid government-issued identification, and the authorized agentâs valid government-issued identification.
We cannot process your request if you do not provide us with sufficient detail to allow us to understand and respond to it.
