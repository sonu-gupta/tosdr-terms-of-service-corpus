         Right of Withdrawal for Consumers 
ï»¿Insofar as you are a natural person and enter into contracts for the supply of goods or the provision of services for purposes which cannot mainly be attributed to either your commercial or self-employed professional activity (= a consumer in terms of Section 13 of the German Civil Code - BGB), you are entitled to a statutory right of withdrawal described in more detail below.
If, on the other hand, you are an entrepreneur within the meaning of Section 14 BGB and exercise your commercial or self-employed activity upon conclusion of the contract, there is no such right of withdrawal.
