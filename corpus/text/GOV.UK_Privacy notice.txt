 Privacy notice GOV.UK (or www.gov.uk) is provided by the Government Digital Service (GDS), part of the Cabinet Office.
Cabinet Office is the data controller for pages starting with www.gov.uk - for example, www.gov.uk/pip.
If you follow a link to a service provided by another government department, agency or local authority, that organisation will:

be the data controller
be responsible for processing any data you share with them
publish and manage their own privacy notice with details of how to contact them


Example

If you make a claim for Universal Credit www.universal-credit.service.gov.uk, the Department for Work and Pensions will be the responsible controller.
The serviceâs own privacy notice will apply.
A data controller determines how and why personal data is processed.
For more information, read the Cabinet Officeâs entry in the Data Protection Public Register. What data we collect The personal data we collect from you includes:

questions, queries or feedback you leave, including your email address if you contact GOV.UK

We do not store your personal information through Google Analytics (for example your name or address).

We continuously test and monitor our data protection controls to make sure theyâre effective and to detect any weaknesses. Why we need your data We collect information through Google Analytics to see how you use the site and government digital services.

All personal data is stored in the European Economic Area (EEA).
Data collected by Google Analytics may be transferred outside the EEA for processing. How we protect your data and keep it secure We are committed to doing all that we can to keep your data secure.
We have set up systems and processes to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure of your data - for example, we protect your data using varying levels of encryption.
