 Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
USE OF THE SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.
NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY NINTENDO OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES CREATES A WARRANTY.
THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS-IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.
NINTENDO DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTY OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NINTENDO AND ITS AFFILIATED COMPANIES, LICENSEES, LICENSORS AND CONTRACTORS ("NINTENDO PARTIES") WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR ACCESS, USE, MISUSE, OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, EVEN IF NINTENDO HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
IN ANY CASE, THE NINTENDO PARTIESâ AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU IN CONNECTION WITH ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE SERVICES IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT (IF ANY) YOU ACTUALLY PAID FOR THE SERVICES THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF SUCH CLAIM.
IF A LAW RESTRICTS OUR ABILITY TO LIMIT LIABILITY OR DISCLAIM WARRANTIES, THE LIMITATIONS LISTED ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
IN THAT CASE, WE LIMIT OUR LIABILITY AND DISCLAIM WARRANTIES TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

 Indemnity.

You further agree to indemnify the Nintendo Parties for any Covered Losses arising out of or related to: (a) any Submissions you provide.
(b) your violation of these Terms.
and (c) your violation of any rights of another.
Some jurisdictions limit consumer indemnities, so some or all of the indemnity provisions above may not apply to you.
If you are obligated to indemnify us, we will have the right, in our sole and unfettered discretion, to control any action or proceeding and determine whether we wish to settle it, and if so, on what terms.

 Dispute Resolution.
Binding Individual Arbitration.
Class Action Waiver.


Our consumer service department is available to address any concerns you may have regarding the Services.
You may contact them by phone at 1-800-255-3700, by email at useragreement@noa.nintendo.com, or by regular mail sent to Nintendo of America Inc., Attn: Terms of Use, 4600 150th Ave NE, Redmond, WA 98052 USA.
Most matters are quickly resolved in this manner to our customerâs satisfaction.


Any matter we are unable to resolve and all disputes or claims arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of the Services (each, a "Claim"), with the exception of the matters described in section 13(d) below, shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the provisions of its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes of the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA"), excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.
The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all Claims.
The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.
The arbitratorâs award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they may have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.
They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.
ANY SUCH ARBITRATION SHALL BE CONDUCTED BY THE PARTIES IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES ONLY AND NOT AS A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND THE PARTIES WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO FILE A CLASS ACTION OR SEEK RELIEF ON A CLASS BASIS.
If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in the preceding sentence is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth in this Section 13 shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate Claims.


The rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at +1.800.778.7879.
To the extent the initial filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the initial filing fee for a lawsuit, we will pay the difference in fees.
If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, we will pay all of the actual filing and arbitrator fees for the arbitration, provided your claim is less than $75,000.
The arbitration rules also permit you to recover attorneyâs fees in certain cases.


Section 13(b) does not apply to any Claim (i) in which a party is attempting to protect its intellectual property rights (such as its patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, or moral rights, but not including its privacy or publicity rights), or (ii) that may be brought in small claims court.


30-Day Right to Opt Out.
You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Section 13 by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: Nintendo of America Inc., Attn: CS Admin, 4600 150th Ave NE, Redmond, WA 98052 within 30 days of the start of your use of the Services.
If you send this notice, then Section 13 will not apply to either party.
If you do not send this notice, then you agree to be bound by this Section 13.


You and Nintendo agree that the state or federal courts in King County, Washington have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals of an arbitration award and over any suit between the parties not subject to arbitration.
Any dispute between the parties will be governed by this Agreement and the laws of the State of Washington and applicable United States law, without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that may provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction.



 Miscellaneous.
If any part of these Terms is determined to be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that part will be severed from these Terms, and the rest of the Terms will remain intact.
If we do not enforce any provision of these Terms, that will not be considered a waiver of our rights.
Any waiver of these Terms must be obtained in a written document signed by an authorized representative of Nintendo.

 Changes to these Terms We may change these Terms from time to time.
If we do, weâll provide notice of any changes, such as by posting the most recent version on our Services and updating the "Last Updated" date above.
You can view the latest Terms any time by clicking the "Terms of Use" link at the bottom of the applicable webpage.
We encourage you to check for updates regularly.
Your continued use of the Services following any notice we provide will confirm that you have agreed to the amended Terms.
If you do not agree to the amended Terms, you must stop using the Services.
