This means that you do not have

any obligation to give Us your personal data and you can use the Services without

giving Us any of your personal data.

4.
LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL DATA

4.1.
We process your personal data because it is necessary for the fulfilment of a contract

concluded between you and Us for providing you the Services (see clauses 3.1.a) and

3.1.b)).
or for taking steps at your request prior to entering into a contract (see

clause 3.1.b)).
In such a case the legal basis for processing data is the contract

concluded between you and Us.
or you request prior to entering into a contract.

4.2.
We also process your personal data to improve the Platform and the Avatar

generation quality (see clause 3.1.c)).

your personal data is your prior consent.

not process your personal data for that purpose.
You may at any time withdraw your

consent by sending a respective notice to Our e-mail at support@wolf3d.io.

Withdrawal of consent does not affect your right to use the Services and the

Platform.

4.3.
Furthermore, We process your personal data (i.e.
use your e-mail address) for

sending you information about updates to the Platform and to uses of the Avatar (see

clause 3.1.d)).
But We do it only in the case where you have voluntarily given Us

your e-mail address.
The legal basis for that is Our legitimate interest to keep you

the in loop of any advancements which the Platform may get (e.g.
new customization

options, etc.), any news about the Platform and any new use cases for the Avatar.

You always have the possibility to unsubscribe from such e-mails by clicking on a link

which is provided under each e-mail.
If you unsubscribe, We will no longer send you

such e-mails.

4.4.
We also process your personal data for enforcing and defending Our legal rights under

legitimate interest pursued by Us (see clause 3.1.e)).
It is Our legitimate interest to

enforce and defend Our legal rights as We see it necessary.

4.5.
Also, We process personal data for complying with legal or regulatory obligations or

requests (see clause 3.1.f)) as processing is necessary for compliance with the legal

obligations to which We are subject to.
