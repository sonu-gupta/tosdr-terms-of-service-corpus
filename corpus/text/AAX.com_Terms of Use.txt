Therefore the risk of loss in trading Digital Assets and derivatives linked to Digital Assets may be substantial and losses may occur over a short period of time.
6.2.The value of Digital Assets may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange cash currency or exchange of one Digital Asset for another, which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular Digital Assets, should the market for that Digital Assets disappear.6.3.Trading in derivatives linked to Digital Assets exposes you to the following risks and loss that you may suffer:
You may suffer a loss as a result of a position moving against you.
If you hold a long position and the Digital Assets price declines or if you hold a short position and the Digital Assets price increases, you will lose all of your Digital Assets and initial margin in respect of the Trade;
You may suffer a loss in the event you are unable to close out of a position because there is no demand to take the other side of that trade;
You may suffer a loss because of a malfunction of the Platform, for example resulting from scheduled or unscheduled downtimes, matching system failure, database failure, cryptocurrency transfer or storage failure, failure or malfunction of the API, hacker attacks or other failure or malfunction.
6.4.You should be aware that you may sustain a total loss of the funds in your Account, and that under certain market conditions, you may find it difficult or impossible to liquidate a position.
You should, therefore, carefully consider whether such risk is suitable for you in light of your circumstances and financial resources.6.5.Transactions in Digital Assets may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable.
The nature of Digital Assets may lead to an increased risk of fraud or cyber-attacks, and may mean that technological difficulties experienced by the Platform may prevent the access to or use of your Digital Assets.6.6.Digital Assets are not legal tender and are not backed by the government.
Deposits into your Account may not be considered deposits under local laws, rules, or regulations in your jurisdiction and therefore not subject to deposit insurance protection or investor protection.6.7.Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of Digital Assets.
You may suffer a loss in the event we are required to restrict or terminate elements of our Service in response to regulatory action.7.No Financial Advice7.1.AAX does not give advice or recommendations regarding Digital Assets, including the suitability and appropriateness of, and investment strategies for Digital Assets.
