We may Process your Personal Data by placing or reading Cookies and similar technologies.
For more information, please see our Cookie Policy below.
This policy provides detailed information about how and when we use cookies.
This cookie policy applies to the Consensus products or services websites that link to this policy or incorporates it by reference.

What is a cookie?

A cookie is a piece of data stored on your computer and tied to information about you.
By using and browsing our Sites, you consent to the use by us and third parties of cookies and other technologies in accordance with this Policy.

What are the different types of cookies?

First party cookies are our own cookies set by our Site, controlled by us, and used to provide information about the usage of our Site.
Third party cookies are cookies from any other domain.
Some of our business partners (for example, third-party advertisers) may use cookies on the Site, in emails or in our advertisements on other websites to allow them to deliver the services they are providing.
In order to create a user-friendly experience, some of our third-party promotions and advertisements are designed to automatically transmit usersâ information onto the third partyâs landing page when you choose to âclickâ upon a third partyâs advertisement or promotion.
We do not control these third parties or their use of cookies.
As such, this Policy covers the use of cookies by the Company and does not cover the use of cookies by any third-party advertisers.
Please check the websites of those third parties for details on how they use cookies.

How long do cookies stay on your computer?

Two types of cookies may be used on the Site, session cookies and persistent cookies.
Session cookies are temporary cookies that remain in your browser or device until you leave the site.
they are deleted from your device once you leave the Service.
Persistent cookies are small files stored on your hard drive until you delete them or until they reach their expiry date.
These may, for example, be used to remember your preferences when you use the Site, recognize you on your return, and enhance your experience on the Site (see more about profiles below).
Use of a persistent cookie is not linked to any personally identifiable information while on the Site except if you choose to store your user names and PINs so that you do not have to enter them each time you access your accounts.
Then, a persistent cookie will be stored on your computer, which is linked to your account information.
If you reject the persistent cookie, you may still use the Site but you will be limited in some areas of it.

How do we use cookies?
We may use cookies for the following purposes (either on our own or by using third party services): 

Authentication and Preferences: Cookies can be used to recognize you when you visit our Sites, remember your preferences (such as languages and communication preferences), and customize your experience with using our Sites and Services.

Security: Cookies may enable and support our security features and to help us detect malicious activity.

Advertising: Cookies allow us to bring you advertising both on and off our Sites.
We may also use a cookie to learn whether someone who saw an ad later visited and took an action on the advertiserâs site.
Similarly, our partners may use a cookie to determine whether weâve shown an ad and how it performed, or provide us with information about how you interact with ads.
We may also work with a partner to show you an ad on or off our Sites, such as after you have visited a partnerâs site or application.
Analytics: We use cookies to understand, improve, and research products, features, and services, including when you access our Sites from other websites, applications, or devices such as your mobile device.
Geo-Location Information: Some devices allow applications to access real-time location-based information (for example, GPS).
Some photos or other contact you place within our Service may contain recorded location information.
We may use this information to optimize your experience.
Also, some of the information we collect from a device, for example IP address, can sometimes be used to approximate a deviceâs location.
Flash Cookies: We may, in certain situations, use Adobe Flash Player to deliver special content, such as video clips or animation.
Flash cookies are stored on your device, but they are managed through an interface that is different from the one provided by your web browser.
This means that it is not possible to manage Flash cookies at the browser level in the same way you would manage other types of cookies.
Instead, you can access your Flash management tools from Adobeâs website directly.
Our List of Cookies may provide you with more information on the cookies used on our Sites.
Note, the names of cookies, pixels and other technologies may change over time.

What other technologies do we use?
Log Files

Like most websites, our servers use log files to analyze trends, administer our sites, track userâs movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
The log file information consists of IP addresses, browser type, browser language, referring URL, platform type, etc., and is not linked to identifiable personal information.

Clear Gifs

Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and we may use them to track the online movements of our users.
Clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller than cookies, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by the recipients.
This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.

Profile

We may store information that we collect to create a profile of our users.
A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that detail their viewing preferences.
Consequently, collected information may be tied to usersâ personally identifiable information to improve the content of the Site for users, improve our Services and provide new services that are likely to be of interest to users and to direct pertinent product updates and marketing promotions to users if they have opted in to receive those promotions.
We do not share personally identifiable elements of a userâs profile with other third parties.
User profiles are shared in aggregate form only.

Do Not Track Response

Certain web browsers may allow you to enable a âdo not trackâ option that sends signals to the websites you visit indicating that you do not want your online activities tracked.
This is different from blocking cookies as browsers with the âdo not trackâ option selected may still accept cookies.
Right now, there is no industry standard for how companies should respond to âdo not trackâ signals, although one may be adopted in the future.
We do not respond to âdo not trackâ signals at this time.
If we do so in the future, we will modify this Privacy Policy accordingly.
More information about âdo not trackâ is available at www.allaboutdnt.org.

Can I Change My Cookie Preferences?

Browser settings allow you to choose whether or not to accept cookies or limit certain cookies.
Most browsers also provide functionality that lets you review and erase cookies.
If you use our Sites without changing your browser settings, we will assume that you are happy to receive all cookies on our Sites.
Please be aware that if cookies are disabled, not all features of the Site may operate as intended.
Your mobile operating system may let you opt out from having your information collected or used for interest-based advertising on mobile devices.
You should refer to the instructions provided by your mobile deviceâs manufacturer, but this functionality is usually available in the âSettingsâ section of your device.
You can also stop us from collecting information through our applications by uninstalling our applications.
