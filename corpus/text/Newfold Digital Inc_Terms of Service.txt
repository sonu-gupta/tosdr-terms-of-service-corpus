Applicable Law Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms and/or your use of the Site, including any claim based upon arising from an alleged tort, shall be governed by the substantive laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, regardless of your location, without regard to its conflicts of law provisions.
Arbitration You hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ) in connection with any dispute relating to, concerning or arising out of these Terms.
 The arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator and will be held at the AAA location in Boston, Massachusetts.
 Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAAâs rules, unless otherwise stated in this paragraph.
 In the event you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Endurance will pay as much of your filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.
 The arbitration before the AAA shall proceed solely on an individual basis without the right for any claims to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on bases involving claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of others.
 The arbitratorâs authority to resolve and make written awards is limited to claims between you and us alone.
 Claims may not be joined or consolidated unless agreed to in writing by all parties.
 No arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration.
 If you initiate a litigation or any other proceeding against Endurance in violation of this paragraph, you agree to pay Enduranceâs reasonable costs and attorneysâ fees incurred in connection with its enforcement of this paragraph.
Severability If any portion of these Terms shall be held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, it is the intention of the parties that the remaining provisions or portions (unless otherwise specified) thereof shall constitute their agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof, and all such remaining portions (unless otherwise specified) thereof shall remain in full force and effect.
Miscellaneous Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.
