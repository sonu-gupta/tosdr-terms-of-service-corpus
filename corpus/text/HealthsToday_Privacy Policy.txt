 Privacy Policy Privacy Policy Last revised: March 10, 2020
HealthsToday owns and operates a number of different Website/App on mobile, TV, set top boxes, and other devices (each one or all together referred to as âHealthsToday Website/Appâ).
The Company is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of its user community.
The intent of this privacy policy (âPrivacy Policyâ) is to detail the information the Company might gather about individuals who visit HealthsToday Website/App, how that information is used, and our disclosure practices.
By using any HealthsToday Website/App, you signify that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy as well as our Terms of Use, which are incorporated by reference herein to this Privacy Policy.
Your Consent for Our Collection, Use and Disclosure
Typically, we will seek consent for the collection, use or disclosure of your personal information at the time of collection.
In certain circumstances, consent may be sought after the information has been collected but before use (for example, when we want to use information for a purpose not previously identified).
The form of consent that we seek, including whether it is express or implied, will largely depend on the sensitivity of the personal information and the reasonable expectations of the individual in the circumstances.
You may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice.
If you wish to withdraw your consent at any time, please contact us as set out below.
We will inform you of the implications of withdrawing consent.
We will not, as a condition of the supply of a product or service, require you to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of information beyond that required to fulfill the explicitly specified and legitimate purposes for which the information is being provided.
What Personal Information We Collect
When you sign up for the HealthsToday Website/App you will be required to share information that identifies you personally.
âPersonal Informationâ refers to any information that lets us know the specifics of who you are and which can be used to identify, contact or locate you.
Examples of Personal Information include, without limitation, your first name together with your last name, your credit card number, your mailing address and/or email address, and your phone number.
When We Collect Personal Information
Generally, we collect Personal Information when you provide it to us by signing up on HealthsToday Website/App, filling out surveys or questionnaires, joining our mailing list, corresponding with us, entering one of our sweepstakes or contests, choosing to submit testimonials, stories, photos or the like to the HealthsToday Website/App, or otherwise volunteering information about yourself.
The Company usually collects Personal Information so that it can provide you with the Companyâs goods or services.
The Company may also use your Personal Information for other reasons, including updating you on the Companyâs services, news and special offers (unless you choose to âopt-outâ as described in the âChoice/Opt-outâ section below).
If you donât provide some of the Personal Information the Company asks for (e.g.
your name, your mailing address and/or email address), it may be unable to provide you with the Companyâs goods or services.

The Company collects or may collect some information each time you visit HealthsToday Website/App so we can improve the overall quality of your online experience.

Like most standard servers, we use log files to collect and store this anonymous user information.
