 1.
Our details as the data controller Spark Application (the "App") and Spark for Teams Service (the "Service") are brought to you by Readdle, Inc.
(the "Data Controller" of your personal data).
Consequently, "We", "Us" and "Ours" refers to the Data Controller. 2.
Information we collect and how we use this information We collect certain information about you when you provide it directly to us or use our App and Service.
We only obtain information necessary to provide you with our services.

Email address: As an email client, the core functionality of our Product is based on providing you with the ability to manage your email.
For this reason, Spark services access your email account when you start using the App.
Your email address is a unique identifier of you as a user within our system and allows us to secure your data.
Your email address will also be used as a primary means of communication for us on anything related to changes to the App and Service such as Privacy Policy, Terms of Use, or core functionality of our App or Service.
We may also occasionally contact you for marketing purposes and it will be in our legitimate interests to do so, but you will always have a chance to opt out of such marketing communications for similar products and/or services anytime.
Your email is safe and we do not use it for profiling or targeting.

OAuth login or mail server credentials: Spark requires your credentials to log into your mail system in order to receive, search, compose and send email messages and other communication.
Without such access, our Product wonât be able to provide you with the necessary communication experience.
In order for you to take full advantage of additional App and Service features, such as âsend laterâ, âsync between devicesâ and where allowed by Apple â âpush notificationsâ we use Spark Services.
Without using these services, none of the features mentioned above will function.

Identity of a team you join: To make Spark Services possible, we allow you and your colleagues to create teams within the Service.
It allows you to have a secure space where you share information such as email conversations, shared email drafts, private discussions, or create links to a specific email message.
Team identity is necessary in order to associate you with that specific team as well as secure your information from people who are not a part of your team.
Our system creates a record about the team only when you create one.

Email content while using Spark Services: We allow you and your colleagues to create teams within the Service.
It allows you to have a secure space where you share information such as email conversations, shared email drafts, have private discussions, or create links to specific emails.
This information is stored on our secure servers in order to make Services available to you, so you can collaborate with your teammates around email.

IP address: Core functionality of our Product is based on connection to the Internet.
That is why our App and Service wonât properly function without Internet connection.
Your IP address is a unique identifier that lets you connect to the Internet and our service will log connections for security and troubleshooting purposes.


APNS device token (Apple Push Notification Service): Push notifications allow you to get immediate updates about new emails or private team comments in your email inbox.
Youâre free to enable or disable them during initial App setup or later using your deviceâs system preferences.

App token assigned by us: This token allows us to identify your device in our system and troubleshoot potential issues you might experience.

Device, App version, iOS version information: We need to have this information so the App functions properly on your specific device.

Statistical information with regards to App usage: In order to better understand general app usage patterns, improve the Product and its user experience, Spark collects general statistical information about the usage of the Product.
Collecting such data helps us optimize the App in future updates and such usage does not affect your rights and freedoms and does not disclose any personal data of yourself or your contacts.

Recently accessed email messages, collaboration threads and shared inboxes: We need this information to provide Spark Services to you and your teammates such as private discussions around email, shared drafts, shared email conversations and shared inboxes.
By collecting and storing this data, we are able to present message discussion threads through your Spark app and provide better communication experience with your team.

Some of your email contacts: Spark Smart Notifications will send you push notifications only for important messages from real people.
To block push notifications for promotional newsletters and automatic emails, we need to keep the âwhitelistâ of senders for push notifications.
Weâll sync this âwhitelistâ of contacts to our server to enable Smart Notifications.
If you decide not to use Smart Notifications, we will never sync your email contacts.

Logs: We collect this information to prevent fraud and potential unauthorized access to your personal information, ensuring the technical availability and security of the App.
The server that hosts the App may record requests your device makes to the server, the details on device and browser you use, your IP address, date and time of access, city and country, operating system, browser type, mobile network information.
This data is used only for technical purposes â that is, to ensure the proper functioning and security of the App and to investigate possible security incidents.

Cookie information: This information is necessary for the Spark for Teams administration portal.
Cookies allows us to identify you as a member of the team and prevent unauthorized access to your team administration portal by other users.
All of this information is stored locally on your device.

Customer Support communication: Regarding the email: we save a record of communication including attachments and information you voluntary decide to share with us for troubleshooting purposes whenever you communicate with our support team.
Regarding the Website: your browser transfers certain data so that it can access the Website, namely:

Security measures used by Us Your data is stored on secure servers that we rent and We use the recommended industry practices to keep your data secure.
We use appropriate level of technical and organizational measures to prevent accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of or access to personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.
For instance, We ensure that all transmission is secured with HTTPS so that no one else can access your data.
Your email and account credentials are stored on secure cloud-based servers using symmetric encryption.
We currently use Hetzner and Google (the "Hosting providers").
Those Hosting providers are in possession of various international security certificates that ensure safety of your data with them.
You can read more on the security measures of Google, for instance, by following the link: https://cloud.google.com/security/compliance/
We use appropriate level of technical and organizational measures to prevent accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of or access to personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.
A non-exhaustive list of such measures include:

1.
Protective measures for physical access control:

We secure access to the premises via ID readers, so that only authorised persons have access.
The ID cards can be blocked individually.
access is also logged.
Furthermore, an alarm system is installed in the premises, preventing infiltration by unauthorised persons.
The alarm system is linked to a locking mechanism for the doors.

2.
Protective measures for system access control:

Each employee has access to the systems/services only via his/her own employee access.
The access rights involved are limited to the responsibilities of the respective employee and/or team.
We regulate access to our own systems via password procedures and the use of SSH keys of at least 4096 bits in length.
The SSH keys strengthen the productive systems against attacks that target weak passwords, as the password-based access to the relevant systems is disabled.
We have, in addition, a regulation for the creation of passwords.
This guarantees higher security also for systems that offer password-based access.
Passwords must meet the following requirements:
At least 8 characters long
At least 1 letter in upper-case
At least 1 letter in lower-case
At least 1 number
At least 1 non-alphanumeric character
Our systems are protected by firewalls that reject all incoming connections by default.
Only connection types defined by exception are accepted.

3.
Protective measures for data access control:

All servers and services are subject to continuous monitoring.
This includes the logging of personal access in the user interface.
Due to the close proximity of the employees, a visual inspection is possible at any time.
Locking and/or logging off when leaving work is prescribed and is practised.

4.
Protective measures for transfer control:

The handling of local data storage devices, e.g.
USB sticks, is regulated via agreements.
Access to the systems from outside the company network is possible only via secure VPN access.

5.
Protective measures for input control:

Our employees do not work directly at database level, but instead use applications to access the data.
IT employees access the system via individual access and use a common login.

6.
Protective measures for availability control:

We ensure the availability of data in several ways.
On the one hand, there is regular backup of the entire system.
This steps in if the other availability measures fail.
Critical services are operated redundantly in multiple data centres and controlled by a high-availability system.
Our workstations are also protected with the usual measures.
For example, virus scanners are installed, laptops are encrypted.

7.
Protective measures for separation control:

To separate data, We use logically separate databases so that no accidental reading of data by unauthorised persons can occur.
Access to the data itself is also restricted by the fact that employees use services (applications) which control access. 6.
