.In compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), this Privacy Policy incorporates the Edpuzzle Standard Contractual Clauses ("ESCC"), when the GDPR applies to your use of the Edpuzzle Services and personal data is transferred to third countries which do not ensure an adequate level of data protection.
Further information in this regard can be found in the Europe section of this Privacy Policy.What is Edpuzzle?Edpuzzle is a simple, easy-to-use video platform that helps teachers engage their students.
In the classroom, teachers use Edpuzzle to give students video lessons that they watch through the Edpuzzle Apps, Edpuzzle Website or the school's LMS.
If multiple devices are used, they will all sync with each other.
Beyond the classroom, teachers use Edpuzzle to engage students at home and access this video learning anywhere.
Edpuzzle collects students' viewing history and quiz responses which teachers can view instantly.Students can create their own account, but can only tie that account to a class after they receive a unique code from their teacher.
As further explained below in the "Which are Edpuzzle's Commitments to providing Transparency and Choice" section of this Privacy Policy, if the school or teacher elects to utilize Edpuzzle with students under a specific age, the school will be responsible for obtaining any necessary parental consent under the applicable laws.
No teachers or school members will be provided with a unique code for their students unless they consciously agree to this Policy, by reading and accepting the Privacy Policy notice given prior to signing up and in the verification email sent upon sign-up.Edpuzzle Privacy PrinciplesWhat are Edpuzzle's principles when processing personal information?In collecting and processing your personal information, we will comply with the data protection laws and regulations in force at the time.
This requires that the personal information we hold about you must be:

 Relevant to the purposes we have told you about and limited only to those purposes.
 Accurate and kept up-to-date.
 Kept only as long as necessary for the purposes we have told you about.
 Kept securely.
Why does edpuzzle collect personal information from its users?Edpuzzle collects personal information from users in order to provide the Service.
Concretely, the personal information of students and teachers is collected and used for the following purposes:
 To create the necessary accounts to use the Service.
 To provide teachers with analytics on student progress.
 To help teachers connect with other teachers from the same school or district.
 To send email updates to teachers, if applicable.
 To assess the quality of the Service.
 To secure and safeguard personal information.

 To comply with all applicable laws on the protection of personal information.
What are my rights when using Edpuzzle?Your rights relating to your personal information include:
 to be informed about how Edpuzzle uses your personal information;
 to request access to personal information held by Edpuzzle, and to have any incorrect, inaccurate or incomplete personal information rectified;
 where appropriate, to restrict processing concerning you or to object to processing;
 to have personal information erased where there is no compelling reason for its continued processing.
and
 where applicable, to portability of personal data, that is to say, to receive your personal information in a structured and commonly used format.
Which are my responsibilities when Using Edpuzzle?We require that your personal information is accurate.
Please let us know if the personal information you provided us for creating your account has changed.
If we do not have the correct information, we cannot take responsibility for information-related errors.Additionally, if we determine that you are in violation of this Policy, you will be subject to disciplinary action that could eventually lead to the banning of your account.What are Edpuzzleâs commitments to providing transparency and choice?We try to be transparent about what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices about how it is used.
For example, you can:
 Opt-out of providing certain information.
 Access and manage your account information by using the account settings within Edpuzzle.
 Control who you share information with.
 Remove information from Edpuzzle.
 Take information out of Edpuzzle.
NoticeWhen providing you with information on the processing of your personal information, such as its collection, transfer to other countries, types or identity of third parties to which we disclose that information and the purposes for which we do so, we will make sure that such information is provided in clear and understandable language.
Also, initial notice on our practices and policies will be provided when you are first asked to provide personal information to us, or as soon as practicable thereafter, and in any event before we use the information for a purpose other than that for which it was originally collected.ChoiceWe will offer you the opportunity to choose (by either opting-out or opting-in) if your personal information is (a) to be disclosed to a third party different from those listed in this Privacy Policy, or (b) to be used for a purpose materially different from the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you.Change of PurposeWe will only use your personal information for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason which is compatible with the original purpose.
If we need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.Contract PerformanceWhen, as a teacher or school representative, or when acting on behalf of a company or other organization, you create an Edpuzzle account, you provide your first and last name and an email address.
We require those data elements for you to enter into the Terms of Service agreement with us, and we process those elements on the basis of performing that contract.ConsentIf you are a teacher or school representative, or use the Service on behalf of a company or other organization, note that Edpuzzle provides its Service upon explicit consent given by you when signing up.
Prior to signing up, we will direct you to our Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy.
When signing up, you will be declaring to have read such policies and to consent to them.
Remember, nonetheless, that you will be able to withdraw your consent at any time by deleting your account in accordance with this Policy's Managing My Information section.EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS UTILIZING THE SERVICE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING THE RIGHTS AND INTERESTS OF THEIR STUDENTS AND MUST THEREFORE TAKE SPECIAL CARE WHEN REVIEWING THIS PRIVACY POLICY.
EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR OBTAINING, WHERE APPLICABLE, PERTINENT CONSENT FROM PARENTS, LEGAL GUARDIANS OR ELIGIBLE STUDENTS (THOSE WHO ARE 18 YEARS OF AGE OR ATTEND A POSTSECONDARY INSTITUTION) PRIOR TO UTILIZING THE SERVICE.
EDPUZZLE SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY NEGLIGENCE OF THE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION IN THE REVIEWING OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY OR THE OBTAINMENT, WHERE APPLICABLE, OF THE NECESSARY PARENTAL CONSENT.U.S.
Educational Institutions and Parental Consent: Consistent with the requirements of COPPA, if you or your school decide to utilize the Service with children under 13, you will be electing to either obtain parental consent or to consent on behalf of the children's parents directly, which is commonly referred to as "school consent." At the same time, yet subject to exceptions, FERPA prohibits schools from disclosing personally identifiable information from a student's education record to a third party without written consent from the parent or eligible student.
Accordingly, schools must either obtain parental consent, or ensure that their use of Edpuzzle meets one of FERPA's exceptions to the written consent requirement.
Typically, schools are exempted from obtaining parental consent under FERPA when Edpuzzle is identified as a "school official," meaning Edpuzzle is performing an institutional service or function for which the school would otherwise use its own employees.European Educational Institutions and GDPR: According to article 8 of the GDPR, minors shall be entitled to give valid consent only if they are 16 years old (unless Member States have set a lower age limit which, nonetheless, cannot be under 13 years old).
Under that age limit, processing of personal information related to minors shall be subject to parental consent.
Schools are in control of their studentsâ personal information and are obliged to take all necessary measures for protecting said information.
This means that schools will have to be especially cautious when contracting any service that may require disclosure of student personal information.
In other words, schools are data controllers in terms of GDPR and thus determine the purposes and means of the processing of student personal data.
As a consequence, schools will also be responsible for informing students and their parents accordingly about what data is collected, which are the purposes of collection, how data is used and to which third parties it is disclosed, including Edpuzzle.Legitimate InterestsGenerally, the remainder of the processing of personal information we perform is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests or those of third parties.
For example, for legal compliance purposes or to maintain ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of Edpuzzle's systems, website, and overall services, we must keep logs of Technical Information.
and, in order to respond to legal process, we are required to keep records of users who have sent and received DMCA takedown notices.As foreseen in the "Restrictions" and "Account Bans" sections of our Terms of Service , the breach of certain rules in the use of the Service may lead to the suspension or indefinite ban of your account, depending on the severity of the offense.
In the event of an indefinite account ban, Edpuzzle may keep part of your personal information, such as, but not limited to, IP address and email address, to prevent you from accessing or using the Service.How will Edpuzzle notify me of changes to this policy?We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy.
You can see when the last update was by looking at the âLast Updatedâ date at the top of this page.
We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent.
If we make any significant changes, we will provide prominent notice by posting a notice on the Service and/or notifying you by email (using the email address you provided) prior to and after changes taking effect, so you can review and make sure you're aware of them.We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy from time to time, to stay informed about our collection, use, and disclosure of personal information through the Service.
If you do not agree with any changes to the Privacy Policy, you may delete your account (although we will be sad to see you go!).
By continuing to use the Service after the revised Privacy Policy has become effective, you acknowledge that you accept and agree to the current version of the Privacy Policy.Protecting Our StudentsWhat information does Edpuzzle collect from children, and how is it used?Except for the "Open Class" feature as explained below, Edpuzzle collects the minimal amount of information from students necessary to create accounts on our Service: we ask students to provide a unique username, a unique email, a password, their first and last name and a unique code they have been given by their teacher to join a class.
Beyond this information, students can submit responses, comments, audios or images depending on the activities they are assigned, which will remain private between teacher and student.
All this information will only be used for the purposes of the school/teacher.
In addition to the information entered by the child, we automatically collect some information from any use of our Service as set forth in the "Information Collected Automatically" section.We use this information to provide the Service to the child, for security and safety purposes, or as required by law or to enforce our Terms.
We will not require children to provide more personal information than is reasonably necessary in order to participate in the Service.
If we discover that we have collected information from a child in a manner inconsistent with COPPA, FERPA or any other applicable laws or regulations, we will take appropriate steps to delete the information.
We do not disclose any personal information about children to third parties, except to service providers necessary to provide the Service, as required by law, or to protect the security of the Service or other users.
Information collected from students (including personal information and information collected automatically) is never used or disclosed for third-party advertising, including any kind of first- or third-party behaviorally targeted advertising, and childrenâs personal information is never sold or rented to anyone, including marketers or advertisers.When using the Open Class feature, students can access and use the Edpuzzle service without the need to create an account.
In this modality, students may have to provide a nickname, and only responses will be collected and processed by the Service.What childrenâs information is visible to others?No studentâs profile is made available or visible to the public, or to any other students, through Edpuzzle.
Teachers may share their classes, including grades or scores, with other teachers they co-teach with in their school, to help them collaborate.
If the teacher chooses to display Edpuzzle in their classroom, either by utilizing the "live mode" feature of the Service or by projecting via a smartboard or interactive whiteboard, students physically present in that classroom may see other studentsâ names, responses, comments or total scores.EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND TEACHERS SHALL MAKE A RESPONSIBLE USE OF THE SERVICE AND AVOID COMPROMISING CHILDREN'S PERSONAL INFORMATION AT ALL TIMES WHEN DISPLAYING EDPUZZLE IN THE CLASSROOM.
EDPUZZLE SHALL NOT BE HELD LIABLE FOR THE INAPPROPRIATE USE OF THE SERVICE BY THE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION OR THE TEACHER.How long does Edpuzzle keep childrenâs information?We only keep a childâs personal information for as long as his or her student account is active, unless we are required by law to retain it, need it to ensure the security of our community or our Service, or to enforce our Terms:
 Minimal information: As mentioned before, Edpuzzle collects the minimal amount of information from students necessary to create accounts on our Service: we ask students to provide first name, last name, email, a username and a password.
Consistent with the requirements of FERPA and COPPA in the United States and of GDPR in Europe, among other applicable laws, we only collect, use, share, and retain student personal information for purposes for which we were authorized by the educational institution/agency, teacher or the student.Beyond this information, students can submit responses, comments, audios or images depending on the activities they are assigned, that will remain private between teacher and student.
In addition to the information entered by the child, we automatically collect some information from any use of our Service as set forth in the "Information collected automatically" section.
 Deleting inactive accounts: If a studentâs account is inactive for eighteen (18) months or more (meaning the student has not used his or her account), Edpuzzle will automatically delete the student account, including all personal information provided by the student or collected by Edpuzzle from the student, as well as questions, responses or comments associated with the account.
The mentioned eighteen (18) month term has been calculated in accordance with the estimated use of the Service, which usually coincides with an entire school year, plus an additional period of time in case teachers want to renew the use of the Service.
If the day in which the account should be deleted does not exist in the corresponding month (e.g., last day of activity being the 30th of August and deletion programmed for February of the following year, which only has 28 or 29 days), deletion will be performed on the last day of the 18th month.
After deletion of the account Edpuzzle may retain copies and/or backups of the mentioned information for a maximum term of thirteen (13) months.
Nevertheless, Edpuzzle shall not be responsible for the accidental loss or destruction of data on behalf of users.
Edpuzzle will not be obliged to recover erased data stored in backups when erasure is attributable to users.EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS UTILIZING THE SERVICE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPLYING WITH THE RETENTION OF STUDENT EDUCATION RECORDS FOR AS LONG AS LEGALLY APPLICABLE.
STUDENT PROGRESS MAY BE SAVED FOR EITHER SHORTER OR LONGER PERIODS THAN THE ONES STATED ABOVE IF SO DECIDED BY THE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION.
TEACHER ACCOUNTS WILL BE PROVIDED WITH NECESSARY TOOLS TO MANAGE AND DELETE STUDENT INFORMATION.EDPUZZLE SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ERASURE OF STUDENT PROGRESS DUE TO ACCOUNT DELETION AFTER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF INACTIVITY OR BECAUSE OF THE VOLUNTARY ELECTION TO DELETE TEACHER ACCOUNTS.
SCHOOL OFFICIALS MAY REQUEST DELETION OF STUDENT INFORMATION AND CONTENT AT ANY TIME BY CONTACTING EDPUZZLE AT PRIVACY@EDPUZZLE.COM.Parental ChoicesAny parents that want copies of their childrenâs personal information that we may have stored can contact their childrenâs school personnel to that end.
At any time, the school can also refuse to permit us to collect further personal information from its students, and can request that we delete the personal information we have collected from them by contacting us at privacy@edpuzzle.com.
Please keep in mind that deleting records may require us to terminate the account in question.
Also remember that before we can share the information with the school, or delete it per your request, we will, by reasonable means, proceed to verify the identity of the requester.Information CollectedWhat information does Edpuzzle collect?We collect two types of information about you: (1) information that you voluntarily provide us by using the Edpuzzle Service (described below under "Information you provide to us") and (2) information collected automatically as result of your use of the Service (described below under âInformation collected automaticallyâ).
The types and amounts of information collected will vary depending on whether the user is a teacher or student (e.g.
we collect minimal information from students) and how they use Edpuzzle (e.g.
if teachers join their school, we may need to collect school address information).Information You Provide to UsThere are currently two categories of users on our Service: teachers and students.
We collect and store the following types of information from each type of user:
 Account Sign-up and Profile Information: To create an Edpuzzle account as a teacher, you may be asked to provide some basic information such as your first and last name, email address, password and profile photo.
If you create an Edpuzzle account as a student, you will be asked to enter your first name, last name, username, password and email.
Teacher profiles may be viewed by other teachers in the same school or when searching for it through Edpuzzle's search engine.
however, no student profile is made available or visible to the general public through the functionality of our Service.
 Subject, School Information and Collaboration Features: If you are a teacher, as part of the profile information you provide, you will be asked to to indicate the subject you teach.
You'll also be asked to choose to associate your account with an existing school or you may enter a new school name and possibly your schoolâs address if we do not have it already.
If you are using the Service as a teacher, we may ask you for permission to collect and store your precise geolocation information to help us identify schools located nearby for you.
By connecting you with your school, the Service may enable and provide additional collaboration features for teachers within the same school such as sharing videos.
 Class Information: As a teacher you will need to enter the grade level (e.g., first grade) and subject.
You will have the opportunity to change the names and passwords of the students in your class (these may or may not be the studentâs actual first and last names.
it is entirely the teacherâs choice what they enter here: for example, teachers could enter âJohn Sâ, âJohnâ, âJSâ, or âStudent 23â to describe the same person).
If a teacher opts to share the classes they set up on Edpuzzle with other teachers in their school, such as teachers they co-teach with, then those teachers can also see that classâs information.
Students will also be able to create lessons (and add questions, comments, audio or images into them) if their teacher assigns a Student Project to them, but these lessons will remain private to their teachers.
Only if the teacher chooses to share them with the class, will the other students in the class be able to watch othersâ videos.
Interactive Lessons: As a teacher you can upload your own videos (which may include your face or voice), record your voice (for small clarifications, warm introductions or replace the original audio) and add questions, comments or images at any point during the lesson.
If this content is set as public, other teachers may use it to teach other students all around the world.
however, students will only see the videos assigned to them by their teachers.

Responses, Grades and Feedback: As a student, you may have to write your own responses for open-ended questions included in your lessons.
They can only be viewed by your teacher, as well as any grades - corresponding to either multiple choice or open ended questions - and any private messages exchanged with the teacher for further discussion about a specific response.
Contact Information: When you choose to provide us with your personal information through the Service in some other manner (e.g., when you request a quote for upgrading to a "Pro Plan" at your school, when you submit a copyright claim or report any media on our platform, when you send us an email asking a question, submit a support request, participate in a video testimonial about our Service, or choose to participate in any research efforts with Edpuzzle to improve the Service).
Billing Information: When subscribing to any of our "Pro Plan" options, you will be asked to provide necessary information for processing the payment (e.g., credit/debit card number).
As further explained in the Security Measures section of this Privacy Policy, payments are processed over Stripe.
Our use of the information above is described below in the "How Does Edpuzzle Use the Information it Collects?â section.
If you are using the Edpuzzle App, we may ask you for certain permissions.Information Collected AutomaticallyLike most web-based services, we (or our service providers) may automatically receive and log information on our server logs from your browser or your device when you use the Service.
For example, this could include the frequency and duration of your visits to Edpuzzle (similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show).
If you use Edpuzzle on different devices, we may link the information we collect from those different devices to help us provide a consistent Service across your different devices.
If we do combine any automatically-collected information with personal information, we will treat the combined information as personal information, and it will be protected as per this Privacy Policy.The technologies and information we automatically collect include:
 Cookies and Other Similar Technologies: We (or our service providers) may use various technologies to collect and store information when you visit our Service, including clear GIFs (also known as âweb beaconsâ), âtagsâ, âscriptsâ, and âcookiesâ.
We also make use of persistent secure cookies: persistent cookie remains after you close your browser (although they can be removed) and may be used by your browser to identify you on subsequent visits to the Service.
We may also use, collect and store information locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5).
Like many services, Edpuzzle uses these technologies to tailor the Service for you, and to help the Service work better for you - for example, by remembering your language preferences.
 Device Information: We collect, through our third-party analytics services, device-specific information such as your operating system, hardware version, device settings, file and software names and types, battery and signal strength, and device identifiers.
This helps us measure how the Service is performing, improve Edpuzzle for you on your particular device, and send you push notifications if youâve opted in to receive them.
 Log Information: Like most online services, when you use our Service, we automatically collect and store certain information in our server logs.
Examples include:
 Details of how you used our service, such as your activity on the Service, and the frequency and duration of your visits to the Edpuzzle Website or Edpuzzle App (similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show).
 IP Address.
 Device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL.
 This information helps us make decisions about what we should work on next - for example, by showing which features are most (or least!) popular.
Location Information: When you use our Service we may collect and process information about your geographic location, for example through GPS, Bluetooth, or Wi-Fi signals.
We collect coarse (i.e., city-level) location data.We will not store or track your device location on an ongoing basis or without your permission.
We do not share precise geolocation data with third parties, other than our service providers as necessary to provide the Service.

Learning Management System (LMS) Interfaces: When accessing Edpuzzle through your institution, company or organization's LMS (e.g., Google Classroom, Blackboard, Canvas or Moodle, among others), we may collect and process information related to this kind of use of the Service, such as your school user ID, your profile picture, information on the LMS interface and the LTI version used and your school domain name.
Automated Decision Making and ProfilingAutomated Decision Making (ADM) refers to a decision which is taken solely on the basis of automated processing of your personal data.
This means processing using, for example, software code or an algorithm, which does not require human intervention.Profiling means using automated processes without human intervention (such as computer programmes) to analyse your personal information in order to evaluate your behaviour or to predict things about you which are relevant in the context of using Edpuzzle, such as what kind of videos you used.As profiling uses automated processing, it is sometimes connected with automated decision-making.
Not all profiling results in automated decision-making, but it can.If you are a teacher, we may use profiling or other forms of automated processing to show you personalized content and make recommendations through the web and/or email based on, but not limited to, your usage, subject area, school and country.If you are a student (or the parent or legal guardian of a student), we may use profiling or other forms of automated processing to provide your teacher or teachers with analytics on your progress, depending on the videos you have watched and responses to quizzes you have submitted.How does Edpuzzle use the information it collects?First and foremost, you should know that Edpuzzle does not sell or rent any of your, or your students' personal information to any third party for any purpose including for advertising or marketing purposes.
We use the information we collect from you to provide you with the best Edpuzzle experience.
More specifically, this information is used to:
 Provide and improve the Service, for example by developing new products and features.
 Respond to your requests for information or customer support.
 Customize the Service for you, and improve your experience with it.
 Send you information about new features and Edpuzzle products we believe you may be interested in.
 Most crucially, to protect our community by making sure the Service remains safe and secure.
We use automatically collected information (described in the "Information Collected Automatically" section above) to provide and support our Service, and for the additional uses described in this section of our Privacy Policy.How long does Edpuzzle keep information about me?We store your personal information for as long as it is necessary to provide products and Services to you and others, including those described above.
As a general rule, if your account is inactive for eighteen (18) months or more (meaning you have not logged into your account during that time), Edpuzzle will automatically delete your account.
Deletion will affect any on-going paid subscriptions, which will be immediately cancelled.Note we may retain and use de-identified data (i.e., data which has been stripped off all information that can be used to identify a person) for purposes of research, improvement of our products and services, and/or the development of new products and services.
We may also have to retain some information after your account is deleted, to comply with legal obligations, to protect the safety and security of our community or our Service, or to prevent abuse of our Terms.
In case we keep copies or backups of personal information, such copies or backups will be kept for a maximum term of thirteen (13) months after the deletion of your account.
Remember that you can delete your account at any time, as per the "How Can I Delete my Account?" section.
In addition to the policy above that applies to all users, we only keep a studentâs personal information while the studentâs account is active, unless we are required by law to retain it or need it to ensure the security of our community or our Service, or to enforce our Terms.Social Media Features/WidgetsThe Service may now or in the future include social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, and the Twitter Tweet button.
These social media features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.
Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our website.
Your interactions with these social media features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing each social media feature.
If you are not comfortable accessing such social media websites and using such social media features, please donât use them!Security MeasuresWill Edpuzzle share any information it collects?First and foremost, you should know that Edpuzzle does not sell or rent your, or your students' personal information to any third party for any purpose - including for advertising or marketing purposes.
Furthermore, we do not share personal information with any third parties except in the limited circumstances described in this Privacy Policy:
Other Users You Share and Communicate with on Edpuzzle: No student profiles are made available to the general public through our Service.
Furthermore, students cannot share their account information with anyone on Edpuzzle.
If you are a teacher you may choose to share information or content through the Service with other Edpuzzle teachers - for example, things like your account information or videos.
Please keep in mind that information (including personal information or children's personal information) or content that you voluntarily disclose to others - including other Edpuzzle users you interact with through the Service can be viewed, copied, stored, and used by the people you share it with.
We cannot control the actions of people with whom you choose to share information.
Third-party Integrations on Our Service: When, as a teacher, you use third-party apps, websites or other services that use, or are integrated with, our Service, they may receive information about what you post or share.
For example, when you invite others via Facebook or Twitter, these services receive the information that you share through this functionality, and information that you are sharing this from Edpuzzle.
Information collected by these apps, websites or integrated services is subject to their own terms and policies.
Service Providers: We do work with vendors, service providers, and other partners to help us provide the Service by performing tasks on our behalf - we canât build everything ourselves, after all! We may need to share or provide information (including personal information) to them to help them perform these business functions, for example sending emails on our behalf, database management services, database hosting, providing customer support software, and security.
