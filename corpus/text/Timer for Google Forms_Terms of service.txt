âTfGFâ means Timer for Google Forms Inc., whose principal place of business is at Crochy Road 20, 1024 Ecublens, Switzerland.
This document explains how the agreement is made up, and sets out some of the terms of that agreement.1.2 Unless otherwise agreed in writing with TfGF, your agreement with TfGF will always include, at a minimum, the terms and conditions set out in this document.

All of these are referred to below as the âAdditional Termsâ.
Where Additional Terms apply to a Service, these will be accessible for you to read either within, or through your use of, that Service.1.4 The Universal Terms, together with the Additional Terms, form a legally binding agreement between you and TfGF in relation to your use of the Services.
It is important that you take the time to read them carefully.
Collectively, this legal agreement is referred to below as the âTermsâ.1.5 If there is any contradiction between what the Additional Terms say and what the Universal Terms say, then the Additional Terms shall take precedence in relation to that Service.2.
