If you are a California resident, California Civil Code Section 1798.120 may permit you to âopt outâ of the âsaleâ of your âpersonal informationâ to âthird partiesâ (as those terms are defined in the CCPA).
Our Privacy Policy https://www.viacomcbsprivacy.com/policy describes the circumstances under which we share your information with third parties outside ViacomCBS and its affiliates (collectively âViacomCBSâ).
If you are a California resident and would like to opt out of the âsaleâ of your âpersonal informationâ to âthird partiesâ associated to your registered account, your newsletter subscription or otherwise associated to the email address you may have provided to us please submit your request here https://www.viacomcbsprivacy.com/dns.Opting Out of Interest-based AdvertisingOur Privacy Policy also provides you with information regarding how to opt out of receiving interest-based advertising on desktop and mobile websites for:

Advertising Alliance (US) https://www.aboutads.info/choices/
Advertising Alliance (Canada) https://youradchoices.ca/en/tools
Advertising Alliance (EU) https://www.youronlinechoices.com/
Advertising Initiative https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1

You can also opt out of interest-based advertising with some of the service providers we use, such as Google https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated.
In addition, the Digital Advertising Alliance (âDAAâ) Ad Choices tool offers a centralized place to opt out of the sale of personal information by any or all DAA participating companies that are collecting your personal information across multiple digital properties (including the ViacomCBS Services).
Please keep in mind that while ViacomCBS provides the DAA tool as a means for companies who collect information on the ViacomCBS Services and who participate in the DAA program to receive and honor âDo Not Sellâ choices, ViacomCBS does not control the activities of DAA participants or have the ability to verify or enforce any participantâs compliance with any DAA standards.
Learn more about the DAA and check the status of their CCPA Opt Out Tool at https://www.privacyrights.info/.Additional Choices About Personal Information Associated with Your Browser or DeviceOn many mobile devices, you can control interest-based advertising through your deviceâs settings.
These options can include resetting your deviceâs advertising ID or selecting âLimit Ad Trackingâ (for iOS devices) or âOpt out of Ads Personalizationâ (for Android devices) in your device settings.
Ad choices settings and options will vary depending on your browser and device settings, and this is not an exhaustive list.
Please note that your opt-out choices will only apply to the specific browser or device from which you opt out.
We encourage you to explore your device and browser settings to better understand your choices.
Connected devices (such as tablets, connected TVs, set top boxes, streaming devices and gaming consoles) may also use an advertising ID or other methods to identify you or serve you interest-based advertising.
In some cases, you can disable tracking by selecting options like âlimit ad trackingâ or disabling options like âinterest-based advertisingâ in your connected deviceâs settings.
These options will vary by device and we do not control the policies or practices of third partiesâ providing these devices.
ViacomCBS is not responsible for tracking on connected devices or our business partnersâ services and may not have visibility on choices you may have made with respect to tracking on connected devices or our business partners' services.
For information on how to control your choices on those devices, you should contact those third parties directly to learn more about their privacy practices and any data they may collect and share or sell to third parties.
