One use or consequence of cookies is to enable you to receive customized ads, alerts, content, services or information.

 In addition, we, our service providers and others sometimes use data-gathering mechanisms on the Services, including without limitation âweb beaconsâ, âclear GIFsâ, âpixelsâ and/or âtagsâ.
These perform statistical and administrative functions, such as measuring site and page traffic, verifying advertising paths, better understanding user interests and activity, gathering related information (such as information relating to a particular browser, device or IP address) and positioning images, and typically do so without detracting from your online experience.
Such mechanisms are not necessarily designed to collect Personal Information.
In addition, if you have provided your email address, we might use a non-human unreadable form (or âhashâ) of your email address to deliver, or facilitate delivery of, relevant advertisements and information to you on or by way of the Services or on or by way of other websites or media, including, for example, popular social media sites and features.
