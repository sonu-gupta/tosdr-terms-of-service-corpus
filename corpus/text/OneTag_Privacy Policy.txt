Scope of this Privacy Policy This Privacy Policy includes detailed information on the type of data our Platform collects and/or processes, on the statutory rights of the concerned data subjects and on how our platform strictly complies with the applicable privacy regulations. Data subjects are encouraged to carefully read this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy may be subject to constant modifications and amendments.
The version which is published on the website is the only one which can be considered valid and effective on that time. 2.
Information processed Our Platform processes information relating to queries, impressions, clicks and other user behavior on websites and other electronic interfaces for the main purpose of enabling, by one side, our advertising partners to optimize their advertising campaigns and, by the other, our publishing partners to optimize their revenues from the sale of advertising inventory. Unless expressly authorized by the data subject, we do not collect or process Personal data via the Platform. According to the applicable European privacy law, âPersonal dataâ means: âany information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (âdata subjectâ).
An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural personâ. Our platform performs ad-verification and automated machine learning activities strictly on anonymous or pseudo-anonymised data. Our platform processes multiple information and data, including IP addresses, browser types, user agent, referring URLs and other data relating to geo-localization.
We may use such information and data in order to provide our services to our clients, and we may share this information with our clients to help them improving their online advertising campaigns and for analytics, ad delivery, reporting and targeting purposes. We mainly use the information collected to enable our partners to sell and buy advertising space on websites and other interfaces. Our partners can download and use HTML tags that can be either technical or profiling tags, based on a request by the supply partner or the demand partners.
Our platform requires supply partners to inform us if the user has actually done opt-in or not through a special javascript code, or at least to receive such information from who gets the opt-in on the web page.
If the supply partner does not confirm that the user has given consent to the profiling activities, we do not submit any Personal data to our demand Partners or any other third parties.
We encourage our partners to use consent management tools to capture and submit to our platform user consent to the processing of Personal data.
All information, including Personal data, will be stored and used according to the applicable laws and within a timeframe considered appropriate for the reasons for which such Personal data was initially collected and processed. We work with third parties that may separately collect Personal data, to enable our customers to deliver targeted advertisements through our technology.
Collection and use of that information are not governed by this Privacy Policy.
instead, it is governed by the privacy policy of the third party that is collecting and/or processing such Personal data. 3.
