Fees
7.1.
Overview of Brigit's Free Features
As a baseline, Brigit offers several no fee products to its users.
These
products include tools to track your income and expenses, and alerts
about estimated upcoming bills and other expenses.
Brigit will monitor
your Bank Account and notify you when your Bank Account balance is in
danger of being overdrawn and, in turn, help you avoid overdraft fees.
7.2.
Brigit Plus (Additional Features)
In addition to the free features, Brigit may be able to provide you with
certain premium features ("Brigit Plus").
Brigit Plus provides users
access to advanced analytical &amp.
budgeting tools, credit monitoring,
credit building, and, if eligible, direct integration with Brigit's
Advance service.
7.2.1.
Membership Fee for Brigit Plus
Brigit Plus is subject to a $9.99 per month subscription fee (the
"Membership Fee").
We require that you link a Bank Account or debit card
(a "Payment Method") for payment of the Membership Fee.
We will
automatically charge your Payment Method for the Membership Fee every
month on your last payday of the month unless or until you cancel your
membership or your Brigit User Account is otherwise terminated.
Upcoming
dates upon which you will be charged for subsequent Membership Fees will
also be displayed in the app.
Brigit will do its best to collect the Membership Fee when you have the
funds available to pay the Membership Fee.
Brigit will attempt to avoid
charging you for Brigit Plus if we detect that your Payment Method does
not have sufficient funds to cover the charge.
If our attempt to charge
you for the Membership Fee is declined, Brigit reserves the right to try
up to two (2) additional times, for a total of three (3) debit attempts.
After that, Brigit will not attempt without a subsequent authorization
from you.
This may result in a change of date for which you are billed
for each period.
Brigit monitors your balance and does its best effort to ensure you have
sufficient funds before debiting your account, but the company makes no
warranties that an overdraft will not occur.
The Membership Fee may be discounted from time to time by our customer
service team, or through partnerships with affiliates.
If you receive a
discounted price on signup, we will notify you at least 30 days before
we make any changes to the discounted pricing.

Membership Fee once each month.
As applicable, you also authorize Brigit
to electronically debit and credit your Payment Method to correct
erroneous debits and credits.
You have the right to receive notice of
any debit for the Membership Fee that would vary in amount from a
previous Membership Fee, but you agree that we only need to notify you
in advance if a particular debit from your Payment Method would be more
than $9.99.
(Our policy is that no single debit will exceed $9.99, so
we expect not to provide you with advance notice of each ongoing debit
from your Payment Method.)
You acknowledge that, as applicable, the electronic authorization
contained in this Section represents your written authorization for
automated clearinghouse ("ACH") transactions as provided herein and will
remain in full force and effect until you notify Brigit that you wish to

debit date in order to cancel this authorization.

may make it impossible for Brigit to stop withdrawal of the
preauthorized withdrawal.
You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Brigit from and against any
loss incurred as a result of its withdrawal of a preauthorized debit
transaction from your Bank Account or debit card if any of the
information relied upon in your request to stop payment is incorrect or
incomplete.
If you have followed the instructions in this section to
notify Brigit of your desire to revoke your authorization at least three
(3) business days before the scheduled debit date, Brigit will be liable
for your losses or damages directly caused by our failure to stop any
preauthorized transaction.
If we do not receive notice at least three
(3) business days before the scheduled debit date, we may attempt, in
our sole discretion, to cancel the transaction.
However, we assume no
responsibility for our failure to do so.

us to charge and credit your Bank Account or debit card for payments due
to us under this Agreement.

YOUR RIGHTS IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND US.
YOU UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REJECT THIS PROVISION AS PROVIDED IN SECTION
20.3 BELOW.
20.1.
Election to Arbitrate
You and Brigit agree that the sole and
exclusive forum and remedy for resolution of a Claim be final and
binding arbitration pursuant to this section 20 (the "Arbitration
Provision"), unless you opt out as provided in section 20.3 below.
As used in this Arbitration Provision, "Claim" shall include any
past, present, or future claim, dispute, or controversy involving
you (or persons claiming through or connected with you), on the one
hand, and us on the other hand, relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, and/or the activities or relationships that involve, lead
to, or result from this Agreement, such as the Site or the Services
and including (except to the extent provided otherwise in the last
sentence of Section 20.8 below) the validity or enforceability of
this Arbitration Provision, any part thereof, or the entire
Agreement.
Claims are subject to arbitration regardless of whether
they arise from contract.

or
otherwise.
Claims include matters arising as initial claims,
counterâclaims, cross-claims, third-party claims, or otherwise.
Please note that you may continue to assert Claims in small claims
court, if your Claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in
such court and advances only on an individual (non-class,
non-representative) basis.
The scope of this Arbitration Provision
is to be given the broadest possible interpretation that is
enforceable.
20.2.
Applicability of the Federal Arbitration Act.
Arbitrator's Powers.
This Arbitration Provision is made pursuant to a
transaction involving interstate commerce and shall be governed by
and enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act (the "FAA").
The
arbitrator will apply substantive law consistent with the FAA and
applicable statutes of limitations.
The arbitrator may award damages
or other types of relief permitted by applicable substantive law,
subject to the limitations set forth in this Arbitration Provision.
The arbitrator will not be bound by judicial rules of procedure and
evidence that would apply in a court.
The arbitrator shall take
steps to reasonably protect confidential information.
20.3.

You may opt out of this
Arbitration Provision for all purposes by sending an arbitration opt

fit as long as it is received at the specified address within the
specified time.

Arbitration Provision.
If the opt out notice is sent on your behalf
by a third party, such third party must include evidence of his or
her authority to submit the opt out notice on your behalf.
20.4.
Informal Dispute Resolution.
If a Claim arises, our goal is to
learn about and address your concerns and, if we are unable to do so
to your satisfaction, to provide you with a neutral and cost
effective means of resolving the dispute quickly.
You agree that
before filing any claim in arbitration, you may submit Claims by
sending an email to info@hellobrigit.com at any time.
20.5.
Arbitration Procedures.
The party initiating arbitration shall
do so with the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA") or
Judicial Alternatives and Mediation Services ("JAMS").
The
arbitration shall be conducted according to, and the location of the
arbitration shall be determined in accordance with, the rules and
policies of the administrator selected, except to the extent the
rules conflict with this Arbitration Provision or any countervailing
law.
If you have any questions concerning the AAA or would like to
obtain a copy of the AAA arbitration rules, you may call 1(800)
778-7879 or visit the AAA's web site at: www.adr.org.
If you have
any questions concerning JAMS or would like to obtain a copy of the
JAMS arbitration rules, you may call 1(800) 352-5267 or visit their
web site at: www.jamsadr.com.
In the case of a conflict between the
rules and policies of the administrator and this Arbitration
Provision, this Arbitration Provision shall control, subject to
countervailing law, unless all parties to the arbitration consent to
have the rules and policies of the administrator apply.
The
arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live
or work, or any other location we agree to.
20.6.
Arbitration Fees.
If we elect arbitration, we shall pay all the
administrator's filing costs and administrative fees (other than
hearing fees).
If you elect arbitration, filing costs and
administrative fees (other than hearing fees) shall be paid in
accordance with the rules of the administrator selected, or in
accordance with countervailing law if contrary to the
administrator's rules.
We shall pay the administrator's hearing
fees for one full day of arbitration hearings.
Fees for hearings
that exceed one day will be paid by the party requesting the
hearing, unless the administrator's rules or applicable law require
otherwise, or you request that we pay them and we agree to do so.
Each party shall bear the expense of its own attorneys' fees,
except as otherwise provided by law.
If a statute gives you the
right to recover any of these fees, these statutory rights shall
apply in the arbitration notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein.
20.7.
Appeals.
Within 30 days of a final award by the arbitrator, any
party may appeal the award for reconsideration by a three-arbitrator
panel selected according to the rules of the arbitrator
administrator.
In the event of such an appeal, any opposing party
may cross-appeal within 30 days after notice of the appeal.
The
panel will reconsider de novo all aspects of the initial award that
are appealed.
Costs and conduct of any appeal shall be governed by
this Arbitration Provision and the administrator's rules, in the
same way as the initial arbitration proceeding.
Any award by the
individual arbitrator that is not subject to appeal, and any panel
award on appeal, shall be final and binding, except for any appeal
right under the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"), and may be entered
as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
20.8.
No Class Actions.
NO ARBITRATION SHALL PROCEED ON A CLASS,
REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS (INCLUDING AS PRIVATE ATTORNEY
GENERAL ON BEHALF OF OTHERS), EVEN IF THE CLAIM OR CLAIMS THAT ARE
THE SUBJECT OF THE ARBITRATION HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN ASSERTED (OR
COULD HAVE BEEN ASSERTED) IN A COURT AS CLASS REPRESENTATIVE, OR
COLLECTIVE ACTIONS IN A COURT.
Unless consented to in writing by all
parties to the arbitration, no party to the arbitration may join,
consolidate, or otherwise bring claims for or on behalf of two or
more individuals or unrelated corporate entities in the same
arbitration unless those persons are parties to a single
transaction.
Unless consented to in writing by all parties to the
arbitration, an award in arbitration shall determine the rights and
obligations of the named parties only, and only with respect to the
claims in arbitration, and shall not (a) determine the rights,
obligations, or interests of anyone other than a named party, or
resolve any Claim of anyone other than a named party.
nor (b) make
an award for the benefit of, or against, anyone other than a named
party.
No administrator or arbitrator shall have the power or
authority to waive, modify, or fail to enforce this Section 20.8,
and any attempt to do so, whether by rule, policy, arbitration
decision or otherwise, shall be invalid and unenforceable.
Any
challenge to the validity of this Section 20.8 shall be determined
exclusively by a court and not by the administrator or any
arbitrator.
20.9.
Survival and Severability of Arbitration Provision.
This Arbitration Provision shall survive the termination of this
Agreement.
If any portion of this Arbitration Provision other than
section 20.8 is deemed invalid or unenforceable, the remaining
portions of this Arbitration Provision shall nevertheless remain
valid and in force.
If there is a final judicial determination that
applicable law precludes enforcement of this Arbitration Provision's
limitations as to a particular claim for relief or particular term,
then that claim (and only that claim) or that term (and only that
term) must be severed from the Arbitration Provision and may be
brought in court.
If an arbitration is brought on a class,
representative, or collective basis, and the limitations on such
proceedings in section 20.8 are finally adjudicated pursuant to the
last sentence of section 20.8 to be unenforceable, then no
arbitration shall be had.
In no event shall any invalidation be
deemed to authorize an arbitrator to determine Claims or make awards
beyond those authorized in this Arbitration Provision.
20.10.
Judicial Forum for Claims.
Except as otherwise required by
applicable law or governing loan agreement, in the event that this
Arbitration Provision is found not to apply to you or your Claim,
you and Brigit agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small
claims actions) will be brought in the federal or state courts of
New York, New York.
Both you and Brigit consent to venue and
personal jurisdiction there.
We both agree to waive our right to a
jury trial.
20.11.
WAIVER OF RIGHT TO LITIGATE.
THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY
HAVE A RIGHT TO LITIGATE CLAIMS THROUGH A COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR
JURY, BUT WILL NOT HAVE THAT RIGHT IF ANY PARTY ELECTS ARBITRATION
PURSUANT TO THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION.
THE PARTIES HEREBY KNOWINGLY
AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVE THEIR RIGHTS TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIMS IN A
COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY UPON ELECTION OF ARBITRATION BY ANY
PARTY.
21.

Builder, this Agreement and all Claims are governed by the laws of the
