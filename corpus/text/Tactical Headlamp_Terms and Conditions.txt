The
arbitratorâs award will be binding and may be entered as a judgment in any
court of competent jurisdiction.
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, no arbitration under this TOS will be joined to an arbitration involving any
other party subject to this TOS, whether through class arbitration proceedings
or otherwise.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will have the right to seek
injunctive or other equitable relief in state or federal court located in New
Castle County, Delaware to enforce this TOS or prevent an infringement of a
third partyâs rights.
In the event equitable relief is sought, each party hereby
irrevocably submits to the personal jurisdiction of such court.
You and shipnowpaylater.co agree that any dispute between us (including
disputes against any agent, employee, subsidiary, affiliate, predecessor in
interest, successor, or assign of the other) relating to our website, any
transaction or relationship between us resulting from your use of our website, the purchase, order, installation, or use of shipnowpaylater.co products or
services, or communications between us, will be resolved exclusively and
finally by binding arbitration and the arbitration decision may be enforced and
judgment entered thereon in any court of competent jurisdiction.
You and
shipnowpaylater.co further agree that this arbitration agreement is made
pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce and shall be governed
by the Federal Arbitration Act (âFAAâ), and not by any state law concerning
arbitration.
You and shipnowpaylater.co further agree that any determination
regarding the applicability, enforceability, or validity of this arbitration
agreement will be made by the arbitrator, not by any court.
BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, YOU ARE GIVING
UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO A
JURY TRIAL.
In arbitration, a dispute is resolved by a neutral arbitrator or
panel of arbitrators, rather than by a judge or jury.
Arbitration is more informal.
however, an arbitrator can award the same relief that a court can award.
The
arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association
(âAAAâ) and conducted under AAAâs Commercial Arbitration Rules and the
Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, the
âAAA Rulesâ) then in effect at the time of the dispute.
You may obtain copies
of the AAA Rules and forms and instructions for initiating arbitration by visiting
the AAA website at www.adr.org, or by calling AAA at (800) 788-7879.
If you
initiate arbitration, shipnowpaylater.co will promptly reimburse you for any
standard filing fee which may have been required under AAAâs Procedures
once you have notified shipnowpaylater.co in writing and provided a copy of
the arbitration proceedings.
However, if shipnowpaylater.co is the prevailing
party in the arbitration, applicable law may allow the arbitrator to award
attorneysâ fees and costs to shipnowpaylater.co.
If for any reason the AAA is
unavailable, the parties shall mutually select another arbitration forum.


15) Waiver of Class Action Rights
BY ENTERING INTO THIS TOS, YOU HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE
ANY RIGHT YOU MAY HAVE TO JOIN CLAIMS WITH THOSE OF OTHERS
IN THE FORM OF A CLASS ACTION OR SIMILAR PROCEDURAL DEVICE.
ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR CONNECTED WITH
THIS TOS MUST BE ASSERTED INDIVIDUALLY.
There shall be no right or authority for any claim to be arbitrated on a class
action basis or in a purported representative capacity.
No claim submitted to
arbitration is heard by a jury or may be brought as a private attorney general.
You do not have the right to act as a class representative or participate as a member of a class of claimants with respect to any claim submitted to
arbitration.
The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one personâs claims
against shipnowpaylater.co and may not preside over any kind of
representative or class proceeding against shipnowpaylater.co.
You
acknowledge that this class action waiver is material and essential to the
arbitration of any disputes between the parties and is non-severable from the
agreement to arbitrate claims.
If any portion of this class action waiver is
limited, voided, or cannot be enforced, then the partiesâ agreement to arbitrate
shall be null and void.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THIS
CLASS ACTION WAIVER, YOU MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST US
IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS
MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE
PROCEEDING.
IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS ARBITRATION

terminated by you or us or if you have the right to access or use the website.

permitted assigns and governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Nevada without regard for conflict of law principles.

TOS and all of your rights and obligations under them may not be assignable
or transferable by you without our prior written consent.

contractor, and no agency, partnership, joint venture, or employee-employer
relationship is intended or created by this TOS.
