When and Why We Share Your Personal Data
We are committed to maintaining your trust, and we want you to understand when and with whom we may share the information we collect.
We do not, and will not without consent, sell, lease, or rent your information to third parties for monetary or other valuable consideration.
We permit third parties to process information necessary for our Services, and we may disclose the personal information we process to third parties for business purposes.
The third parties we work with are contractually required to comply with adequate privacy, confidentiality, and security requirements.



With our Partners

We may provide your user data, administrative data, security data, and third-party data to our partners for the purpose of allowing them to conduct NortonLifeLock business.
Our partners may use your personal data to communicate with you and others about NortonLifeLock Services either alone or jointly with partner products and services.
We may provide your personal data to partners to confirm your eligibility for joint or co-branded offers or to communicate and administer such offers (e.g., report sales conversions, verify eligibility, assess effectiveness of joint offer, etc.).
Our partners are not allowed to use personal data that they receive from us for any purpose except for communicating, evaluating, improving, and administering the offer in question (NortonLifeLock branded, co-branded, or joint offer). This will not affect the partnerâs ability to use personal data that it may already have obtained from you or other sources.
If you do not wish to receive promotional emails from our partners, you can unsubscribe directly using the unsubscribe link or tool provided in the partnerâs email or other communication to you.

With Service Providers Processing Data on Our Behalf

We may use contractors and service providers to process the personal data we collect for the purposes described in this Statement, the relevant Product and Service Privacy Statements, and for business purposes such as financial auditing, data storage and security, troubleshooting and debugging, improving and operationalizing threat intelligence and counter-threat measures, and for marketing and promoting our Services.
We contractually require service providers to keep data confidential, and we do not allow our service providers to disclose your personal data to others without our authorization, or to sell it or use it for purposes unrelated to the services they provide (e.g., their own marketing purposes).
However, if you have a separate and/or independent relationship with these service providers, their privacy statements will apply to such relationships.
Such service providers may include benefit brokers, your employer (for products and services offered as an employee benefit), contact centers, payment card processors, and marketing, survey, or analytics suppliers.

With Public Authorities and Legal Proceedings

In certain instances, it may be necessary for us to disclose any of the personal data we collect to comply with a legal obligation, at the request of public authorities, or as otherwise required by applicable law.
No personal data will be disclosed except in response to:

A subpoena, warrant, or other legal process issued by a court or other public authority of competent jurisdiction;
Discovery requests or demands as part of a civil lawsuit or similar legal process;
Where disclosure is necessary for us to enforce our legal rights pursuant to applicable law;
A request with the purpose of identifying and/or preventing credit card fraud or identity theft.
or
Where disclosure of personal data is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat of bodily or other significant harm to the data subject or other individuals potentially concerned.


For Restoration Services

We may disclose your user data, security data, diagnostic information, and third-party data to financial institutions, financial services companies, and other third parties at your direction to provide restoration services and other Services to you.

If you access third-party services through our Services, these third-party services may be able to collect user data, security data, diagnostic information, and third-party data about you in accordance with their own privacy policies.

With Our Corporate Affiliates

We may share all of the information we collect with our corporate affiliates.

For Business Transfers

We may share all of the information we collect in connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of a website, a merger, acquisition, consolidation, asset sale, or initial public offering, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.
Retention and Deletion of Your Personal Data
We will keep your personal data on our systems as long as necessary to provide you with our Services, or for as long as we have another legitimate business purpose to do so, but not longer than permitted or required by law.
When we no longer have an ongoing legitimate business reason to keep your personal data, your personal data will either be securely disposed of, or de-identified through an appropriate anonymization means, such as aggregation, truncation, or one-way hashing so it is no longer identifiable as your personal data.
Cross-Border Transfers of Personal Data Among NortonLifeLock Entities and to Third-Party Vendors
We are a global company and process personal data in many countries.
As part of our business, your personal data may be transferred to NortonLifeLock and/or its subsidiaries and affiliates in the United States, and to subsidiaries and third-party vendors of NortonLifeLock located worldwide.
All transfers will occur in compliance with the applicable data transfer requirements laws and regulations.
If your personal data originates from the European Economic Area and is transferred to NortonLifeLock subsidiaries, affiliates, or third-party vendors engaged by NortonLifeLock to process such personal data on our behalf who are located in countries that are not recognized by the European Commission as offering an adequate level of personal data protection, such transfers are covered by alternate appropriate safeguards, specifically Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the European Commission.
If we are involved in a reorganization, merger, acquisition, or sale of our assets, your personal data may be transferred as part of that transaction.

How We Protect Your Personal Data
Securing personal data is an important aspect of protecting privacy.
We take reasonable and appropriate physical, technical, and organizational security measures in accordance with applicable laws to protect your personal data against the risk of accidental loss, compromise, or any form of unauthorized access, disclosure, or processing.
The relevant security controls are communicated throughout NortonLifeLock to support the secure development of Services and maintain a secure operating environment.
Our security approach includes:

Physical Safeguards

We lock doors and file cabinets, control access to our facilities, implement a clean desk policy, and apply secure destruction to media containing personal data.

Organizational Safeguards

We conduct regular company-wide as well as role-specific training and awareness programs on security and privacy.

If you click on our ads, we will know the domain you came from.
For more information, please see the Cookies &amp.
Tracking Technologies section below.



Data from Third Parties

Third parties may provide us with personal data they have collected about you, from you, or from other online and offline sources.
Marketing data from our partners and third parties can be combined with information we already have about you, to provide you with more relevant communications and to better tailor our offers to you.
We make reasonable efforts to verify that the third parties we work with for marketing purposes are reputable, and we do not ask them to disclose your personal data if we do not have a lawful purpose and valid legal basis to collect and process that data.

Community Networking â NortonLifeLock Community (Forums, Blogs, and Networking Sites)

We operate forums, websites, and related information services, to better assist you in using our Services, discussing technical issues, and sharing your experiences.

How to Opt Out of Interest-Based Advertising

Tracking Technologies

Cookies

A cookie is a commonly used automated data collection tool.
Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or device by websites that you visit or HTML-formatted emails you open, to make websites work, or work more efficiently.
We and our partners use cookies and other similar tracking technologies such as Web Beacons, JavaScript, clear GIFs, pixel tags, HTML5, and Flash Local Storage Objects on our websites or emails to:

Enable the proper functioning of our websites and the proper delivery of legitimate electronic communications;
Tailor information presented to you based on your browsing preferences, such as language and geographical region;
Collect statistics regarding your website usage;
Provide us with business and marketing information.
and
In some cases, to enable a third party to deliver future advertising for our Services to you when you visit certain websites owned by third parties.

We use different kinds of cookies:


Essential cookies are necessary to provide you with Services and features available through our websites.
Without these cookies, services you may need, such as shopping carts or e-billing, cannot be provided.

Advertising cookies and tracking scripts are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you.
They perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly delivered and, in some cases, featuring ads based on your interests. 

Social Media cookies collect data regarding social media interactions.

Analytics cookies collect data that is either used in aggregate form to help us understand how the website is being used or to understand the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.

Performance and Functionality cookies collect data that is used to help make the user experience better on our websites.

The cookies we use include âsessionâ cookies that are erased when you leave our websites, or they may be âpersistent" cookies that remain on your computerâs hard drive after you leave the site, in preparation for your next visit to our websites.
If you do not wish to receive cookies, you may be able to refuse them by not agreeing to the use of them upon entering the website.
If you do so, we may be unable to offer you some of our functionalities, Services, or support.
If you have previously visited our websites, you may also have to delete any existing cookies from your browser.
If you would like to view or manage the cookies we use, please see our cookie banner which is displayed when you first access our website, or the âprivacy settingsâ tab located on the lower right hand of our websites.

Third-Party Data Collection

Cookies may also be placed on our websites by third parties to deliver tailored information and content that may be of interest to you, such as promotions or offerings, when you visit third-party websites after you have left ours.
We do not permit these third parties to collect personal data about you on our sites beyond such cookies (e.g., email address) unless such data is provided to the third party in their role as a service provider acting solely on our behalf.



Social Media Features and Widgets

Our websites include social media features, such as Facebookâs âLikeâ button, and widgets, such as the âShare Thisâ button, or interactive mini-programs that run on our sites.
These features are usually recognizable by their third-party brand or logo and may collect your IP address or other personal data, including which page you are visiting on our websites, and set a cookie to enable the feature to work properly.
Any collection of information through such third-party feature is governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.



Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms.

Some mobile and web browsers transmit âdo-not-trackâ signals.
Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they are even aware of them.
We currently do not respond to these signals.




Automated Individual Decision-Making and Profiling
Where NortonLifeLock processes network traffic data for the purpose of network and information security based on our or our customersâ legitimate interest as outlined in the corresponding section of this Statement, automated decisions concerning data elements may occasionally be made.
This could involve assigning relative cybersecurity reputation scores to IP addresses and URLs based on objective cyber-threat indicators measured by our and our partnersâ cyber-threat detection engines.
Such indicators may be, for instance, the determination that malicious or otherwise harmful contents are hosted at a given URL or are coming from a given IP address.
Such automatically assigned reputation scores may be leveraged by you, by NortonLifeLock, by our partners, and by other customers to detect, block, and mitigate the identified cyber threats.
They could therefore result in our Services blocking network traffic coming from or going to such URLs and IP addresses.
This processing is intended only to protect you, NortonLifeLock, our partners, and our other customers from cyber threats.
If you consider that such automated processing is unduly affecting you in a significant way, please contact us as explained above (âContact Usâ) to raise your concerns and to seek our help in finding a satisfactory solution.




Childrenâs Privacy
Our websites are not directed to, nor do we knowingly collect data from, minors (as defined by applicable law) except where explicitly described otherwise in the privacy notices of Services designed specifically for purposes such as to assist you by providing child online protection features.
In such cases, we will only collect, and process personal data related to any child under 13 years of age that you choose to disclose to us or otherwise instruct us to collect and process.
Please refer to the Product Specific Privacy Statements for additional information.
Changes to this Statement
We reserve the right to revise or modify this Statement.
In addition, we may update this Privacy Statement to reflect changes to our data practices.
If we make any material changes in the way we collect, process, and/or share your personal data, we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this website prior to the change becoming effective.
In the case of a material change to our personal data processing practices, any such change will only apply on a going-forward basis.
We will not process the personal data currently in our possession in a materially different way without your prior consent.
We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.




Links to Other Websites
Our websites may contain links to other websites owned or operated by other companies.
If you visit any linked websites, please review their privacy statements carefully.
We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of websites that are owned by those third parties.
Our websites may also link to co-branded websites that are maintained by NortonLifeLock and one or more of our business partners who are collecting your personal data pursuant to their own privacy practices.
Please review the applicable privacy statements on any co-branded site you visit, as they may differ from ours.
