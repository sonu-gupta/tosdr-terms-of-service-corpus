Bitpanda Index

To exchange and purchase/sell via Bitpanda Index, the respective provisions in section 3 (in particular 3.1.1., 3.1.2.
and 3.1.3.) of these general terms and conditions shall apply equally.

7.2.By using Bitpanda Index, you can create a number of Bitpanda customer offers with one 'click' and purchase, sell or exchange E-Token according to a predefined allocation of funds.
This means that the Bitpanda customer creates combined Bitpanda customer offers for E-Token according to the allocation of funds they have selected.

7.3.
Bitpanda Systems offer different allocations of funds from which Bitpanda customers can choose freely and independently.
The weighting of the allocation of funds and the respective (re)calculation of the allocation of funds is carried out by external partners who are independent of Bitpanda ("Index Provider") and Bitpanda has no influence on this.
You acknowledge and accept that the allocation of funds is not created by Bitpanda itself and that the unlimited availability of the allocation of funds in Bitpanda Systems cannot be guaranteed at all times.
In particular, Bitpanda reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to change, modify or terminate the offered allocation of funds at any time and to exclude or remove individual tokens from the allocation of funds or not to include individual tokens in the allocation of funds if there are important reasons for this (e.g.
regulatory requirements).
Bitpanda ensures that neither financial instruments nor other regulated financial products are included in an allocation of funds.

7.4.
The current balance of E-Token held using Bitpanda Index is recorded and displayed in a separate wallet in the respective Bitpanda customer account ("Index Wallet").
You, as a Bitpanda customer, do not purchase a complete product or an index-representing token, but individual E-Token according to the allocation of funds you have selected (e.g.
BCI5).

7.5.
The allocation of funds provided by Bitpanda Systems are adjusted to the parameters (e.g.
market capitalisation) specified in the respective allocation of funds ("Rebalancing") pursuant to a predefined period of time (e.g.
at the end of the month).
Rebalancing creates corresponding Bitpanda customer offers for the exchange, purchase or sale of E-Token recorded and displayed in the Index Wallet.
You hereby confirm and grant Bitpanda the right to carry out the corresponding and periodic exchange, purchase and/or sale orders for E-Token according to the allocation of funds you have selected.
In addition, you accept and agree to pay all applicable fees in connection with the exchange, purchase and/or sale orders placed in the Rebalancing process.
Rebalancing will generally take place no later than four business days after the end of a period.
Bitpanda reserves the right, however, to only execute exchange, buy or sell orders within the scope of Rebalancing at its sole discretion once certain minimum sizes per order have been reached.
You are aware and hereby confirm that the rebalancing may have tax implications for you as a Bitpanda customer (see point 13.1.
ix).

7.6.
It can sometimes be the case that certain E-Token included in the allocation of funds are not offered in Bitpanda Systems.
In such cases, Bitpanda will take appropriate steps to integrate these E-Token into Bitpanda Systems within a reasonable period of time.
Should Bitpanda have successfully completed the integration of the respective E-Token, this E-Token will be added to the next Rebalancing and the corresponding Index Wallet at the price displayed in Bitpanda Systems on the day of the subsequent Rebalancing.
The actual extent to which E-Token are integrated into Bitpanda Systems (e.g.
trading options, wallet services) is at Bitpanda's sole discretion.
In particular, Bitpanda reserves the right not to provide a separate wallet in Bitpanda Systems for certain E-token included in an allocation of funds.
in such cases you can only exchange the respective E-Token for other Tokens available in Bitpanda Systems.

7.7.
You can exchange the E-Token recorded and displayed in the Index Wallet for other Tokens at any time by creating a corresponding Bitpanda customer offer.
Such a Bitpanda customer offer must refer to either (i) the total number of E-Token displayed and recorded in the Index Wallet or (ii) a proportionate number of E-Token displayed and recorded in the Index Wallet corresponding to the ratio of the selected allocation of funds.
You confirm and accept that such customer offer - in total or proportionate - may only be possible above a certain minimum amount.
It is not possible to exchange individual E-Token which are displayed and booked in the Index Wallet.
Alternatively, you can transfer the E-Token recorded and displayed in the Index Wallet directly to the corresponding wallet in your Bitpanda customer account.

7.8.
You acknowledge and accept that Bitpanda Index can be terminated or discontinued at any time.
If Bitpanda Index is terminated, Bitpanda will inform you of any such termination within a reasonable period of time.
You can then either sell or exchange (Swap) the Tokens displayed and booked in the Index Wallet or transfer them to the corresponding Wallet on your customer account.
If you do not take action, Bitpanda will credit the equivalent value (pursuant to the prices displayed and offered within Bitpanda systems) of the displayed Tokens and held in the Index Wallet to your Wallet or Fiat Wallet within a reasonable period of time (and deduct the respective fees incurred for this).
This is done at Bitpanda's sole discretion.
This notice period may also be waived for important reasons.

7.9.
The E-Token recorded and displayed in the Index Wallet can neither be sent to other Bitpanda customers nor to wallet addresses outside of Bitpanda Systems.
Partial removal of individual E-Token is also excluded.

In case of using Bitpanda Savings, you can choose between SEPA Direct Debit mandate or recurring credit card debiting as payment method: 
8.7.1.
SEPA Direct Debit mandate: The respective payment amount is immediately payable and due for collection on the respective collection time, which Bitpanda can freely determine in advance.
By using SEPA Direct Debit mandate, you hereby revocably grant Bitpanda or a company affiliated with Bitpanda a SEPA Direct Debit mandate in order to collect the payments payable by you when due from your specified account by means of a recurring and regular SEPA Direct Debit mandate.
You acknowledge and agree that the time of collection from your bank account may be up to ten days prior to the respective recurring purchase time specified by you.
You hereby also authorise your bank to redeem the Direct Debits.
Your bank is also entitled to decline Direct Debits, especially if your account does not have sufficient cover.
You have the right to initiate a chargeback to your account within 56 calendar days (8 weeks) from the debit date without stating any reasons (âDirect Debit Chargebackâ).
In such case, the terms and conditions as agreed by you with your bank apply.
Please note: The claim due, according to the Final Rate accepted and confirmed by you in the Multiple Debit Order (as defined in section 8.2.7.) will remain payable in case of a Direct Debit Chargeback.
Since you have been informed of the amount and the debit dates accordingly, you revocably waive the right to obtain pre-notifications before collections of Direct Debits are made.
You are obliged to provide sufficient funds on your account on the due date.
If collection via SEPA Direct Debit mandate is not possible (e.g.
bank refuses or rejects the Direct Debit), you will bear any resulting costs (e.g.
bank fees) and you authorise Bitpanda to execute a Direct Debit again on a later date.
This also applies to all costs incurred to Bitpanda in connection with a Direct Debit Chargeback and/or revocation of a SEPA Direct Debit mandate.
You authorise and grant Bitpanda the right to deduct such costs directly from any of your Token.
The provisions as set forth in section 8.9.
and 8.10.
apply equally in these cases.
You are aware and accept that the initial setup of a SEPA Direct Debit mandate may take up to ten calendar days after submitting your necessary data to Bitpanda until it is fully implemented and hence, Direct Debits can be executed (the same applies in  case you amend the amount of your Multiple Debit Order).

8.7.2.
Recurring credit card payment: The respective payment amount is immediately payable and due for collection on the respective recurring purchase point in time specified by you in advance.
Hence, you authorise Bitpanda to charge your credit card accordingly and in accordance with the general terms and conditions applicable for your credit card.
You are obliged to provide sufficient funds on your credit card on the due date.
If collection by credit card is not possible (e.g.
insufficient funds), you will bear any resulting costs (e.g.
credit card fees).
In such a case, the provisions of point 8.9.
and 8.10.
apply equally.&nbsp.

8.7.3.
If execution of a Multiple Debit Order is not possible, for whatever reason, no E-Token will be credited to your Bitpanda Client Account.
In such a case, Bitpanda will notify you by e-mail of the failure of executing the order.&nbsp.

8.7.4.
You may revoke a Multiple Debit Order issued by SEPA Direct Debit or credit card at any time.
A revocation of the SEPA Direct Debit mandate shall take effect no later than two Business Days after your revocation was communicated to us.
Please note that your Multiple Debit Order issued via SEPA Direct Debit mandate will still be executed after revocation or pause, provided that your revocation or pause falls between the time of collection from your bank account and the respective recurring purchase time.

8.7.5.
Bitpanda is entitled to refuse the Bitpanda Savings service to individual Bitpanda Clients for objective reasons.&nbsp.

8.8.
Until the purchase price, including all fees and expenses, and/or any other outstanding amounts and/or claims have been fully paid, or any Token in exchange have been fully transferred to Bitpanda, any Token or proceeds thereof, remain the property of Bitpanda (Reservation of Title.
Eigentumsvorbehalt) and Bitpanda has a right of retention (ZurÃ¼ckbehaltungsrecht) regarding the Token of the respective Bitpanda Client.
This reservation remains in force regardless of any form of processing or blending of goods, which may take place in any location worldwide.&nbsp.

8.9.
Your payment/transfer is delayed if the respective payment/transfer is not booked on Bitpanda's accounts (including Wallets and storages of Bitpanda) at the time when the respective CCOFA (as set forth under item 3.1.5.) has been completed by Bitpanda or a collection via SEPA Direct Debit mandate cannot be fulfilled (see point 8.7.).
Bitpanda cannot be in delay because Bitpanda either accepts an offer by completing the respective CCOFA or denies an offer in all other cases of not completing the respective CCOFA.&nbsp.

8.10.
In the case you are in delay with your transfer, Bitpanda may charge reminder fees to a reasonable relation to the amount in delay/value of transferred Token in delay and as far as such fees are necessary to cover adequate costs of Bitpanda to administer such delay and enforce Bitpanda's rights (a total amount of at least EUR 5.00 up to a maximum of EUR 15.00 will be charged).
In case the respective Bitpanda Client does not settle debts within a reasonable time, Bitpanda reserves the right to entrust a debt collection agency with the collection of the claimed debt.
In such case(s) Bitpanda will additionally charge EUR 5.00 processing fee for claims between EUR 0 and EUR 500.00 and EUR 10.00 processing fee for claims of more than EUR 500.00.
Furthermore, any additional expenses charged by the debt collection agency towards Bitpanda complying with the "Verordnung des Bundesministers fÃ¼r wirtschaftliche Angelegenheiten Ã¼ber die HÃ¶chstsÃ¤tze der Inkassoinstituten gebÃ¼hrenden VergÃ¼tungen" (BGBI Nr.
141/1996 idgF), will be charged to the Bitpanda Client, as long as these are reasonable and necessary to cover adequate prosecution costs.

8.11.
Bitpanda allows within the single account rule (item 4.1.) also only a single match between a Bitpanda Client Account and a payment service provider account (e.g.
bank account, Neteller account, etc).
Respectively any account with a payment service provider may be used only by one single Bitpanda Client.
The name of the payment service user must match the name of the Bitpanda Client attached to the respective Bitpanda Client Account.

8.12.
You have to fully comply with the data disclosure requirements in the payment processes, in particular when paying via SEPA.
If you do not comply with the data disclosure requirements Bitpanda cannot match the respective payment with your Bitpanda Client Account with the consequence that Bitpanda has to start a manual tracking process, for which Bitpanda shall charge you a processing fee in addition to any damage claims (if any) according to item 4.3.
above.

8.13.
Bitpanda reserves the right in all cases where a failure occurs with respect to payments from Bitpanda to you, which is in your sphere (e.g.
incorrect IBAN provided by you or technical failure of your payment service provider, etc) to transfer instead (parts of) available F-Token having the same value in a currency which is legal tender at the time when the failure has occurred.
The received F-Token completely replace the payment without any further claim.

8.14.
Bitpanda reserves the right to change, amend and/or disallow accepted payment methods at its own discretion.

8.15.
In the case of transferring E-Token from and to a Bitpanda System to an external blockchain, meaning out of or into a Bitpanda System,&nbsp.

8.15.1.
transaction fees or miner-fees may occur, which must be settled directly by the Bitpanda Client.

8.15.2.
the transaction-ID, as generated by the network, serves as irrefutable proof of the completed transfer of E-Token from Bitpanda to Bitpanda Client's last disclosed wallet-address.
Such transaction-ID will also be communicated to the Bitpanda Client's last disclosed email address as part of a delivery confirmation email.

8.15.3.
the transaction is completed and cannot be reversed once the transaction appears on an external blockchain network.
You are aware and accept that from this point onwards Bitpanda has no influence anymore on the transaction and whether or not you have access to such transferred E-Token via your last disclosed wallet-address.
You are aware and accept that the transfer can only be accepted by a confirmation on the blockchain and that Bitpanda assumes no liability whatsoever that such confirmation is given.
You assume full responsibility for the receipt of the adequate transaction confirmation by an external blockchain.

8.15.4.
upon the transfer of the E-Token out of a Bitpanda System the assumption of risk, especially the risk of deterioration and loss, passes to you.

8.16.
You are solely responsible for the accuracy of your own wallet-addresses outside of a Bitpanda System and for ensuring that they are correct and kept up to date.
This applies in particular to a transfer from a certain E-Token to a wallet-address which is meant for another E-Token (e.g.
Bitcoin to Litecoin).
Should the E-Token be transferred to your last disclosed wallet address, the E-Token cannot be transferred back or sent to another wallet-address.
Bitpanda assumes no liability whatsoever for any failures with respect to wallet addresses outside of a Bitpanda System.&nbsp.

8.17.
You are solely responsible for the accuracy of your own wallet-addresses inside a Bitpanda System and for ensuring that they are correct and kept up to date.
This applies in particular to a transfer from a certain E-Token to a wallet address which is meant for another E-Token (e.g.
Bitcoin to Litecoin).
Should the E-Token be transferred to your wrong E-Token Wallet, the E-Token cannot be transferred back or sent to another E-Token Wallet.
Bitpanda assumes no liability whatsoever for any failures of a Bitpanda Client with respect to wallet addresses inside a Bitpanda System.

8.18.
You are obliged to ensure that in the case of E-Token refunds which are made by third parties onto the hot wallet of Bitpanda, that these transactions can be assigned faultlessly to you.
Such a case may occur, when you transfer E-Token from Bitpanda's hot wallet to a third party and the recipient sends the appropriate refunds back to Bitpandaâs hot wallet.&nbsp.

9.
Right of withdrawal
9.1.
You must explicitly give up your 14-day right of withdrawal, from which consumers benefit according to section 11 of the "Fern- und AuswÃ¤rtsgeschÃ¤fte-Gesetz" (the "FAGG"), in order to allow Bitpanda in accordance with section 18 para 1 no 11 FAGG to transfer E-Token or any other cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units (as digital content not stored on a physical data carrier) before the right of withdrawal expires.
Bitpanda Systems transmit a confirmation of the closed contract to the respective Bitpanda Client according to section 5 para 2 of the FAGG immediately after the CCOFA.

10.
Bitpanda Pro
10.1.
In addition to the services outlined in item 3.
Bitpanda offers an exchange service enabling you to obtain prices for your purchases and sales of E-Token via Bitpanda Pro (https://exchange.bitpanda.com or its associated APIs).

You find the current rates of the Bitpanda Pro trading fees displayed on Bitpandaâs website.

11.
Bitpanda Card
11.1.
If you sign up to use the digital asset-backed debit card service (âBitpanda Cardâ) the following terms will apply and you expressly agree to these terms and conditions.

11.2.
In order to provide the Bitpanda Card Service to you, we have partnered with UAB FinansinÄs paslaugos, company code 304406236, registered in the commercial register of the Republic of Lithuania, having a head office at MÄnulio g.
11-101, Vilnius, Lithuania (âContisâ).
Contis is the issuer of the Bitpanda Card and is a member of the Visa card schemes (âVisaâ), which will be used to enable your Bitpanda Card to operate as a regular debit card.
When you sign up for the Bitpanda Card you also agree to the Contis Bitpanda Card Account Terms and Conditions (available at https://www.bitpanda.com/en/legal#terms-contis) and Contis Privacy Policy (available at https://www.bitpanda.com/en/legal#privacy-contis).

11.3.
To be able to sign up and use the Bitpanda Card you must (i) have a fully verified Bitpanda Client Account, (ii) be a resident in the Euro Area (i.e.
resident of a European Union Member State that has adopted the euro as its currency), (iii) have assets (i.e.
any kind of offered and available token within the Bitpanda system) worth an equivalent value of at least EUR 100.00 within the Bitpanda system (including Bitpanda Pro) and (iv) have downloaded and installed the Bitpanda mobile app.

11.4.
You can order a Bitpanda Card only on your legal name as registered with your Bitpanda Client Account.
Therefore, please make sure your name registered with Bitpanda is spelled correctly.
You acknowledge and accept that you are only allowed to order and have one active Bitpanda Card per Bitpanda Client Account.

11.5.
You can only use your Bitpanda Card at places where Visa credit and debit card payments are accepted.
Please note that you can connect up to two specific assets of your choice to your Bitpanda Card.
The default asset that you connect to your Bitpanda Card is called the âMain payment assetâ (e.g.
your E-Token wallet for Bitcoin) and the optional asset that will be used as a fallback asset is called the âFallback payment assetâ (e.g.
your E-Token wallet for Ethereum).
Please make sure to always have sufficient funding on your Main payment asset or Fallback payment asset as transactions can only be completed successfully if you have enough funds on these two assets.
If a payment is too big to be covered by the connected Main payment asset, the full amount will be deducted from the Fallback payment asset.
This helps to avoid failed transactions if your Main payment asset runs low on funds.
If neither the Main payment asset nor the Fallback payment asset cover the transaction costs (including fees), then the transaction will be cancelled and fail, and your card will be declined at the respective point of sale.

11.6.
Any payments and transactions made via your Bitpanda Card will be facilitated in EUR.
This means that whenever you use (i.e.
purchase or ATM withdrawal) your Bitpanda Card the following happens: 
i.
If you connected an asset other than a euro wallet as your Main payment asset and/or Fallback payment asset, then the respective amount will be automatically sold from your connected Main or Fallback payment asset to your euro wallet.
You hereby grant Bitpanda the right to conduct such automatic sales (including trading premiums).
The sale will be performed in accordance with item 3.1.1 and item 8.2.4 of these GTCs.

ii.
The respective amount sold to your euro wallet will then be deducted from your euro wallet to settle your purchase or transaction for which you used the Bitpanda Card.

11.7.
Whenever you use your Bitpanda Card and your connected Main payment asset and/or Fallback payment asset is deducted from a wallet other than a euro wallet, your respective Token will be sold and converted to your euro wallet.
For such a sale, the standard Bitpanda premium structure is applied.
Besides the trading premium, an additional ATM withdrawal fee and a foreign exchange fee is applied.
Fees may vary depending on your BEST VIP Level.
You can find a detailed overview of all the fees here bitpanda.com/card#fees.

11.8.
Please note that for certain payments and transactions such as reservations for hotels or car rentals or any other kind of deposits, we have to deduct the value of the respective payment upfront.
This means that the sale from your chosen Main payment asset and/or Fallback payment asset to your euro Wallet and the respective EUR deduction will simultaneously take place at the time you initiate such a payment or transaction.

11.9.
You acknowledge and accept that certain limits (such as but not limited to spending limits, ATM withdrawal limits, the number of transactions you may perform within a specific time frame) may be applied.
Furthermore, you acknowledge that such limits may change and/or be amended at any time at Bitpandaâs sole discretion.

11.10.
Bitpanda clients who are considered BEST VIPS are eligible to receive cashback on purchases conducted with the Bitpanda Card, if the chosen and connected Main payment asset and Fallback payment asset is an asset other than a fiat wallet (âCashbackâ).
Any Cashback will be credited and paid out solely in BTC.
The Cashback amount you may receive is a specific percentage of your purchase conducted with the Bitpanda Card and depends on your BEST VIP level.
You hereby acknowledge and accept that the Cashback feature itself, amounts of Cashback and/or forms of payouts of potential Cashback may be amended, changed or terminated at any time at Bitpandaâs sole discretion and you do not have a legal claim against Bitpanda to receive any kind of Cashback in any form.
The Cashback will be credited directly to your BTC wallet on Bitpanda after each successful transaction conducted with your Bitpanda Card.
You acknowledge and agree that the crediting of the Cashback may be delayed and Bitpanda shall not be liable for any losses arising out of or in connection with a late credit of Cashback (e.g.
losses due to price changes).

11.11.
If your BEST VIP level changes before 11:00 PM CET, such a change will be reflected in your card conditions after 23:59 CET of the same day the level changes.
For example, if you go from BEST VIP level 1 to level 2 on Monday, at 16:00 CET, then all new BEST VIP benefits for your Bitpanda Card will start to apply on the same Monday, at 23:59 CET.
Any changes in your BEST VIP level after 11 PM CET will be applied at 23:59 CET on the next day after such a change.

11.12.
Once a transaction has been completed successfully, there will be an entry in your Bitpanda history, showing all transactions (including Cashback) conducted using your Bitpanda Card.
Bitpanda will strive to ensure that the transactions shown in the Bitpanda history and in your dashboard are current and accurate at all times.
However, due to technical or other issues, discrepancies between the transactions shown in the Bitpanda history and the actual transaction might occur.
You hereby acknowledge and accept that Bitpanda will not be liable for any direct or indirect losses resulting out of any discrepancies between your Bitpanda history and the actual transaction.

11.13.
If a transaction fails, you will receive a push notification (given you have enabled push notifications) with instructions on how to proceed.
Most payments may fail due to insufficient funds in your connected wallet.
Make sure you have enough funds in your chosen Main payment asset and/or Fallback payment asset to cover the payment amount.
Transactions will also fail if you exceed your daily card limits, if your card is blocked or any other reason (such as but not limited to: you have entered an incorrect pin, your Main payment asset and/or Fallback payment asset was in maintenance mode while initiating the payment, a technical issue occurred on the merchantâs side, etc).
You acknowledge and accept that Bitpanda will not be liable for any direct or indirect losses resulting out of any failed transaction for any reason.

11.14.
If you receive a refund (for inter alia security deposits, cancelled transactions, chargebacks) such a refund will always be credited to your euro wallet, excluding Bitpanda trading- and transaction premiums.
If you have received Cashback for purchases that are, for whatever reason, refunded, you hereby grant Bitpanda the right to deduct the received Cashback directly from your euro wallet.
If your euro wallet has insufficient funds, the equivalent value will be deducted from the available Token on your Bitpanda Account.
Furthermore, you grant Bitpanda the right to deduct funds from the available Token on your Bitpanda Account, should you have used your Bitpanda Card successfully (e.g.
offline) without having enough assets on your Main or Fallback payment asset.

11.15.
From time to time, Bitpanda may add new services and promotions for the Bitpanda Card and will announce them to you accordingly.
All such new services and promotions may be amended, changed or terminated anytime at Bitpandaâs sole discretion and you do not have a legal claim against Bitpanda to receive any kind of said new services and promotions in any form.

11.16.
If you lost your Bitpanda Card, or your Bitpanda Card was stolen, we highly recommend to instantly block the Bitpanda Card in your Bitpanda mobile app.
Bitpanda will not bear any losses or damages caused due to lost or stolen cards.
In some instances, we will need to block the card for you.
This could happen for, inter alia, the following reasons: You have entered the CVV incorrectly 3 times and/or you have entered the PIN incorrectly 3 times.
Replacements for stolen or lost Bitpanda Cards may be charged with a service fee from Bitpanda.
If you received a replacement for your Bitpanda Card, you must destroy and must not use your old Bitpanda Card.

11.17.
Your Bitpanda Card will renew automatically after three years and a new card will be sent to you at no additional cost.
For further information regarding termination please see item 13.
and 19 of Contis Bitpanda Card Account Terms and Conditions.

11.18.
Please note that Bitpanda, together with Visa, makes every possible effort to use state-of-the-art technology to keep your Bitpanda Card as safe as possible.
We would urge you to also use your Bitpanda Card cautiously and apply the necessary safety measures.
Therefore, we highly recommend keeping the following in mind: Never share your CVV, PIN or SMS codes with anyone else.
Bitpanda staff members will never ask for your CVV, PIN or SMS code.
It is up to you to keep your card safe and Bitpanda does not take any responsibility for any mistakes or carelessness that may occur on your behalf.

11.19.
With the Bitpanda Card, we strive to make it as easy and convenient for you to spend your digital assets in real life.
By doing so, we encourage you to also use your Bitpanda Card in line with this intended purpose (âFair-Use-Policyâ).
Therefore, Bitpanda reserves the right to withdraw or disqualify you from using Bitpanda Card and/or exclude you from receiving any kind of Cashback, if you are having mainly and/or consistently set your euro wallet as Main payment asset, and/or if you use the Bitpanda Card in any other harmful way or if you breach any of the clauses set forth in this GTCs or any other Terms of Bitpanda Group or its partners or subsidiaries.

12.
Data Protection
12.1.

13.
Risks
13.1.
You as a Bitpanda Client understand and accept the following risks in connection with using Bitpanda Systems.
In particular, but without being limited to these examples, you understand the inherent risks set forth above and hereinafter: 
i.
Risk of software weaknesses: The underlying software application and software platform, the Bitpanda Systems, mobile applications and System technology, the smart contract systems and other involved software and technology and technical concepts and theories are still in an early development stage and unproven.
There is no guarantee or warranty that the process for receipt, use and ownership of any cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units will be uninterrupted or error-free and there is an inherent risk that the software and related technologies and theories could contain weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs causing, inter alia, the complete loss of any cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units, in particular but not limited to token, Euros or any value of any cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units.

ii.
Regulatory risk: Blockchain technologies allow new forms of interaction.
It is possible that certain jurisdictions will apply existing regulations, or introduce new regulations addressing, on blockchain technology-based applications, which may have negative influence on the current setup of the systems and which may, inter alia, result in substantial modifications to the/any cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units/Bitpanda System technology, including its termination or the loss of any cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units or any value which any cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units might have.
Bitpanda System technology is planned for a market, which is not regulated by financial markets rules.
It is the design and intended structure not to fall under any financial market rules and Bitpanda and Bitpanda Metals GmbH intend to design, modify and/or adapt the Bitpanda System technology in such way that financial market rules are not applicable on any cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units and/or Bitpanda System technology.
Respectively within the regulatory risk category also changes in the Bitpanda System technology with respect to such adaptions, amendments and re-designs may cause termination or the loss of any cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units or any value which any cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units might have.

iii.
Risk of abandonment/lack of success: The allocation of any cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units and the development of the any cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units technologies might be abandoned for a number of reasons, including lack of interest from industry, community and/or the public, lack of funding, lack of commercial success or prospects (e.g.
caused by competing projects).
Respectively even if Bitpanda System technology is partially or fully developed and launched, it could happen that any cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units do not receive any functionality.

iv.
Risk of theft and internet vulnerability: The underlying software application and software platform, the Bitpanda System technology, the smart contract system(s), other involved software, other technology components and/or platforms may be exposed to electronic or physical attacks that could result in the theft or loss of cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units, or the theft or loss of private data, impacting the ability to develop, launch or use Bitpanda System technology.
You should be aware that SMS/messages and email services are vulnerable to spoofing and phishing attacks and should use care in reviewing messages purporting to originate from Bitpanda or Bitpanda Metals GmbH.
 You should always log into your Bitpanda Client Account through https://www.bitpanda.com to review any transactions or required actions if you have any uncertainty regarding the authenticity of any communication or notice.
You should note that phishing attacks often occur despite SMS or email or equivalent services, via search engines or ads in search engines, or other fraudulent links.
Neither Bitpanda nor Bitpanda Metals GmbH take any responsibility for lost Token or any other funds due to spoofing, phishing or other equivalent attacks.

v.
Risk of blockchain mining attacks: As with any other public blockchain-based systems, the Bitpanda System technology may be susceptible to attacks including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, âselfish-miningâ attacks, and race condition attacks or any other mining or non-mining related attacks.
Any successful attacks present a risk to the Bitpanda System technology, expected proper execution and sequencing of cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units transactions and expected proper execution and sequencing of software computations.

vi.
Risk of depreciation in value/extreme volatility: As cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units are not regulated the value of cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units is assessed differently.
Respectively the value of cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units in whatever form might experience extreme volatility and/or the value of cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units might decline to zero.
As additional cost with respect to regulatory or other risks might be triggered â and if such cost are added for the purpose of calculation to the value of cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units (whatever value you might give to the cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units) â cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units might also decline in their value to zero.

vii.
General risk: There is no guarantee/warranty whatsoever on cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units and/or the success of the Bitpanda System technology, expressed or implied, to the extent permitted by law, and that cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units are created and obtained at the sole risk of the Bitpanda Client on an âas isâ and âunder developmentâ basis and without, to the extent permitted by law, any guarantees/warranties of any kind, including, but not limited to, warranties of title or implied warranties, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.

viii.
Market and community risk: You are aware of the risks of soft and hard forks and splitting including the broad possible changes to Bitpanda System technology which might be imposed by the market or community on Bitpanda/Bitpanda System technology.&nbsp.

ix.
Tax risk: The tax consequences of the allocation or purchase of cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units (in whatever form) as well as the exchange of cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units, the holding of cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units (in whatever form), the alienation of cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units (in whatever form) and/or any other action or transaction related to cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units may have tax implications at the level of a Bitpanda Client.
therefore, you should contact your own tax advisors on the tax consequences in connection with the cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units and the Bitpanda System technology.
by making a Bitpanda Client Offer to Bitpanda, using Bitpanda Pro and/or by receiving, using or holding cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units, and to the extent permitted by law, you agree not to hold any associated party (including Bitpanda, Bitpanda's auditors, Bitpanda's contractors, Bitpanda's advisors, Bitpanda's employees or Bitpanda's founders) liable for any tax liability associated with or arising from making an Bitpanda Client Offer, using Bitpanda Pro, the allocation, use or ownership of cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units or any other action or transaction related to cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units.

GTC.


2.
Orders
2.1.
You can instruct to buy or sell a specified quantity of Base Token at a specified price in the Quote Token (Order) provided that you have the required positive Balance of the relevant Token on your Bitpanda Pro Account which covers the total value of the Order and any applicable fees.
With placing an Order, the respective specified quantity of Token of such Order is set aside.
For purposes of effectuating a trade, you authorise Bitpanda to take temporary control of the Token that you are disposing of in the respective Order.

2.2.
On Bitpanda Pro you can place an Order as a Limit, Market or Stop Order.
You can cancel an Open Order at any time before it is executed, and no fees will be charged for cancelled Orders.&nbsp.

2.3.
Limit Orders 
2.3.1.
A Limit Order will be immediately placed in the Order Book and may result in a Maker Order or a Taker Order, or an Order that is partially a Maker Order and partially a Taker Order.
The placed Order will remain on the Order Book until you cancel it.

2.4.
Market Orders 
2.4.1 Bitpanda cannot and does not guarantee that a Market Order will be executed at a specified price.
You agree and accept that a Market Order may execute at a number of different prices, based on the quantity of the Market Order and the quantities of the existing Orders on the Order Book at the time.
In particular, you are aware and accept that a Market Order may execute at a price less favourable than the most recent trade price, in some cases significantly less.

2.4.2.
A Market Order is always a Taker Order.&nbsp.

2.5.
Stop Orders 
2.5.1.
A Stop Order must be placed as a Stop Limit Order which posts a Limit Order when the stop price is triggered.

the Limit Order when the stop price is triggered) is posted and visible.&nbsp.

2.5.2.
You are aware and acknowledge that a Stop Limit Order is not guaranteed to execute.
The placed Order will remain on the Order Book until you cancel it or until it gets completely executed.&nbsp.

2.7.1.
Execution takes place provided that a Maker Order matches with a Taker Order and an Order may be matched with one or more Orders at the same price.
The matched Orders will be settled by Bitpanda immediately in form of the respective debits and credits to the involved Bitpanda Pro Accounts.&nbsp.

2.8.
Matching engine and order priorities 
2.8.1.
Bitpanda Pro matches Taker Orders with Open Maker Orders on each Order Book based on price-time priority.
This means that each time a Taker Order is placed this order is matched with the earliest in time Maker Order at the best price on the Order Book.
Should the Taker Order not be completely fulfilled, it may be matched with any subsequent Maker Orders at that price, in the sequence those Maker Orders were posted.
Should such a Taker Order still not be completely executed as described previously, it is matched with one or more Maker Orders at the next best price, in the sequence those Maker Orders were posted.
This process is repeated until the Taker Order is completely executed.&nbsp.

2.9.
Trading fees 
2.9.1.
Orders are charged with a maker fee for each Maker Order and a taker fee for each Taker Order posted on the Order Book.
Fees will be charged in the Token you receive and are calculated as a percentage of the Order quantity.
For example: on the BTC-EUR Order Book, you, as a buyer of BTC, pay fees in BTC and the seller of BTC pays fees in EUR.
Fees are charged on a per trade basis and will be deducted automatically once an Order is matched.
If an Order qualifies partially as a Maker Order and partially as a Taker Order, a maker fee applies to the part posted as a Maker Order and a taker fee applies to the part posted as a Taker Order.&nbsp.

2.9.2.
You are aware and accept that trading fees may vary from time to time and between Order Books.
Any such updated fees will apply prospectively to any Orders or other transactions that take place following the effective date of such updated fees.

The remainder of the larger Order remains open.

2.12.2.
Further, you are prohibited from engaging in any market manipulation (specifically includes, without limitation: front-running, wash trading, spoofing, layering, churning, and quote stuffing).

Annex III
Bitpanda Fork Policy 


A fork is a situation in which a blockchain splits into two separate chains temporarily or permanently ("Fork").
Forks are a natural occurrence during mining, where two chains following the same consensus rules temporarily have the same accumulated proof-of-work and are both considered valid.
They can also occur as a consequence of the use of two distinct sets of rules trying to govern the same blockchain.
Forks have been used in cryptocurrencies in order to add new features to a blockchain or to reverse the effects of hacking or catastrophic bugs on a blockchain as was the case with the fork between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.
Notably, Forks have been widely discussed in the context of the bitcoin scalability problem.



Bitpanda does not automatically support Forks of any cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units.



Bitpanda assesses each case, and each Fork on a case by case basis and Bitpanda may at its sole discretion decide whether to support a Fork or not and whether to communicate that to you or not.



If Bitpanda decides not to support a Fork but you want to participate in a Fork, you would have to move the respective E-Token onto such third-party wallet which you think fits for supporting such a Fork.
Bitpanda herewith advises you to take enough time into consideration to move the respective E-Token, because Bitpanda cannot and will not give any guarantees to any transfers out of/outside of Bitpanda Systems.
Bitpanda does not advise on how much time is enough but suggests that you carefully consider all relevant facts.



You must monitor the market by yourself to stay informed about Forks.
Bitpanda has no duty to inform you of any Forks.



Bitpanda may decide at its sole discretion to suspend/temporarily shut down any exchange, trading or any transaction with respect to E-Token which are part of a Fork or influenced by a Fork to a major extent.
This applies to Forks which are supported by Bitpanda and also to Forks which are not supported by Bitpanda.&nbsp.



If Bitpanda decides â at Bitpanda's sole discretion â to try to support a Fork, Bitpanda shall decide which chain is the original blockchain in the fork scenario.
Consequently, Bitpanda shall inform you of such decisions and will endeavour to integrate the new cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units resulting from the Fork into Bitpanda Systems.
However, Bitpanda gives no guarantee that such integration takes place and shall inform you at its sole discretion on when and how and at which distribution rate such new cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units resulting from the Fork can be used in Bitpanda Systems.
Respectively, Bitpanda holds any resulting new cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units balances for and on behalf of you from the time of the split until the time of distribution to you in cold storage (meaning offline).
You are aware and accept that it is impossible to withdraw/or transfer any such new cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units balances out of a supported Fork until Bitpanda decides at Bitpanda's sole discretion to go live with such new cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units in Bitpanda Systems.
You are aware and accept that there might be situations where Bitpanda may decide in a commercially reasonable way not to integrate such new cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units in  Bitpanda Systems and that in such cases you have no right to claim damages or compensation of any kind from Bitpanda.
You are aware that Bitpanda will always only try to integrate new cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units but in no case gives any guarantee that such integration can be done or is fixed for a certain point in time.
