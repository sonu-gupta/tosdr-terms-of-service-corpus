In order to further effect the rights and license that you grant to 4âH to your User-Generated Content, you also hereby grant to 4âH, and agree to grant to 4âH, the unconditional, perpetual, irrevocable right to use and exploit your name, persona, and likeness in connection with any User-Generated Content, and that of any other person depicted in or otherwise included in your User-Generated Content, without any obligation or remuneration to you or any other party.
Except as prohibited by law, you hereby waive, and you agree to waive, any moral rights (including attribution and integrity) that you may have in any User-Generated Content, even if it is altered or changed in a manner not agreeable to you.
To the extent not waivable, you irrevocably agree not to exercise such rights (if any) in a manner that interferes with any exercise of the granted rights.
You understand that you will not receive any fees, sums, consideration, or remuneration for any of the rights granted in these Terms.
We do not want you to, and you should not, send any confidential or proprietary information to us via the Site.
Except as otherwise described in the Siteâs posted Privacy Policy or any Additional Terms, you agree that, notwithstanding your retained ownership interests (a) any information that you or individuals acting on your behalf provide to us will not be considered confidential or proprietary by us â regardless of whether you mark them âconfidential,â âproprietary,â or the like â and will not be returned, and (b) to the maximum extent not prohibited by applicable law, 4âH does not assume any obligation of any kind to you or any third party with respect to your User-Generated Content.
By providing any such information, you grant us an unrestricted, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, display, publicly perform, transmit and distribute such information.
You further recognize that we do not want you to, and you warrant that you shall not, download, upload or otherwise provide any information to us that is defamatory, threatening, obscene, harassing or otherwise unlawful, or that incorporates the proprietary material of another.

In addition, 4âH retains all of the rights held by members of the general public with regard to your Unsolicited Ideas and Materials.
4âHâs receipt of your Unsolicited Ideas and Materials is not an admission by 4âH of their novelty, priority, or originality, and it does not impair 4âHâs right to contest existing or future intellectual property rights relating to your Unsolicited Ideas and Materials.
4âH may, but will not have any obligation to, review, monitor, display, post, store, maintain, accept, or otherwise make use of, any of your User-Generated Content, and 4âH may, in its sole discretion, reject, delete, move, re-format, remove or refuse to post or otherwise make use of User-Generated Content without notice or any liability to you or any third party in connection with our operation of User-Generated Content venues in an appropriate manner.

As a user of the Site, these Community Usage Rules (âRulesâ) are here to help you understand the conduct that is expected of members of the Siteâs online communities (âCommunitiesâ).
Your participation in the Communities is subject to all of the Terms, including these Rules:

Your User-Generated Content.
All of your User-Generated Content either must be original with you or you must have all necessary rights in it from third parties in order to permit you to comply with these Terms and any applicable Additional Terms.
Your User-Generated Content should not contain any visible logos, phrases, or trademarks that belong to third parties.
Do not use any User-Generated Content that belongs to other people and pass it off as your own.
this includes any content that you might have found elsewhere on the Internet.
If anyone contributes to your User-Generated Content or has any rights to your User-Generated Content, or if anyone appears or is referred to in the User-Generated Content, then you must also have their permission to submit such User-Generated Content to 4âH.
(For example, if someone has taken a picture of you and your friend, and you submit that photo to 4âH as your User-Generated Content, then you must obtain your friendâs and the photographerâs permission to do so.)
Speaking of Photos: No Pictures, Videos, or Images of Anyone Other Than You and Your Friends and Family.
If you choose to submit photos to the Site, link to embedded videos, or include other images of real people, then make sure they are of you or of you and someone you know â and only if you have their express permission to submit it.
Act Appropriately.
All of your Site activities must be venue appropriate, as determined by us.
Be respectful of othersâ opinions and comments so we can continue to build Communities for everyone to enjoy.
If you think your User-Generated Content might offend someone or be embarrassing to someone, then chances are it probably will and it doesnât belong on the Site.
Cursing, harassing, stalking, insulting comments, personal attacks, gossip, and similar actions are prohibited.
Your User-Generated Content must not threaten, abuse, or harm others, and it must not include any negative comments that are connected to race, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or physical handicap.
Your User-Generated Content must not be defamatory, slanderous, indecent, obscene, pornographic, or sexually explicit.
Your User-Generated Content must not exploit children under the age of 18.
Do Not Use for Commercial or Political Purposes.
Your User-Generated Content must not advertise or promote a product or service or other commercial activity, or a politician, public servant, or law.
Do Not Use to Solicit or Send Unwanted Communications.
Do not harvest or collect email addresses or other contact information of others from the Site by electronic or other means for the purposes of sending unsolicited emails or other unsolicited communications.
Do not solicit personal information from anyone or solicit passwords or personally identifying information for commercial or unlawful purposes.
This also includes not uploading, posting, transmitting, sharing or otherwise making available any unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, solicitations, promotional materials, âjunk mail,â âspam,â âchain letters,â âpyramid schemes,â or any other form of solicitation.
Do Not Use for Inappropriate Purposes.
Your User-Generated Content must not promote any infringing, illegal, or other similarly inappropriate activity.
Be Honest and Do Not Misrepresent Yourself or Your User-Generated Content.
Do not impersonate any other person, user, or company, and do not submit User-Generated Content that you believe may be false, fraudulent, deceptive, inaccurate, or misleading, or that misrepresents your identity or affiliation with a person or company.
Others Can See.
We hope that you will use the Communities to exchange information and content and have venue appropriate discussions with other members.
However, please remember that the Communities are public or semi-public and User-Generated Content that you submit on the Site within a Community may be accessible and viewable by other users.
Do not submit personally identifying information (e.g., first and last name together, password, phone number, address, credit card number, medical information, email address, or other personally identifiable information or contact information) on Community spaces and take care when disclosing this type of information to others.
Donât Share Other Peopleâs Personal Content.
Your User-Generated Content should not reveal another personâs address, phone number, email address, social security number, credit card number, medical information, financial information, or any other information that may be used to track, contact, or impersonate that individual, unless, and in the form and by the method, specifically requested by 4âH (e.g., an email address to send an email invite to a friend).
Donât Damage the Site or Anyoneâs Computers or Other Devices.
Your User-Generated Content must not submit viruses, Trojan horses, spyware, or any other technologies or malicious code that could impact the operation of the Site or any computer or other Device.

If you submit User-Generated Content that 4âH reasonably believes violates these Rules, then we may take any legally available action that we deem appropriate, in our sole discretion.
However, we are not obligated to take any action not required by law.
We may require, at any time, proof of the permissions referred to above in a form acceptable to us.
Failure to provide such proof may lead to, among other things, the User-Generated Content in question being removed from the Site.
You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Site, whether online or offline.
We are not responsible or liable for the conduct or content of any user.
We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor or become involved in disputes between you and other users.
Exercise common sense and your best judgment in your interactions with others (e.g., when you submit any personal or other information) and in all of your other online activities.
In using the Site, you must respect the intellectual property and other rights of 4âH and others.
Your unauthorized use of Content may violate copyright, trademark, privacy, publicity, communications, and other laws, and any such use may result in your personal liability, including potential criminal liability.

Any unauthorized use of any Content or the Site for any purpose is prohibited.

4âH respects the intellectual property rights of others.

If you are under the age of thirteen (13), then you are not permitted to register as a user, or otherwise submit personal information to us.
If you register for any feature that requires a password and/or username, then you will select your own password at the time of registration (or we may send you an email notification with a randomly generated initial password) and you agree that: (i) You will not use a username (or email address) that is already being used by someone else, may impersonate another person, belongs to another person, violates the intellectual property or other right of any person or entity, or is offensive.
We may reject the use of any password, username, or email address for any other reason in our sole discretion.

We also reserve the more general and broad right to terminate your Account or suspend or otherwise deny you access to it or its benefits â all in our sole discretion, for any reason, and without advance notice or liability.

Procedure For Alleging Copyright Infringement
4âH asks our users to respect the intellectual property rights of others.
It is our policy to respond appropriately to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement, as set forth more fully below.
In 4âHâs sole discretion, 4âH may remove content that may be infringing on another personâs intellectual property rights with or without notice to the potential infringer.
In accordance with the U.S.
Digital Millennium Copyright Act (âDMCAâ) and other applicable law, 4âH has adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances, users who are deemed to be repeat infringers.
If we remove or disable access in response to a DMCA Notice (as defined below), we will make a good faith attempt to contact the owner or administrator of the affected site or content so that they may make a counter-notification.
If you own a copyright in a work (or represent such a copyright owner) and believe that your (or such ownerâs) copyright in that work has been infringed by an improper posting or distribution of it via the Site, then you may send us a written notice that includes all of the following:
(i) a legend or subject line that says: âDMCA Copyright Infringement Noticeâ;
(ii) a description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed or, if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works;
(iii) a description of where the material that you claim is infringing or is the subject of infringing activity is located that is reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material (please include the URL of the Site on which the material appears);
(iv) your full name, address, telephone number, and email address;
(v) a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;
(vi) a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that all the information in your notice is accurate, and that you are the copyright owner (or, if you are not the copyright owner, then your statement must indicate that you are authorized to act on the behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed).
and
(vii) your electronic or physical signature.
4âH will only respond to DMCA Notices that it receives by mail, email, or facsimile at the addresses below:

By Mail:

National 4âH Council
7100 Connecticut Ave.
Chevy Chase, MD 20815

By Email: http://4âH.org/contact/

By Facsimile: 1-301-961-2894
It is often difficult to determine if your copyright has been infringed.
4âH may elect to not respond to DMCA Notices that do not substantially comply with all of the foregoing requirements, and 4âH may elect to remove allegedly infringing material that comes to its attention via notices that do not substantially comply with the DMCA.
Please note that the DMCA provides that any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be subject to liability.
We may send the information that you provide in your notice to the person who provided the allegedly infringing work.
That person may elect to send us a DMCA Counter-Notification.
Without limiting 4âHâs other rights, 4âH may, in appropriate circumstances, terminate a repeat infringerâs access to the Site and any other website owned or operated by 4âH.
If access on the Site to a work that you submitted to 4âH is disabled or the work is removed as a result of a DMCA Notice, and if you believe that the disabled access or removal is the result of mistake or misidentification, then you may send us a DMCA Counter-Notification to the addresses above.
Your DMCA Counter-Notification should contain the following information:
(i) a legend or subject line that says: âDMCA Counter-Notificationâ;
(ii) a description of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled (please include the URL of the Site from which the material was removed or access to it disabled);
(iii) a statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled;
(iv) your full name, address, telephone number, email address, and the username of your account;
(v) a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located (or, if the address is located outside the U.S.A., to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Central District of California), and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided DMCA notification to us or an agent of such person.
and
(vi) your electronic or physical signature.
Please note that the DMCA provides that any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification may be subject to liability.
If we receive a DMCA Counter-Notification, then we may replace the material that we removed (or stop disabling access to it) in not less than ten (10) and not more than fourteen (14) business days following receipt of the DMCA Counter-Notification.
However, we will not do this if we first receive notice at the addresses above that the party who sent us the DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice has filed a lawsuit asking a court for an order restraining the person who provided the material from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on the Site.
You should also be aware that we may forward the Counter-Notification to the party who sent us the DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice.

Finally, we will under no circumstances be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental or special loss or other damage, whether arising from negligence, breach of contract, defamation, infringement of copyright or other intellectual property rights, caused by the exhibition, distribution or exploitation of any information or content contained within these Third Party Services.
Any activities you engage in connection with any of the same are subject to the privacy and other policies, terms and conditions of use and/or sale, and rules issued by the operator of the Third Party Services.
4âH disclaims all liability in connection therewith.

You hereby agree to indemnify 4âH against all claims, injury and/or damages including, without limitation, attorneysâ fees, that arise out of your use of any Third Party Service, including without limitation from any material that you post on any forum or social networking site in connection with us and/or any other claim related to your use of social media.
You hereby grant 4âH an irrevocable perpetual license to use, reproduce, edit, create derivative works from, distribute, display, copy, transmit or otherwise use in any way, commercially or otherwise, any material that you post to any social networking site or other Third Party Service in connection with us or our Service.

The most current version of this Dispute Agreement in effect when any Dispute arises shall govern resolution of any Dispute.
Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees (âArbitration Feesâ) will be governed by the AAAâs rules.
You agree to commence arbitration only in your county of residence or in Chevy Chase, Maryland.
The arbitration will be conducted based on written submissions unless you request a phone or in-person hearing, or the arbitrator determines that a phone or in-person hearing is necessary.
The arbitrator may only award those damages and relief as a court could, and must follow the terms and conditions of the Agreement and this Dispute Agreement.

Limited Time To File Claims.
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU OR WE WANT TO ASSERT A DISPUTE (BUT NOT AN EXCLUDED DISPUTE) AGAINST THE OTHER, THEN YOU OR WE MUST COMMENCE IT (BY DELIVERY OF WRITTEN NOTICE AS SET FORTH IN THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTION SECTION WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE DISPUTE ARISES â OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED.

Injunctive Relief.
The foregoing provisions of this Dispute Resolution Section will not apply to any legal action taken by 4âH to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in connection with, any loss, cost, or damage (or any potential loss, cost, or damage) relating to the Site, any Content, your User-Generated Content and/or 4âHâs intellectual property rights (including such 4âH may claim that may be in dispute), 4âHâs operations, and/or 4âHâs products or services.

No Class Action Matters.
Disputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be joined or consolidated with any other arbitrations or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party.
YOU AND 4âH AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
There shall be no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on any basis involving Disputes brought to a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, or other persons or entities similarly situated.
But if, for any reason, any court with competent jurisdiction holds that this restriction is unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement in this Dispute Resolution Section to arbitrate will not apply and the Dispute must be brought exclusively in court pursuant to this Dispute Resolution Section.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Dispute Resolution Section, any and all issues relating to the scope, interpretation and enforceability of this Dispute Resolution Section, including the class action waiver provisions contained herein, are to be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction, and not by the arbitrator.

Except to the extent that arbitration is required in this Dispute Resolution Section, and except as to the enforcement of any arbitration decision or award, any action or proceeding relating to any Dispute or Excluded Dispute may only be instituted in state or Federal court in Chevy Chase, Montgomery County, Maryland.
Accordingly, you and 4âH consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts for such matters.
