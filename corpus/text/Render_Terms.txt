Governing Law, Arbitration, and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver



Governing Law. You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in California.
and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California.
This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles.
The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C.
Â§Â§ 1-16).
The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in San Francisco County, California for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm.
You agree that San Francisco County, California is the proper forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the event that the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.



Arbitration. Read this section carefully because it requires the parties to arbitrate their disputes and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from Render.
For any dispute with Render, you agree to first contact us at legal@render.com and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally.
In the unlikely event that Render has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as provided below) arising out of or in connection with or relating to this Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, âClaimsâ), by binding arbitration by JAMS, under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS, except as provided herein.
JAMS may be contacted at www.jamsadr.com.
The arbitration will be conducted in San Francisco County, California, unless you and Render agree otherwise.
If you are using the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneysâ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses.
If you are an individual using the Service for non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS.
(ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorneyâs fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses.
and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process.
Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing Render from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights.



Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver. With respect to all persons and entities, regardless of whether they have obtained or used the Service for personal, commercial or other purposes, all Claims must be brought in the partiesâ individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action, collective action, private attorney general action or other representative proceeding.
This waiver applies to class arbitration, and, unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one personâs Claims.
You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and Render are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action, collective action, private attorney general action, or other representative proceeding of any kind.


14.
General



Assignment. This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Render without restriction.
Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.



Notification Procedures and Changes to the Agreement. Render may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by Render in our sole discretion.

When we change the Agreement in a material manner, we will update the âlast modifiedâ date at the top of this page and notify you that material changes have been made to the Agreement.
Your continued use of the Service after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Service.
If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future Terms of Service, do not use or access (or continue to access) the Service.



Entire Agreement/Severability. This Agreement, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Render in connection with the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Render concerning the Service.
If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect, except that in the event of unenforceability of the universal Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver, the entire arbitration agreement shall be unenforceable.



No Waiver. No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Renderâs failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
