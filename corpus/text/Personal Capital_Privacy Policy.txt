When we talk about affiliated companies, we mean Personal Capital Corporation and its subsidiaries - Personal Capital Advisors Corporation and Personal Capital Services Corporation, as well as affiliated Empower Retirement branded companies.

Our Use of Google Analytics
We use Google Analytics to help us understand how you interact with our website and mobile app, market our products and services to you, and to improve the User experience.
To do this, we share a unique identifier with Google.
For information on how Google Analytics collects and processes data, as well as how you can control information sent to Google, see âHow Google uses data when you use our partnersâ sites or appsâ linked here.
You can learn about Google Analyticsâ currently available opt-outs, including the Google Analytics Browser Ad-On, here.

Our Use of Tags, Pixels, Cookies and Other Trackers
Tags, pixels and cookies are bits of code that we use to gather information to operate and measure engagement with our site.
These generally fall into two categories:

User Experience â Information that helps us determine which features are most popular with our users, provide content and offers that are relevant to a userâs financial situation or site engagement, market our products and services to you, and identify errors or other technical issues on our site.
and
Marketing Attribution â Information that allows us to track the effectiveness of advertising we run on other sites and to manage our affiliate marketing program.
For example, marketing pixels operate by sending a small amount of information when triggered by specific events, such as when a user registers on our site after clicking through a promotional link on another site.
To do this, the pixel uses a unique identifier that does not contain personally identifying information to connect that data (user registration) back to the action (clicking on the link).

To implement the features described above, Personal Capital contracts with trusted service providers to place tags on the Personal Capital applications.
These service providers are prohibited from using any Personal Information they collect on our behalf for any purpose other than providing services to Personal Capital.
