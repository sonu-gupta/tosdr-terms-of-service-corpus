affiliate links:

Sometime I share products for infants and toddlers that I have either used with my own children or recommend to my students.
I will only recommend products that Iâm familiar with and love.
Youâll also find Amazon affiliate links because I love their service and prices (and fast shipping!).
If you make a purchase via an Amazon link I get a small commission (at no extra cost to you) â this helps support my small business and I really appreciate it!
