CCPA Do Not Sell

In 2020, we did not âsellâ PI, and we will not sell your PI collected by us during a period in which we did not offer you the opportunity to opt out of the sale, unless we first obtain your affirmative consent to do so.
We may disclose your PI for the following purposes, which are not sales: (i) if you direct us to share PI.
(ii) to comply with your requests under the CCPA.
(iii) disclosures among the Tidio companies.
(iv) as part of a merger or asset sale.
and (v) as otherwise required or permitted by applicable laws.




Consistent with the CCPA and our interest in the security of your PI, in response to a CCPA rights request from you, even if we are in possession of the following, we will not deliver to you a Social Security number.
driverâs license number or other government-issued ID numbers.
financial account number.
any health or medical identification number.
an account password.
security questions or answers in response to your security questions.
or unique biometric data generated from measurements or technical analysis of human characteristics.
However, you may be able to access some of this information yourself through your account if available and if you have an active account with us.

CCPA Right-to-Know Categories Request â You have the right to send us a request, no more than twice in a twelve (12)-month period, for any of the following for the period that is twelve (12) months prior to the request date:

The categories of PI we have collected about you.
The categories of sources from which we collected your PI.


The business or commercial purposes for our collecting your PI.


The categories of third parties to whom we have disclosed your PI.


A list of the categories of PI disclosed for a business purpose in the prior twelve (12) months and, for each, the categories of recipients, or that no disclosure occurred.


A list of the categories of PI sold about you in the prior twelve (12) months and, for each, the categories of recipients, or that no sale occurred.





CCPA Specific Pieces of PI Request â You have the right to make or obtain a transportable copy, no more than twice in a twelve (12)-month period, of your PI that we have collected in the period that is twelve (12) months prior to the request date and are maintaining.

CCPA Deletion Request â You may request that we delete the PI that we have collected directly from you and are maintaining.
However, we may have a basis for the retention of your PI under the CCPA.
Our retention rights include (i) to complete transactions and services you have requested or that are reasonably anticipated.
(ii) for security purposes.
and (iii) for legitimate internal business purposes, including to maintain business records, to comply with law, to exercise or defend legal claims, and to cooperate with law enforcement.
Note also that we are not required to delete your PI that we did not collect directly from you.

Third-Party Marketing and Other California Privacy Rights

We provide California residents with the option to opt in to sharing of âpersonal information,â as defined by Californiaâs âShine the Lightâ law, with third parties, other than our affiliates, for such third partiesâ own direct marketing purposes.
California residents may prospectively withdraw that consent, and/or request information about our compliance with the Shine the Light law, and obtain a disclosure of third parties we have shared information with in accordance with the law for those companies direct marketing purposes and the categories of information shared.
To obtain such information, email us here, or write us at 160 Spear Street, #1000, San Francisco, CA 94105, U.S.A.
(Attn: California Privacy Rights Request).
Requests must include your name, street address, city, state, and ZIP code.
Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through the provided email address or postal address.
As these rights and your CCPA rights are not the same and exist under different laws, you must exercise your rights under each law separately.

California Minors â As noted above, Tidio is intended for a general audience and not directed to children less than thirteen (13) years of age.

Nevada Residents
Nevada law allows customers to âopt outâ of the sale of certain personal information, called âcovered information.â We do not sell covered information as defined in the law, and we have no plans to change that practice.
If you want to be notified if we do change that practice, you may email us here and provide your name, Nevada resident address, and email address.
We will contact you if there are any changes, and you can complete your opt out at that time.
If your contact information changes at any point, contact us in the same manner to update your contact information.
We may share your data as explained in this Privacy Policy for different purposes, such as to make your experience and our Application Services better, and those activities are separate from your opt-out request.
