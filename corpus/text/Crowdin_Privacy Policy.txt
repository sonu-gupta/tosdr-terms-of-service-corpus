THIRD-PARTY SERVICES

The Service may contain features or links to web sites and services provided by third parties.
Any information you provide on third-party sites or services is provided directly to the operators of such services and is subject to those operatorsâ policies, if any, governing privacy and security, even if accessed through the Service.
We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of third-party sites or services to which links or access are provided through the Service.
We encourage you to learn about third partiesâ privacy and security policies before providing them with information. 7.
INTEREST BASED ADVERTISING

Interest based advertising is the collection of data from different sources and across different platforms in order to predict an individualâs preferences or interest and to deliver to that individual, or his/her computer, smart phone or tablet, advertising based on his/her assumed preference or interest inferred from the collection of data pertaining to that individual or others who may have a similar profile or similar interests.
We work with a variety of third parties to attempt to understand the profiles of the individuals who are most likely to be interested in the Crowdin products or services so that we can send them promotional emails, or serve our advertisements to them on the websites and mobile apps of other entities.
These third parties include: (i) advertising networks, which collect information about a personâs interests when that person views or interacts with one of their advertisements.
(ii) attribution partners, which measure the effectiveness of certain advertisements.
and (iii) business partners, which collect information when a person views or interacts with one of their advertisements.
In collaboration with these third parties, we collect information about our customers, prospects and other individuals over time and across different platforms when they use these platforms or interact with them.
Individuals may submit information directly on our Sites or on platforms run by third parties, or by interacting with us, our advertisements, or emails they receive from us or from third parties.
We may use special tools that are commonly used for this purpose, such as cookies, pixels, and similar technologies.
We may have access to databases of information collected by our business partners.
The information we or third party collect enables us to learn what purchases the person made, what ads or content the person sees, on which ads or links the person clicks, and other actions that the person takes on our Sites, or in response to our emails, or when visiting or using third partiesâ platforms.
We, or the third parties with which we work, use the information collected as described above to understand the various activities and behaviors of our customers, Site visitors and others.
We, or these third parties, do this for many reasons, including: to recognize new or past visitors to our Sites.
to present more personalized content.
to provide more useful and relevant ads - for example, if we know what ads you are shown we can try not to show you the same ones repeatedly.
to identify visitors across devices, sales channels, third party websites and Sites, or to display or send personalized or targeted ads and other custom content that is more focused on a personâs perceived interest in products or services similar to those that we offer.
Our interest-based ads may be served to you in emails or on third-party platforms.
We may serve these ads about our products or services or send commercial communications directly ourselves or through these third parties.
Crowdin does not provide any personal information to the third party sites that display interest-based ads promoting Crowdin. 8.
THIRD PARTY COOKIES

We allow third parties with which we have a separate agreement to use cookies and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Site.
These third parties include (i) business partners, which collect information when you view or interact with one of their advertisements on the Site.
and (ii) advertising networks, which collect information about your interests when you view or interact with one of their advertisements.
The information gathered by these third parties is used to make predictions about your interests or preferences so that they can display advertisements or promotional material on this Site and on other sites across the Internet tailored to your apparent interests.
The business partners and advertising networks that serve interest-based advertisements on the Services have limited access to a small amount of information about your profile and your device, which is necessary to serve you advertisements that are tailored to your apparent interests.
It is possible that they may reuse this small amount of information on other sites or services.
We do not share with these third parties any information that would readily identify you (such as email address).
however, these third parties may have access to information about your device (such as IP or MAC address).
We do not have access to, or control over, the technologies that these third parties may use to collect information about your interests, and the information practices of these third parties are not covered by this Privacy Notice.
Other than as discussed in this document, we have no control over these third parties. 8.1 The Following Types of Cookies Are Used in the Site 
strictly necessary/essential cookies - These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the website.
Without these cookies services you have asked for cannot be provided.
These cookies donât collect information that identifies a visitor.

For more information about these and a full list of the cookies we use, what they do, and how to disable the non-necessary ones, please refer to our full Cookie Statement . 9.
MINORS AND CHILDRENâS PRIVACY Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important.
Our Service is not directed to children under the age of 18, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 18 without obtaining parental consent.
If you are under 18 years of age, then please do not use or access the Service at any time or in any manner.
If we learn that Personal Data has been collected on the Service from persons under 18 years of age and without verifiable parental consent, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.
If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under 18 years of age has obtained an Account on the Service, then you may alert us at privacy@crowdin.com and request that we delete that childâs Personal Data from our systems.
The Service is not intended to be used by minors, and is not intended to be used to post content to share publicly or with friends.
To the extent that a minor has posted such content on the Service, the minor has the right to have this content deleted or removed using the deletion or removal options detailed in this Privacy Policy.
If you have any question regarding this topic, please contact us as indicated in the âHow to Contact Usâ section.
Please be aware that, although we offer this deletion capability, the removal of content may not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of that content or information. 10.
DATA SECURITY

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
We maintain appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, unauthorized alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, misuse, and any other unlawful form of processing of the Personal Data in our possession.
This includes, for example, firewalls, password protection and other access and authentication controls.
We use SSL technology to encrypt data during transmission through public internet, and we also employ application-layer security features to further anonymize Personal Data.
However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.
We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or store on the Service, and you do so at your own risk.
We also cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
If you believe your Personal Data has been compromised, please contact us as set forth in the âHow to Contact Usâ section.
If we learn of a security systems breach, we will inform you and the authorities of the occurrence of the breach in accordance with applicable law. 11.
DATA RETENTION

We only retain the Client Data collected from a User for as long as the Userâs account is active or otherwise for a limited period of time as long as we need it to fulfill the purposes for which we have initially collected it, unless otherwise required by law.
We will retain and use information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements as follows:

the Client Data of closed accounts are deleted within 3 months of the date of closure

 12.
SETTINGS

Although we may allow you to adjust your privacy settings to limit access to certain Personal Data, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.
We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures on the Service.
Additionally, we cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your information.
Further, even after information posted on the Service is removed, caching and archiving services may have saved that information, and other users or third parties may have copied or stored the information available on the Service.
We cannot and do not guarantee that information you post on or transmit to the Service will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. 13.
DATA TRANSFER

We may transfer, process and store Personal Data we collect through the Services in centralized databases and with service providers located in the U.S.
The U.S.
may not have the same data protection framework as the country from which you may be using the Services.
When we transfer Personal Data to the U.S., we will protect it as described in this Privacy Policy.
The Service is hosted in the United States or Germany.
Regardless of the database being hosted in the EU, if you choose to use the Service from the European Union or other regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S.
law, then please note that you may be transferring your Client Data and Personal Data outside of those regions to the United States for storage and processing by our service providers listed in the Crowdin Terms of Service.
We will comply with GDPR requirements providing adequate protection for the transfer of personal information from Europe to the U.S.
Also, we may transfer your data to the U.S., the EEA, or other countries or regions deemed by the European Commission to provide adequate protection of personal data in connection with storage and processing of data, fulfilling your requests, and operating the Service. 14.
DATA CONTROLLER AND DATA PROCESSOR

Crowdin does not own, control or direct the use of any of the Client Data stored or processed by a Client or User via the Service.
Only the Client or Users are entitled to access, retrieve and direct the use of such Client Data.
Crowdin is largely unaware of what Client Data is actually being stored or made available by a Client or User to the Service and does not directly access such Client Data except as authorized by the Client, or as necessary to provide Services to the Client and its Users.
Because Crowdin does not collect or determine the use of any Personal Data contained in the Client Data and because it does not determine the purposes for which such Personal Data is collected, the means of collecting such Personal Data, or the uses of such Personal Data, Crowdin is not acting in the capacity of data controller in terms of the European Unionâs General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679, hereinafter âGDPRâ) and does not have the associated responsibilities under the GDPR.
Crowdin should be considered only as a processor on behalf of its Clients and Users as to any Client Data containing Personal Data that is subject to the requirements of the GDPR.
Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, Crowdin does not independently cause Client Data containing Personal Data stored in connection with the Services to be transferred or otherwise made available to third parties, except to third party subcontractors who may process such data on behalf of Crowdin in connection with Crowdinâs provision of Services to Clients.
Such actions are performed or authorized only by the applicable Client or User.
The Client or the User is the data controller under the Regulation for any Client Data containing Personal Data, meaning that such party controls the manner such Personal Data is collected and used as well as the determination of the purposes and means of the processing of such Personal Data.
Crowdin is not responsible for the content of the Personal Data contained in the Client Data or other information stored on its servers (or its subcontractorsâ servers) at the discretion of the Client or User nor is Crowdin responsible for the manner in which the Client or User collects, handles disclosure, distributes or otherwise processes such information.
If you need a signed Data Processing Addendum in addition to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, you can find the document signed on behalf of Crowdin here. 15.
CHANGES AND UPDATES TO THIS POLICY

Please revisit this page periodically to stay aware of any changes to this Policy, which we may update from time to time.
If we modify the Policy, we will make it available through the Service, and indicate the date of the latest revision, and will comply with applicable law.
