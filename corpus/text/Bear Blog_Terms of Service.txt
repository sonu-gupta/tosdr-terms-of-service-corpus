Your bearblog.dev Account
If you create a blog on bearblog.dev, you get to use a Bear-owned subdomain, such as example.bearblog.dev.
You must not engage in "domain squatting," claim an unreasonable number of subdomains (as determined by us), or sell access to any subdomains.
You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and blog, and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account and any other actions taken in connection with the blog.
You must immediately notify Bear of any unauthorized uses of your blog, your account, or any other breaches of security.
You must be a human.
Accounts registered by automated methods are not permitted.
Bear will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions. 2.
Responsibility of Users
If you operate a blog, post material to bearblog.dev, post links on bearblog.dev, or otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) material available (any such material, "Content"), you are entirely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from, that Content or your conduct.
That is the case regardless of what form the Content takes, which includes, but is not limited to text, photo, video, audio, or code.
By making Content available, you represent and warrant that:
the downloading, copying and use of the Content will not infringe the proprietary rights, including but not limited to the copyright, patent, trademark or trade secret rights, of any third party.
if your employer has rights to intellectual property you create, you have either (i) received permission from your employer to post or make available the Content, including but not limited to any software, or (ii) secured from your employer a waiver as to all rights in or to the Content.
you have fully complied with any third-party licenses relating to the Content, and have done all things necessary to successfully pass through to end users any required terms.
the Content does not contain or install any viruses, worms, malware, Trojan horses or other harmful or destructive content.
the Content is not spam, is not machine- or randomly-generated, and does not contain unethical or unwanted commercial content designed to drive traffic to third party websites or boost the search engine rankings of third party websites, or to further unlawful acts (such as phishing) or mislead recipients as to the source of the material (such as spoofing).
the Content is not pornographic, does not contain threats or incite violence towards individuals or entities, and does not violate the privacy or publicity rights of any third party.
your blog is not getting advertised via unwanted electronic messages such as spam links on newsgroups, email lists, other blogs and websites, and similar unsolicited promotional methods.
your blog is not named in a manner that misleads your readers into thinking that you are another person or company.
For example, your blog's URL or name is not the name of a person other than yourself or company other than your own.
and
you have, in the case of Content that includes computer code, accurately categorized and/or described the type, nature, uses and effects of the materials, whether requested to do so by Bear or otherwise.
By submitting Content to Bear for inclusion on your blog, you grant Bear a world-wide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, modify, adapt and publish the Content solely for the purpose of displaying, distributing, and promoting your blog.
If you delete Content, Bear will use reasonable efforts to remove it from bearblog.dev, but you acknowledge that caching or references to the Content may not be made immediately unavailable.
Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, Bear has the right (though not the obligation) to, in Bear's sole discretion, (i) reclaim your blog's URL due to prolonged inactivity, (ii) refuse or remove any content that, in Bear's reasonable opinion, violates any Bear policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable, or (iii) terminate or deny access to and use of bearblog.dev to any individual or entity for any reason.
Bear will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid. 3.
HTTPS
We offer free HTTPS on all bearblog.dev blogs by default, including those using custom domains, via Let's Encrypt.
By signing up and using a custom domain on bearblog.dev, you authorize us to act on the domain name registrant's behalf (by requesting the necessary certificates, for example) for the sole purpose of providing HTTPS on your blog. 4.
Fees, Payment, and Renewal 4.1.
Fees
Some of our Services are offered for a feeâsuch as a bearblog.dev plan ("Paid Services").
By using a Paid Service, you agree to pay the specified fees.
Depending on the Paid Service, there may be a one-time fee or recurring fees.
For recurring fees, we'll bill or charge you for in regular intervals (such as monthly, or annually), on a pre-pay basis until you cancel, which you can do at any time from the Account section of your bearblog.dev account dashboard. 4.2.
Taxes
To the extent permitted by law, or unless explicitly stated otherwise, all fees are exclusive of applicable federal, provincial, state, local or other governmental sales, goods and services, harmonized or other taxes, fees, or charges now in force or enacted in the future ("Taxes").
You are responsible for payment of all applicable Taxes relating to your use of our Services.
If we are obligated to pay or collect Taxes on the Fees you've paid or will pay, you are responsible for such Taxes, and we may collect payment for such Taxes. 4.3.
Payment
If your payment fails or Paid Services are otherwise not paid for on time, we may immediately cancel or revoke your access to the Paid Services.
If you contact your bank or credit card company to decline or reverse the charge of fees for Paid Services, we may revoke your access to our Services in general. 4.4.
Automatic Renewal
To ensure uninterrupted service, recurring Paid Services are automatically renewed.
This means that unless you cancel a Paid Service before the end of the applicable subscription period, it will automatically renew, and you authorize us to invoice you or use any payment mechanism we have on record for you to collect the then-applicable subscription fee (as well as any Taxes).
Your Paid Services are renewed for the same interval of time.
For example, if you purchase a bearblog.dev monthly plan, you will be charged each month. 4.5.
Refunds
While you may cancel a Paid Service at any time, refunds are issued in our sole discretion. 4.6.
Fee Changes
We may change our fees at any time.
When applicable, we may give you advance notice of the fee changes.
If you don't agree with the fee changes, you can cancel your Paid Service. 5.

We do not endorse any Site Materials or represent that Site Materials are accurate, useful, or non-harmful.
We also disclaim any responsibility for any harm resulting from anyone's use, purchase or downloading of Site Materials.
If you access or use any Site Materials, you are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content.

Bear disclaims any responsibility for any harm resulting from your use of non-bearblog.dev websites and webpages. 7.
Copyright Infringement
As Bear asks others to respect its intellectual property rights, it respects the intellectual property rights of others.

Bear will respond to all such notices, including as required or appropriate by removing the infringing material or disabling all links to the infringing material.
