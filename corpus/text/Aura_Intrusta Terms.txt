5.4 Recurring Payments for Service.
Our Service is billed on a subscription basis (âSubscription(s)").
You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (âBilling Cycleâ).
Billing cycles are set on a regular basis, typically monthly or yearly.
You agree to pay for the subscription that you select for the Service and you authorize us to automatically charge the payment method our service provider has on file for your recurring payments.
At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the same conditions as your existing subscription unless you cancel it or we cancel it.
Several methods of cancelling the automatic renewal of your paid Service subscription are available to you, and are described at https://support.intrusta.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018000853-How-do-I-disable-automatic-renewal-.
Once you have cancelled your automatic renewal, recurring subscription fees for Service fees will no longer be charged to the payment method we have on file for your account, and your subscription will remain active only until the end of the term for which you have fully paid the Service fee.
A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription.
You shall provide us or our third-party payment processor, with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, and valid payment method information.
By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize us to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.

If we do not receive payment, we may suspend or terminate your paid Service subscription.

5.5&nbsp.
Open Source.
The Open-Source code components that are included with the Software are redistributed by Aura under the terms of the applicable Open-Source Code license for such component.
Your receipt of Open-Source code components from Aura under this Agreement neither enlarges nor curtails your rights or obligations defined by the Open-Source Code license applicable to the Open-Source Code component.
Copies of the Open-Source Code licenses for the Open-Source Code components that are included with the Software are included with or referenced in the Softwareâs Documentation.

5.6&nbsp.

 Dispute Resolution and Arbitration



15.1 Generally.
In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Aura in the most expedient and cost-effective manner, you and Aura agree that any and all disputes arising out of or relating in any way to this Agreement or your use of the Service shall be resolved by binding arbitration.
Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.
Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts.
Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.
Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of this Agreement, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of this Agreement. 

15.2 No class actions or jury trials.
This Arbitration Agreement involves interstate commerce and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.
Â§Â§ 1-16 (âFAAâ), and not by state law.
If you or we elect to resolve a dispute by arbitration, neither you nor we will be able to have a court or jury trial or participate in a class action or class arbitration.
Other rights that you and we would have if you or we went to court will not be available or will be more limited in arbitration, including discovery and appeal rights.
You and we each understand and agree that by allowing each other to elect to resolve any dispute through individual arbitration, WE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A COURT OR JURY TRIAL.
IF ANY PARTY ELECTS ARBITRATION, THAT DISPUTE SHALL BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND NOT AS A CLASS ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY SIMILAR PROCEEDING.
The arbitrator(s) may not consolidate the claims of multiple parties, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

15.3
Notice.
Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (âNoticeâ).
The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.
and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (âDemandâ).
We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Aura may commence an arbitration proceeding.
During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Aura shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.

15.4
Procedure Generally. Arbitrations shall be administered by the JAMS (âJAMSâ) pursuant to the applicable JAMS rules in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated.
You may obtain information about arbitration, arbitration procedures and fees from JAMS by calling 800-352-5267 or visiting http://www.jamsadr.com/.
If JAMS is unable or unwilling to arbitrate a dispute, then the dispute may be referred to any other arbitration organization or arbitrator we both agree upon in writing or that is appointed pursuant to section 5 of the FAA.
The arbitrator shall be authorized to award any relief that would have been available in court, provided that the arbitratorâs authority is limited to you and us alone, except as otherwise specifically stated herein.
No arbitration decision will have any preclusive effect as to non-parties.
The arbitratorâs decision shall be final and binding.
You and we agree that this Arbitration Agreement extends to any other parties involved in any Claims, including but not limited to affiliated companies and vendors.
This Arbitration Agreement shall take precedence over the rules of the arbitration organization or arbitrator in the event of any conflict. 

15.5 Fees.
In the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with this Agreement, Aura will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by the Rules.
Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Herndon, Virginia for United States residents, and at a location to be mutually agreed upon for all other persons, provided that if the claim is for US $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the Rules.
If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in the United States Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the Rules.
In such case, you agree to reimburse Aura for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the Rules.
Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.
The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitratorâs ruling on the merits.

15.6 Enforceability.
If Section 15.2 above is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 15 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 15 will be null and void.
If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement other than the class action waiver and prohibition against class arbitration is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it shall not invalidate the remaining portions of this Arbitration Agreement.
This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of this Agreement, your fulfillment or default of your obligations under this Agreement, and/or your or our bankruptcy or insolvency (to the extent permitted by applicable law).
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REJECT THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, BUT YOU MUST EXERCISE THIS RIGHT PROMPTLY.
If you do not wish to be bound by this agreement to arbitrate, You must notify us in writing within sixty (60) days after the date you agree to this Agreement.
You must send your request to: Aura Customer Service, P.O.
Box 222455, Chantilly, VA 20153-2455.
The request must include your full name, address, account number, and the statement âI reject the Arbitration Agreement contained in the Terms of Use for my Aura Service.â If you exercise your right to reject arbitration, the other terms of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect as if you had not rejected arbitration.


 Miscellaneous.



16.1 Assignment.
This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Aura without restriction.
