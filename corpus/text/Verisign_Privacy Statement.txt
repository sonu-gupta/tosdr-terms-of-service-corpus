Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete your personal information from our records, and direct our service providers to do the same, unless an exception applies.
Some of the exceptions that would allow us to deny a request for deletion include if the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to do the following:

If we require more time (up to 45 additional days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.

Additional Information About Requests to Know

When responding to a request to know, we will not disclose information to you if we cannot verify your identity.
The CCPA allows a California resident to make a verifiable consumer request to know only twice within a 12-month period.
Additionally, the verifiable consumer request must:

1.
Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are: (i) the person about whom we collected personal information, or (ii) an authorized representative.
2.
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.


Additional Information About Requests to Delete

When responding to a request for deletion, we will specify the manner in which we have deleted your personal information, in accordance with the CCPA.
We will not delete your information if we cannot verify your identity. C.
DESIGNATING AN AUTHORIZED AGENT Only you as a California resident, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf (Authorized Agent), may make a verifiable request to know or a request for deletion.
If you are using an Authorized Agent to exercise your CCPA rights, we require the Authorized Agent to provide us with written confirmation that you have authorized them to act on your behalf.
We may also verify the identity of the Authorized Agent. D.
HOW WE VERIFY CALIFORNIA RESIDENTSâ REQUESTS TO KNOW AND REQUESTS FOR DELETION We will not respond to requests to know or requests for deletion unless we can verify your identity to a reasonable degree of certainty.
To verify your identity, when feasible, we will use information about you that we already have.
however, on occasion we may need to request additional information, which we will use only for the purposes of verification.
We may also use a third-party identify verification service.
The information we need to verify your request will depend on the type of request, the sensitivity of the personal information requested, and/or the risk of harm to you.
Upon receipt of your request, we will notify you if we need additional information from you to verify your request. E.

How We Use Your Personal Information

We will only use your personal information in a manner that is consistent with applicable laws.
Most commonly, we will use the categories of personal information identified above for the following business purposes:

For the provision of our Covered Products and Services or the operation of our business or a third partyâs business.
Personal information may be made available to Verisign businesses around the world if necessary for the provision of our Covered Products and Services, account administration, sales and marketing, customer and technical support, and business and product development, for instance.
All of our employees and contractors are required to follow our data privacy and security policies when handling personal information.
Where we need to perform a contract that we have entered into with a third-party or you, or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract.
To protect the security and integrity of our business, our Covered Products and Services, or Covered Sites.
Where we need to protect your interests (or someone else's interests).
Where it is needed in the public interest or for official purposes.
In connection with the sale, merger, acquisition, or other reorganization of our business.
Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of it from sellers.
It is Verisign's practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.
For compliance with legal obligations and protection of Verisign and others.
Specifically, we may be required to use and retain personal information for legal and compliance reasons, such as the prevention, detection, or investigation of a crime, loss prevention, or fraud.
We may also use personal information to meet our internal and external audit requirements, and as we otherwise believe to be necessary or appropriate: (i) under applicable law, which may include laws outside your country of residence.
(ii) to respond to requests from courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies, and other public and government authorities, which may include such authorities outside your country of residence.
(iii) to enforce or apply our contractual rights.
and (iv) to otherwise protect our rights, privacy, safety, or property, or those of other persons.
For marketing purposes.
Specifically, we may use your personal information (including cookies â for more information on how we use cookies, please see Section IX below) to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you.
This is how we decide which products, services, and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).

Where it is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests or those of a third party (e.g., for the provision of our services or products, the operation of our business or a third partyâs business, or the marketing of products or services by us to you in circumstances where you have already bought or subscribed for similar Verisign products or services) and your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms do not override our legitimate interests.
You may receive marketing communications from us if you have purchased products or services from us, we have identified similar products or services that may be relevant for you and, in each case, you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.
We will get your express opt-in consent before we market products or services to you that are not similar to products or services you have purchased from us before, or if we share your personal information with any company outside the Verisign group of companies for marketing purposes.
You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time.
If you receive a marketing communication from us, the communication will contain an option to opt out of further communications.
If you receive a marketing communication from one of our business partners, or from social media providers, you should opt out with that entity directly.
You can also contact us at any time to opt out using the details given at the end of this Privacy Statement.


We may disclose your personal information to entities other than Verisign for business purposes.
When we disclose personal information, we do so in accordance with our data privacy and security requirements.
Please see Section I.C.
for more information about these types of disclosures.

We will only use your personal information for the purposes for which we collected it, including where we reasonably consider that we need to use it for a reason that is compatible with the original purpose.
If we need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you as required by law.
Please note that we may process your personal information without your knowledge or consent where this is required or permitted by law.
