Subscription

 Rambox currently offers access to Rambox CE at no cost.

 Subscription fees are subject to change (with prior notice) and shall apply to the upcoming renewal period (if any) as indicated.
Such notice may be provided by email or by posting the changes to our Apps or the Rambox website.
When you enroll in any recurring subscription arrangement, you authorize Rambox to automatically charge the billing source you provided us at the time you enrolled for the subscription term specified (at the time of enrollment) until the subscription ends or you cancel your enrollment.


Renewal

 We will renew your subscription automatically for the same term as you selected, unless you cancel your account prior to its renewal date (see below).

DISPUTE RESOLUTION


Informal Negotiations

 To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Terms of Use (each a "Dispute" and collectively, the âDisputesâ) brought by either you or us (individually, a âPartyâ and collectively, the âPartiesâ), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration.
Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.


Binding Arbitration

 If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.
The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the âDirecciÃ³n Nacional de Defensa del Consumidorâ department and, where appropriate, the DNDCâs 24.240 laws.
Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the DNDC Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the DNDC Consumer Rules.
The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online.
The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party.
The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.
Except where otherwise required by the applicable DNDC rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in Rosario, Santa Fe (Argentina).
Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

 If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in Rosario, Santa Fe (Argentina) and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts.
Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Terms of Use.

 If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.


Restrictions

 The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually.
To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding.
(b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures.
and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.


Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration

 The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party.
(b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use.
and (c) any claim for injunctive relief.
If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
