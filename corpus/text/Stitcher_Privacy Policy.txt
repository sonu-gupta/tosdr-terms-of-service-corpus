The Beacon transmits information to a server, such as a numeric count, unique identifier, or IP address.
Stitcher and third parties that we contract with use Beacons to help us better manage content on the Stitcher Service, for example, to let us know which emails recipients have opened, or to count the number of unique visitors to a webpage.
The use of a Beacon may also allow us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and of our marketing campaigns.


Advertisers' and other third parties' use of cookies: Advertisers and other third-party advertising entities that deliver ads to you on the Service may place or recognize a unique cookie on your hard drive ("third-party cookies").
Advertising entities may use third-party cookies in order to count your exposure to or gauge your interaction with an ad.
They may also use third-party cookies to provide you with interest-based advertising.
Most major web browsers or mobile operating systems provide users with the option to accept or reject third-party cookies.
The use of third-party cookies is not covered by this Privacy Policy.
We do not have access to or control over cookies placed by advertisers and other third parties.


HTML5 and Flash Local Storage: Stitcher or its advertising and technology providers may, in some instances, use HTML5 and/or Flash Local Storage (collectively, "Local Storage") to enhance your listening and advertising experiences on the Service.
Each browser implements HTML5 Local Storage differently and provides tools for managing content stored within local storage.
