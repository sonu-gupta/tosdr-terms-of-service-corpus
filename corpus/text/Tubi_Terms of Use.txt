(a) YOU AND TUBI MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR MULTI-CLAIMANT PROCEEDING, AND THE ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE NO POWER TO AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF.
(b) Tubi will pay arbitration costs as required by the JAMS Consumer Arbitration Minimum Standards and consistent with paragraph 10 below.
(c) the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are permitted by applicable law and these Terms of Use.
and (d) each side pays his, her or its own attorneysâ fees, except as otherwise provided in paragraph 10 below.
(10) JAMS charges filing and other fees to conduct arbitrations.
Ordinarily, the claimant has to pay the filing fee to initiate arbitration, but if you wish to commence an arbitration against Tubi, you and the Tubi acknowledge and agree to abide by the following:

If you are seeking to recover less than $10,000 (inclusive of attorneysâ fees), Tubi will pay the filing fee on your behalf or reimburse your payment of it.
If you are seeking to recover $10,000 or more, you will have to pay the filing fee charged by JAMS, but Tubi will reimburse the filing fee if you prevail on all claims decided upon by the arbitrator.
Tubi and you agree that, if the claims to be arbitrated total less than $10,000 (inclusive of attorneysâ fees), the claim ordinarily should be decided on written submissions only, without a telephonic or in-person hearing.
Tubi will not request a hearing for any claims totaling less than $10,000.
This provision shall not be construed by the arbitrator to deprive you of any rights you may have to a telephonic or in-person hearing in your hometown area pursuant to the JAMS Rules.
Tubi and you agree that, if the claims to be arbitrated total $10,000 or more, the arbitration will occur in a manner and place consistent with the JAMS Rules.

(11) Regardless of how the arbitration proceeds, each of you and Tubi shall cooperate in good faith in the exchange of non-privileged documents and information as necessary in accordance with the JAMS Rules, and the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain his or her findings and conclusions.
(12) Each of you and Tubi may incur attorneysâ fees during the arbitration.
Each side agrees to pay his, her or its own attorneysâ fees unless the claim(s) at issue permit the prevailing party to be paid its attorneysâ fees, and in such instance, the fees awarded shall be determined by the applicable law(s).
In addition to whatever rights you may have to recover your attorneysâ fees under applicable law, if you prevail in the arbitration, and if Tubi failed to make a settlement offer to you before the arbitration or the amount you win is at least 25% greater than Tubiâs highest settlement offer, then Tubi will pay your reasonable attorneysâ fees in addition to the amount the arbitrator awarded.
If Tubi wins the arbitration, you will be responsible for your own attorneysâ fees.
In addition, if the arbitrator, at the request of the winning party, finds that the losing party brought a claim or asserted a defense frivolously or for an improper purpose, then regardless of the amount in dispute, the arbitrator must order the losing party to pay both sidesâ arbitration fees and may order the losing party to pay the winning partyâs reasonable attorneysâ fees, unless such an award of fees is prohibited by applicable law.
(13) The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief, only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that partyâs individual claim, only as permitted by applicable law, and only to the extent that declaratory and injunctive relief are permitted by these Terms of Use.
The arbitrator shall have no authority to award punitive, exemplary, multiplied or consequential damages or any other relief not allowed under this Arbitration Agreement.
The arbitrator also may not order Tubi to pay any monies to or take any actions with respect to persons other than you, unless Tubi explicitly consents in advance, after an arbitrator is selected, to permit the arbitrator to enter such an order.
Further, unless Tubi expressly agrees, the arbitrator may not consolidate other personsâ claims with yours, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, multi-claimant or class proceeding.
(14) You and Tubi agree to maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding and shall not disclose the fact of the arbitration, any documents exchanged as part of any mediation, proceedings of the arbitration, the arbitratorâs decision and the existence or amount of any award, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration (in which case anyone becoming privy to confidential information must undertake to preserve its confidentiality), or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a provisional remedy, a judicial challenge to an award or its enforcement, an order confirming the award, or unless otherwise required by law or court order.
In keeping with the confidential nature of the arbitration, You and Tubi agree that an order confirming award is only necessary if the obligations of the award have not been performed.
Therefore, before taking any steps to confirm the arbitration award, the party seeking confirmation of the award must give the other party notice of its intention to confirm the award.
If the party who would be the respondent in any such confirmation proceeding performs its obligation under the terms of the arbitration award within 15 business days of such notice, the party who gave notice of its intent to confirm the award shall not seek to confirm or otherwise enforce the award.
(15) With the exception of subpart (a) in paragraph (9) (i.e., the waiver of the ability to proceed on behalf of multiple claimants or a purported class), if any part of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the balance of this Arbitration Agreement shall remain in effect and be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, or illegal provision were not contained.
If, however, subpart (a) in paragraph (9) is found invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, but the rest of these Terms of Use, including the provisions governing where actions against Tubi must be pursued, the choice of governing law, and our mutual waiver of the right to a trial by jury, will remain in effect and apply to any claim that, for this or any other reason, proceeds in court rather than in arbitration.

YOU HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT YOU MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY CLAIMS, COUNTERCLAIMS, CROSS-CLAIMS, OR THIRD PARTY CLAIMS) ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT.

No Waiver/Reliance.
If you see other parties violating these Terms of Use, you may let us know at feedback@tubi.tv (subject line: âTOU Violationâ).
You may not rely upon Tubiâs response with respect to one party or one situation as any indication of what Tubi might do with respect to another party or another situation, even if the parties or situations appear to you to be similar.
Similarly, if we fail to act in response to a violation of these Terms of Use, you should not assume that we do not object to the violation or even that we are aware of it.
In addition, you may not construe a waiver of any provision of these Terms of Use with respect to any party as a waiver of that provision (or any other provision) with respect to either that party or any other party.
Further, Tubiâs decision to delay exercising or enforcing any right or remedy under these Terms of Use will not constitute a waiver of such right or remedy.
Even if Tubi acts in a way that appears to you to be inconsistent with these Terms of Use, Tubiâs action will not be deemed a waiver or constructive amendment of these Terms of Use.
Tubiâs failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision.
The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Tubi.
Except as expressly set forth in these Terms of Use, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms of Use will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms of Use or otherwise.

Except as set forth in Section 1 above, these Terms of Use may not be amended or varied except in a writing signed by Tubi.
Although we understand that electronic or digital signatures are frequently viewed as the equivalent of traditional written signatures these days, for these purposes, a signature or âsignedâ writing or written agreement may not include an electronic or digital signature.
These Terms of Use operate to the fullest extent permissible by law.
If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, you and we agree that the provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms of Use will remain in full force and effect.
