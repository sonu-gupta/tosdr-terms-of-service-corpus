Cookies.

A cookie is a small file placed onto your device that enables a variety of features and functionality.

We use a variety of cookie types:


Preference Cookies.
Preference cookies collect information about your choices and preferences, and allow us to remember language or other local settings and customize the websites accordingly.

Without these cookies, websites will not perform as intended and we may not be able to provide our website or certain services or features you request.
Analytics Cookies.
