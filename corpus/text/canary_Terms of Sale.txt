There are certain terms and conditions which pertain to the purchase, use and termination of these Additional Services that are in addition to other terms governing the use of Canary's systems generally.
One form of Additional Services is our "Premium Services".
Each of the Basic and Premium Services currently offered by Canary is explained at this link.
Premium Services may include items such as access to full recorded videos for a predetermined timeframe (e.g., 30 days).
access to certain exclusive Premium Services software features such as a web-based video viewing experience and two-way talk functionality.
an extended Equipment warranty.
and customer service support in the event of a home security incident.
Use of all Additional Services is governed by all relevant Canary terms and conditions including, without limitation, the Canary System Terms &amp.
Conditions, Canary's Privacy Policy, Canary's End User License Agreement (for software embedded in the Product) and these terms, including the terms applicable to your selected service plan.
Full recorded videos are available to Premium Services subscribers and will remain available for the predetermined timeframe applicable to your selected plan.
Video previews previously captured prior to an upgrade to Premium Services will not be replaced by full videos if you upgrade to Premium Services.
Your selected plan may include an Extended Warranty.
The Extended Warranty includes the same provisions of Canary's standard Limited Warranty but adds additional time (e.g., twelve (12) months) from the date of purchase.
The Extended Warranty must be in place for the relevant Equipment at the time the Equipment fails to be potentially eligible for an Extended Warranty claim.
Outside the United States, subscribers to Premium Services will receive full video and timeline access as set forth in the documentation applicable to the user's country of residence, and other features of our Premium Services (such as extended warranty or incident support) may not be available in certain countries outside the United States.
Purchase of Canary's Premium Services or Professional Monitoring includes the features described on our Premium Services FAQ page and Professional Monitoring FAQ page, respectively, at the time of your purchase and are subject to change (including during the period of your Additional Service) on notice to you.
Canary reserves the right to limit certain Premium Services functionality, such as video uploads and access, web-based video viewing experience, and two-way talk, or Professional Monitoring functionality, such as escalating events for review or first responder dispatch, immediately upon notice to you if, in our sole discretion, your use of the applicable Additional Service is inconsistent with the purpose or manner in which it is intended to be used.
No refunds will be offered in connection with any such limitation.
Additional Services and the rights and privileges provided to an Additional Services subscriber are personal and non-transferable by assignment, sale or otherwise, each of which is specifically prohibited.
If you give your Equipment to another person (e.g., as a gift), you are not permitted to transfer your activated Additional Services with the Equipment for that person's use.
The person who receives your Equipment must purchase his or her own Additional Services.
provided that for Products with a minimum contract period, if the person who receives the Equipment is acceptable to us in our sole discretion, we may permit them to enter into a new contract with us with a contract period that is equal to the balance of your remaining contract period.
You will not receive a refund, pro-rated or otherwise, if, as a result of giving your Equipment to another person, you deactivate your account.
All fees for and payments for Additional Services are in US Dollars unless otherwise noted at the time of purchase.
Additional Services are billed on a per-location or a per Equipment (device) basis depending on the plan you selected at the time of purchase.
The price of your Additional Services is subject to your selected plan and may also depend on the amount of Equipment (number of devices) registered with your Additional Services at each physical location on your account.
If a physical location has Additional Services activated, we may require that all Equipment at that location must be activated for the same Additional Services.
In the event that the amount of Equipment (number of devices) changes during the course of a month or year, depending on which plan you selected, we may adjust your bill on a pro-rated basis to reflect any changes.
When you purchase Additional Services that includes "free" Equipment, you do not purchase the Equipment outright and instead it remains in our ownership.
Title to and ownership in this Equipment shall not transfer to you, and your payments shall be for your right to use our Products.
This means that you cannot sell, rent, mortgage or otherwise encumber our Equipment unless we agree in writing.
At the end of any Additional Services plan, we have the right to require that you return the Equipment to us.
Failing to return an applicable Equipment to us within 14 days following our instructions to do so violates these Terms, and we may continue to charge your Additional Services plan fees until you return the Equipment to us and/or we may take legal or other collection action against you.
This could mean you have to pay our costs and expenses, including collections and legal costs, with interest added daily as described in the "Payment" section below.

Canary reserves the right to change your Additional Services terms and prices with appropriate notice to you.
We do not provide upward or downward price protection or refunds in the event of promotions or price decreases offered after the date on which you subscribe.
You may pay for your Additional Services with a major credit or debit card, or any other payment method accepted by our third party payment processor at the time of purchase ("Payment Method").
We will charge your credit or debit card or account for your first Additional Services fee on the date that we process your order for your Additional Services and on or about each monthly or annual anniversary.
If you purchase Additional Services with a minimum committed contract period (e.g., 24 months), after your applicable contract period, we will continue your Additional Services on a month-to-month or annual Additional Services plan (based on your latest selected payment period), and will charge you at our then-current rates.
Once your credit or debit card or account is charged the first Additional Services fee, you will receive a confirmation email.
If you have any dispute with any such charge, you must notify us in accordance with our Cancellation requirements, set forth below.
You acknowledge that the amounts billed each billing period may vary for reasons that may include differing amounts due to promotional offers, changing your Additional Services plan (where permitted) and changes in the amount of taxes we collect.
You authorize Canary to charge your Payment Method for such varying amounts, or to provide you a credit, on your next billing cycle.
Payments for our Additional Services are processed through our third party payment processors.
If you purchase Additional Services with a minimum contract period, you are committing to the minimum contract period specified at the time of your order (e.g., 24 months).
You may cancel your Additional Services plan with a minimum contract period at any time, subject to your payment to us at the time of cancellation an early termination fee equal to the entire amount that you would have paid to us if you had completed the remainder of your minimum contract period.
For example, if your Additional Services with a minimum contract period is billed at $14.99 monthly + tax and includes a 24-month contract, and you cancel in month 14, your early termination fee would be $149.90 + tax due at the time of cancellation.
We may evaluate your credit history before modifying or providing you Additional Services, including obtaining a report from a consumer credit agency or exchanging information with our affiliates in connection with determining your creditworthiness.
If you fail to pay your bill, we may submit a negative credit report to a credit reporting agency, which will negatively affect your credit report.
If a payment for Additional Services with a minimum contract period is not successful, you remain responsible for any unpaid amounts, and after a grace period that we determine of at least 30 days, we may consider that you have canceled your Additional Services plan, in which case an early termination fee will apply, due at the time of cancellation or deemed cancellation, equal to the entire amount that you would have paid to us if you had completed the remainder of your minimum contract period specified at the time of your order (see the sample calculation above).
Imposing an early termination fee does not affect our right to take legal or other collection action against you for non-payment, to charge you interest, or to request that you return to us Equipment that we own.
If you are past due on amounts owed to us for Additional Services with a minimum contract period, we may also temporarily or permanently remotely disable your Equipment so that it will not operate, even if you give or otherwise transfer it.
If you purchase Additional Services with a minimum contract period and you do not make any payment due to us by the due date for payment, we may also charge interest to you on the overdue amount at the rate of the lesser of (a) 6% a year above the "prime rate" as reported by the Wall Street Journal or any successor publication and (b) the maximum interest rate allowed by law.
This interest shall accrue on a daily basis from the due date until the date of actual payment of the overdue amount, whether before or after judgment.
You will be required to pay interest together with any overdue amount unless you dispute a request for payment in good faith and contact us to let us know promptly after you have received a payment request of your dispute, in which case we may choose not to apply interest for the period of the dispute.
In addition to any early termination or other fees that apply, you also agree to reimburse us for our reasonable costs, fees and expenses in connection with any collection activities we undertake arising from your failure to pay us any amounts owed when due, including our reasonable attorneys fees and collection agency fees.
If you fail to pay on time and we refer your account(s) to a third party for collection, we may assess a collection fee that will be due at the time of the referral to the third party.
The fee will be calculated at the maximum percentage permitted by applicable law, but not to exceed 18 percent per annum of the amount due.Free TrialsYour Canary Additional Services may begin with a free trial for a limited period of time.
If you receive a free trial, the specific offer terms will be stated in the material describing the free trial offer.
Free trials are for new Canary customers only.

Canary reserves the right to determine and limit eligibility for any free trial.

Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states or jurisdictions, the Canary Representatives' liability (and the Noonlight Representatives' liability, with respect to the Noonlight Services) shall be limited to the maximum sum of $25.00 collectively.
In the event that you wish to increase the maximum amount of such limited liability, you may, as a matter of right, obtain a higher limit by contacting legal@canary.is to arrange paying an additional amount for the increase in such limit of liability, but this payment shall in no way be interpreted to hold Canary or Noonlight, and their Representatives as an insurer.GeneralCanary controls and operates its Service from its headquarters in the United States.
