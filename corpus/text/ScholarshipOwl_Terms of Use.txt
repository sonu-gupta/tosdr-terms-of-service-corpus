We will award scholarships based on our determinations of greatest financial and personal need amongst applicants using information provided in applicant submissions, the scholarshipâs eligibility criteria, and the goal of each scholarship.
We will give preference to students who have written a compelling narrative and to students who have previously been awarded a scholarship by us either as part of the Fund or otherwise.
We may award full or partial scholarships.
Our scholarship award determinations are final.
If a scholarship is funded entirely by donor-designated donations, we will award the scholarship after the scholarship has been fully funded.
If a scholarship has not been fully funded via donor-designated donations after thirty (30) days, we may, at any time in our sole discretion, elect to (i) pay out the partial scholarship based on the donor-designated donations or (ii) pay out a full or partial scholarship based on the donor-designated donations supplemented by other available funds in accordance with the scholarship award criteria above.
Scholarship recipients will have seventy-two (72) hours after notification to accept the scholarship and return all required documentation, otherwise the scholarship will be forfeited.
If we determine after notifying a student that they have been awarded a scholarship but prior to payment of the scholarship that it was awarded in error or the student violated any of these Terms of Use, we may revoke the scholarship award upon notice to such student.
The number of scholarships awarded within each category will vary based upon available funds.
We may terminate the Fund at any time, with or without notice, upon awarding scholarships using available funds.
