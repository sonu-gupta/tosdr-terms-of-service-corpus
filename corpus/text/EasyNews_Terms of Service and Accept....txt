Any dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court will be resolved in the federal courts of Florida and the United States, respectively, sitting in Orange County, Florida.



DISPUTE RESOLUTION.
BINDING ARBRITRATION.


Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Easynews and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.


(a) Except for small claims disputes in which you or Easynews seek to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county of your billing address or disputes in which you or Easynews seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, you and Easynews waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services resolved in court.
Instead, all disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or our Services will be resolved through confidential binding arbitration held in Orange County, Florida in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures ("Rules") of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services ("JAMS"), which are available on the JAMS website and hereby incorporated by reference.
You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS or waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.

(b) You and Easynews agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services is personal to you and Easynews and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.


(c) You and Easynews agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 17 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.
Â§ 1, et seq.
(the"FAA"), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.
As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court.
provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms.
The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual's claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.
You and Easynews agree that for any arbitration you initiate, the party filing the claim will pay the filing fee and the parties will split the remaining JAMS fees and costs.
You and Easynews agree that the state or federal courts of the State of Florida and the United States sitting in Orange County, Florida have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.

(d) ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR OUR SERVICES MUST BE FILED WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER SUCH CLAIM AROSE.
OTHERWISE, THE CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED, WHICH MEANS THAT YOU AND EASYNEWS WILL NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASSERT THE CLAIM.



ENFORCEABILITY. If any portion of this agreement is wholly or partially unenforceable, for any reason, such unenforceability shall not affect the balance hereof.



ASSIGNMENT. Customer may not assign its rights or obligations under this agreement without the prior written consent of Easynews, which may be withheld at Easynews' sole discretion.



NO WAIVER. Easynews' failure to insist upon or enforce any provision of this agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right.



WRITTEN AGREEMENT. This agreement (and any amendments hereto) represents a binding written contract, whether executed by each party on paper or accepted by electronic communication.
