Data collection and use of personally identifiable information

Collection. We collect personally identifiable information, such as your name, phone number, company name and email address, directly from you when you choose to enter it on our website, for instance when you complete the âContact Usâ form.

Use. We use this information to respond to the request or inquiry you have submitted to us through the contact form or other entry field.
We also use this information for marketing purposes, such as to send you our newsletter or other promotional emails.
You may choose to stop receiving our marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these communications.
With your consent, we may also post your name and a testimonial on our site.
Consent.
The collection of personal data based on your consent is done by using a consent form as for instance on our Contact Us page.
Your consent is stored and documented in our systems.
You may withdraw any consent to personal data processing at any time.
Contract.
We also use personal information for fulfilling our obligations related to contracts and agreements with customers, partners and suppliers.
Legitimate interest.
We may use your personal data if it is considered to be of legitimate interest, and if your privacy interests do not override this interest.
Normally, to establish the legal basis for data collection, an assessment has been made during which a mutual interest between you and Criteo has been identified.
This legal basis is primarily related to our sales and marketing purposes.
We will always inform you about your privacy rights and the purpose for collecting your personal data.
In such cases, you can always&nbsp.
choose to object to the processing of your personal data.

Information Sharing. We do not share your information with third parties for their promotional purposes.
We may share your information with our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, and trusted third party service providers working under the instruction of Criteo, such as an email service provider, hosting provider or data center, exclusively for storage purposes.
Such third parties who provide services on our behalf are authorized to use your personal information only as strictly necessary to provide these services to us.
We of course remain responsible for making sure they commit themselves to adhere to this privacy policy and applicable data protection legislation by signing a data processing agreement.
In this context, please note that Criteo may transfer your personal data outside the European Union as part of its processing.
In such case the organization receiving your personal data will have provided to Criteo adequate safeguards such as execution of the EU Standard Contractual Clauses for transfer to third countries, or another specifically stated lawful basis for the transfer of personal data to a third country.

Legal Disclaimer. We reserve the right to disclose or transfer your personally identifiable information as required by law, as part of a merger, acquisition, dissolution or sale of assets, and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process.
You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change of ownership, uses of your personal information, and choices you may have regarding your personal information.
We may also disclose your personal information when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud or respond to a government request.
We may also disclose your personal information to any other third party with your prior consent.
