DEFINITIONS When we say "you", "your" or "Data Subject" we mean any natural person that shares personal data with us via Website.
When we say "processing" we mean any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or sets of personal data.
This includes activities such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.
When we say "personal data" or "data" we mean any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.
an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, either directly or indirectly.
Therefore, data about a company or any legal entity is not considered to be personal data but registering on behalf of a legal entity may include sharing personal data.
For example, the information in relation to one-person companies may constitute personal data where it allows the identification of a natural person.
The rules also apply to all personal data relating to natural persons in the course of professional activity, such as the employees of a company or organization, business e-mail addresses like "firstname.surname@company.com".
This Privacy Policy does not apply to information from which no individual can reasonably be identified (anonymized information).
When we say "Data Processors" or "processor" we mean any natural or legal person who processes the data on behalf of the Data Controller.
In some cases, COING is a Data Processor and in others, Data Controller (as further explained in Section 2).
In addition, we may use the services of various service providers to process your data more effectively.
In such cases, they are either our processors or sub-processors.
When we say "cookies" we mean small pieces of data stored on your device (computer or mobile device).
This information is used to track your use of the Website and to compile statistical reports on website activity.
For further information about the use of cookies and how you can manage them, please read our Cookie Policy.
When we say "consent" we mean your explicit consent on the processing of personal data.
Persons who are 15 years of age or older may give free consent to the processing of their personal data. 2.
DATA CONTROLLER OR DATA PROCESSOR In relation to your personal data processed on or via the Website, COING may be either a Data Controller or Data Processor.
When COING acts in the capacity of a Data Controller, COING determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.
The purpose of data processing is the reason why we process your personal data.
The table in Section 4 of the Privacy Policy presents the purposes and legal basis for data processing.
In such cases, COING is responsible for your personal data.
This Privacy Policy contains information on processing your data in the capacity of a Data Controller.
Should you have any inquiries, or you wish to exercise any of the rights of a Data Subject stipulated in Section 10, please contact us:

By using the Service, you may disclose, share, record, or otherwise use various types of data via a Workspace as the User Content.
The type of User Content is determined by the person that owns the Workspace and not by us.
In that event, COING is a Data Processor and Data Controller is the owner of the Workspace.
Thus, COING does not analyze, disclose or access such date unless a User sends a request for support and, in these cases, the access is limited to enabling the functioning of the Service.
Should you wish to send an inquiry or exercise any of the Data Subject's rights, please contact the owner of the relevant Workspace via which your personal data has been processed.
Please also note that we do not collect your personal data if you are End User of Server Clockify.
In that case, Client (the company that has Clockify installed on their server) is responsible for your personal data.

The DPA includes the Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the European Commission, as applicable, and reflects the Parties' agreement with respect to the terms governing the processing of personal data under the CLOCKIFY's Terms of Use.
Signing the DPA will be considered as an amendment to the Agreement (within the meaning of Section 1 of the Terms of Use) and will be considered to form a part of the Agreement.

 6.
PERSONAL DATA SECURITY We take administrative, technical, organizational and other measures to ensure the appropriate level of security of personal data we process.
Upon assessing whether a measure is adequate and which level of security is appropriate, we consider the nature of the personal data we are processing and the nature of the processing operations we perform, the risks to which you are exposed by our processing activities, the costs of the implementation of security measures and other relevant matters in the particular circumstances.
Some of the measures we apply include access authorization control, information classification (and handling thereof), protection of integrity and confidentiality, data backup, firewalls, data encryption and other appropriate measures.
We equip our staff with the appropriate knowledge and understanding of the importance and confidentiality of your personal data security. 7.
WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL DATA? COING utilizes external processors for certain processing activities.
We use information audits to identify, categorize and record all personal data that is processed outside the company, so that the information, processing activity, processor and legal basis are all recorded, reviewed and easily accessible.
We have strict due diligence procedures and measures in place and review, assess and background check all processors prior to forming a business relationship.
We obtain company documents, certifications, references and ensure that the processor is adequate, appropriate and effective for the task we are employing them for.
We audit their processes and activities prior to contract and during the contract period to ensure compliance with the data protection regulations and review any codes of conduct that oblige them to confirm compliance.

We retain personal data for as long as we reasonably require it for legal or business purposes.
In determining data retention periods, we take into consideration the applicable law (see Section 22 of the Terms of Use), contractual obligations, and the expectations and requirements of our Users.
When we no longer need personal information, or when you request us to delete your information, where this is legal, we will securely delete or destroy it.
