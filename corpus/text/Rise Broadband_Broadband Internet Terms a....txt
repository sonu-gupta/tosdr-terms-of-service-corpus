Any detriment caused to the network as a result of USERâs failure to properly secure USERâs network and devices may result in the immediate termination of USERâs Service.
USER is entirely responsible for any actions, damages, or costs incurred via their account, regardless of who is using that account.


SERVICE CHARACTERISTICS


Service Availability â The Service is subject to availability as it is contingent on available RISE facilities and unique signal path conditions between such facilities and the USER premises.
Due to the nature of the Service technology, RISE reserves the right to deem the Service unavailable to the USER up to, including, and after the installation.
RISE assumes no liability whatsoever for any claims, damages, losses or expenses arising out of or otherwise relating to the unavailability of the Service in USERâs geographical area, for any reason, even where such unavailability occurs after installation of the Service.
Service Plans â RISE offers a range of Service plans with different speeds and data usage.
Service plans are subject to availability and may include other promotional terms and conditions including a minimum service term commitment (âService Termâ).
A Service Term shall begin on&nbsp.
the date that the Service has been installed and activated by RISE.
If USER signs up for a Service plan that includes special or promotional offers, such offers may only be in effect for the initial Service Term of the plan.&nbsp.
If USER changes or upgrades their Service plan, any special or other promotions may be subject to discontinuance or removal.
Performance Levels â Speed is a function of the traffic experienced upon the wider network architecture of the Internet itself.
RISE Services are provided as âup-toâ speeds and RISE does not guarantee the maximum Service performance (throughput speeds) levels.
RISE will make every reasonable effort to ensure that USERS receive the speeds under the Service plan they signed up for throughout most of a USERâs daily use and reflecting performance under ideal conditions.
RISE is not responsible for speeds from points anywhere else on the internet and USER understands that content that USER may access through the Service may be subject to âcachingâ or several other factors that are beyond RISEâs control.
Throughput Volume â Depending on the Service plan signed up for, an account will have a standard quota for disk space and data usage.
At RISEâs discretion, additional quota may be added to such an account for a recurring fee, based on RISEâs then-current rates.
Data usage on an account above USERâs limit will result in additional fees as set forth in the Additional Fee Statement (as defined herein).
Network Management â USER understands, acknowledges and agrees that RISE may use various tools and techniques in order to efficiently and reasonably manage its networks as provided in RISEâs Open Internet Statement which may be updated from time to time and is available at https://www.risebroadband.com/legal/open-internet-statement-and-policy/.

From time to time, the computer equipment required to access and use the Service may change.
Accordingly, USERâs computer equipment may cease to be adequate to access the Service.
In such event, USERâS sole remedy will be to upgrade computer equipment or terminate this Agreement.
It is possible for hardware and software below RISEâs stated minimum requirements to work on RISEâs network.
