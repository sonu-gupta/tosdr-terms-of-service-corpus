This privacy policy ("Policy") sets out how we, Joya Communications Inc.
("Joya"), makers of the Marco PoloÂ® video sharing app (the âMarco Polo Appâ) and Marco Polo Channels app (the âChannels App,â and together with the Marco Polo App, the âApps,â use and protect the personal information of people who use the Apps or who visit Marco Polo websites such as www.marcopolo.me (the âMarco Polo Websiteâ).
We will refer to the Marco Polo App, Channels App, and Marco Polo Website collectively as the "Service" or âMarco Polo.â
Privacy Principles
Joya has two fundamental principles when it comes to personal information:

We don't sell your personal information or use it to show you ads.
We only store the personal information that we need to operate our Service so you can communicate with the people you choose.

This Policy applies to anyone who accesses the Service.
By visiting the Website and/or using the Apps or Service, you acknowledge that the collection, use, and sharing of your information will take place as described in this Policy.
So we are clear about the terminology we are using, when we use the phrase "Personal Information" in this Privacy Policy, we mean information that is capable of being associated with or could reasonably be linked with you, such as your name, email, or mobile number.
What we collect
Marco Polo is a communication service.
To operate the Service, we may collect Personal Information you choose to provide us.
1.
Marco Polo App
a.
Basic Account Data
To create a Marco Polo account (âAccountâ), you provide your mobile number, your name and your email address, and may choose to provide your photo, birth day and birth month.
Only other registered Marco Polo users that:

already have your phone number in their phoneâs address book,
are in a group with you, or
you invited to Marco Polo

may see your name, photo, mobile number, email, birth day and/or birth month.
Note that users who have you in their contacts will see you by the name theyâve saved and not by the name you provided to Marco Polo.
For example, your spouse will still see you as âLoveâ when they use the app if thatâs how you appear in their phoneâs address book.
If you chose to provide them, we collect your birth day and month so people you know get reminded when itâs your birthday.
b.
Polo Messages and Scrapbooks
Marco Polo is a cloud service.
We may collect and store the content you create, including videos (or âPolosâ), photos, short video clips you share with selected contacts (or âScrapbook momentsâ), and text messages.
We store this Personal Information on our servers so that you can access your data anytime from any of your devices that have the Marco Polo App without having to rely on third-party backups or use up your phoneâs memory.
Our servers are located in the United States.
c.
Contacts
You may choose to provide us with your friends' contact information as stored on your phone.
Marco Polo uses mobile phone numbers and email addresses as unique identifiers so that it is easy for you to find and communicate with other people you know.
We ask your permission before syncing your contacts, and you can still use the app without giving it access to your contacts (though you will have a harder time finding people you know who also use Marco Polo).
We store your contacts on our servers in order to notify you as soon as one of your contacts creates a Marco Polo Account and to properly display their names.
We store their name, phone number(s), email address(es), and/or birth day and month for this to work.
Our automatic algorithms also use this data to suggest which of your contacts you might like to communicate with on Marco Polo.
We use this information to suggest people to invite to join Marco Polo but we do not contact anyone in your phoneâs contact list without your permission.
Other than our Service Providers that we describe below, we do not share your contacts with third parties unless required to do so in response to valid legal requests, such as through a court order or search warrant.
2.
Channels App
Through Channels, you can be a leader or member of a Channels group.
Leaders facilitate learning and/or provide guidance on various topics.
You can subscribe to become a Channels member by joining a particular leaderâs group and paying the subscription fee set by that leader.
a.
Basic Account Data
To create a Marco Polo Channels member account (âAccountâ), you provide your mobile number, your name, and your email address, and may choose to provide your photo and other social media identifiers.
Channel leaders will have access to this data while you maintain an active paid membership to their channel.
Other Channels group members will see your name and photo, but your email and mobile number will not be shared with other Channels group members unless you explicitly choose to do so.
b.
Other Data
If you subscribe to a Channels group, the Channels leader and other members will also receive any other personal information you choose to share with the group.
To be a Channels member, you pay the subscription fee directly to the Channels leader or through Joya.
If through Joya, you need to provide a valid credit card number, expiration date, CCV, and billing zipcode.
This data is directly processed by Stripe and only the last four digits of the credit card number and billing zip code are made available to Joya and the group leader.
Although we receive the last four digits of Channels membersâ credit card number, we do not store it.
Also, although Channels leaders may also see the last four digits of membersâ credit card number, they are contractually obligated to not share or otherwise use that information.
For more information about how Stripe will use this information, please visit Stripeâs privacy policy at https://stripe.com/privacy-center/legal.
3.
User Support
If you contact Marco Polo support, any Personal Information you may share with us is used only for the purposes of researching the issue and contacting you about your request.
4.
Additional Technical Information

Notification Choices
By default, Marco Polo sends you emails and notifications regarding activities on the Service, e.g., when you receive a Polo from one of your contacts or when a Channels group leader you subscribe to posts a new video.
We may also communicate with you via informational, transactional, or marketing emails and/or text messages.
