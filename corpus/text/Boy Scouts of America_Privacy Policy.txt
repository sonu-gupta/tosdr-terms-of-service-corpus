Note regarding definitions: The following terms, as used in this policy, have the following meanings:

âPersonal informationâ means information that identifies (whether directly or indirectly) a particular individual, such as the individualâs name, postal address, email address, telephone number, and birth date.
When anonymous information is directly or indirectly associated with personal information, the resulting information also is treated as personal information.
âAnonymous dataâ means information that does not directly or indirectly identify, and cannot reasonably be used to identify, an individual person.
âAggregate dataâ means information about groups or categories of people, which does not identify and cannot reasonably be used to identify an individual person.

What We Collect
We collect two basic types of information â personal information and anonymous data â and we may use personal information and anonymous data to create a third type of information, aggregate data.
For example, we collect:

Note: The information you provide to BSA local councils through their websites and applications is collected separately by them and is subject to their privacy practices and those of their service providers.
Privacy choices you have made on a local councilâs website or application will not apply to our use of information we have collected directly through our websites and applications.

Consistent with applicable law and choices and controls that may be available to you, we may use information collected from you, or from devices associated with you, to:

Provide you with the products, services, and/or information you have requested, purchased, or won (e.g., in a contest or promotion)

We may share personal information you provided when joining one of our affinity groups (e.g., the National Eagle Scout Association, Scouting Alumni &amp.
Friends) with carefully selected providers of membership benefits, for the sole purpose of such providers communicating with you about such benefits to you.
However, we do not share any lists of current or former registered members or leaders of the BSA or lists of BSA donors with any third party for its direct marketing purposes.

In addition, we may share your personal information:

With third parties providing services for us or on our behalf, such as order and prize fulfillment, package delivery, customer service, event registration management, payment processing, financing and advertising, marketing, or data analytics services.
however, such service providers are prohibited from using your personal information for their marketing purposes or any other purpose not specified by us or required by law.
With others associated with your Scouting unit, including approved users of our application programming interfaces (APIs), for the purposes of efficient unit administration.
This might include sharing information about the awards, advancements, recognition, and training you have received in or through our programs.
With third parties to enforce our policies and regulations, to ensure the safety and security of our members, volunteers, donors, employees and third parties, to protect our rights and property and the rights and property of our members, volunteers, donors, employees and third parties, to comply with legal process or in other cases if we believe in good faith that disclosure is required by law.

Your Controls and Choices
You always have the choice to not provide your personal information to us or change your communication choices, but consequently you may not be able to receive certain goods or services or participate in certain programs or activities.
Certain communications are mandatory for all registered adult volunteers and others attending or participating in certain Scouting events, as explained below.
Depending on the Internet browser and device you use to interact with us, you may have the ability to control the use of certain tracking technologies through which we gather anonymous data.
For further information about exercising these choices and controls, please see below.


Mandatory Communications.
As long as you are registered adult leader of the BSA, you may not choose whether or not to receive non-commercial notifications related to the safety and operations of BSAâs programs, such as messages about Youth Protection Training and the health and safety policies of the BSA.

My.scouting.org

You may have created an account through a BSA website not listed here.
If you need assistance accessing a BSA website not listed here, please contact BSA Member Care by calling 972-580-2000 or submitting a request at membercare.scouting.org.


Marketing.
As a matter of BSA policy, lists of current and former registered members and leaders of the BSA and lists of BSA donors may not be used for commercial purposes, such as selling or renting such lists to other businesses for their direct marketing purposes.
We may send you offers and promotions for our products, programs, and events, or those that we think may be of interest to you, and you may opt-out or unsubscribe from such offers by either following the instructions provided in our communications to you or changing your preferences in your account.


NOTE: If you have separately joined one of our affinity groups, such as Scouting Alumni &amp.
Friends, you may receive as a benefit of membership targeted offers and promotions for products and services from carefully selected third parties.
You may exercise your choice to not receive such offers or promotions at any time by following the third partyâs opt-out procedures or contacting us at the address listed below.


Tracking Technologies.
We use cookies to track user activity on our websites and online services, but we do not collect personal information about your online activities over time as you move across other websites and online services.
Web browsers can transmit Do Not Track (âDNTâ) signals that indicate that a user does not wish to have activity tracked.
Currently, no universally accepted standard exists for how to interpret such signals, and we do not respond to Do Not Track signals.
Thus, whether or not you have turned on your DNT setting should not affect your experience or interaction with our websites or online services.
Learn more about Do Not Track.

Childrenâs Privacy
Digital privacy is a component of BSAâs commitment to youth protection and safety.
As such, we do not collect the personal information of children under the age of 13 unless a childâs parent or legal guardian provides it to us through the online membership registration process or a child provides it to us to enter a contest or promotion.
In any event, consistent with the U.S.
Childrenâs Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), a parent may review or have deleted their childâs personal information, and prohibit its further collection or use.
If you have a request in relation to the personal information of your child below the age of 13, please send an email to privacy@scouting.org.
For contests and promotions, we typically require only the information necessary for a child to enter, such as first name (to distinguish among family members) and his or her online contact information.
We will only use the childâs online contact information to enter him or her into the contest or promotion and contact him or her once when the contest ends.
If a contest or sweepstakes asks the child to submit his or her own created content with the entry and that content contains the childâs personal information, then we will either pre-screen the submission to remove any personal information or seek parental consent by email for the collection.
To facilitate delivery of the contestâs prize, we may ask a child at the time of entry to also provide her or her parent or legal guardianâs online contact information, which we will only use to notify the parent or legal guardian if the child wins the contest or promotion.
Our sites and applications that are age-gated are not intended for use by children, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 through those sites and applications.
In the unlikely event we discover that we have collected personal information from a child other than as described in this section, we will either delete the information immediately or promptly seek the parent or legal guardianâs consent to use the information.
Data Security, Integrity and Retention
The security, integrity and confidentiality of your information are extremely important to us.
We have implemented technical, administrative and physical security measures that are designed to protect guest information from unauthorized access, disclosure, use and modification.
From time to time, we review our security procedures to consider appropriate new technology and methods.
Please be aware though that, despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.
We will retain your personal information for the length of time needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
Changes
From time to time, we may change this privacy policy to accommodate new technologies, industry practices, regulatory requirements or for other purposes.
We will provide notice to you if these changes are material, either by direct notice or posting an announcement on the websites where this policy is posted, and, if required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent.
Comments and Questions
If you have a comment or question about this policy or our treatment of your information, you may email us at privacy@scouting.org, write to us at Boy Scouts of America, Attn: Privacy Compliance-Legal Department, 1325 West Walnut Hill Lane, Irving, Texas 75038, or contact our Member Care Center at (972) 580-2000.
Our sites and applications may contain links to other sites not owned or controlled by us and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of those sites.
We encourage you to be aware when you leave our sites or applications and to read the privacy policies of other sites that may collect your personal information.

General Data Protection Regulation:
Article 13 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires those who collect personal information from individuals in the European Union to provide certain information to such individuals at the time their personal information is collected.
In GDPR parlance, those who collect and direct the use of such personal information are referred to as âdata controllersâ or simply âcontrollersâ, and such individuals are referred to as âdata subjectsâ.
The terms âprocessingâ, âprofilingâ, and ârecipientâ are defined in Article 4 of the GDPR, as is the term âpersonal dataâ, which is analogous to the term âpersonal informationâ used in this policy.
Much of the information required by Article 13 is set forth elsewhere in this policy.
For ease of reference, below we have indexed the contents of this policy to the specific requirements of Article 13 and included additional commentary as appropriate:
