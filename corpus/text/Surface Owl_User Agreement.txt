General Terms

To the extent allowed by law, the English version of this Agreement is binding and other translations are for convenience only.
This Agreement (including additional terms that may be provided by us when you engage with a feature of the Services) is the only agreement between us regarding the Services and supersedes all prior agreements for the Services.
If we don't act to enforce a breach of this Agreement, that does not mean that surfaceOwl has waived its right to enforce this Agreement.
You may not assign or transfer this Agreement (or your membership or use of Services) to anyone without our consent.
However, you agree that surfaceOwl may assign this Agreement to its affiliates or a party that buys it without your consent.
There are no third party beneficiaries to this Agreement.
