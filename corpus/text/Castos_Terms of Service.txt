Availability, Errors and Inaccuracies

We are continuously updating product and service offerings on the Service.
We may experience delays in updating information on the Service and in our advertising on other web sites.
The information found on the Service may contain errors or inaccuracies and may not be complete or current.
Products or services may be mispriced, described inaccurately, or unavailable on the Service and we cannot guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any information found on the Service.
We therefore reserve the right to change or update information and to correct errors, inaccuracies, or omissions at any time without prior notice.

Subscriptions

Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis (âSubscription(s)â).
You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (âBilling Cycleâ).
Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.
At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Castos cancels it.
You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting Castos customer support team.
A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription.
You shall provide Castos with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information.
By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Castos to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.
Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Castos will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.

Free Trial

Castos may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time (âFree Trialâ).
The terms of the Free Trial are as follows:

The Free Trial is for 14-days, starting from the date on which you registered for your Castos Account.
You are only allowed to have ONE Free Trial per Castos Account.
Once the Free Trial ends, unless you log in and provide your billing information and make a payment sufficient to cover the first monthâs fees (âSubscribeâ), your Castos site(s) and RSS feeds will be disabled, during which time, visitors to your Castos Website(s) and RSS feed will see a message stating that the Website is no longer available.
If you do not Subscribe within 90 days following the end of the Free Trial, we will release your Site Link(s) into the public pool of available Site Links for other users to choose from, and the account will be queued for deletion.

At any time and without notice, Castos reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.

Fee Changes

Castos, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions.
Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.
Castos will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.
Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.
If you upgrade from a free trial to any paid Plan, we will immediately bill you for the applicable Subscription Fees.
There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open account.

Refunds

Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by Castos on a case-by-case basis and granted in sole discretion of Castos.
Specifically, refunds may be given in the event of a material or security breach, or if Castos no longer fuflills their role as a hosting and distribution platform.
