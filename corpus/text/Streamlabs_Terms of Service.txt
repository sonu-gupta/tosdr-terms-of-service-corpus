MISUSE OF THE DMCA CAN SUBJECT YOU TO LIABILITY.
 Disputes - ARBITRATION  Before bringing a formal legal case, please first try contacting our Customer Support team.
Most disputes can be resolved that way.

 To the extent permitted under applicable law, any and all disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the breach thereof, or any use of the Websites (including all commercial transactions conducted through the Website) ("Claims"), except for claims filed in a small claims court that proceed on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis, shall be settled by binding arbitration before a single arbitrator appointed by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with its then governing rules and procedures, including the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, where applicable.
In agreeing to arbitrate all Claims, you and Streamlabs waive all rights to a trial by jury in any action or proceeding involving any Claim.
The arbitration shall be held in San Francisco, California, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof.
This arbitration undertaking is made pursuant to and in connection with a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act at 9 U.S.C.
Section 1, et seq.
This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.
Subject to the limitations set forth below, the arbitrator shall have authority to award legal and equitable relief available in the courts of the State of California, provided that: 

The arbitrator shall not have authority to award punitive damages.
and
 Any and all claims shall be arbitrated on an individual basis only, and shall not be consolidated or joined with or in any arbitration or other proceeding involving a Claim of any other party.
You and Streamlabs agree that the arbitrator shall have no authority to arbitrate any Claim as a class action or in any other form other than on an individual basis.

 For any Claims that are not subject to arbitration: (a) the exclusive jurisdiction and venue for proceedings involving Claims shall be the courts of competent jurisdiction sitting within San Francisco County, California (the "Forum"), and the parties hereby waive any argument that any such court does not have personal jurisdiction or that the Forum is not appropriate or convenient.
(b) you and Streamlabs waive any and all rights to trial by jury with respect to any Claims.

 In the event that either party initiates a proceeding involving any Claim other than an arbitration in accordance with this Section, or initiates a proceeding involving a Claim under this Section other than in the Forum, the other party shall recover all attorneys' fees and expenses reasonably incurred in enforcing this Agreement to arbitrate and the Forum to which the parties have herein agreed.


 NO CLASS ACTIONS.
We all agree that we can only bring a claim against each other on an individual basis.
That means: (a) neither you nor Streamlabs can bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class action, consolidated action or representative action.
(b) an arbitrator cannot combine more than one personâs claim into a single case, and cannot preside over any consolidated, class or representative arbitration proceeding (unless we both agree to change this).
(c) an arbitratorâs decision or award in one personâs case can only impact the person who brought the claim, not other Streamlabs users, and cannot be used to decide other disputes with other users.
If a court decides that this subsection on "No Class Actions" is not enforceable or valid, then the entire section covering Disputes will be null and void, but, the rest of the terms of these Terms of Use will still apply.
 Miscellaneous  These Terms of Use shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles.
Any claim or dispute between you and Streamlabs that arises in whole or in part from the Terms of Use, the Websites or any Contest shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in San Francisco County, California.

 Nothing in the Terms of Use shall create or confer any rights or other benefits in favor of any third parties except as specifically provided herein.
By participating in any Contest on the Websites, you agree to indemnify, protect, defend and hold harmless Streamlabs, its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates and divisions, and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives, from and against any and all third party claims, liabilities, losses, damages, injuries, demands, actions, causes of action, suits, proceedings, judgments and expenses, including reasonable attorneysâ fees, court costs and other legal expenses including, without limitation, those costs incurred at the trial and appellate levels and in any bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency or other similar proceedings, and any other legal expenses (collectively, "Claims") arising from or connected with your use of the Websites, any payment methods used, any funding of your account, and/or your participation in any Contest.
The Websites may contain links to third party websites that are not owned or controlled by Streamlabs.
Streamlabs has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party websites.
In addition, Streamlabs will not and cannot censor or edit the content of any third-party site.
By using the Websites, you expressly relieve Streamlabs from any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party website.
Accordingly, we encourage you to be aware when you leave the Websites and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each other website that you visit.

 Nothing in the Terms of Use shall create or be deemed to create a partnership, agency, trust arrangement, fiduciary relationship or joint venture between you and Streamlabs.

 No professional or amateur sports league or any team associated with any professional or amateur sports league is associated with Streamlabs or in any way affiliated or associated with the Contests.

 Third-party online publishers that refer users to the Streamlabs website shall not be responsible or liable for the Streamlabs website or any of the content, software, or functions made available on, or accessed through, or sent from, the Streamlabs website.

 If any provision of these Terms of Use is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms of Use, which shall remain in full force and effect.

 No waiver of any term of these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Streamlabs' failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

 Streamlabs reserves the right to amend these Terms of Use at any time and without notice, and it is your responsibility to review these Terms of Use for any changes.
If you continue to use the Services after we change the Terms of Use, you accept all changes.
The failure of Streamlabs to comply with any provision of these Terms of Use due to an act of God, hurricane, war, fire, riot, earthquake, terrorism, act of public enemies, actions of governmental authorities outside of the control of the Company (excepting compliance with applicable codes and regulations) or other force majeure event will not be considered a breach of these Terms of Use.
