The Information We Collect.
The information that we collect about you falls into certain categories as further described in this Section 3 (The Information We Collect).
This information consists of the following: 



&nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
3.1 Personal Information.
We collect certain information that identifies you as an individual (collectively, âPersonal Informationâ).
The Personal Information we collect may include the following:

Your name;
Your address;
Your email address;
Your phone number; 
Your social security number;
Your date of birth;
Your financial account information; 
Your other transaction history;
Your browsing history when logged into our Website; 
Your academic information (including school name and expected graduation year) and other information that you may submit to us in conjunction with your application to our scholarship program;
Photos, videos, or other materials of personal nature (such as written statements or testimonials) depicting you or otherwise relating to you;
Device identifiers, such as cookies;
Device information, such as hardware and software settings; 
Other characteristics of a user device, which, by themselves or taken in conjunction with other information, are sufficient to distinguish that user device over time from a population of other user devices;
IP addresses and log information, such as your deviceâs name, the type and version of your web browser, and referrer addresses that can function to identify a user device.
and
Tracking information that we, or a third party, collects.


&nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
3.2 Online Activity Information.
We also collect technical and device-related information through our Website and third-party analytics tools that we use (collectively, âOnline Activity Informationâ).
Sometimes Online Activity Information can be associated with your Personal Information, in which case we will treat it as Personal Information (as described in Section 3.4 (Treatment of Combined Information)).
Otherwise we consider, and treat, Online Activity Information as Anonymous Information.

&nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
3.3 Anonymous Information.
We also collect, process, and/or use information that does not identify you or your devices, including Personal Information that has been made anonymous by: (i) removing identifying fields and aggregating the information with other information so that individual subjects of the information cannot be re-identified, or (ii) anonymizing the information with techniques that remove or modify the identifying data so as to prevent re-identification of the anonymized information (collectively, âAnonymous Informationâ).
Information that meets these criteria might include, for example, demographic information, statistical information (e.g., page views and hit counts), and general tracking information.
We use Anonymous Information for our business operations, for example, to engage in marketing and other activities in a manner that protects our customers.
Since Anonymous Information does not include Personal Information, it is outside the scope of this Privacy Policy.

&nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
3.4 Treatment of Combined Information.
To enable us to better understand the characteristics of our users and/or to conduct the Business, we may link your Personal Information with Online Activity Information associated with you or other Anonymous Information.
If we combine or associate Online Activity Information or other Anonymous Information with your Personal Information, then we will treat the resulting combination as Personal Information.

We may send email messages, which use a âclick-through URLâ linked to content related to our Business.
