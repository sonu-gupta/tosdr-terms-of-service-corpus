We use methods such as âConnect with Googleâ and âConnect with Microsoftâ to securely access your email inbox.
These methods are based on the OAUTH2 secured authorization protocol, which means we donât have any access to your password.

Every time you decide to reclaim your Personal Data from a company, the request is transmitted directly from your email inbox.
