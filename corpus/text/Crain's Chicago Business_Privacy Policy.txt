For example, we may use your stated job title and activity to provide information we think are relevant to your job function. We may use your email domain to infer your affiliation with a particular organization or industry to personalize the content and experience you receive on our websites. Where you use multiple Products, we combine information about you and your activities to provide an integrated experience, such as to allow you to find information from one Product while searching from another or to present relevant product information as you travel across our websites.&nbsp.
 


For research and development
:&nbsp.
We are always looking for ways to make our Products more useful, relevant, faster, and secure to you.&nbsp.
We use collective learnings about how people use our Products and feedback provided directly to us to troubleshoot and to identify trends, usage, activity patterns and areas for integration and improvement of the Products. &nbsp.
We automatically analyze and aggregate frequently viewed articles to improve relevance of suggested topics that auto-populate when you use the search feature.  In some cases, we apply these learnings across our Products to improve and develop similar features or to better integrate the services you use.
We also test and analyze certain new features with some users before rolling the feature out to all users.

Information storage and security

We use data hosting service providers in the United States, UK and Denmark to host the information we collect, and we use technical measures to secure your data.  While we implement safeguards designed to protect your information, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that data, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others.

How long we keep information

How long we keep information we collect about you depends on the type of information, as described in further detail below.&nbsp.
After such time, we will either delete or anonymize your information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.  


Account information
: We retain your account information for as long as your account is active and a reasonable period thereafter in case you decide to re-activate the Products.&nbsp.
We also retain some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations, and to continue to develop and improve our Products.

Below is a summary of those choices, how to exercise them and any limitations.

Your Choices: 
You have the right to request a copy of your information, to object to our use of your information (including for marketing purposes), to request the deletion or restriction of your information, or to request your information in a structured, electronic format.&nbsp.
Below, we describe the tools and processes for making these requests.&nbsp.
You can exercise some of the choices by logging into the Products and using settings available within the Products or your account. Where the Products are administered for you by an employer (see "Notice to End Users" below), you may first need to contact your employer to assist with your request.  For all other requests, you may contact us as provided in the Contact Us section below to request assistance.
Your request and choices may be limited in certain cases: for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal information about another person, or if you ask to delete information which we or your administrator are permitted by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep.&nbsp.
If you have unresolved concerns, you may have the right to complain to a data protection authority in the country where you live, where you work or where you feel your rights were infringed.


Access and update your information
: Our Products give you the ability to access and update certain information about you from within the Product.
For example, you can access your profile information from your account.&nbsp.
You can update your profile information within your profile settings and modify content that contains information about you using the editing tools associated with that content.

If you can deactivate your own account, that setting is available to you in your account settings.
Otherwise, please contact your employer.
Please be aware that deactivating your account does not delete your information.  


Delete your information
: In some cases, you may ask us to delete accessing, storing, using and otherwise processing your information.&nbsp.
You request by contacting customer service.
Please note, however, that we may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes, to complete transactions or to comply with our legal obligations.&nbsp.
 


Request that we stop using your information
:  In some cases, you may ask us to stop accessing, storing, using and otherwise processing your information where you believe we don't have the appropriate rights to do so.&nbsp.
For example, if you believe an account was created for you without your permission or you are no longer an active user, you can request that we delete your account as provided in this policy.  Where you gave us consent to use your information for a limited purpose, you can contact us to withdraw that consent, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place at the time.
You can also opt-out of our use of your information for marketing purposes by contacting us, as provided below.  When you make such requests, we may need time to investigate and facilitate your request.&nbsp.
If there is delay or dispute as to whether we have the right to continue using your information, we will restrict any further use of your information until the request is honored or the dispute is resolved, provided your employer does not object (where applicable).  


Opt out of communications
: You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us by using the unsubscribe link within each email, updating your email preferences within your Product account settings menu, or by contacting us as provided below to have your contact information removed from our promotional email list or registration database.&nbsp.

Send "Do Not Track" Signals
: Some browsers have incorporated "Do Not Track" (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked.
Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, our Products do not currently respond to browser DNT signals.
You can use the range of other tools we provide to control data collection and use, including the ability to opt out of receiving marketing from us as described above.


Data portability
: Data portability is the ability to obtain some of your information in a format you can move from one service provider to another (for instance, when you transfer your mobile phone number to another carrier).&nbsp.

Exercising Your Privacy Rights

To exercise your privacy rights described above, please submit a request to us by either filling out our Privacy Request Form (link below) or calling us at 1-877-860-9145.
You can submit a request to us to exercise the following privacy rights using the link below, which will take you to a form: Right to Know, Right to Delete, Shine the Light, and/or to submit a âDo Not Sellâ request for any âsaleâ not related to interest-based advertising.

SUBMIT PRIVACY REQUEST

Click this link to make a privacy request:  http://x.e.crainalerts.com/ats/show.aspx?cr=879&fm=44
For your protection, we will take steps to verify your identity before granting access to your personal data or other information.
For example, we may verify your Privacy Request by matching information you provide with our records, or you may be asked to log in to your online account (if applicable).
We may request additional information to verify your identity depending on the nature of the Privacy Request and the sensitivity of the information sought.
Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf may submit a Privacy Request to us.
You may only submit a Privacy Request twice within a 12-month period.
We cannot respond to your Privacy Request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm that the personal information relates to you. Submitting a Privacy Request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a Privacy Request to verify the requestorâs identity or authority to make the request.

Response Timing and Format

We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your verifiable Privacy Request. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:

Deny you goods or services.
Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.

You may opt in by registering for one of these programs, but if you would like to register without providing your personal information, please fill out the Privacy Request form and you will be advised of the price difference.
