California âDo Not Sell My Personal Infoâ Notice.
Like many companies online, we use advertising services that use information collected from cookies and similar technologies to try to make the ads you see on other websites more relevant to your interests.
This is called interest-based advertising.
See the section of our Privacy Policy entitled Use of Cookies and Other Technology to Collect Information for details.
Although we do not sell your information to these companies for money, our use of these services may constitute a âsaleâ of Personal Information from which you have the right to opt-out for purposes of the CCPA.
You can opt-out of the use of your information for interest-based advertising by: 

Browser settings. Blocking third party cookies in your web browser settings.

Privacy browsers/plug-ins. Using privacy browsers or ad-blocking browser plug-ins that let you block advertising trackers.

Ad industry tools. Opting-out of interest-based ads from companies participating in the following industry opt-out programs: 

Network Advertising Initiative: https://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.aspx 

Digital Advertising Alliance:

Opt-out (optout.aboutads.info), which will allow you to opt-out of interest based ads served by on websites by participating members.
AppChoices mobile app (available at https://www.youradchoices.com/appchoices), which will allow you to opt-out of interest-based ads in mobile apps served by participating members.





Mobile settings. Using your mobile device settings to limit use of the advertising ID associated with your mobile device for interest-based advertising purposes.


We recommend that you take all of these steps if you want to prevent collection of your information for interest-based ads.
You will need to apply these opt-out settings on each device from which you wish to opt-out.
Not all companies that serve interest-based ads participate in these opt-out programs, so even after opting-out, you may still receive cookies and interest-based ads from other companies.
If you opt-out, you will still see advertisements online but they may be less relevant to you.
