You expressly agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless PETA and its directors, officers, employees, servants, agents, representatives, independent contractors, and affiliates from and against any and all claims, damages, liabilities, actions, causes of action, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneysâ fees), judgments, or penalties of any kind or nature whatsoever arising from your use of the Service.
These terms shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, except for the terms of arbitration below, which are subject to the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) because the Service involves interstate commerce.
Arbitration: You agree that any and all claims arising from or relating to this agreement, your relationship with PETA, and/or the Service shall be subject to binding arbitration under the FAA.
This includes claims based on contract, tort, equity, or statute as well as claims regarding the scope and enforceability of this provision.
It includes all claims by or against you, PETA, or PETAâs affiliates or vendors, such as Upland Software.
A single arbitrator shall decide all claims and shall render a final, written decision.
You may choose the American Arbitration Association (AAA), the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service (JAMS), or another similar arbitration service provider acceptable to PETA to administer the arbitration.
Consistent with the FAA, the appropriate AAA rules, JAMS rules, or rules of another service provider shall apply, as determined by the arbitrator.
For AAA and JAMS, these rules are found at adr.org and jamsadr.com.
Each party to the arbitration shall pay his, her, or its own costs of arbitration unless prohibited by law or the applicable arbitration rules.
If you canât afford your arbitration costs, you may apply for a waiver under the relevant rules.
The parties waive any right to bring representative claims on behalf of a class of individuals (a class action waiver).
This arbitration provision may be severed or modified if necessary to render it enforceable.
