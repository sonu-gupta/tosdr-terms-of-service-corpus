This Cookie Policy (âPolicyâ) explains how Webflow, Inc.
("Webflow", "we", "us" and "our") uses cookies and similar technologies (like web beacons) when you visit any of our websites that link to this Cookie Policy (such as www.webflow.com) ("Websites").

It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.
In some cases, we may use cookies and similar technologies to collect Personal Information or information that becomes Personal Information if we combine it with other information.
In such cases, the Webflow Global Privacy Policy will also apply, as will the EU &amp.
Swiss Privacy Policy, if applicable.
Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Policy have the meaning given them in our Webflow Global Privacy Policy or our Terms of Service. Hi there Welcome to Webflow's Cookie Policy! 
If it was purely up to us, we'd made this policy all about giving out fresh-baked cookies every time you design something awesome in Webflow â but alas, we'll need to talk more about browsers than snickerdoodles in this particular policy. What cookies are A cookie is a small software file stored temporarily or placed on your computerâs hard drive.
The main purpose of a cookie is to allow a web server to identify a userâs computer and web browser and tailor web pages and/or login information to a userâs preferences.
Cookies help us promptly display the information needed to use the capabilities on the Service and other information which we consider to be of interest to visitors to the Sites and users of the Service.
By gathering and remembering information about website preferences through cookies, we can provide a better web and marketing experience.
Cookies do not give us access to your computer. Cookie (n) 
1: a small flat or slightly raised cake

2: a person of a specified kind    â¢ a tough 

cookie



3: a small file or part of a file stored on a World Wide Web user's computer, created and subsequently read by a website server, and containing personal information (such as a user identification code, customized preferences, or a record of pages visited) The types of cookies Webflow uses There are two types of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies.
We use both session and persistent cookies.
Session cookies allow us to uniquely identify your browser while you are logged in and to process your online transactions.
Session cookies disappear from your computer when the web browser is closed or computer is turned off.
We also utilize persistent cookies to make it easier to log into and use the Service.
Persistent cookies remain on computers after the web browser is closed or the computer is turned off. Basically...
We use session cookies, persistent cookies, and pecan sandies.
The names of two out of three of those are surprisingly clear.
 Cookies on customer sites We do not add any cookies to customer sites.
The cookies described in this Policy only apply to Webflowâs own marketing and product pages, not websites that are created with Webflow or published via Webflow Hosting.
Customers may make changes to their websites at their own discretion that may cause cookies to be added (for example, enabling Google Analytics, using a Facebook Like button, or adding custom code), but these changes are optional and not made by Webflow.
 Basically...
We'd love to give you all the tasty kind of cookies, but we don't put the tracking kind on the sites you create or host with Webflow. Third-party cookies Cookies set by us are called "first-party cookies," while cookies set by others are called "third-party cookies." A third-party cookie can recognize your device both when it visits our Services and when it visits certain other websites or mobile apps.
Webflow does not control how third-party cookies are used, so you should check the website of a third-party cookie provider for more information about how they are used.

Both first-party and third-party cookies can serve many functions, including analytics, marketing, and advertising.
For more information about how you can control advertising or analytics cookies, please see the relevant section below.

We do not track or respond to browser âDo Not Trackâ requests. Basically...
Third-party cookies are other people's cookies.
 Cookies and your Personal Information Some cookies are associated with your account and Personal Information, while others are not.
We generally treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as nonâPersonal information.
However, to the extent that IP addresses or similar identifiers are considered Personal Information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as Personal Information.
If we combine non-Personal Information with Personal Information, then the combined information will be treated as Personal Information for as long as it remains combined. Basically...
Some cookies are completely anonymous, while some may contain your personal information.

How to Live Cookieless and Ensure All Ads You See Are Completely Irrelevant Webflow's use of log files Webflow gathers certain information automatically and stores it in log files.
This information includes an anonymized internet protocol address as well as browser, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, search terms, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.
Otherwise, we generally use this information as we would any Usage Data, to analyze trends, administer and maintain the Service, or track usage of various features within the Service. Anyway...
Log as in record.
Not Yule log.
 Webflow's use of clear GIFs/web beacons When you use the Service, we may employ clear GIFs (also known as web beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our users.
In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients.
The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service. Anyway...
That's web beacon, not bacon.
Much as we'd all prefer the latter. Changes to Webflow's Cookie Policy We may, in our sole discretion, modify or update this Policy from time to time.
If we make any material changes to this Policy, we will endeavor to notify you by email or by posting a prominent notice on the Sites prior to the change becoming effective, but will not be liable for any failure to do so.
We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.
Your continued use of the Service constitutes your acceptance to be bound by such changes to this Policy.
