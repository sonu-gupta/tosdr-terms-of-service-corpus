Health Information

Personal details about your physical or mental health are considered âspecial categories of personal dataâ under the GDPR and applicable data protection laws.
We will only process such data where you have given your explicit consent (for example, where you request special assistance before or during a flight, we will need to provide this information to our staff or our service providers at those airports to and from which you will be flying so they can provide the assistance you have requested),&nbsp.
or where it is necessary to protect your vital interests or those of other people (for instance, if you request special assistance), or where you have deliberately made this information public.
The processing of such personal data, including Covid-19 Data (as defined above), may also be necessary for compliance with public health legislation, regulatory requirements or other entry requirements in your destination/s.&nbsp.
Some of these requirements apply directly to you as a passenger and some apply to Ryanair and we are required to ensure (and may be required to demonstrate to our regulators, law enforcement and public health authorities) that these requirements have been complied with in the interests of public health.
When you upload Covid-19 Data during online check-in, in relation to a single booking, you do so on a voluntary basis, in which case the documents will be deleted from your device 48 hours after your flight departure.
We will retain a copy for three years (unless you request that we erase the copy) solely for the purpose of demonstrating our compliance with public health travel requirements as airlines are subject to heavy fines for allowing passengers without valid vaccine certificates and/or test certificates and/or locator forms to board their flight.
In addition to the above you can also choose to upload your Digital Covid Cert to your mobile phone during online check-in, in which case it will be saved for future bookings on your mobile phone, and you may remove this document at any time. 
When you have a specific medical condition, you need to inform us of that and in some instances provide us with a medical certificate.
This is for your safety and the safety of other passengers.
Our General Terms &amp.

We have described below these purposes and all the other purposes your data may be used for.
We will only process your data for these stated purposes.
