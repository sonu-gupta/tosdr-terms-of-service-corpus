 elementary OS

We do not collect any data from elementary OS. Your files, settings, and all other personal data remain on-device unless you explicitly share them with a third-party app or service.
Protections
elementary OS comes with built-in privacy protections to help protect your data from others.
Tattle-tale
elementary OS helps you keep tabs on what apps are up to.
When an app is using your microphone, we display an indicator to let you know.
When an app is using a lot of energy, we tell you in your power indicator.
Permissions
When an app wants access to your data or devices, it has to ask up front.
We review all AppCenter apps to ensure theyâre properly using permissionsâand you can always revoke them yourself in System Settings.
Housekeeping
elementary OS automatically keeps your temporary and trashed files tidied up.
Not only does this keep your deviceâs storage free, it can help ensure your private data doesnât come back to haunt you.
Online Accounts
elementary OS optionally integrates with online accounts such as email and calendar providers via System Settings.
Data from these providers may be retrieved by your copy of elementary OS and stored locally on your device to be displayed in locally-installed apps such as Mail, Calendar, and Tasks.
This data is not sent to elementary or shared with any third party.

What Data is Collected
If you choose to add an online account, your copy of elementary OS may collect and store your name, email address, avatar, email messages, calendar events, contacts, photos, and files from your connected accounts locally on your device.
