 Personalization and data We want to provide you with the most interesting content when you use Pinterest.
Sometimes we use information from Pinterest site features like the Save button to do this.
Our advertising partners may also give us information about your off-Pinterest activity to give you better personalized ads.
You can choose whether we use the information to customize Pinterest for you by going to your account settings.
Save button and site features
If you go to a site that has the Save button or a Pinterest widget, Pinterest can use info about that visit to personalize your experience back on Pinterest, to measure ad effectiveness, and for other purposes described in our cookie policy.
Turn off personalization
If you donât want Pinterest using stuff you do off Pinterest to personalize your experience, here are some things you can do:

Go to your account privacy settings and turn off Personalization
Change your browserâs Do Not Track feature to keep Pinterest and other sites from using this info for personalization
