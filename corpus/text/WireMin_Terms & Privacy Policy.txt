Privacy Policy 
WireMin is a democratized network based on interconnected users' devices.
WireMin apps are designed as equal nodes in the network that communicate with nodes of other users with common protocols.
It is not based on cloud service nor centric servers, such that no single bit of user data will be transferred or stored in any computing facility controlled by us.
WireMin messages and multimedia as well as user identities and social relationship data are stored and replicated only among users' devices with end-to-end encryption, which allows only the user and intended recipients to access.
Our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy are available below. Terms of Service We donât operate a service.
So there is nothing regarding a service.

Instead, WireMin establishes a self-organizing network only by a number of active instances of WireMin apps.
WireMin, as a tool, utilizes advanced security based on time-tested cryptography to provide private messaging, social relationships and user profiles.
All those are achieved by information exchanging within a democratized network without relying on a cloud service or any sort of back-end server.
