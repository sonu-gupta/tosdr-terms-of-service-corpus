Purposes of and Legal Bases for Data Processing

adMarketplace uses personal data relating to identifiable individuals (âpersonal dataâ) as set out below:


If you are an internet user visiting one of our Publishersâ websites: We process personal data in order to deliver the most relevant ads to you.
We provide our publishers with a search box where you can enter search queries and our technology platform shows ads in the following ways:
Conducive Search:
Before your search ("pre-search"): we show tiles for different trusted brands with which we have commercial relationships ("Our Brands") below our search box using data signals to predict those that may be of most interest to you;
During your search: we show relevant, "instant search" links for Our Brands based on what you are typing and these links allow you to directly navigate to the brand site and "skip" the search engine results page (the "SERP");


Search Results ("post-search"): youâll see your search results and we add related sponsored links from Our Brands;
Native Search:
Deep-linking: we show embedded keyword links that may be of interest to you for Our Brands featured within relevant, brand-safe editorial or consumer-generated content
Push Notifications: we show dynamically delivered notification links for Our Brands at a specific time of day on your desktop or mobile device only if you have actively opted-in to receive them


Omnibox Search: we will auto-complete and/or redirect your mistypes and misspells, by bypassing parked pages, to Our Brandsâ domains that you had the intention to type


We ensure ads comply with applicable regulations and our obligations, to provide our customers with reports to analyze their campaigns (such as which ads were delivered and the number of clicks) and to detect and prevent fraud.
Using IP addresses helps us ensure ads are running in permitted territories, to better place ads, and flag fraudulent traffic.
Cookies may be used to track how you interact with the advertisement and the publisherâs website (please see section 10 below).
Our legal basis for this processing is:
For display of advertising: your consent (which you give to the Publisher when you visit their site).
and
For analytics and fraud prevention: that data processing is necessary for our legitimate interests and those of our clients, namely improving our products and services, charging correctly for our services and reducing fraud.


If you are a visitor to our website: our legal basis for processing your personal data is:
When you contact us with inquiries, complaints or request other assistance: your consent.
and
For technical data relating to your device/network: that data processing is necessary for our legitimate interests, namely improving our website and products and services.



If you work for a customer or supplier (or potential customer or supplier):our legal basis for processing your personal data is:
Where we provide products or services to you or purchase products or services from you: That it is necessary for the performance of our contracts with our customers or suppliers;
Where you are an authorized user of our online customer portal: in order to provide access to materials and product features, this being necessary for performing our contract with you or for our legitimate interests in managing our relationship with you;
Where we send newsletters or other commercial offers: that it is necessary for our legitimate interests in managing and developing our business;
Where we keep data for legal, recordkeeping, tax or accounting purposes: that it is necessary to enable us to comply with the legal obligations that apply to our business.



This Privacy Notice does not apply to personal data processing that relates to our employees or other staff, or to applicants for positions with any of our group of companies, as these activities are governed by separate privacy notices.
Please contact our HR department for more information.

What Personal Data do we Collect?


Search information
adMarketplaceâs network shows ads to visitors on our publisherâs websites.
We receive and analyze the search terms (keywords) entered into the search box on those sites.
We may also receive technical information such as your approximate location, browser type, language settings, user agent, timestamp, cookie ID and IP addresses.
We also receive information regarding which ads were viewed or clicked on and that you arrived on or made a purchase from one of our advertiserâs websites.
Our publisher partners might also collect personal data by dropping cookies on your device.
we recommend that you refer to their respective privacy policies.
When a user types a search query, we will match ads between the current user agent and IP address and the search query, and those ads will appear in the scroll down menu below the search box.
If the user clicks on the ad, we will collect the click information (along with ad informationâ¦), then a cookie will be dropped on the userâs device.
If the user proceeds to the site redirected from the ad he clicked on, and if the user then purchases a product or a service or completes an action during that session, then a conversion pixel might be fired from the advertiser site.
This helps adMarketplace and the advertiser measure the effectiveness of its advertising.
When the user uses our products in a mobile environment, we might sometimes collect the device IDs (unique identifiers to the phone the user is using).

We may also obtain information from public sources, such as professional networking platforms, trade shows, or other directories, as part of our business development activities.


5.
Security

adMarketplace applies reasonable security measures to protect data from unauthorized access, corruption or loss.
These include storing information in databases which are protected by security measures such as password protection and encryption at rest using Transport Layer Security technology (TLS), so that even if the data is improperly accessed, it is less likely to be in an intelligible format.
When no longer required, this data is moved to our secure archive server, also encrypted and password protected and only accessed for regulatory, legal or business reasons.

International Data Transfers

Federal Trade Commission.
As we process data outside the European Economic Area (âEEAâ â which in this Privacy Policy includes the UK and Switzerland) it may not be subject to equivalent data protection laws and so we ensure EEA personal data will only be processed if the appropriate transfer mechanisms are in place.

We may also continue to use data in aggregated and anonymized form to analyze and improve our website and products.
For business contacts, data will normally be kept for the duration of any contractual relationship and for six years after it ends (in order to be in a position to address any legal claims that could be made).
We may need to keep data for longer for legal compliance, accounting, tax or recordkeeping purposes, in which case it will be kept and used only for such purposes
If we donât have a contractual relationship then we will regularly review the data and delete it when no longer necessary for the original purpose, but we will retain it for as long as we are in contact (e.g.
if you have subscribed to a newsletter or other publications from us, or we are evaluating a business relationship).

11.
GDPR Rights

If you are in the EEA, including in the EU or the UK, you have various rights in relation to your personal data which may include the rights:
to request access to it
to request rectification of incorrect data
to ask for it to be erased (the "right to be forgotten")
to object to its processing
to ask for a copy to take to another service provider ("data portability").
If our data processing is based on your consent, then you can always withdraw that consent (but any processing that took place before the withdrawal will still be legal).
If you request that data should be erased, the usual method for this is to remove all personally identifying elements so that the data is permanently anonymized and cannot be traced back to you.
In case of any issue, please contact us using the details in this Notice and we will help as far as we can.
If you believe that we have not respected your rights then you also have a right to make a complaint to the Supervisory Authority in your country (e.g.
in the UK, the Information Commissionerâs Office: www.ico.org.uk)
You may ask to exercise any of your rights by submitting a request to dpo@admarketplace.com or privacy@admarketplace.com or using the Contact Request Form.

13.
CCPA

Your rights under the CCPA:
Your rights under the CCPA can broadly be divided into the following categories: (1) right to notice, (2) right to access, (3) right to opt-out (or right to opt-in), (4) right to request deletion, and (5) right to equal services and prices.
Right to notice: Under the CCPA, businesses must inform consumers at or before the point of collection what categories of personal information will be collected and the purposes for which these categories will be used.
Right to access: Consumers have the right to request that a business disclose the categories of personal information collected.
the categories of sources from which personal information is collected.
the business or commercial purpose.
the categories of third parties with which the business shares personal information.
and the specific pieces of personal information the business holds about a consumer.
If a business sells personal information or discloses it for business purposes, consumers have the right to request the categories of information so sold or disclosed.
Right to opt-out: Consumers have the rightâat any timeâto direct businesses that sell personal information about the consumer to third parties to stop this sale, known as the right to opt-out.
If a consumer is a minor, the CCPA provides for a right to opt-in to the sale of data (exercised by the minor if the consumer is between 13 and 16 years of age, or by the minorâs parent or guardian if the consumer is under 13 years old).
Businesses must wait at least 12 months before asking consumers to opt back in.
Right to request deletion: Consumers also have the right to request the deletion of personal information, but only where that information was collected from the consumer.
Like the right to erasure under the GDPR, this right is subject to exceptions.
For instance, businesses need not delete personal information necessary for detecting security incidents, exercising free speech, protecting or defending against legal claims, orâin what is potentially a broad and likely contentious categoryâfor internal uses reasonably aligned with the consumerâs expectations.
Right to equal services and prices: The CCPA prohibits businesses from discriminating against consumers by denying goods or services, charging a different price or rate for goods or services, providing a different level or quality of goods or services, or suggesting that they will do any of these things based upon a consumerâs exercise of any CCPA rights.
Put differently, consumers have a right to equal services and prices.
Exercising your rights under the CCPA:
According the law (see paragraph above), you are entitled to request specific pieces of personal information (as defined under the CCPA) that we have about you, the business purpose for which the personal information was collected, categories of personal information, categories of sources from which the personal information was collected, categories of personal information that we either shared, transferred, sold with a business purpose, categories of those third parties to which the personal information was sold for a business purpose.
If you want to do such a request, you can write to privacy@admarketplace.com and we will respond within 45 days as per the law.
We reserve the right to verify your identity if you make such a request.
However, we may not be able to respond to your request if it goes against applicable law.
(Please note that we do transfer personal information collected through our network of partners to third parties and as such are considered as having disclosed or sold data (as defined under the CCPA) over the past twelve months.)
