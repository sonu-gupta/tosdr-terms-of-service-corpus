What is Hero Health?

Hero Health provides an in-home medicine management service which includes the Dispenser, the App and and other associated services.&nbsp.
The Dispenser and App assist you and your Caregivers (as defined below) with medication management by sorting and dispensing medicines and providing reminders to take and/or fill medicines, whether or not they are loaded in the Dispenser.&nbsp.
The App may also include additional offerings from time to time at the discretion of Hero Health, such as: a daily journal, which will permit you to describe how you are feeling and to note any health conditions,.
or, the ability to record health indicators, such as your weight, blood pressure, laboratory test values , and others.
Your Caregiver will have access to the medications, schedule and adherence data, as well as other health data provided to Hero Health.&nbsp.
You can share this data with your physician as well.
Hero Health does not provide any medical advice or any medical services.&nbsp.
The Services are not a replacement or substitute for the guidance of healthcare professionals.&nbsp.
The Services are not intended to be, and must not be taken to be, the practice of medicine, nursing, pharmacy or other healthcare services or advice by Hero Health.

You understand and agree that the health information and other Content appearing on the Services is for informational purposes only, you should not rely upon any of the Content in making decisions that affect your health or safety.
IF YOU RELY ON ANY CONTENT FOUND ON THE SERVICES, YOU DO SO SOLELY AT YOUR OWN RISK.&nbsp.
The Services are not meant to diagnose or treat any conditions, and the information provided through the Services is not intended to advocate the use of one treatment or drug over another â only your medical professional can determine the right course of treatment for you and determine what is safe, appropriate and effective based on your needs.&nbsp.
We encourage you to independently confirm any Content relevant to you with other sources, including a primary care physician or any other healthcare professional, relevant medical associations and your state medical boards.
You should see your healthcare provider for any medical condition and consult them about any change in your condition.&nbsp.
Consult your physician before taking any drug or changing or stopping any course of treatment.   
DO NOT USE THE SERVICES FOR EMERGENCY MEDICAL NEEDS.&nbsp.
DO NOT USE THE DISPENSER OR THE SERVICES TO DISPENSE MEDICATIONS NECESSARY TO TREAT A LIFE-THREATENING EMERGENCY AS YOUR ACCESS TO MEDICATIONS MAY BE DELAYED BY TECHNICAL AND MECHANICAL LIMITATIONS OF THE SERVICES.
IF YOU EXPERIENCE A MEDICAL EMERGENCY, IMMEDIATELY CALL A HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL AND 911.
You may NOT use the Services in connection with acute, life-threatening events or conditions.&nbsp.
You may only use the Services in accordance with these Terms , and in the manner&nbsp.
described by the instructions provided to you, including any limitations described by the instructions and any other safety labeling, inserts or other publications.
The Dispenser may NOT be used by a recipient of medication who is incapable of verifying the accuracy of each dispensed dose (such as those suffering from dementia or other cognitive or physical impairments) unless pill dispense accuracy is verified, in each instance, by qualified person(s) trusted by the medication recipient, i.e.
a caregiver, a healthcare aide, and/or a healthcare professional.


While the Dispenser is capable of successfully and accurately dispensing most whole pills loaded into the device and the App is designed to provide timely medication reminders and medication management / monitoring, on most occasions, the Services should not be used with&nbsp.
medications that have high dosage sensitivity, that have a narrow therapeutic window, that are used to treat acute conditions or that are used to treat life-threatening events.
Hero Health, Inc.
cannot guarantee the accuracy of medication dispenses from the Dispenser or reminders from the App due to the potential for human error and/or mechanical and software limitations or failures.&nbsp.
You are solely responsible for the uninterrupted supply of electricity and internet connectivity necessary for you to operate and make use of the Services as well as your hardware and the environmental conditions necessary for the Dispenser to function.
The Hero pill dispenser will not function without 120v A/C electricity, it does not contain an internal battery.&nbsp.



When using the Dispenser, you (or a trusted qualified person, as stated above) must verify that the types and number of pills dispensed accurately match the prescribed dosage before ingesting the contents of the pill cup.&nbsp.
Keep track of pills inside the Dispenser (e.g., by size, shape, color, imprint, or form) to help ensure that dispensed doses match prescribed doses.
If you cannot visually differentiate between the different types of pills you intend to store in the Dispenser, do not add those medications to the device.
Store the original prescriptions or pill bottles in a safe, accessible place for reference after loading appropriate medications into the Dispenser, and leave one or more pills in their original container to help you identify each pill, and in case you ever experience a mechanical or software failure with the Dispenser.
Softgels, half pills, gummies, liquid medications and medications that require refrigeration should not be stored in the Dispenser.&nbsp.
The Dispenser has a discrete lifespan that depends on various factors, including but not limited to the type and amount of pills used, the number of dispenses, and the environmental conditions in which the Dispenser is operated.&nbsp.
As the Dispenser nears the end of its useful life, when a Dispenser requires maintenance, or, in certain other circumstances, you may experience unsuccessful dispenses.&nbsp.
Unsuccessful dispenses while rare, may occur.&nbsp.
In the event that the Dispenser is unable to dispense a full or partial dose, the Dispenser will typically, but not always, notify you (and your caregiver, if applicable) of the unsuccessful dispense, and prompt you with a resolution depending on the situation (for example: offer to retrieve your scheduled dose manually, contact Hero Health, or other).
If you experience repeated unsuccessful dispenses, you should contact Hero Health at 855-855-9962 for further instructions.&nbsp.
It is possible, though unlikely, that the Dispenser may fail to notify you of an unsuccessful dispense, that pills may stick together resulting in the dispensing of extra pills, and that pills may be deposited into and dispensed from other pill reservoirs resulting in the dispensing of incorrect dosages, thus, it is imperative that you verify each dispense.&nbsp.
If you are unable or unwilling to utilize or interact with this dispense method, or if you believe that doing so would cause you to take an incorrect dose of medication, you should not use the Dispenser. 
You must store the Dispenser and your medications in a safe place.
If children or other individuals who may be harmed by gaining unsupervised access to the medications are present, the Dispenser should be installed beyond their reach with passcode protection enabled for all medication dispenses.&nbsp.
The Dispenser should also be stored in a room that is no warmer than 77Âº F (25Âº C) and with humidity no higher than 20%.&nbsp.
You should not use the Dispenser in a location that has an altitude of more than 8,000 feet.
You are solely liable for any unauthorized access to the Dispenser and your medications.&nbsp.
Hero Health will not be liable for any injury resulting or arising from, or related to, the use of the Services (even if unauthorized) whatsoever.

Your use of the Services does not create a doctor-patient or provider-patient relationship.

YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE SERVICES OF A QUALIFIED HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL.
NO DOCTOR-PATIENT OR PROVIDER-PATIENT RELATIONSHIP IS CREATED WHEN YOU USE THE SERVICES OR CONTENT.
THIS IS TRUE WHETHER SUCH CONTENT IS PROVIDED BY OR THROUGH THE USE OF THE SERVICES OR THROUGH ANY OTHER COMMUNICATIONS TO OR FROM HERO HEALTH.
You acknowledge that although Hero Fill, which is made available through the Services, is provided, in part, by healthcare professionals, the provision of the Services does not create a doctor-patient or provider-patient relationship between you and Hero Health.&nbsp.

This is a license only â your ownership in User Submissions is not affected.
If you store a User Submission in your own personal Hero Health account, in a manner that is not viewable by any other user except you and your Caregiver(s) with administrative permissions (a âPersonal User Submissionâ), you grant Hero Health the license above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Personal User Submission for the sole purpose of making that Personal User Submission accessible to you and your Caregiver(s) with administrative permissions, if any, and providing the Services necessary to do so.
If you share a User Submission only in a manner that only certain specified users can view (for example, any Caregivers linked to your account) (a âLimited Audience User Submissionâ), then you grant Hero Health the licenses above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Limited Audience User Submission for the sole purpose of making that Limited Audience User Submission accessible to such other specified users, and providing the Services necessary to do so.

You hereby assign all right, title, and interest in, and Hero Health is free to use, without any attribution or compensation to you, any ideas, know-how, concepts, techniques, or other intellectual property and proprietary rights contained in the Feedback, whether or not patentable, for any purpose whatsoever, including but not limited to, developing, manufacturing, having manufactured, licensing, marketing, and/or selling, directly or indirectly, Services using such Feedback. 
You understand and agree that Hero Health is not obligated to use, display, reproduce, or distribute any such ideas, know-how, concepts, or techniques contained in the Feedback, and you have no right to compel such use, display, reproduction, or distribution.

What if I see something on the Services that infringes my copyright?

You may have heard of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the âDMCAâ), as it relates to online service providers, like Hero Health, being asked to remove material that allegedly violates someoneâs copyright.
We respect othersâ intellectual property rights, and we reserve the right to delete or disable Content alleged to be infringing, and to terminate the accounts of repeat alleged infringers.
The DMCA provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S.
copyright law.
If you believe in good faith that materials posted on the Services infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send Hero Health a âNotification of Claimed Infringementâ requesting that the material be removed or access to it blocked.
The notice must include the following information:

A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the works that have been allegedly infringed;
Identification of the copyrighted work alleged to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the Services are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works);
Identification of the specific material alleged to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Hero Health to locate the material on the Services;
Your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address (if available);
A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
and
A statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Upon receipt of a proper notice of copyright infringement, we reserve the right to remove or disable access to the infringing material.
notify the content provider who is accused of infringement that we have removed or disabled access to the applicable material.
and terminate such content provider's access to the Services if he or she is a repeat offender.
If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send Hero Health a counter-notice.
Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA.
see http://www.loc.gov/copyright/ for details.
Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Services should be sent to [General Counsel, Hero Health, ATTN: DMCA Notice, 132 E.
43rd St, Ste 552, New York, NY 10017] or support@herohealth.com.
Consult your legal advisor and see 17 U.S.C.
Â§ 512 before filing a notice or counter-notice as there are penalties for false claims under the DMCA.

If you choose to use Hero Fill, you hereby authorize Hero Health as your agent with respect to (a) finding lower prices for your medications and engaging a pharmacy partner to provide you with pharmacy services directly, (b) finding arrangements that may reduce the cost to you of your medications, and (c) contacting our third-party pharmacy partner on your behalf to transfer a prescription, initiate a prescription refill or auto-fill, or request a prescription renewal.&nbsp.
You also permit us to share certain personal information with our third-party pharmacy partner in order to provide you with Hero Fill (including but not limited to your name, address, and medications used).&nbsp.
Please see our Privacy Policy for additional information about our use of any personal information you provide in connection with Hero Fill.&nbsp.
By creating an account, you hereby direct pharmacies to transmit, share or disclose protected health information about you, including your name, birthdate, demographic information, medical and treatment information, prescription and over-the-counter medication information and history, current prescriptions, and information to Hero Health.&nbsp.
You make this direction pursuant to your rights of access under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (âHIPAAâ), 45 C.F.R.
Â§ 164.524(c)(3)(ii).

Billing.
We use Stripe, a third-party payment processor (the âPayment Processorâ) to bill you through a payment account linked to your account on the Services (your âBilling Accountâ) for use of the Paid Services.
The processing of payments will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition to these Terms.
We are not responsible for errors by the Payment Processor.
By choosing to use the Paid Services, you agree to pay us, through the Payment Processor, all charges at the prices then in effect for any use of such Paid Services in accordance with the applicable payment terms and you authorize us, through the Payment Processor, to charge your chosen payment provider (your âPayment Methodâ).
You agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method.
We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes that the Payment Processor makes even if it has already requested or received payment.&nbsp.
We also reserve the right to change our billing methods at any time.
any changes to billing methods will be posted on or through our website or the App.&nbsp.
Your continued use of the Paid Services after changes have taken effect means that you accept such changes. 

Payment Method.
The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method.
If we, through the Payment Processor, do not receive payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts due on your Billing Account upon demand.
All payments must be made in U.S.
dollars. 

Recurring Billing.
Some of the Paid Services may consist of an initial period, for which there is a one-time charge, followed by recurring period charges as agreed to by you.
By choosing a recurring payment plan, you acknowledge that such Services have an initial and recurring payment feature and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation. 
WE MAY SUBMIT PERIODIC CHARGES (E.G., MONTHLY) WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU, UNTIL YOU PROVIDE PRIOR NOTICE (RECEIPT OF WHICH IS CONFIRMED BY US) THAT YOU HAVE TERMINATED THIS AUTHORIZATION OR WISH TO CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD.&nbsp.
SUCH NOTICE WILL NOT AFFECT CHARGES SUBMITTED BEFORE WE REASONABLY COULD ACT.&nbsp.
TO TERMINATE YOUR AUTHORIZATION OR CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD, GO TO YOUR ACCOUNT SETTINGS
OR CONTACT US AT support@herohealth.com.


Current Information Required.
You must provide current, complete and accurate information for your Billing Account.
You must promptly update all information to keep your Billing Account current, complete and accurate (such as a change in billing address, credit card number or credit card expiration date), and you must promptly notify us or our Payment Processor if your Payment Method is canceled (e.g., for loss or theft) or if you become aware of a potential breach of security, such as the unauthorized disclosure or use of your user name or password.&nbsp.
Changes to such information can be made in your account settings.
however, this may temporarily disrupt your access to the Paid Services while Hero Health verifies your new payment information and may result in a change to your payment billing date.&nbsp.
Hero Health is not liable for any loss caused by any unauthorized use of your credit card, debit card or any other method of payment by a third party in connection with your use of the Paid Services.&nbsp.
IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE ANY OF THE FOREGOING INFORMATION, YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY CONTINUE CHARGING YOU FOR ANY USE OF PAID SERVICES UNDER YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT UNLESS YOU HAVE TERMINATED YOUR PAID SERVICES AS SET FORTH ABOVE.

Change in Amount Authorized.
If the amount to be charged to your Billing Account varies from the amount you preauthorized (other than due to the imposition or change in the amount of state sales taxes), you have the right to receive, and we shall provide, notice of the amount to be charged and the date of the charge before the scheduled date of the transaction.
Any agreement you have with your payment provider will govern your use of your Payment Method.
You agree that we may accumulate charges incurred and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing cycle.

Auto-Renewal for Paid Services.&nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
Any Paid Services (for example, use of the App and Hero Fill) you have signed up for will be automatically extended for successive renewal periods of the same duration as the membership term originally selected, at the then-current non-promotional rate.
To change or resign your Paid Services at any time, go to account settings.&nbsp.
If you terminate a Paid Service within the first year after any 30-day trial period, you will be charged for the remainder of the 12-month period upon termination.
If you terminate after the initial 12-month period, you will be charged on a month-to-month basis for the Paid Services, and you may cancel at any time with no penalty.
Please see our Limited Warranty, Returns and Cancellations Policy for more information.&nbsp.
If you do not want to continue to be charged on a recurring monthly basis, you must cancel the applicable Paid Service through your account settings or terminate your HERO HEALTH account before the end of the recurring TERM.
Paid Services cannot be terminated before the end of the period for which you have already paid, and except as expressly provided in these terms, HERO HEALTH will not refund any fees that you have already paid.

Reaffirmation of Authorization.
Your non-termination or continued use of a Paid Service reaffirms that we are authorized to charge your Payment Method for that Paid Service.
We may submit those charges for payment and you will be responsible for such charges.
This does not waive our right to seek payment directly from you.
Your charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when you initially selected to use the Paid Service.

Cancellations.&nbsp.
You can cancel your membership to the Services for any reason if you are dissatisfied with the Services.&nbsp.
Please see our Limited Warranty, Returns and Cancellations Policy for more information.
Any Dispensers returned to us due to your membership cancellation or otherwise must not have visible damage or other physical flaws that are the result of improper use or handling (including scratches and missing components).

Title.&nbsp.
Hero retains ownership of and title to the Dispenser, unless you purchased a membership before October 1st, 2019, in which case ownership of and title to the Dispenser passed to you upon delivery of the Dispenser to the carrier.&nbsp.
If you purchased a membership before October 1st, 2019, you are responsible for filing any claims with carriers for damaged or lost shipments.&nbsp.
IF YOU DID NOT PURCHASE A DISPENSER DIRECTLY FROM HERO HEALTH YOU MAY NOT USE IT IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES.

Shipping.&nbsp.
When you place an order for a product (including a Dispenser) through our Store, the product will be shipped to the address you designate as the âShipping Addressâ during the check-out process.&nbsp.
Please see our Limited Warranty, Returns and Cancellations Policy for more information.  

Free Trials.&nbsp.
Your membership in the Services may begin with a free trial.
If we offer a free trial, the specific terms of your free trial offer will be stated in the material describing the particular free trial.
Free trials are for new Hero Health customers only.
We may be unable to accommodate combining free trials with any other offers.
Hero Health reserves the right to determine eligibility for any free trial.&nbsp.
Free trials may require the payment of up-front fees and costs such as activation and shipping charges, some of which may be non-refundable.&nbsp.
Once your free trial period ends, we may begin billing your Payment Method for fees corresponding to your membership choices (plus any applicable taxes), unless you cancel prior to the end of your free trial.
For that reason, unless otherwise indicated in the free trial description, you may be asked to set up a valid Payment Method when redeeming a free trial offer.
If you wish to avoid charges to your Payment Method, you must cancel your membership prior to the last day of your free trial period.
You may cancel your membership at any time as described in the Limited Warranty, Returns and Cancellations Policy.

From time to time, Hero Health may offer qualified consumers âgift codesâ or âoffer codesâ through a variety of promotional activities and communications (collectively referred to herein as âoffer codesâ) that are redeemable towards a purchase on the website or App, while supplies last, and subject to certain merchandise exclusions or any other restrictions as may be determined and communicated by Hero Health in its sole discretion.

Full terms and conditions of the Hero Referral Program will be available upon launch of the program.
Gift and Offer codes may not be used in conjunction with Hero Referral Programs.

What if I want to stop using the Services? 

Youâre free to stop using the services&nbsp.
at any time, you may terminate Paid Services and/or terminate your account by contacting us at support@herohealth.com or by following the steps
for cancellation in the App.
please refer to our Privacy Policy, as well as the licenses above, to understand how we treat the information you provide to us after you have stopped using our Services. 
Hero Health is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the Services or your account, or to âbrickâ any Dispenser (thereby making it inoperable), for any reason in our discretion, including your breach of these Terms.&nbsp.
Hero Health has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms.&nbsp.
Hero Health also reserves the right to refuse any order you place with us.&nbsp.
We may, in our sole discretion, limit or cancel quantities of Dispensers or other products on a per person, per household, or per order basis.
These restrictions may include orders placed by or under the same customer account, the same credit card, and/or orders that use the same billing and/or shipping address.
In the event that we make a change to or cancel an order, we may attempt to notify you by contacting the email and/or billing address/phone number provided at the time the order was made.
We also reserve the right to limit or prohibit orders that, in our sole judgment, appear to be placed by dealers, resellers or distributors or in connection with any commercial service. 
We may also periodically replace our Dispensers as we improve the technology and add new features.
If we upgrade all of our Dispensers, you will have the option to upgrade to a new Dispenser at a time to be determined by us, and which may come at an additional charge.
If you choose to continue using an older Dispenser model, we may, at our sole discretion, no longer provide support services for such older Dispenser model, and we will have no liability if you continue to use an older Dispenser model after we have upgraded our Dispensers.
If we have upgraded to a new Dispenser model, we also reserve the right to âbrickâ any older Dispenser models that we no longer support, without liability to you.
If Hero Health is unable to successfully charge your credit card or payment account for any fees due, Hero Health reserves the right to revoke or restrict access to your Content, delete your stored Content, or terminate your account. 
Account termination may result in destruction of any Content associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you decide to terminate your account.
We will try to provide advance notice to you prior to our terminating your account so that you are able to retrieve any important User Submissions you may have stored in your account (to the extent allowed by law and these Terms), but we may not do so if we determine it would be impractical, illegal, not in the interest of someoneâs safety or security, or otherwise harmful to the rights or property of Hero Health.
If you have deleted your account or the App by mistake, contact us immediately at support@herohealth.com â we will try to help, but unfortunately, we canât promise that we can recover or restore anything.
Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms shall survive termination.
By way of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us, including without limitation the arbitration agreement.

What about mobile applications?

You acknowledge and agree that the availability of our App is dependent on the third party stores from which you download the application, e.g., the App Store from Apple or the Android app market from Google (each an âApp Storeâ).
Each App Store may have its own terms and conditions to which you must agree before downloading mobile applications from such store, including the specific terms relating to the Apple App Store set forth below.
You agree to comply with, and your license to use our application is conditioned upon your compliance with, such App Store terms and conditions.
To the extent such other terms and conditions from such App Store are less restrictive than, or otherwise conflict with, the terms and conditions of these Terms, the more restrictive or conflicting terms and conditions in these Terms apply. 

I use the App available via the Apple App Store â should I know anything about that?

These Terms apply to your use of all the Services, including the App available via the Apple, Inc.
(âAppleâ) App Store, but the following additional terms also apply to the App:

You represent and warrant that you are not located in a country subject to a U.S.
Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S.
Government as a âterrorist supportingâ country, and that you are not listed on any U.S.
Government list of prohibited or restricted parties;
Both you and Hero Health acknowledge and agree that, in your use of the Application, you will comply with any applicable third party terms of agreement which may affect or be affected by such use.

In the event of such a claim, suit, or action (âClaimâ), we will attempt to provide notice of the Claim to the contact information we have for your account (provided that failure to deliver such notice shall not eliminate or reduce your indemnification obligations hereunder).

Assignment.
You may not assign, delegate or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder, or your Services account, in any way (by operation of law or otherwise) without Hero Healthâs prior written consent.
We may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations without consent.

Choice of Law.
These Terms are governed by and will be construed under the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the State of New York, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof. 

Arbitration Agreement. Please read the following ARBITRATION AGREEMENT carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with HERO HEALTH and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.
Both you and Hero Health acknowledge and agree that for the purposes of any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms, Hero Healthâs officers, directors, employees and independent contractors (âPersonnelâ) are third party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Personnel will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third party beneficiary hereof.
(a) Arbitration Rules.
Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.
Any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in New York County, New York.
The arbitration will proceed in the English language, in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (âRulesâ) of JAMS/Endispute LLC (âJAMSâ) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules.&nbsp.
Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.&nbsp.
Notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction. 
(b) Costs of Arbitration.&nbsp.
The JAMS rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees.&nbsp.
Hero Health will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than $75,000.&nbsp.
Hero Health will not seek its attorneysâ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous. 
(c) Small Claims Court.&nbsp.
Furthermore, either you or Hero Health may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in New York County, New York or any United States county where you live or work. 
(d) Waiver of Jury Trial.&nbsp.
YOU AND HERO HEALTH WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY.&nbsp.
You and Hero Health are instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration.
Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court.&nbsp.
In any litigation between you and Hero Health over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND HERO HEALTH WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.
(e) Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.&nbsp.
ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS.&nbsp.
CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.&nbsp.
If however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration.
instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in (g) below. 

(f) Opt-out.&nbsp.
You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Section by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: support@herohealth.com.
postmarked within 30 days of first accepting these Terms.&nbsp.
You must include (1) your name and residence address.
(2) the email address and/or telephone number associated with your account.
and (3) a clear statement that you want to opt out of these Termsâ arbitration agreement.
(g) Exclusive Venue.&nbsp.
If you send the opt-out notice in (f), and/or in any circumstances where the foregoing arbitration agreement permits either you or Hero Health to litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms in court, then the foregoing arbitration agreement will not apply to either party and both you and Hero Health agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, New York County, New York, or the Southern District of New York. 

Miscellaneous.&nbsp.
You will be responsible for paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services, provided that Hero Health may, in its sole discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or for itself as it sees fit.&nbsp.
The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.&nbsp.
If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.&nbsp.
You and Hero Health agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and Hero Health, and that these Terms supersede and cancel all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms.&nbsp.
You hereby acknowledge and agree that you are not an employee, agent, partner, or joint venture of Hero Health, and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Hero Health in any respect whatsoever. 
Except as expressly set forth in the sections above regarding the Apple App Store and the arbitration agreement, you and Hero Health agree there are no third party beneficiaries intended under these Terms.
