3.
Sharing Your Information
We do not rent or sell your personal contact information (such as your email address associated with your account registration) to third parties to use for their direct marketing purposes.
We share personal information in the following ways:
Platform Visitors and Users
One of the main purposes of having a Houzz account is to share home renovation and design ideas with others.
Through Houzz, others have the ability to find, contact, view, and follow your profile and public activity on Houzz (for example, if you "like" content on our Platform or if you create an ideabook and do not mark it private) and link it to your username.
You can customize your Houzz profile and whether users may follow you through your Houzz settings.
Other than your proprietary content that you generate in or upload to our Houzz Pro or Ivy business management tools, your Houzz content (for example, ideabooks, photos, notes on others' photos, projects, discussions, and social media profiles), followers, and others you follow are publicly viewable on the Platform and open to comments by other Houzz users.
Learn how to make these private.
You also may choose to make certain information public on our Platform like your city and neighborhood.
If you are a professional or seller on Houzz, we may also display the following information in order to help visitors and users evaluate you: your last visit to Houzz, aggregated information on our Platform about your Platform activity (e.g.
response rate), and information that is publicly available from third parties.
We have policies that place restrictions on Platform visitors' and users' use of information and content you choose to make available publicly through the Platform.
Professionals, Sellers, and Other Businesses on our Platform
If you request us to find professionals for you, your project information (including the contact information) that you provide will be made available to a limited number of professionals that we believe may be suitable for your project.
Professionals and sellers that participate on the Houzz Platform may view your public activities on our Platform and receive feedback you provide to us about your engagement with them.
For example, if you requested us to find professionals for you and provide us feedback about your level of interest in these professionals, we may convey such feedback to them.
In addition, a professional or seller can view your public activities on our Platform that are interactions with their content (for example, that you added one of their photos to your non-private Ideabook on a particular date, as identified by the username for your profile and any photo or public identifiers you provide for your profile).
The business cannot see your non-public account information (for example, email address) or see private activity (for example, if your ideabook is private).
We ask professionals, sellers, and advertising businesses on our Platform to limit the use of your information to the reasons for which the information was provided.

Service Providers and Partners
We may share your information with service providers and partners as reasonably needed for our uses described in this Privacy Policy.
We ask our service providers to limit their use of that information for use on behalf of Houzz and for improving their services and products (in a de-identified form if legally required).
You can find more information here about our service providers and partners with which we may share your information.
Only if you specifically agree to share your contact information with a third-party partner, for example, as part of a contest or promotion we sponsor with such third party, will we share your contact information with that third-party partner for their direct marketing purposes.
In addition, we may share information about you with third-party platforms when you allow the third-party platform to receive this information from us or allow Houzz to share this information with the third party.
Our Platform may include third-party social media features and other third-party plug-ins and widgets.
When these features are displayed on our Platform, they are operated or hosted by third parties and are subject to their own privacy policies instead of this Privacy Policy.
For example, you may sign-up for our Platform through Facebook, Google, or Apple.

Advertisers and Ad Networks
We use advertising networks and partners to serve advertisements for us and other businesses, including interest-based advertising, on third-party sites and to assist us in evaluating the effectiveness of our advertising.
We may also work with advertising networks and partners to serve ads on our Platform and to communicate with you at the addresses they have for you.
We may provide advertising networks, advertising partners, and businesses advertising on our platform with aggregate information but other than hashed information or device identifiers, we do not disclose your name, contact information, or other personal information.
For example, we may provide a hashed version of your email address or other information to advertising networks (e.g., Facebook and Google) to serve advertisements to you or others.
To opt-out of the use of your information for this purpose, please send a request as provided under the Contact Us section.
We and the businesses advertising on our Platform, advertising networks, and advertising partners may also use cookies or similar technologies to track your activities on our Platform and other online properties in order to provide you with tailored ads across websites, apps, and devices and to understand how those ads perform.
To learn how to opt-out of receiving this type of advertising, please see our Cookie Policy.

In these cases, their use will be subject to this Privacy Policy.
Legal Obligations
We may disclose information from or about you, as required or permitted by applicable law, if we believe that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with legal process and law enforcement instructions and orders, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, judicial proceeding, or other legal process served on us, a service provider, or a partner (which may include disclosure to law enforcement, courts, or governmental authorities).
(b) prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with our Platform.
(c) protect our rights, reputation, property, or that of our visitors, users, corporate affiliates, or the public.
