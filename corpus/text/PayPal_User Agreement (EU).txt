For more information about us and our service, you can read our Key Payment and Service Information.
This user agreement, together with other legal terms and legally required disclosures relating to your use of our service will be made available to you at all times on the PayPal website (typically located on the âLegal Agreementsâ page).
We may also send this information to you.
You may request a copy of any legally required disclosures (including this user agreement and the Key Payment and Service Information) from us and we will provide this to you in a form which allows you to store and reproduce the information (for example, by e-mail).
 Opening an account We offer two types of accounts: personal accounts and business accounts.Personal accountsWith a personal account you can send and request money from friends and family and pay online for purchases.
Holders of certain existing personal accounts may be required to upgrade their accounts (which may include providing further information to PayPal) in order to be able to use all of the current functionality available in a personal account.

To use your PayPal account primarily to sell things, you must open a business account or convert your personal account to a business account.Business accounts Business accounts are for people and organisations (whether incorporated or not) that primarily use PayPal to receive online payments for sales or donations.
Business accounts may be subject to fees that differ from the fees applicable to personal accounts.
See our Fees for further details.

By opening a business account or converting a personal account to a business account, you certify to us that you are using it primarily for a business or commercial purpose.

 Commercial Entity Status If the activity through your business account reaches certain thresholds or involves certain business segments or activities, you are required by the card networks to agree to Commercial Entity Agreements directly with our processing partners to allow you to continue accepting card-funded payments.
In this case, these Commercial Entity Agreements will apply to any payment processed by PayPal on your behalf in addition to this user agreement.
 Safe use of your PayPal account You should take reasonable steps to stop your PayPal account being misused.
You must maintain adequate security and control of any and all devices, items, IDs, passwords and personal identification numbers / codes that you use to access your PayPal account and the PayPal services.
Please see our Key Payment and Service Information for guidelines.

You must comply with all reasonable instructions we may issue regarding how you can keep your Payment Instrument safe.
We may require you to authenticate any instruction relating to your account (i.e.
give us the information that we need to be sure that itâs you giving us the instruction, such as submitting your correct log-in information â this could include your e-mail address and password) and otherwise successfully log into your PayPal account to provide to us your instruction.
You must keep your postal address, email address and other contact information current in your PayPal account profile.
You may expressly grant, remove and manage permissions for some third parties to take certain actions on your behalf.
In some cases you can do this when logged into your account â in other cases you can do this directly with the third party.
You acknowledge that if you grant permission for a third party to take actions on your behalf, we may disclose certain information about your Account to this third party.
You may permit third party service providers licensed by applicable law to: 

provide account information services to access information about your account on your behalf;
confirm whether an amount necessary for the execution of a card-based payment transaction is available on your account.
or
provide payment initiation services to initiate payments from your account on your behalf.

Granting permission to any third party to access your account in any way does not relieve you of any of your responsibilities under this user agreement.
You are liable to us for the actions that you authorise the third parties to carry out.
You will not hold us responsible for, and you will indemnify us from, any liability arising from the actions or inactions of such third parties in connection with the permissions you granted, subject to your mandatory legal rights. Closing Your PayPal Account 
You can close your account at any time. See the PayPal Help Centre for how to do this.
We may close your account at our convenience by providing you with two monthsâ prior notice.
We may also close your account at any time if:

you are in breach of this user agreement and/or we are otherwise entitled to close your account under this user agreement;
you do not access your account for three years.
or
we suspect that your account has been accessed without your authorisation.

Where we decide to close your account we will provide you with notice of account closure and where practicable, the reasons for closing your account, together with the ability to withdraw any undisputed funds that we are holding.
When your account is closed:

this user agreement terminates immediately, except that this user agreement survives termination to the extent and for so long as we require to deal with the closure of your account and to comply with applicable laws and regulations;
we may cancel any pending transactions and you will forfeit any balances associated with special funding arrangements;
we may suspend, limit or terminate your access to or use of our services, websites, software, systems (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the services) operated by us or on our behalf or some or all of the services;
you will remain liable for all outstanding obligations under this user agreement related to your account prior to closure;
we may keep your account information in our database for the purpose of fulfilling our legal obligations.
and
we may retain your electronic money after closure to the extent and for the time we reasonably require to protect us and/or any third party against the risk of reversals, fees, fines, penalties and other liabilities of whatever nature.
After this time you will be able to withdraw any undisputed funds that we are holding.
Please Contact Us if you have any questions about funds held in your account on closure.
If you are the legal representative of an incapacitated or deceased account holder, please Contact Us for assistance.


In the event that we decide to discontinue any of our services or any portion or feature of our services for any reason, we will give you at least two months prior notice before discontinuing the service or feature, unless we determine in good faith that: 

the service or feature must be discontinued sooner as required by law or a third-party relationship.
or 
doing so could create a security risk or substantial economic or material technical burden.
 Linking and Unlinking a Funding Source All money in your account is legally termed âelectronic moneyâ, which is recognised throughout the European Economic Area as a form of money suitable for use online.

You can use a funding source as a way to pay us to obtain electronic money in your account or to receive withdrawals from your account, as further outlined in this user agreement (see in particular Adding or Withdrawing Money and Funding your Payment.

You can link or unlink a credit card, debit card, a prepaid card (where available) a bank account or PayPal Credit (where available) to your PayPal account as a funding source.

We may limit the availability of your funding sources to manage our risk.
Please keep your funding source information current (e.g.
credit card number and expiration date).
If this information changes, we may update it using information and third-party sources available to us without any action on your part.
If you do not want us to update your card information, you may contact your issuer to request this or remove your funding source from your PayPal account.
If we update your funding source, we will keep any preference setting attached to that funding source.
You may choose to confirm your card or bank account, so that we can verify that the card or bank account is valid and that you are its owner.
We may allow you to do this by following the Link and Confirm Card process (for cards) or the Bank Confirmation process (for bank accounts) or other processes which we may notify to you or which we may publish from time to time.Your continuous permission for us to charge your funding sources By linking a funding source to your PayPal account, you give us continuous permission to automatically charge that funding source (subject to this user agreement and the terms of any mandate (e.g.
bank direct debit) used by the provider of that funding source to set up and maintain that authority) for the required value of the electronic money:

to cover the payment amount (plus all transaction fees payable to us) when you use your account to send a payment to another user.
and
to top up your account when you use the Add Funds functionality account interface.

We may charge the funding source again if the previous attempt failed.
If you cancel any continuous permission from your funding source, you will reimburse us for the value of any electronic money weâve already issued for which a charge from that funding source remains outstanding.

You can stop the permission by unlinking the funding source from your PayPal account.
SEPA is an initiative of the European Commission and European banking sector, aimed at making transactions more efficient within the European Union.
Whenever you register a bank account with PayPal or use a new bank account for the first time as a Funding Source, you grant PayPal a SEPA Direct Debit mandate.
If you use a SEPA Direct Debit mandate for the continuous authority:

you can access the mandate and the mandate reference number (MRN) in your PayPal account profile at any time and cancel or change the mandate for future transactions.
PayPal will inform you of the amount of the SEPA Direct Debit payment and the time frame in which PayPal will collect the amount from the bank account together with the purchase confirmation.
If PayPal resubmits any SEPA Direct Debit payment request due to reversal of the original payment, there will be no (additional) information given on the amount and the time frame ahead of the resubmission.
you can claim a refund from your bank at any time up to 8 weeks after the date on which the SEPA Direct Debit payment took place in accordance with your bankâs terms and conditions.
 Risk of reversals to your funding source and when eCheques may arise When we receive a payment from your funding source we may store the resulting electronic money in your reserve account for as long as we have reason to believe that there is risk of reversal by the funding source provider.
This is because we do not have all the information necessary to place the funds from your payment at your disposal in your PayPal balance while there is such a risk of reversal.

When you instruct us to make a payment from your account to another user funded by a payment from your bank account and we store the resulting electronic money in this way, we call this type of payment from your bank account an âeChequeâ payment.
See Funding payments you send from your account below for how we use eCheques. Holding and using a PayPal balance You will not receive interest or any other earnings on the money in your account.
This is because the money in your account is electronic money and European law forbids paying interest on electronic money.
Also, electronic money is not a deposit or an investment under Luxembourg law, so the Luxembourg deposit guarantee or investor indemnity schemes administered by the Conseil des Protection des Deposants et des Investisseurs cannot protect you.
We may store and move the money in your account in and between:

the PayPal balance.
and 
the reserve account, 

at any given time subject further to this user agreement.PayPal balance The operational part of your account contains your PayPal balance, which is the balance of money available for payments or withdrawals.

When you use our payment service to pay another user, you instruct us to transfer the money from your PayPal balance to the recipientâs account.

You need to have enough PayPal balance in cleared funds to cover the amount of any payment you make and the transaction fees you owe us at the time of the payment.
Other requirements also apply â see the section Making a Payment below.
If you have insufficient PayPal balance or have chosen a preferred funding source you are also requesting us to obtain funds on your behalf from your applicable funding source and issue electronic money to your PayPal balance for your payment to be made.
When you withdraw your money you need to have enough PayPal balance to cover the value of any withdrawal at the time of the withdrawal.
See Adding or Withdrawing Money to know how to get a PayPal balance and how to withdraw it.
If your PayPal balance shows a negative amount, this is the net amount you owe to us at the given time.
 Reserve account Money marked in your account overview as âpendingâ, âunclearedâ, âheldâ or otherwise restricted or limited at any given time is held in the part of your account which acts as a reserve account.
You cannot access and use money stored in the reserve account. Adding or Withdrawing Money Adding money To get electronic money into your account you can, subject further to this user agreement:

accept a payment in your account from someone else.
We may charge you fees for this.
or
obtain electronic money from us by paying us an equivalent amount.


You can obtain electronic money from us by:

automatically using your applicable funding source(s) to cover the amount of the payments that you instruct us to send to other users (and the transaction fees payable by you to us)..
or
manually using the âAdd Fundsâ function available from your account interface to pay us or instructing us to charge your funding source for the electronic money.


The execution of any payment to us from your funding source provider is your funding source providerâs legal responsibility.
We have no control over how long the payment to us will take.Withdrawing money If you have a PayPal balance, you may withdraw any amount by transferring it to your nominated funding source linked to your PayPal account, as we may allow from time to time.
This could include your bank account or debit or credit card, depending on the country in which your PayPal account is registered.
When you instruct us to withdraw any amount of your PayPal balance, subject further to this user agreement we will:

convert the electronic money to money that we can transfer to your nominated funding source.
and 
instruct our own bank to transfer that money to your nominated funding source.


We aim to send the withdrawal payment instruction to our bank by the end of the next Business Day (âBusiness Dayâ means a day on which banks in Luxembourg are open to the general public).
if there are no other delays subject to this user agreement.
Once our bank receives our payment instruction, we have no control over how long the payment to you will take to complete.
At this point, our bank, your funding source provider and the payment systems that they rely on take over responsibility for getting the money to your nominated funding source and this can affect the time it takes for you to receive your money.
We may allow you to withdraw the money by transferring the money to:

an eligible bank account (where we make this available) through: 
a standard transfer to your bank account linked to your account (this withdrawal/redemption functionality is sometimes known as âtransfer to bankâ).
or
an Instant Transfer to your bank account linked to your account.

 We may allow the above transfers to be made through the debit card attached to that bank account.


your branded MasterCard or Visa card (where we make this available).

Fees apply to withdrawals.
We will also disclose to you the fees in advance each time you initiate such a withdrawal.
The funding source (for example, bank account or card) into which you request the withdrawal must be denominated in the original opening currency of your account or another currency that PayPal supports for withdrawals in your country of residence.
You may only withdraw PayPal balance in the opening currency of your account, unless we agree otherwise.
In order to withdraw PayPal balance held in another currency you will have to convert the currency to the opening currency of your account, or it will be converted for you at the time of your withdrawal.
Our transaction exchange rate will be used.
This means that if you withdraw:

a PayPal balance held in a currency other than the original opening currency of your account, you will be charged a fee for the conversion into your original opening currency.
and
to a funding source (for example, bank account or card) denominated in a currency other than the original opening currency of your account, you will be charged a fee for the conversion into the currency in which the funding source is denominated.

To protect you, our other users and us from loss and to allow us to comply with our anti-money laundering and other legal obligations, we may delay a withdrawal, in certain situations, including if we need to confirm that you have authorised the withdrawal or if payments to your PayPal account have been subject to a reversal (for example, as a result of a chargeback, bank reversal or dispute by a buyer).
If we place a limitation on your PayPal account, a payment is subject to a hold, or your account or an associated account has a negative balance in any currency while a withdrawal from your PayPal account is pending, you will have to reinitiate the withdrawal once the limitation or hold has been lifted, or negative balance is fully paid off.
We may set limits on your withdrawals, and you can view any withdrawal limit by logging into your PayPal account.
You must follow the steps that we will notify to you or publish from time to time (which we may set out in your account overview) to lift your withdrawal limit. Managing Your Money in Multiple Currencies When you open your account, it is configured for use with the opening currency of your account.

The opening currency of your account is Euro (EUR).

We may configure your account further so that you can use it to store money and send and receive payments in currencies other than the opening currency of your account.
If you hold a PayPal balance, we may allow you to convert it to balance in another currency.

 If your PayPal balance is not enough to cover the amount of a payment you instruct us to make in a particular currency, we may perform a currency conversion from any PayPal balance in another currency to cover the shortfall.
There may be some restrictions on where you can send payments in certain currencies.

 We may allow you to choose the way in which your account treats and/or converts payments received in currencies other than the opening currency of your account.
To receive money in a currency other than the opening currency of your account, it may be necessary to create a balance in that currency or convert the money into another currency that we allow you to hold.

 Payments in certain currencies can only be received by automatic conversion of the money into another currency that we allow you to hold.

 If you receive a payment from anyone who doesnât have a PayPal account and that payment is in a currency which your account is not currently configured to use, we may automatically convert the amount received into a currency that your account is configured to use at the time the payment is made.

 Please see the Withdrawing Money section above to see how withdrawals in different currencies can be made.

 If one of the currency balances in your account shows that you owe us an amount of funds for any reason, we may set off the amount you owe us by using funds you maintain in a different currency balance or by deducting amounts you owe us from money you receive into your account, or money you attempt to withdraw or send from your account, or in a different account, and by deducting funds from any withdrawals you attempt to make.
If, for a period of 21 Days, you have a PayPal balance that reflects an amount owing to us that is not in Euros, we may convert the amount you owe us to Euros.

 We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of money you can convert or the number of conversions you can perform.
You are responsible for all risks associated with maintaining multiple currencies in a PayPal account.
You may not manage or convert currencies for speculative trading purposes, conversion arbitrage, conversion options, or any other activity that we determine is primarily for the purpose of gaining or making money based on currency conversion rates.
We may hold, cancel, or reverse any transaction we determine to violate this policy.
How we convert currency If PayPal converts currency, it will be completed at the transaction exchange rate we set for the relevant currency exchange.

 The transaction exchange rate is adjusted regularly and includes a currency conversion fee applied and retained by us on a base exchange rate to form the rate applicable to your conversion.
The base exchange rate is based on rates within the wholesale currency markets on the conversion day or the prior Business Day.
or, if required by law or regulation, set at the relevant government reference rate(s).

 We may make a transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) available for your review during your transaction.
If you complete the transaction, that transaction exchange rate may apply to the payment for the transaction whenever it is processed.
or that rate may be valid only if the payment for that transaction is processed within a limited time, as stated during the transaction.
After that limited time, we may use the transaction exchange rate in effect at the time the transaction is processed, or not perform the currency conversion.

 If you have authorised a payment under a billing agreement, and we perform currency conversion for that payment, we will use the transaction exchange rate in effect at the time the payment transaction is processed.
The transaction exchange rate for each payment under a billing agreement may vary.

 We may provide you access to a âCurrency Converterâ tool to see what transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) may apply for certain currency conversions.
Any rates shown using the Currency Converter tool only apply at the time you use the tool and are subject to change. Currency conversion choices When your payment is funded by a debit or credit card and PayPal determines currency conversion is necessary, you consent to and authorise us to convert the currency in place of your debit or credit card issuer.

 You may have the right to have your card issuer convert the currency of the card payment into the currency in which you send the payment from your PayPal account, if applicable for that card issuer and network.
This selection may be presented to you in various forms, including a choice of which currency is used for the transaction, whether we or your card issuer performs the conversion, or which conversion rate is used for the transaction, among others.
If your card issuer converts the currency, your card issuer will determine the currency conversion rate and what fees they may charge.

 PayPal will always perform the conversion for transactions where you use existing balance or your linked bank account is the funding source.

 If PayPal determines currency conversion is necessary for a transaction that also requires a backup funding source to be chosen, you may not be able to separately choose whether PayPal or your card issuer performs the currency conversion on the payment from your backup funding source.

 Where a currency conversion is offered at the point of sale by the merchant, not by PayPal, and you choose to authorise the payment transaction on the basis of the merchant's exchange rate and charges, PayPal has no liability to you for that currency conversion.
 Account Statements and Requesting Account Records Unless your Account is restricted you may view and download your PayPal account statement by logging into your PayPal account.
You agree to review your transactions through your PayPal account history instead of receiving periodic statements by email.

Key information relating to your payments will be provided to you via e-mail and your transaction history will also be updated and made available to you at any time by logging into your account.
You can also access a downloadable report from your PayPal account.
This will show all fees incurred and any other amounts charged to your PayPal account in the relevant period.
The report will only be updated and made available if there has been any activity on your PayPal account or any fees have been incurred in the relevant period.
The way in which we provide the transaction information will allow you to store and reproduce the information unchanged, for example by printing a copy.

 We reserve the right to charge a fee for providing you with additional information or for providing the transaction history and other information about fees in a different way but we wonât charge you for records requested in connection with your good-faith assertion of an error in your PayPal account. Fees  We charge fees for our services as set out on the fees page.

 Quoted fees are inclusive of all applicable taxes.
however, other taxes or costs may exist that are not paid through or imposed by us.

 You are liable for telephone charges and any charges made by your internet service provider or similar or associated charges as a result of the use by you of our services.

 We may deduct our fees from your PayPal balance.
We may deduct our transaction-related fees from the amounts we transfer before those funds are credited to your PayPal balance.

 We will provide you with the details of the amounts you receive and our fees charged either by e-mail or in your transaction history (which you can access by logging into your account).

 If your payment requires you to pay a fee to us, we may disclose that fee to you when you provide your payment instruction to us.

 You cannot set off or deduct any amounts from our fees.

 We may make a charge for any additional services we provide outside this user agreement.
We will tell you of those charges when you ask for the service.

If you are a merchant and you wish to apply for (and retain) our volume-based tiered merchant rate, the terms of the merchant rate in the Receiving Payments section below apply. PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT
Making A Payment General provisions for making a payment Your payment instruction We may allow you to provide your payment instruction to us in any way which we may notify to you from time to time.
The way in which you provide your payment instruction can depend on the type of payment you are making â for example:

If you are paying for a purchase or making a donation, many sellers and/or fund collectors allow you to provide your payment instruction to us in a dedicated PayPal checkout or other PayPal payment collection integration on their site.
You can use the âSend Moneyâ feature when you log into your PayPal account to send a payment to someone.


 We may require you to authenticate your instruction (i.e.
give us the information that we need to be sure that itâs you giving us the instruction, such as submitting your correct log-in information â this could include your e-mail address and password) and otherwise successfully log into your PayPal account to provide to us your payment instruction.
 Cancelling your payment instruction  Once you provide you payment instruction to us, you may not cancel it, except if it is a payment instruction under a billing agreement (see below for more details).
 How long will my payment take? Your payment to another user will leave your account [within the Business Day] after we receive your complete payment instruction.
The payment will leave your account within two Business Days if we receive your complete payment instruction:

on a day which is not a Business Day.
or
after the following local cut off times on a Business Day for accounts registered in the following countries: 4pm in Netherlands.

We may allow you to ask us to make your payment on a specific later date, in which case your payment will leave your account on that later date.
Other provisions in this user agreement may cause the above timeframes to be extended.When we may refuse to make your payment We may treat your payment instruction as not complete and we may refuse to make your payment if:

you do not have enough money in your PayPal balance.

we have reason to believe that your linked funding sources do not have sufficient funds to cover the money required to make your payment;
you do not provide us with all mandatory information requested in the relevant payment or checkout flows which we use to obtain your payment instructions (for instance, sufficient details of the recipient as we may request and authentication of your payment instruction);
the payment exceeds the sending limit we tell you about when you try to make the payment.
or
we have reason to believe that a restricted activity has happened in relation to your account or you are otherwise in breach of this user agreement.

 When your payment is not accepted by the recipient  If we allow you to send a payment to someone who does not have a PayPal account, the recipient can claim the money by opening a PayPal account.

 If the recipient already has a PayPal account, they can refuse to accept the money.

 If the recipient refuses to accept the money or doesnât open a PayPal account and claim the money within 30 days after the date it is sent, the money (including any fees you were charged) will be refunded to your PayPal account.
See Refunds to your account for what can happen when your PayPal account receives a refund.
 Sending limits  We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount and value of payments you can make, including money you send for purchases.
You can view any sending limit by logging into your PayPal account.
To lift your sending limit, you must follow the steps that we will notify to you or publish from time to time (which we may set out in your account overview). Setting up automatic charges from your account Seller delayed payments  When you pay certain sellers or pay for certain purchases (for instance, purchases which have to be shipped to you or may be updated and finalised by the seller), you are providing: 

an authorisation to the seller to collect your payment at a later time.
and
an instruction to us to automatically pay that seller when the seller requests payment.

 Your authorisation will typically remain valid for up to 30 days, but may remain valid for longer.
If you have balance, we may hold the payment amount as pending until the seller collects your payment.
If your payment requires a currency conversion by us, the transaction exchange rate will be determined and applied (as described in the Currency Conversion section) at the time the payment is processed.

 Your authorisation allows the seller to update the payment amount before the seller collects the payment (to account for any changes to the purchase that you may agree with the seller, such as additional taxes, shipping or postage charges or discounts).
We are not required to verify any changes at any time (including at the time the payment is transferred).
We may transfer any amount on the basis of your authorisation and upon receiving instructions from the seller of the final payment amount.
 Billing agreement payments  You can use a billing agreement to manage payments to the same recipient(s) on an ongoing automatic basis.
When you enter into a billing agreement:

you authorise the named recipient(s) to collect payments from your account as the recipient determines (this could be for payments of amounts you owe the recipient for a purchase of goods or services under a separate contract that you have with the recipient).
and
you instruct PayPal to pay the named recipient(s) (or other recipient(s) that the named recipient(s) direct(s)) when the named recipient(s) request(s) PayPal to make your payment.

This makes the recipient a âtrusted beneficiaryâ (the legal term for someone you tell us is a trusted recipient) of all your payments made under that billing agreement, so we will not normally ask you to authenticate (e.g.
log in) or approve these payments when they are made.

 Payments made under the billing agreement may be in variable amounts and may be made on various dates.
We are only a payment service provider so we canât (and please donât expect us to) know what you have or havenât agreed with the recipient or to know why the recipient decided to collect your payment.
We are not obliged to verify or confirm the amount the recipient presents to us for the purpose of processing payments made under the billing agreement.

 We use several names for payments that can be managed by a billing agreement â these include âautomatic payments,â "subscription payments" "recurring paymentsâ âreference transactionsâ "preauthorised transfers" or "preapproved payment." 
 You can cancel your billing agreement at any time with immediate effect in your account interface or by contacting us.
Where a payment under that billing agreement is scheduled to be made before the end of the next Business Day after you tell us to cancel it, we may cancel your billing agreement after that payment has been made.
If you cancel a billing agreement, you may still owe the recipient money for goods or services that you have received but have not paid for.

 If we determine currency conversion is necessary for a billing agreement payment, and we perform the conversion, we will use the transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion fee) in effect at the time the payment is processed.
The transaction exchange rate for each payment transaction may vary.
 Refunds to your account How refunds can happen  We may allow the recipient of your payment to:

refuse to accept it.
or
decide to accept it and then use our service to send you a refund of all or any part of the amount of the payment later.


 We will return the amount of any refused payment or refunded payment to your Balance.
We will return the amount of an unclaimed payment to your balance within 30 days after the date you initiated the payment.
If any amount of any payment is returned to you in any of the ways outlined above, we may convert the returned amount for you into either: 

the currency of the balance you used for the original payment (before any conversion into the currency received by the recipient happened);
the opening currency of your account.
or
US dollars (opening a balance in that currency for you, if you donât have one already).

If the original payment you sent involved a currency conversion we will convert the returned amount from the currency received by the recipient as follows:

if the amount is returned within 1 day of the date of the original payment we will use the transaction exchange rate applicable on the date of the original payment, so that you receive the original amount (including the currency conversion fee you paid) in the original currency you converted for the original payment.
and
if the amount is returned after 1 day of the date of the original payment we will use the transaction exchange rate applicable at the time of the conversion of the returned amount.
You agree to bear the currency conversion fee for amounts returned to you as refunds or refused payments.

Unless otherwise outlined above in this section, you agree to bear the currency conversion fee for amounts returned to you as refunds or refused payments when you convert any amount returned to you in the ways outlined above.
The transaction exchange rate may be applied immediately and without notice to you.

 We may also automatically withdraw the returned amount from your Balance and transfer the funds back to the funding source you used for the original payment.
Withdrawals can also involve a currency conversion â see the section on Withdrawing money above.
Risks when receiving refunds  The returned amount could be lower in value than your original payment amount.
This can happen as a result of:

the recipient sending you a refund lower in value than your original payment amount.
As we are only a payment service provider, we cannot know what you are entitled to from the original payment recipient as a refund or why the recipient sent the refund in a particular amount.
or
transaction exchange rate fluctuations.


PayPal is not responsible for any loss resulting from the recipient's decision to refuse or refund your payment, except to the extent that a refund sent by the recipient is a payment executed incorrectly by PayPal 
We are not liable to you for the difference between the value of your original payment and the value of the resulting refund, except to the extent that the refund is an incorrect payment (see the section on Resolving Problems).
 Funding Your Payment Selecting a preferred funding source You may select a preferred funding source when logged into your account.
Subject to this user agreement, the preferred funding source will be used as the default funding source for payments you send from your account.
 You can set separate preferred funding sources for some billing agreement payments.
 Special Funding Arrangements  Some payments can be funded by special funding arrangements linked to your PayPal account, such as merchant/transaction specific balance, gift vouchers or other promotional funding arrangements.
The use and priority of these special funding arrangements are subject to further terms and conditions between you and us.
Your account overview may show the notional amount available in your special funding arrangements to fund qualifying payments at any given time.
This amount does not constitute electronic money, is not deemed part of your PayPal balance and is not redeemable in cash - it only represents the amount of electronic money which we offer to issue and credit to your account at the time of (and only to immediately fund) a qualifying payment, subject to (and only for the period outlined in) the further terms and conditions of use of that special funding arrangement.
If your payment funded by a special funding arrangement is reversed at a later time for any reason, we will keep the amount that represents the portion of that payment that was funded by your special funding arrangement and (provided that the special funding arrangement has not already expired) reinstate the special funding arrangement. Funding payments you send from your account  We will obtain electronic money for the payment you send from your account from the following sources in the following order to the extent they are available:

Special Funding Arrangements (if available for the given transaction)
Preferred funding source (if selected and available)
Pre-existing PayPal balance
Bank account (instant transfer via bank mandate)
PayPal Credit (where available)
PayPal-branded debit card (where available)
PayPal-branded credit card (where available)
Debit card
Credit card
Bank account (eCheque) 

If you have linked a bank account as a funding source we may choose to offer you access to Pay After Delivery, which allows you to defer a charge to this bank account for a period of time.
If you are offered and choose to use this service, the Pay After Delivery Terms will apply. PayPal Buyer Protection When you buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal, you may be eligible for a refund under PayPal Buyer Protection.
When applicable, PayPal Buyer Protection program entitles you to reimbursement for the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping costs you paid, if any.
PayPal determines, in its sole discretion, whether your claim qualifies for PayPal Buyer Protection.
PayPalâs original determination is considered final, but you may be able to file an appeal of the decision with PayPal if you have new or compelling information not available at the time of the original determination or you believe there was an error in the decision-making process.
IMPORTANT: You may be required to return the item to the seller or other party we specify as part of the settlement of your claim.
PayPal Buyer Protection does not entitle you to reimbursement for the return shipping costs that you may incur.
PayPal Buyer Protection program may apply when you encounter these specific problems with a transaction:

You didnât receive your item from a seller (referred to as an âItem Not Receivedâ claim), or
You received an item, but the item isnât what you ordered (referred to as a âSignificantly Not as Describedâ claim).

If you believe that a transaction made through your PayPal account was not authorized by you, this type of claim is different from the PayPal Buyer Protection, and is described below under Liability for Unauthorized Transactions and Other Errors. QR Code Transactions If you buy something from a seller in-person by using a PayPal goods and services QR, your transaction may be eligible for PayPal Buyer Protection.Item Not Received claims Your claim 
will not
 qualify for a refund under PayPal Buyer Protection for an Item Not Received claim, if:

You collect the item in person, or arrange for it to be collected on your behalf, including if you use PayPal in a sellerâs retail point of sale, except for in-person PayPal QR code goods and services transactions or
The seller has provided proof of delivery.

If the seller presents evidence that they delivered the goods to you, PayPal may find in favor of the seller for an Item Not Received claim even if you claim you did not receive the goods. Significantly Not as Described claims An item may be considered Significantly Not as Described if:

The item is materially different from the sellerâs description of it.
You received a completely different item.
The condition of the item was misrepresented.
For example, the item was described as ânewâ but the item was used.
The item was advertised as authentic but is not authentic (i.e.
counterfeit).
The item is missing major parts or features and those facts were not disclosed in the description of the item when you bought it.
You purchased a certain number of items but didnât receive them all.
The item was damaged during shipment.
The item is unusable in its received state and was not disclosed as such.

An item may not be considered Significantly Not as Described if:

The defect in the item was correctly described by the seller in its description of the item.
The item was properly described but you didn't want it after you received it.
The item was properly described but did not meet your expectations.
The item has minor scratches and was described as âused."

  Ineligible items and transactions under PayPal Buyer Protection Payments for the following are not eligible for reimbursement under PayPal Buyer Protection:

Real estate, including residential property.
Financial products or investments of any kind.
Businesses (when you buy or invest in a business).
Vehicles, including, but not limited to, motor vehicles, motorcycles, recreational vehicles, aircraft and boats, except for personally portable light vehicles used for recreational purposes like bicycles and wheeled hoverboards.
Significantly Not as Described claims for wholly or partly custom-made items or items picked up in person.
Donations including payments on crowdfunding platforms, as well as payments made on crowdlending platforms.

 Transaction eligibility for PayPal Buyer Protection To be eligible for PayPal Buyer Protection you must meet all of the following requirements:

Have a PayPal account in good standing.
Pay for the eligible item from your PayPal account.
Attempt to contact the seller to resolve your issue directly before filing a claim under PayPalâs Purchase Protection through the Resolution Center.
Respond to PayPal's request for documentation and other information within the time requested.
Open a dispute in the Resolution Center within 180 days of the date you sent the payment, then follow our online dispute resolution process.
Not have received a recovery related to such purchase from another source.

  Our online dispute resolution process If youâre unable to resolve a transaction related issue directly with a seller, you must follow our online dispute resolution process through the Resolution Center to pursue a claim under our PayPal Buyer Protection.
You may also file a claim (Step 2 below) by calling us and speaking to an agent.
The steps you must follow are described below, and if you do not follow these steps your claim may be denied:
Step 1: Open a dispute within 180 days of the date you made the payment.
This might allow you to start a direct conversation with the seller regarding your issue with the transaction that may help resolve the dispute.
If you are unable to resolve the dispute directly with the seller, proceed to Step 2.
We will place a hold on all funds related to the transaction in the seller's PayPal account until the dispute is resolved or closed.
Step 2: Escalate the dispute to a claim for reimbursement within 20 days after opening the dispute, if you and the seller are unable to come to an agreement, or we will automatically close the dispute.
You can escalate the dispute to a claim for reimbursement through the Resolution Center.
The seller or PayPal may also escalate the dispute to a claim at this point.
If you are making an Item Not Received claim, PayPal may ask you to wait at least 7 days from the transaction date to escalate the dispute.
Step 3: Respond to PayPalâs requests for documentation or other information, after you, the seller or PayPal escalates your dispute to a claim for reimbursement.
PayPal may require you to provide receipts, third party evaluations, police reports or other documents that PayPal specifies.
You must respond to these requests in a timely manner as requested in our correspondence with you.
Step 4: Comply with PayPalâs shipping requests in a timely manner, if youâre filing a Significantly Not as Described claim.
PayPal may require you, at your expense, to ship the item back to the seller, to PayPal or to a third party (which will be specified by PayPal) and to provide Proof of Delivery.
Step 5: PayPal will make a final decision (including automatically closing any dispute or claim), in its sole discretion, based on the coverage and eligibility requirements set forth above, any additional information provided during the online dispute resolution process or any other information PayPal deems relevant and appropriate under the circumstances. Event tickets In certain cases, if you purchase a ticket or pay for the right to attend an event from a payment recipient who is a UK registered PayPal account holder (âEventâ), all monies paid by you may be held by PayPal on trust for you, so that the beneficial interest in such monies remains with you until the performance of the Event in question.Dispute with us or your card issuer If you used a debit or credit card as the payment method for a transaction through your PayPal account and you are dissatisfied with the transaction, you may be entitled to dispute the transaction with your card issuer.
Applicable card chargeback rights may be broader than those available to you under PayPalâs Buyer Protection.
For example, if you dispute a transaction with your card issuer, you may be able to recover amounts you paid for unsatisfactory items even if they donât qualify for protection under a Significantly Not as Described claim with us.
You must choose whether to pursue a dispute with PayPal under our PayPal Buyer Protection, or to pursue the dispute with your card issuer.
You canât do both at the same time or seek a double recovery.
If you pursue a dispute/claim with us and you also pursue a dispute for the same transaction with your card issuer, weâll close your dispute/claim with us.
This wonât affect the dispute process with your card issuer.
In addition, if you pursue a dispute with your card issuer, you cannot pursue a dispute/claim with us later.
If you choose to dispute a transaction with PayPal and we decide against you, you can seek to pursue the dispute with your card issuer later.
If PayPal does not make a final decision on your claim until after your card issuer's deadline for filing a dispute, and because of our delay you recover less than the full amount you would have been entitled to recover from the card issuer, we will reimburse you for the remainder of your loss (minus any amount you have already recovered from the seller or your card issuer).
Before contacting your card issuer or filing a dispute with PayPal, you should contact the seller to attempt to resolve your issue in accordance with the sellerâs return policy. PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT
Receiving Payments General provisions for receiving payments PayPal may allow anybody (with or without an account) to make a payment resulting in the issuance or transfer of electronic money to your account.

By integrating (including by having already integrated) into your online checkout/platform any functionality intended to enable a payer without a PayPal account to send a payment to your PayPal account, you agree to all further terms of use of that functionality which PayPal will make available to you on any page on the PayPal or Braintree website (including any page for developers and our Legal Agreements page) or online platform.
Such further terms include the PayPal Alternative Payment Methods Agreement.

The receipt of a payment into your account does not equate to the receipt of cleared funds.
A notification that a payment has been sent to you does not amount to a receipt of electronic money in your account unless you have accepted the payment.

We may allow you to accept payments in any currency supported by our Service from time to time.

Where you (instead of PayPal) offer the payer at the point of sale a currency conversion of an amount you receive through PayPal, you will inform the buyer of the exchange rate and any charges that will be applied to the payment transaction.
PayPal has no liability to any buyer if you fail to inform the buyer of the exchange rate and charges.
You acknowledge that if you fail to disclose the exchange rate and charges to the buyer this may constitute a criminal offence by you.
Any payment sent to you may be subject to a reversal, payment review, limitation, reserve or hold as allowed under this user agreement.
Receiving limits We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount and value of payments you can receive, including money you receive for purchases.
To lift your receiving limit, you must follow the steps that we will notify to you or publish from time to time (which we may set out in your account overview).
New checkout solution included in the PayPal Commerce Platform
The PayPal Commerce Platform includes our new checkout solution.&nbsp.
The checkout solution consists of:


our dedicated bundled checkout capability in your online checkout/platform to enable a buyer with or without an account to send a payment to your account.
and

Fraud Protection.



We may offer you all, any part or any combination of parts of the checkout solution.
If we offer you the checkout solution and you choose to use it, in addition to this user agreement, you agree to the following further terms relating to the following capabilities:

the PayPal Alternative Payment Methods Agreement, when you use our APM functionality as part of the checkout solution.
and
the PayPal Online Card Payment Services Agreement, when you use: 
our Advanced Credit and Debit Card Payments as part of the checkout solution bundle.
and
Fraud Protection as part of the checkout solution.



Our Fees for using the checkout solution apply. Rules about surcharging PayPal does not encourage surcharging because it is a commercial practice that can penalise the consumer and create unnecessary confusion, friction and abandonment at checkout.

You may only surcharge for the use of our services in compliance with any law applicable to you and not in excess of the surcharges that you apply for the use of other payment methods.
If you surcharge a buyer, you, and not we, will inform the buyer of the requested charge.
We are not liable to any buyer where you have failed to inform the buyer of any surcharge.
You acknowledge that you could be committing a criminal offence if you surcharge and/or fail to disclose any form of surcharge to a buyer. Presentation of PayPal You must treat PayPal as a payment method or mark at least on par with any other payment methods offered at your points of sale, including your websites or mobile applications.
This includes at least equal or substantially similar:

logo placement,
position within any point of sale,
treatment in terms of payment flow, terms, conditions, restrictions, or fees, in each case as compared to other marks and payment methods at your points of sale.

In representations to your customers or in public communications, you must not mischaracterise PayPal as a payment method or exhibit a preference for other payment methods over PayPal. Taxes and information reporting It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the payments you make or receive, and it is solely your responsibility to assess, collect, report and remit the correct taxes to the appropriate authority.
We are not responsible for determining whether any taxes apply to your transaction, or for calculating, collecting, reporting or remitting taxes arising from any transaction.
As a bank service provider no sales tax applies to the PayPal services in the EU. Your refund policy and privacy policy You must publish a refunds and return policy, as well as a privacy policy. In-store payments and QR code transactions If you accept PayPal payments at your physical store, you must communicate the total amount of the transaction to the customer before it takes place.
You may charge your customer's account only for transactions that they have authorized.
You must also provide customers with a physical receipt if they request one.
You agree that any transaction that you make shall have an accurate and true description of the goods and services being purchased.
If you use a QR code to accept payments in your physical store, you must use a QR code intended for goods and services transactions.
You must also not use QR codes for in-person transactions as a method of accepting payment for goods and services transactions occurring online.
For any buyer claims related to QR code transactions you may be required to provide us with alternative evidence of delivery, or such additional documentation or information relating to the transaction. Marketplace sellers If youâre a seller on a marketplace or through a third-party application where PayPal is offered, you must comply with any rules that apply to the marketplaceâs or the third party applicationâs buyer protection program for sales you make through that forum.
Any such protections may require you to take certain actions and may impact how claims are processed.
We may allow you to authorise certain marketplaces to use your account to pay amounts you owe to the marketplace or to the buyer (as the case may be) arising from a claim under the terms of the marketplaceâs own resolution process (âMarketplace Due Amountsâ).
If you give such an authorisation and the marketplace notifies us of the claim, you instruct us to process payments of all and any Marketplace Due Amounts relating to that claim from your PayPal account to that marketplace or to the buyer (as the case may be) according to the marketplaceâs instructions to us.
We may treat your instruction for the payment of any given Marketplace Due Amount as cancelled if we decide that the claim would have been determined in your favour had it been filed as a claim with us.
You can also cancel this instruction by contacting us.
All claims filed directly with the marketplace are governed by the marketplaceâs own policy only.
The terms of the PayPal Seller Protection Programme do not cover you for claims filed by your buyers directly with the marketplace. Accepting billing agreement payments If we allow you to accept payments from a payer under a billing agreement, when you present to us a payment request under that billing agreement, you:

warrant to us that the amounts you present have been agreed and consented to by the payer whose account will be deducted (including changes to those amounts) and that you will give prior notice of the deduction to the payer.
and
agree that you will notify the payer at least 4 weeks in advance of the amount they will collect if that amount has increased in such a manner that the payer could not have reasonably expected to pay such an amount, taking into account the payerâs previous spending patterns and the circumstances of the payment and that you are liable to us for any refunds of that payment in accordance with the terms of this user agreement.
 Refunds and reversals of payments When you receive a payment, it could be refunded or reversed.
We may allow you to send to the payer a refund of the payment.
We may carry out a reversal of your payment in certain circumstances.
See the rest of this section for more details.Refunds You alone are (and PayPal is not) responsible for:

your legal and contractual obligations towards the payer for any amount you return to the payer.
and
any difference between the cost to the payer of making the original payment and the value of the amount returned to the payer (for instance, as a result of transaction exchange rate fluctuations) except to the extent that the refund is an incorrect payment (see the section on Resolving Problems).
See our fees for details of the fees you paid to us as the recipient of the original payment which we retain when you use the special commercial transaction refund functionality in your PayPal account, as we may allow from time to time.
except to the extent that the refund is an incorrect payment (see the section on Resolving Problems).
Reversals If you receive a payment in your account, you owe us the full amount of the payment and our losses arising from processing the payment.
This can include our liability (including any fees, charges and penalties) towards any third party (including the payer and the payerâs funding source provider).
A reversal happens when we exercise our right to set off the above amounts from your account under the section Reimbursement for your liability in this user agreement.
If your PayPal balance for a particular currency is insufficient to cover the amount you owe us in that currency, we may perform a currency conversion from any PayPal balance in another currency to cover the shortfall and you will be charged for the currency conversion.
This means that, for example, if you are a seller, amounts of payments received in your account may be removed from your account after you have delivered any goods or services sold.
A reversal can happen when:

we reimburse the payer in respect of a PayPal Buyer Protection claim the payer made against you.
we compensate the payer or the payerâs funding source provider (or both) because we receive a claim from the payer or their funding source provider for the payment amount under the reversal process used by that funding source provider.

For instance:

if the payer used a card to fund the payment to you the payer could pursue a âchargebackâ with the card issuer.
The card issuer, not us, determines whether the payer is successful when they pursue a chargeback.
You can find out more about chargebacks by reviewing our Chargeback Guide, accessible via the PayPal Security Centre and the section called: âSelling Safelyâ.
The PayPal Security Centre is accessed via the PayPal website.
We charge you a fee for receiving a chargeback claim.


If the payer used a bank account to fund the payment the payer or the bank could pursue a bank reversal.

The amount claimed may be greater than the original amount you received due to currency exchange rate fluctuations between the time of payment and the time of the claim.

we may have to compensate your payer when they claimed that there was a problem with their payment (including that their payment was unauthorised or incorrect or that their billing agreement payment was not expected) â see Resolving Problems.


we are entitled to carry out the reversal for any other reason under this user agreement, including the provision Actions We May Take if You Engage in Any Restricted Activities.
 Impact of PayPal Buyer Protection on sellers  You should read our Buyer Protection Policy and if you sell goods and services to buyers with PayPal accounts in countries other than your own, you also should be familiar with the purchase protection made available by PayPal to buyers in each of those countries as buyersâ rights under these programs may impact you as a seller.
You can find information about the PayPal Buyer Protection on the Legal Agreements page by selecting your buyerâs location at the top of the page and referring to the corresponding PayPal Buyer Protection listed on that page or in the corresponding user agreement.

If you lose a claim under PayPal Buyer Protection&nbsp.
in any country:
Â·     &nbsp.
You must forfeit the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping cost.
In some cases you may not receive the item back.
Â·     &nbsp.
You will not receive a refund of the PayPal fees that you paid in connection with the sale.
Â·     &nbsp.
If the claim was that the item received was Significantly Not as Described, you may not receive the item back, or you may be required to accept the item back plus pay for return shipping costs.
Â·     &nbsp.
If the claim was that the item received was Significantly Not as Described and related to an item you sold that is counterfeit, you will be required to provide a full refund to the buyer and you may not receive the item back.
If you accept PayPal payments from buyers for goods or services you sell through eBay, then you need to read and understand the eBay Money Back Guarantee program.
Unless you opt out by calling eBay, PayPal will treat eBayâs decisions in favor of your buyers under that program as a basis for reversing a PayPal payment made to you.
If the balance in your cash account or business PayPal account is insufficient to cover the amount, we may:
Â·     &nbsp.
place a hold on your PayPal account until sufficient funds become available in your PayPal account to cover the amount.
or
create a negative balance in your PayPal account. PayPal Seller Protection Whatâs eligible If you have received more than â¬100,000 per month at least once over a consecutive period of 6 months on your PayPal Account and/or if you are applying surcharge for the use of PayPal (when the law applicable to you allows you to apply surcharge), you are not eligible for PayPal seller protection and this section applies to you unless otherwise agreed between you and PayPal.
PayPal will review your eligibility for seller protection in October and April of each calendar year.
If you sell something to a buyer and the transaction is later disputed or reversed under Reversals, Claims or Chargebacks, you may be eligible for reimbursement under PayPal Seller Protection.
When it applies, PayPal Seller Protection entitles you to retain the full purchase amount.
There is no limit on the number of payments for which you can receive coverage.
By accessing the transaction details page in your PayPal account you can determine whether or not your transaction is eligible for protection under this program
PayPal Seller Protection may apply when a buyer claims that:

They did not authorize, or benefit from, funds sent from their PayPal account (referred to as an âUnauthorized Transactionâ claim) and the Unauthorized Transaction occurs in an environment hosted by PayPal.
or
They didnât receive the item from you (referred to as an âItem Not Receivedâ claim).

PayPal Seller Protection may also apply when a transaction is reversed because of a successful chargeback by a buyer or when a bank funded payment is reversed by the buyerâs bank.
This section describes PayPal Seller Protection as it applies to you, but you should also be familiar with the Impact of various PayPal Buyer protection processes on sellers. Basic requirements To be eligible for PayPal Seller Protection, all of the following basic requirements must be met, as well as any applicable additional requirements:

The primary address for your PayPal account must be in the Netherlands.
The item must be a physical, tangible good that can be shipped, except for items subject to the Intangible Goods Additional Requirements.

You must ship the item to the shipping address on the transaction details page in your PayPal account for the transaction.
If you originally ship the item to the recipient's shipping address on the transaction details page but the item is later redirected to a different address, you will not be eligible for PayPal Seller Protection.
We therefore recommend not using a shipping service that is arranged by the buyer, so that you will be able to provide valid proof of shipping and delivery.
The shipping requirement does not apply to eligible transactions involving items that you deliver in person, provided, however, that you agree to provide us with alternative evidence of delivery, or such additional documentation or information relating to the transaction that we may request.
You must respond to PayPal's requests for documentation and other information in a timely manner as requested in our email correspondence with you or in our correspondence with you through the Resolution Center. If you do not respond to PayPalâs request for documentation and other information in the time requested, you may not be eligible for Seller Protection.
If the sale involves pre-ordered or made-to-order goods, you must ship within the timeframe you specified in the listing.
Otherwise, it is recommended that you ship all items within 7 days after receipt of payment.
Provide proof of shipment or delivery.
The payment must be marked "eligible" or "partially eligible" in the case of Unauthorized Transaction claims, or âeligibleâ in the case of Item Not Received claims for PayPal Seller Protection on the "Transaction Details" page.
You must accept a single payment from one PayPal Account for the purchase (partial payment and/or payment in installments are excluded).

PayPal determines, in its sole discretion, whether your claim qualifies for the Seller Protection program.
PayPal will make a decision, in its sole discretion, based on the coverage and eligibility requirements, any information or documentation provided during the resolution process or any other information PayPal deems relevant and appropriate under the circumstances.Item Not Received additional requirements To be eligible for PayPalâs Seller Protection program for a buyerâs Item Not Received claim, you must meet both the basic requirements&nbsp.

You agree that engaging in the above restricted activities diminishes your or our other customersâ safe access and/or use of your account and our services generally. Actions We May Take if You Engage in Any Restricted Activities If we believe that youâve engaged in any of these activities, we may take a number of actions to protect PayPal, its customers and others at any time in our sole discretion.&nbsp.
The actions we may take include, but are not limited to, the following:

Terminate this user agreement, limit your account, and/or close or suspend your account, immediately and without penalty to us;
Refuse to provide the PayPal services to you in the future;
At any time and without liability, suspend, limit or terminate your access to our websites, software, systems (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the PayPal services) operated by us or on our behalf, your PayPal account or any of the PayPal services, including limiting your ability to pay or send money with any of the payment methods linked to your PayPal account, restricting your ability to send money or make withdrawals;
Hold your money to the extent and for so long as reasonably needed to protect against the risk of liability.
You acknowledge that, as a non-exhaustive guide:


PayPalâs risk of liability in respect of card-funded payments that you receive can last until the risk of a chargeback closing in favour of the payer/buyer (as determined by card scheme rules) has passed.
This depends on certain factors, including, without limitation: 
a.
The type of goods or services for which you receive payment.
or
b.
The timeframe for delivery of the goods or performance of the services for which you receive payment (e.g.
sales of event tickets months in advance of the event date can present a higher and more enduring risk of chargebacks than sales of most other items or services);


PayPalâs risk of liability in respect of a claim or dispute arising from a payment that you receive can last for the time that it takes for the parties to close the claim or dispute and all appeals associated with that claim or dispute in accordance with PayPal Buyer Protection
PayPalâs risk of liability in respect of any event of insolvency that you suffer can last for as long as and to the extent that laws applicable to your insolvency restrict PayPal from taking legal action against you.
and
If you allow your PayPal account to have a balance reflecting an amount owing to PayPal, PayPalâs risk of liability can last for the time and to the extent that you owe that amount to PayPal.


Block your PayPal account and/or hold any funds in the reserve account (including, without limitation, for more than 180 days if so required by PayPal, where PayPalâs rights arise from your engagement in the restricted activity);
Refuse any particular payment transaction at any time for any reason and will only be required to make available the fact of the refusal and the reasons for the refusal and how you may resolve the problem, where possible, upon request and provided it is not prohibited by law;
Reverse a payment (including, if appropriate, to the senderâs funding source);
Take legal action against you.
Suspend your eligibility for Buyer Protection and/or&nbsp.
Seller Protection (including in retrospect);
Contact third parties and disclose details of the restricted activities in the manner set out in our Privacy Statement;
Request or update inaccurate information you provided us;
Request information or documents from you in order to verify your identity and/or with regard to the goods or services you provided based on a transaction;
If youâve violated our Acceptable Use Policy, then youâre also responsible for damages to PayPal caused by your violation of this policy,

If you use your PayPal account primarily for the purposes of your trade, business, craft or profession and you violate the Acceptable Use Policy, then:

in addition to being subject to the above actions you will be liable to PayPal for the amount of PayPal's damages caused by your violation of the Acceptable Use Policy;


you acknowledge and agree that USD 2,500.00 (or the prevailing equivalent in the currency of the country in which you reside) per violation of the Acceptable Use Policy is: 
a reasonable minimum estimate of PayPal's actual damages considering all currently existing circumstances, including the relationship of the sum to the range of harm to PayPal that reasonably could be anticipated;
reasonable and proportionate in its application to the provision of the Services to you.
and
necessary, but no more than sufficient, to protect PayPalâs legitimate interest in your compliance with the Acceptable Use Policy.
and




PayPal may deduct such damages directly from any existing balance in any PayPal account you control.

Please also see the section below on Your liability.
Unless otherwise directed by us, you must not use or attempt to use your account while it is suspended or has been closed.
You must ensure that all agreements with sellers or other third parties that involve third party initiated payments (including billing agreement payments) set up from your account are cancelled immediately upon the termination, suspension or closure of your account.
You remain liable under this user agreement in respect of all charges and other amounts incurred through the use of your account at any time, irrespective of termination, suspension or closure. Holds, Limitations, and Reserves What are holds, limitations and reserves? Under certain circumstances, in order to protect PayPal and the security and integrity of the network of buyers and sellers that use the PayPal services, PayPal may take account-level or transaction-level actions.
If we take any of the actions described here, we will normally notify you of our actions, but we may, if it is reasonable to do so (for example if you are in breach of this user agreement or we consider it advisable for security reasons), take any of these actions without prior notice to you.
To request information in connection with an account limitation, hold or reserve, you should visit the Resolution Centre or follow the instructions in our email notice with respect to the limitation, hold or reserve.
You acknowledge and agree that any funds held under this user agreement may be placed in your reserve account and that you will provide to us any information as we may reasonably request to allow us to determine whether the risk has passed.Holds A hold is an action that PayPal may take under certain circumstances either at the transaction level or the account level.&nbsp.
When PayPal places a hold on a payment amount, the money is not available to either the sender or the recipient.
 PayPal reviews many factors before placing a hold on a payment, including: account tenure, transaction activity, business type, past customer disputes, and overall customer satisfaction.
Some common situations where PayPal will hold payments include where we have reason to believe that:

Transactions are higher risk, this can be where the transaction involves the sale of goods or services in a high risk category, or other facts known to us typically resulting in an increased number of chargebacks, other claims or disputes or to be often involved in fraud or illegal activity;
There is a sudden and abnormal change in a PayPal account holderâs selling activity including an increase in the number of chargebacks, reversals, or buyer complaints received in relation to such PayPal account;
Any PayPal account is being used in relation to restricted activities;
A PayPal account involved in the transaction may have been compromised, or that stolen financial details (bank or credit card) are used for the payment, or otherwise a transaction has not been properly authorised;
A user is trying to send or withdraw funds they received fraudulently;
A user has not provided sufficient Information to us to enable us to verify their identity or the identity of their business and/or the user has a limited trading history with PayPal;
A payment sent to you as a seller is challenged as a payment that should be invalidated and reversed.
Your buyer files a chargeback, reversal or PayPal Buyer Protection claim on a payment you received. 
Your buyer files a claim under a marketplace's resolution process.
There is a risk of reversal of funds in your account to your funding source.
There is a risk of liability (a non-exhaustive list of examples of such risk is set out in the section Actions We May Take If You Engage In Any Restricted Activities above).
Payment review When we identify a potentially high-risk transaction, we review the transaction more closely before allowing it to proceed.
This may be because we have the reasonable suspicion that the payerâs PayPal account is being used in relation to restricted activities or for other reasons as determined by us in our reasonable discretion.&nbsp.
This may include where there is a risk of liability (a non-exhaustive list of examples of such risk is set out in the section Actions We May Take If You Engage In Any Restricted Activities above).
If a payment is subject to payment review, we may:

execute the payment order initiated by the buyer;
in our discretion, immediately upon such execution restrict the payerâs account;
place a hold on the payment [in the payerâs account].
and/or
notify the recipient to delay the delivery of the purchase paid for by the payment.

As a buyer, this may delay your receipt of the item you purchased.
If we clear the transaction, we will notify the seller and direct them to ship the item.
 
If we donât clear the transaction, we will cancel it and return the funds to you, unless we are legally required to take other action.
All payments that complete payment review are still subject to being reversed under the terms of this user agreement but will be Seller Protection eligible if they meet the Seller Protection requirements.
PayPal will provide notices to you by email and/or in the transaction history tab of your PayPal account.
A payment subject to payment review is a review of the payment only and is implemented to reduce the risk of PayPal users receiving high risk transactions.
A payment subject to payment review is neither a review nor a representation by PayPal as to the commercial dealings, character or reputation of a party to the payment transaction and should not be considered as a lessening of the respect of any person.Holds related to your instructions Certain PayPal functionality may allow you (whether directly or via someone you permit to act on your behalf, like an online marketplace platform on which you transact as a seller) to instruct us to hold your funds (including the proceeds of payments you receive using PayPal) in your reserve account.
In such a case we will show you the availability status of those funds in your balance â the status descriptions may differ according to the functionality you used to instruct us to place the hold.
We will release the hold on the funds according to the instruction that you (or the entity that you have permitted to act on your behalf) give to us, subject to the rest of this user agreement. Account Limitations Limitations are implemented to help protect PayPal, buyers and sellers when we notice restricted activities, an increased financial risk, or activity that appears to us as unusual or suspicious.&nbsp.
Limitations also help us collect information necessary for keeping your PayPal account open.
There are several reasons why your PayPal account could be limited, including where we have reason to believe that:

Someone could be using your PayPal account without your knowledge, then weâll limit it for your protection and look into the fraudulent activity.
Someone has used your card or bank account without your permission, for example if your debit or credit card issuer or bank alerts us to this.
You have breached this user agreement or violated the Acceptable Use Policy.

Your performance as a seller indicate your PayPal account is high risk.
Examples include: indications of poor selling performance because youâve received an unusually high number of claims and chargebacks, selling an entirely new or high-cost product type, or if your typical sales volume increases rapidly.
There is a risk of liability (a non-exhaustive list of examples of such risk is set out in the section Actions We May Take If You Engage In Any Restricted Activities above).

We may also limit your PayPal account in order to comply with applicable law.
You will need to resolve any issues with your account before a limitation can be removed.
Normally, this is done after you provide us with the information we request.
However, if we reasonably believe a risk still exists after you have provided us that information, we may take action to protect PayPal, our users, a third party, or you from reversals, fees, fines, penalties, legal and/or regulatory risks and any other liability.Reserves We may place a reserve on your PayPal account at any time if we believe there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your PayPal account, your business model, or your transactions.&nbsp.
When we place a reserve on your PayPal account, it means that all or some portion of the funds in your PayPal account is reserved as unavailable for withdrawal in order to protect against the risk of transactions made by you being reversed or invalidated or any other risk related to your PayPal account or use of the PayPal services. &nbsp.
We make decisions about whether to place a reserve based on a number of factors, including information available to us from both internal sources and from third parties.
PayPal considers a list of non-exclusive factors and whether and how these factors have changed over time, including:

How long you have been in business.
Whether your industry has a higher likelihood of chargebacks.
Your payment processing history with PayPal and other providers.
Your business and/or personal credit history.
Your delivery time frames.
Whether you have higher than average number of returns, chargebacks, claims or disputes.

There are two types of reserves that may be placed on your PayPal account, and one or both may be applied at the same time:


A ârolling reserveâ is a reserve where a percentage of each transaction you receive each day is held and then released later on a scheduled basis.
For example, your reserve could be set at 10% and held for a 90-day rolling period â meaning 10% of the money you receive on day 1 is held and then released on day 91, 10% of the money you receive on day 2 is held until day 92, etc.
Rolling reserves are the most common type of reserve.

A âminimum reserveâ is a specific minimum amount of funds that youâre required to keep available in your balance at all times.
The minimum reserve is either taken as an upfront amount deposited all at once or is established on a rolling basis from percentages of sales until the minimum reserve is achieved, much like a rolling reserve. 

If we place a reserve on funds in your PayPal account, the money will be moved to your reserve account and shown as âpendingâ and weâll notify you about it.
If we change the reserve due to a change in our risk assessment, weâll notify you about it as well.
You will undertake, at your own expense, any further action required to establish a reserve or other form of security in a manner reasonably determined by us.&nbsp.
This can involve executing any necessary documents and registering any form of document reasonably required by us to allow us to perfect any form of security interest. PAYPAL USER AGREEMENT
RESOLVING PROBLEMS 
We strongly recommend that you monitor your account closely on a regular basis.
 If you find a problemâ¦ If you have any reason to believe that there is a problem with your account or our service, follow these steps: Step 1: Take a few moments to identify the type of problem: 


Unexpected billing agreement payment


This is where you entered into a billing agreement but a payment was sent from your account to another PayPal account under that billing agreement where:

you didnât agree with the recipient in advance the exact payment amount.
and
the payment amount ended up being more than you could reasonably have expected to pay based on previous charges and the other circumstances.






Incorrect payment


This is where a payment sent from your account to another PayPal account was not sent as you specified when you asked us to make it (e.g.
for the wrong amount, delayed, wrong recipient) or you received such a payment.





Security / Fraud problem





Unauthorised payment


This is where a payment sent from your account wasnât authorised by you (or anyone whoâs authorised to make payments for you).





Another type of security / fraud problem


This is where there was another security or fraud problem, such as:

there was some other unauthorised access to your account.
your password or PIN was compromised.
a device you have used to access our services was lost, stolen or deactivated.


Follow the steps in the section âWhat to do in case of a security problemâ in the 
Key Payment and Service Information
 as soon as possible before contacting us.







Another type of problem 


This is where there was another type of problem with your account or with our service which is not mentioned above.
For instance, we may have made a factual, computational or mathematical error related to your PayPal when you added money to or withdrew money from your PayPal account.
If a purchase that you paid for with PayPal was not as described or you have not received the purchase, the PayPal Buyer Protection Policy, not this section, may apply.&nbsp.
Please see the PayPal Buyer Protection Policy for how to deal with these particular problems.

 Step 2: Tell us about the problem 

Contact us as soon as possible
 to tell us about the problem (including the type of problem you are contacting us about so that we can help you as quickly as we can).
You must give us all the information we reasonably request as to the circumstances of the problem and take all reasonable steps we request to assist us in our investigation.
If you tell us about your problem orally, we may require that you report your problem in writing within 10 Business Days after that.
We may provide third parties with information we consider relevant in such circumstances in accordance with our 
Privacy Policy
 (alternatively known as our Privacy Statement). How we will help...
Subject to the rest of this user agreement, we aim to investigate the problem and work with you to resolve it within 60 days.
In addition, if your problem is:



an unexpected billing agreement payment, 
 within 10 Business Days after telling us about it we will either: 
reimburse you for the payment amount.
or
explain why we cannot reimburse you.






an incorrect payment to another Paypal account, 
we will:

make immediate efforts to trace the payment and notify you of the outcome without charge to you;
compensate you as soon as possible (and in any event no later than the end of the Business Day after you tell us about the problem) by putting your account in the state it would have been in had the incorrect payment been sent as actually specified by the sender.
This means: 
If the incorrect payment resulted in you having less money than you would have had if the payment had been made as actually specified, we will credit your account for the difference.
If the incorrect payment resulted in you having more money than you would have had if the payment had been made as actually specified, we may debit the extra funds from your account.


reimburse you in your account for your losses or damages directly and reasonably foreseeably caused by the incorrect payment.





an unauthorised payment to another PayPal account, 
as soon as possible (and in any event no later than the end of the Business Day after you tell us about the problem) we will put your account back to where it would have been had the payment never happened.&nbsp.
This can include a reimbursement of your payment.
 When we canât compensate you...
You are not entitled to any financial compensation from us as outlined above and you will owe to us (and we may reverse from your account) any compensation you have already received from us if:

You do not give us all the information we reasonably requested as to the circumstances of the problem (including, if you tell us about your problem orally, you fail to comply with our request that you tell us about your problem in writing within 10 Business Days);
You do not take all reasonable steps that we request to assist us in our investigation;
We can show that you acted fraudulently;
We can show that circumstances beyond our control (such as fire or flood or loss of internet connection) caused the problem, despite our reasonable precautions;
We have reason to believe otherwise that there is no problem which entitles you to compensation.
or
In respect of the following specific problems:



Unexpected billing agreement payment




Incorrect payment




Unauthorised payment


It takes you longer than 8 weeks after the payment was made to tell us about the problem.
or
You agreed for us to make your payment and the details were made available to you by us or the merchant at least 4 weeks before the payment was made.
It takes you longer than 13 months after the payment was made to tell us about the problem.
or
We can show that you gave us the wrong payment details.
or
We can show that the payment was sent as the payer specified when the payer asked us to make it.
or
Through no fault of ours, you did not have enough PayPal balance to complete the payment.
or
We can show our system was not working properly and you knew about the breakdown when you started the transaction.
or
A delay which you claimed caused the incorrect payment actually resulted from PayPal applying a hold, limitation or reserve 
under this user agreement

It takes you longer than 13 months after the payment was made to tell us about the problem.
or
We can show that the payment was made because you did not keep your account safe either intentionally or with gross negligence (for instance, you very carelessly chose to share your PayPal ID and/or password/PIN with someone else).
or
There was another security /fraud problem and you didnât tell us about it.
We will not pay you compensation for any unauthorised payments made from your account before you told us about that problem.
 
Sometimes we might spot the problem first.&nbsp.
If we need to notify you about the problem, we will ordinarily do so through the Secure Messaging Centre, which you need to log into your account to access.
If you should take action urgently, we may also use other means such as email to request action.
If a payment was made from us to your funding source by way of mistake, we may correct the mistake by debiting or crediting (as the case may be) your appropriate funding source(s).

If there are insufficient funds in your balance to cover your liability, we reserve the right to collect the amount you owe us by deducting the amount (or any part of it) from any payments received in or money you add to your PayPal account.&nbsp.
Otherwise you agree to reimburse us through other means.
We may also recover amounts you owe us through legal means, including, without limitation, through the use of a debt collection agency. Assumption of rights If PayPal invalidates and reverses a payment that you made to a recipient (either at your initiative or otherwise), you agree that PayPal assumes your rights against the recipient and third parties related to the payment, and may pursue those rights directly or on your behalf, in PayPalâs discretion.&nbsp.
This is known in legal terms as your âsubrogationâ or âassignmentâ to PayPal of your rights against the recipient and third parties related to the payment. No waiver Our failure to act with respect to a breach of any of your obligations under this user agreement by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. Information about you We may request information from you as we reasonably require to enable us to facilitate our actions described in this user agreement, reduce the risk of fraud or comply with our regulatory (including anti-money laundering) obligations.
You must comply with these requests in a timely fashion.
This may involve you faxing, emailing or otherwise providing to us at your own expense identification documents and information about your finance and operations (such as your most recent financial statements and merchant processing statements).

PayPal will make reasonable efforts to ensure that requests for electronic debits and credits involving bank accounts, debit cards, credit cards, and cheque issuances are processed in a timely manner but PayPal makes no representations or warranties regarding the amount of time needed to complete processing because the PayPal services are dependent upon many factors outside of our control, such as delays in the banking system or international mail service.

PayPal may transfer or assign this user agreement or any right or obligation under this user agreement at any time. Governing law This user agreement and the relationship between us is governed by the laws of England and Wales.&nbsp.
This does not affect your mandatory rights under the laws of the country in which you reside, such as your rights as a consumer.
If you bring a claim against us in court, you submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.
This means that if you were able to bring a claim arising from this user agreement against us in court, for example, an acceptable court would be a court located in England or Wales, but if the law allows you to do so, you can bring the claim in the court of another country instead, such as the country in which you reside. Privacy Protecting your privacy is very important to us.&nbsp.
Please review our Privacy Statement in order to better understand our commitment to maintaining your privacy, as well as our use and disclosure of your information. Languages and translation of agreement We will communicate with you in in the language(s) in which we have made available this user agreement to you.
This user agreement is concluded in Dutch only.
Any translation of this user agreement is provided solely for your convenience and is not intended to modify the terms of this user agreement.
 Your use of information.
Data protection laws If you receive information about another PayPal customer, you must keep the information confidential and only use it in connection with the PayPal services.&nbsp.
You may not disclose or distribute any information about PayPal users to a third party or use the information for marketing purposes unless you receive that userâs express consent to do so.&nbsp.
You may not send unsolicited emails to a PayPal customer or use the PayPal services to collect payments for sending, or assist in sending, unsolicited emails to third parties.
To the extent that you (as a seller) process any personal data about a PayPal customer pursuant to this user agreement, you agree to comply with the requirements of any applicable privacy and data protection laws.
You have your own, independently determined privacy policy, notices and procedures for any such personal data that you hold as a data controller, including a record of your activities related to processing of personal data under this user agreement.
The privacy and data protection laws that may apply include any associated regulations, regulatory requirements and codes of practice applicable to the provision of the services described in this user agreement.
If you process personal data from Europe pursuant to this user agreement, you must comply with the EU Directive 95/46 EC or the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR).
In complying with such laws, you will:

implement and maintain all appropriate security measures for the processing of personal data;
maintain a record of all processing activities carried out under this user agreement.
and
not knowingly do anything or permit anything to be done which might lead to a breach of any privacy data protection laws by PayPal.
 Complete agreement and third party rights This user agreement sets forth the entire understanding between you and us with respect to our service.
If any provision of this user agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be struck out and the remaining provisions shall be enforced.
A person who is not a party to this user agreement has no rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to rely upon or enforce any term of this user agreement (except for the third parties&nbsp.
falling under the definition of âPayPalâ in the 
Indemnification and Limitation of Liability
 section above, in respect of their rights as specified in this user agreement) but this does not affect any right or remedy of third parties which exists or is available apart from that act. PayPal as Login Method We may allow you to authenticate with PayPal when you log into certain external websites or mobile apps.
If we do so, we may share your login status with any third party enabling you to log in in this way, as well as the personal and other account information that you consent to being shared so that the third party can recognise you.
PayPal will not give the third party access to your account and will only make payments from your account to that third party with your specific authorisation and instruction.
If you enable visitors to authenticate with PayPal when they log into your website, app, or your customer accounts, you must agree to any specific terms applicable when this functionality is made available to you, and comply with any specifications in any integration manual or guideline.
We do not guarantee or otherwise represent the identity of any user of this login method.
We will not share with you the personal and other account information of the user (including login status) held by PayPal unless the user has consented to our disclosure of that information to you. Corporate customers&nbsp.
When we refer to âPSD2â in this section we mean the Second EU Payment Services Directive ((EU)2015/2366).
We consider you to be a âCorporate Customerâ if, on the date you entered into this user agreement, you are not:

a consumer, (being an individual acting for purposes other than a trade, business or profession).
and
a micro-enterprise (being an enterprise which employs fewer than 10 persons and has an annual balance sheet that does not exceed 2 million EUR).

We may disapply certain provisions of PSD2 for your use of our service if you are a Corporate Customer.
If you are a Corporate Customer:

you are not entitled to a refund for billing agreement payments;
where you identify a problem you have up to 60 (sixty) days from the date on which the problem happened to notify us about it, after which time we have no obligation to investigate and refund you;
we are not obliged to comply with the information requirements set out in Title III of PSD2 and their equivalents in any implementation of PSD2 in member states of the European Economic Area that may apply to you (âPSD2 transpositionsâ).
and
articles 72 and 89 of PSD2 and equivalent provisions in PSD2 transpositions do not apply to your use of our service, meaning that, even where we may say so otherwise in this user agreement, we are not liable to you for the losses or damage you may suffer under those articles and provisions.
