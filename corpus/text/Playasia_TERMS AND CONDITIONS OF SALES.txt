Digital Products


Because of the nature of digital products, we are not able to know the identity of the person who ultimately redeems the code.
We are unable to check if a code has been redeemed or not without redeeming it.

For each order we ship, we track the day and the time at which the code was seen by the customer.
Codes are guaranteed, provided they have not been seen by the customer.
Once codes have been viewed, we bare no responsibility, nor can we guarantee the validity of the codes.

Digital Delivery


Codes purchased will be delivered directly to our Customers Playasia account.
To reveal the code, simply click the "Show your code" button.
By clicking the "Show your code" button, the Customer accepts delivery of the digital code.
The IP-Address used will be logged in our record for this purpose. 

Errors


We understand that there may be times where errors are encountered with digital products.
With this, we need to ask for the following:
&nbsp.
1.
Screenshot of the code entered

2.
Screenshot of the error encountered
Once the information has been received, an investigation will commence within 5 business days.

Please note that this is approximate and may take longer depending on the complexity and nature of the code.

After the investigation: If the error with the code is confirmed, a refund or replacement will be given.

For redeemed codes issues: If the code has been redeemed after the code has been seen by the customer, this is considered as used and we are afraid that we cannot offer a refund or replacement.

Errors on codes must be reported to Playasia within 45 days of the date of purchase.
There will be no refund or replacement for any error reported to us more than 45 days after purchase.

Region Locked Products


Most digital products are region locked and require the end-user to have the correct account to redeem them.
for example, an iTunes Japan card can only be redeemed on a Japanese iTunes account.
It is the sole responsibility of the customer to ensure that the code purchased is valid for his/her account being used.
Region locks are stated in the product description.
Refunds or replacements may not be available for issues concerning Region Lock.

Expired Codes


Customers should redeem the codes immediately upon purchase.
Any issues concerning code expiry may not be subject for a refund or replacement.
