 a.You will only use Patook to help you find platonic friendships, and not use it to flirt, hit on, or attempt to seduce other members, nor shall you approach users with ulterior motives.
Patook algorithms or moderators will make the final decision as to whether any certain behavior reflects ulterior motives, and any users displaying such behavior may be banned from the Site or blocked without notification.

 b.   &nbsp.
You will only use Patook from within one of the supported states or countries.
If you activate Patook in a supported state or country, and then move to an unsupported state or country, you certify that you will deactivate and never use Patook while in that unsupported location.

 c.If you are found to use this app to willingly send inappropriate pictures you agree that you will cause irreparable harm to Patook but that the exact level of the harm may be difficult to ascertain.
As a reasonable approximation of the damages that Patook may incur, you may be liable for up to $250 in liquidated damages per violation.
In this paragraph, inappropriate pictures include but are not limited to: pictures showing your or other people's genitalia, pictures of you in underwear, pictures depicting violence or threats to other users, pornographic pictures, and any pictures of an illegal nature, such as those showing the use of illegal substances.
Patook may charge you $250 for each breach of this paragraph of the Terms.
The $250 in damages is a reasonable approximation of the damages that Patook will incur, from lost user revenue and damage to Patook's reputation, due to a breach of this paragraph.
You agree to pay the whole amount within 30 days of receiving a notification from Patook LLC.
A breach of this Paragraph shall occur for each inappropriate picture sent to each user.For example, should a user send the same inappropriate messages to three users, at the same time or at different times, that user will be liable for three $250 violations or $750 in total damages.

 d.You understand that pictures or activities that appear to be of an illegal nature may be automatically or manually submitted to law enforcement authorities or other bodies such as the NCMEC, sometimes solely at the discretion of automated algorithms or human moderators.

 g.
Any attempt to reverse engineer the site or flirt detection algorithms will result in an immediate ban and, if done on behalf of a company or competitor, may result in legal action.

 h.Any attempt to contact users outside of the app without their explicit permission (such as for example, guessing their Facebook name from their first name and city/pictures, or reading their Snapchat alias off their Patook profiles, and adding them as Snapchat friends without having talked to them within Patook) may result in an immediate ban.

 i.Only one account per user is allowed.
Users caught with more than one account may be permanently banned and have all their accounts disabled.
Users who delete their account, only to create another one shortly thereafter may be permanently banned.

You agree to pay the whole amount within 30 days of receiving a notification from Patook LLC.
A breach of this Paragraph shall occur for each user you contact under the fake assumed identity.For example, should a 35-year male user posing as a 22 year old woman contact three women using that fake identity, that user will be liable for three $250 violations or $750 in total damages.

If you breach the terms of this subsection, or send or post unsolicited bulk email, "spam" or other unsolicited communications of any kind through the Services, you acknowledge that you will have caused substantial harm to Patook, but that the amount of such harm would be extremely difficult to ascertain.

As a reasonable approximation of the damages that Patook may incur from banned users creating unauthorized new accounts, you agree to pay Patook the sum of $250 if you create a new account after having been banned, and an extra $250 for each subsequent account you create after being banned.
If you were talking to a user that was banned, Patook will have no responsibility to inform you that the user was banned and what the reason was, even if it was a terms of service violation.
In general, Patook does not notify any users when a ban occurs.
 Pyramid Schemes and MLM schemes.
 If you are found to be attempting to recruit users for a pyramid, marketing or other Multi-Layer Marketing ("MLM") scheme, you agree to pay Patook the sum of $250 for each user that you contacted as a reasonable approximation of the damages that Patook may incur due to you attempting to recruit another user for a pyramid marketing or other MLM scheme, even if that specific user did not reply or you did not begin recruiting them.

Sending overview or informational videos to users regarding the MLM companies.
b-     &nbsp.

You understand that Patook may report you to the law enforcement authorities of your country and provide all the communications you had on the site, including your messages and physical location.
You agree that Patook may take additional precautions against such behavior, including, but not limited to, publishing your information/photo/contact info on a public list of known MLM schemers, or contacting all the users you were in touch with and asking them to report you.
In the event that you contest that a specific scheme is an MLM, Patook will make the final determination as to whether that is the case.
In general, any kind of money-making scheme will fall under this category.
You also agree to report any scheme that falls under this category, and that Patook will in no way be liable if you are a victim of MLM or pyramid schemes.
