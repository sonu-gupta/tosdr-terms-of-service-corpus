MEDIARITHMICS â DEVICE IDENTIFIER MATCHING SERVICE PROVIDER



Besides its software solutions, mediarithmics provides its clients with a service to reconcile, for a given device, the identifiers coming from multiple providers.
In this role, mediarithmics acts as a Data Processor under the GDPR.




Why do we offer this service? 



The need to match a device on different websites
Reconciling device identifiers from multiple providers is a prerequisite to:

Allow clients that own several brands to reconcile the browsing history of their end-users on their multiple website domains / applications 
Operate targeted campaigns on third party websites or applications



Device identification
Assuming that the necessary consents have been given by the end-user, there are two ways to identify a device: 

In the case of mobile applications: through the advertising identifier of the device (Â« IDFA Â» for iOS-based systems, Â« AAID Â» for Android-based systems).

In the case of websites: through an identifier embedded in a cookie.




In the first case, the advertising identifier can be accessed within any application on the device, with a unique value: it is therefore possible to reconcile a given device from an application to another and exchange information between providers (e.g.
between an application selling advertisement inventory and advertisers buying this inventory).


In the second case, the advertising identifier is embedded in a cookie, stored in a web browser.
This cookie may only be read by the website that wrote it: this website can be the one you are browsing (in this case it will be a Â« first-party Â» cookie) or a third-party website (in this case, a Â« third-party Â» cookie).

Therefore, in order to reconcile a device browsing two different websites or in order to exchange information between providers, third-party cookies with third-party identifiers must be used.


mediarithmics ensures a matching of third-party identifiers for a given device and offers it as a service, allowing to reconcile a device browsing websites on different domains and expose it to targeted ads.




Service usage principles



This service is offered to each of our Clients.
Through the use of our generic scripts to collect website browsing activity, our Clients can enrich the service database and use it to identify a known web browser from one site to another.


To remain consistent with our software editor role, we do not sell this data.
The access to this service is included in our contracts for the marketing software solutions.




Description of the service 



Purpose


Match third-party cookie identifiers for a given web browser to reconcile its browsing activity on various websites and retarget it afterwards.


Operation of the service 



Collection and matching

When our tracking scripts are loaded on web pages, they call the websites of our partners to get the identifiers they gave to the web browser.
If the identifiers are known, the device browsing activity will be linked to an existing device.
If not, the identifiers will be stored by the service for future use.



Transmission to third party providers

When our Clients share audiences (lists of users) with third-party providers, they may use this service to send identifiers that are already known by the provider.



Processed data


In the scope of this service, we only process cookie identifiers, considered as pseudonymous personal data.
The third-party providers for which we operate this matching service include: Google DoubleClick, AppNexus, SmartAdServer, BidSwitch.



Consent



The collection and processing of your personal data in the scope of this service can only be operated under your consent.

We ask our Clients to obtain the consent of their users, on the web sites on which they collect data, and in compliance with the regulation.


At any time, you can give or take back your consent.
