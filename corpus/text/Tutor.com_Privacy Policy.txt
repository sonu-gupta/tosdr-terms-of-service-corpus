The Princeton Review and Tutor.com Privacy Policy 
Effective Date: December 3, 2020 
Tutor.com, Inc.
and TPR Education, LLC d/b/a The Princeton Review (collectively, "we," "us," or "our") take your privacy seriously and understand the importance of protecting your personal information.
Therefore, this Privacy Policy provides information about our privacy practices.

Availability of Anonymous Access

Many of our online, on-demand tutoring programs, such as those provided through libraries, schools, government, or employers of students' parents, can be accessed by you in one of two different ways: anonymously or with a personalized account.
If you access the program anonymously, we do not collect personal information such as your name or email address needed from you to create a personalized account.
The benefit to a personalized account is to make available certain features of the service like:

Making your sessions personal;
Storing all of your past sessions, so you can review them anytime.
and
Access to our mobile application. 


Children under the Age of 13

You use our program anonymously and do not have access to some features that come with a personalized account.
If you have used an email address to create an individual account, it is only stored in our system as an un-recognizable âhashâ of letters and numbers, using an irreversible encryption algorithm.
Therefore, you will not receive email communication of any kind from us.
