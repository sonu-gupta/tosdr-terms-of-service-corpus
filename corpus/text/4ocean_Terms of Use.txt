TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, 4OCEAN, ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON INFRINGMENT, IN CONNECTION WITH THE WEBSITE AND YOUR USE THEREOF.
THE WEBSITE AND THE WEBSITE MATERIAL ARE PROVIDED BY 4OCEAN ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS, UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN WRITING.
4OCEAN MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS ABOUT THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE WEBSITE MATERIAL OR THE CONTENT OF ANY SITES LINKED TO THE WEBSITE AND ASSUMES NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY (I) ERRORS, MISTAKES, OR INACCURACIES OF MATERIAL ON THE WEBSITE, (II) PERSONAL INJURY (EXCEPT AS MAY OTHERWISE BE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN SECTION M ABOVE) OR PROPERTY DAMAGE, OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER, RESULTING FROM YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE WEBSITE, (III) ANY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR USE OF OUR SERVERS, (IV) ANY INTERRUPTION OR CESSATION OF TRANSMISSION TO OR FROM OUR WEBSITE, (IV) ANY BUGS, VIRUSES, TROJAN HORSES, OR THE LIKE WHICH MAY BE TRANSMITTED TO OR THROUGH THE WEBSITE BY ANY THIRD PARTY, AND/OR (V) ANY ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN ANY WEBSITE MATERIAL.

Assignment 

The terms of this Use Policy, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by 4ocean without restriction.

Q.
Jurisdiction and Disputes 


Any dispute or claim arising from or relating in any way to your use of the Website, or to any products or services sold or distributed by 4ocean or through the Website will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify.
The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this Use Policy.
There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.
However, an arbitrator can award, on an individual basis, the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must interpret and apply the terms of this Use Policy just as a court would.
We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.
If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial.
We also both agree that You or we may bring suit in court to seek injunctive relief for infringement or other threatened or actual violation of intellectual property rights.
To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent 4ocean Public Benefit Corporation, Attention: Alex J.
Schulze, Registered Agent, 3600 FAU Boulevard, Boca Raton, FL 33431.
The arbitration will be conducted by and under the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA), including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes.
The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules.
You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in Boca Raton, Florida, or at another mutually agreed location.

Disclaimer:

The ratio of one product to one pound of trash removed is an approximation based on total revenues of the bracelets and total trash removed from the ocean by 4ocean within 12 months of the period of time that the bracelet was sold.
Some of the trash that has been allocated to the 4ocean one pound per bracelet pledge throughout this website may not have been removed straight from the ocean but from a coastline and is considered ocean-bound trash.
4ocean defines the term "Trash" as any man made material that does not belong in the ocean and is damaging to the environment. 

Net Profit: The Net Profit for temporary campaigns will be calculated as: The total sales accrued from the particular bracelet subtracted from the Cost of Goods Sold, the operating expenses from the period of time that the bracelet was for sale, and the operating/marketing expenses that were incurred specific to the bracelet campaign.
