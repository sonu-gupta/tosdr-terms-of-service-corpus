Offering and Availability of our Services
Our services. We offer systems that enable you to pay parking fees (our â
parking payment systems
â) and other services related to parking and vehicle use (the â
related services
â).
Our parking payment systems allow you to settle parking fees for specific on-street or off-street locations without the need to use cash.
You register a parking action with our parking payment systems using the available methods and you will pay your parking fees through us on a deferred monthly basis.
We will (periodically) charge you for your parking fees and any related service ordered by you.
For more details on the specific services we provide, please review https://parkmobile.nl/zo-werkt-het/.

Availability. You acknowledge that the use and availability of our parking payment systems is highly dependent on the operation of â for example â your mobile device, the internet, your GPS receiver and other resources you can use to access our services.
If you are unable to access and use our parking payment systems, for any reason, you are required to use alternative payment methods to pay for parking or there may be a risk that you could be liable for additional parking fees and parking tickets.
If your parking action has already started, you or the administrator of your account can manage the parking action by text messaging/SMS, interactive voice recognition (IVR) or here: https://parkmobile.nl/.
In case of any difficulties, please contact our helpdesk: (0900-6665666, local rate).
For the avoidance of doubt, we cannot ensure availability of our parking payment systems and related services.
Neither can we ensure availability of a parking space.

Partners. Our parking payment systems and related services may be used in combination with services offered by our partners.
Our partners will have their own terms of service and you will be required to accept their terms of service before use.
We are not responsible nor liable for the services offered by such operators and partners.2.
Access
Access. You can access our parking payment systems and related services via one of the tools made available to you, including the https://parkmobile.nl web page, text messaging/SMS, interactive voice recognition (IVR) by telephone and mobile/in-car applications.
A description of our tools, including instructions how to use them, can be reviewed here (https://parkmobile.nl/zo-werkt-het).
Our tools are under continuous development and may be updated from time-to-time or discontinued.
You must follow the tool instructions at all times and keep your tool up-to-date.

Registration. Access to our tools can be limited to registered accounts and such registration is subject to our approval.
You are responsible for keeping your account information confidential and should not share your account information with anyone.
A registered account is for your personal use only.
You need to identify and authenticate yourself by entering your user name or mobile phone number in combination with a password or PIN, or by using touch ID, whatever is applicable, before you can start using our services and perform parking actions and related payments through your registered account.
Please take note of the following: You are responsible for providing us with correct account, registration and access details, which should be kept up-to-date continuously by you.

Materials. If applicable, we may provide you with an access token or a sticker for parking enforcement purposes or for access to certain parking locations.
You are required to follow instructions for using the materials, as may be provided by us or the controller of a parking location.
More information can be found here: https://parkmobile.nl.
Please take note of the following: the registrant of the account is responsible and liable for all parking actions initiated with the account, also if the registrant authorised, permitted or otherwise made the account available for someone else to use.3.
Use of Our Parking payment systems
Parking rule compliance. You must observe and comply with (local) traffic and parking regulations and follow instructions from the (local) authorities, and off-street parking vendors at all times.

Parking locations. You can use our parking payment systems to pay for parking at the parking spaces and areas indicated by us on the following website: https://parkmobile.nl/locaties/.
You cannot use our parking payment systems to pay for parking outside these locations.
The parking locations may change from time-to-time.
We are not responsible nor liable for loss or damage to your vehicle or other properties while using the parking locations.

Parking actions. You can pay for parking at one of the parking locations by successfully registering your parking action with our parking payment systems.
You can use one of the methods available in our tools to complete such registration, such as: start/stop, prepay of a specific duration or capture of vehicle movements by means of in/out methods.
Successful registration requires confirmation of your parking action by our parking payment systems. Please take note of the following: Additional instructions on how to register your parking action may be provided on-site at the parking location.
You are required to follow the instructions at all times.

Parking action details. You are responsible for providing all of the necessary and correct details for your parking action.
Your parking action will be automatically processed on our parking payment systems on the basis of these details.
The details you provide about your parking action are key for us to correctly process your parking fees.
You alone are responsible for providing us with the correct details for your parking action and you will be responsible for paying any penalty charge or parking fee issued as a result of incorrect parking action details.
Please take note of the following: We are not responsible for verifying whether your parking action details are correct.
We emphasize that you must read the instructions before you start using our parking payment systems, as incorrect use might lead to penalty charges, incorrect payments or other consequences.

Reminders. If you choose to make use of reminders as part of our parking payment systems, we will automatically send you a notification to remind you of an ongoing parking action.
The time period for such messages is of your choice.
You may also choose to receive confirmation messages when your parking session is due to end.
We emphasize that your parking action still remains your responsibility.
You acknowledge that receipt of the reminder depends on the availability of your network and can be interrupted/delayed.
Any additional costs relating to these reminders will be charged simultaneously with all other charges.4.
Payment and Processing
Parking fees. The parking fees are set by the respective controller of the parking location.
We have no control over the amount of these parking fees, which may change from time-to-time.
You should not use our parking payment systems if you are eligible for certain parking fee arrangements or discounts offered by the parking location controller as these will not always be available in our parking payment systems.

Our fees. In addition to the relevant parking fees we will charge you our fees depending on your selection and use of our parking payment systems and the related services.
Our fees may consist of a registration fee, a parking payment fee and/or a monthly subscription fee, a fee for related services and other fees applicable to our services, which we may change from time-to-time.
For more details on the specific services and the applicable fees, please consult https://parkmobile.nl/tarieven/.

Payment method. You must select the payment method of your preference from the options we make available to you in our parking payment systems.
A full description of the available payment methods can be reviewed here https://parkmobile.nl/tarieven/.
When using our services, you accept that we automatically collect your parking fees and our fees, and that your payments may be processed by a third party payment processor.
You acknowledge that certain use of our parking payment systems requires a specific payment method, such as a payment through your telephone provider or payment card.

Payment. Depending on your selection and use of our parking payment systems and the related services, we will directly or periodically charge the parking fees and our fees, while using the payment method you have chosen.
We are responsible for the correct execution of the payments and you are responsible for having adequate funds available to cover our fees.

You will be charged the statutory interest rate as from the date you are in default on your payment obligation.

Refunds. We are under no obligation to provide a refund or cancel parking actions submitted to our parking payment systems, unless there is a system error on our part.
