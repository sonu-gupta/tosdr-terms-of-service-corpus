Our Privacy Commitment
PokÃ©mon respects your privacy rights and recognizes the
importance of protecting your personal information (or âpersonal dataâ).
Our
Privacy Notice describes the kinds of personal information we collect, why we
collect it, how we share it, and choices we give you.
We also recognize the need to provide additional protections
for kids who visit and/or use our Services.
To learn about privacy protections
for kids, read PokÃ©mon's Kids' Privacy Notice.
PokÃ©mon is a valid licensee, and participating member in
good standing, of the Children's Advertising Review Unit's (âCARUâ) COPPA Safe

CARU conducts independent audits of our
Services and uses other enforcement and accountability mechanisms in its

established online information collection, use, and disclosure practices in
compliance with applicable privacy laws and best practices.

DISCLAIMER: Although CARU does not monitor non-U.S.
based
Services or PokemonCenter.com, PokÃ©mon takes steps to confirm that non-U.S.

guidance and principles of CARU Safe Harbor, including adherence to regulations
in the European Union (âEUâ) and other territories outside of the United States
(âU.S.â).

What does this Privacy Notice cover?

Our Privacy Notice applies to the collection and processing

personal information for their own purposes.
Where they do so, their respective

requests, for legal compliance and enforcement purposes, and for resolving

Product-specific data processing details

The following are product-specific details to supplement the information in this Privacy Notice.


Play! PokÃ©mon


If you participate in the Play! PokÃ©mon tournament ratings
and rankings portion of our websites, we will use personal information about
you to track your tournament results, player ranking, rating, and player status
(e.g., active, terminated, winner, etc.).
Except for those jurisdictions where
privacy law specifies a different age, (a) if you are 13 or older, we will post
your full name or first name and last initial (as you direct us), as well as
your state and country/region with your player ranking.
and (b) if you are
under 13, your parent or guardian can choose to post your screen name, full
name, or first name and last initial in the player rankings.
If you choose not
to create a PokÃ©mon Trainer Club account after participating in Play! PokÃ©mon
events, we will retain your first name, first initial of last name, date of
birth, and any championship points earned for participating in any event where
this information alone cannot identify you and is not considered personal
information.
Also, if you participate in the Play! PokÃ©mon tournament
ratings and rankings portion of our websites, we will share your personal
information with independent third parties (such as League Leaders and
Tournament Organizers) who run Play! PokÃ©mon events that you may participate
in.
In most cases, these are independent third parties and not PokÃ©mon
employees.
If you've signed up to play our products or participate in
competitions and provide us with non-PokÃ©mon account information (e.g., a
Nintendo Account) where that function is available, we will receive your date
of birth and account ID from the other account operator.
If participating in
competitions to be awarded Play! PokÃ©mon championship points, the date of birth
from your non-PokÃ©mon account will be verified against your PokÃ©mon Trainer
Club (âPTCâ) Account, and information about whether there was a match or not, and
your PTC ID will be shared with the other account operator.


PokÃ©mon Apps


PokÃ©mon will keep your personal information within a PokÃ©mon
app for as long as you keep the app on your device.
If you create an account,
the app sends your personal information to our servers.
We keep your data for
as long as you maintain an account and for 90 days after you disable the
account, in case you choose to reactivate the account or in case the request to
disable the account was in error.
Certain apps may give you the option to
receive push notifications.
You can turn push notifications on or off through
settings within the app or your device.
You may disable our access to your
precise geolocation data through settings in your device.


PokemonCenter.com


If you provide information to create an account or as part
of a transaction, payment, or other account action, PokÃ©mon may deliver marketing
communications to you about similar goods or services if you have not opted out
of such marketing when given the chance to do so.
We may also use third
parties, such as Authorize.net and PayPal, to process payment transactions and
facilitate fraud protection.
PayPal and other third-party entities may use your
information for their own purposes, including to service accounts you have with
them and for fraud prevention.
Please review their respective privacy notices
to understand how they use your information.
PokemonCenter.com's services are
intended for customers in the United States and Canada.

A right to object to the processing of your personal data or obtain a restriction of such processing under certain circumstances.


A right to have your personal data transferred to another organization should it be technically feasible for PokÃ©mon to do so.

To make such requests, contact us at privacyquestions@pokemon.com or https://support.pokemon.com/hc/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000012406.

request through your existing account and/or by providing a form of
governmental identification through our customer service portal, where, if
feasible, we may match your identification information with personal
information we have about you, depending on the type of request made and
verification measures proportional to the risk of the personal information
involved with the request(s).

verify your identity to the degree of certainty required by law for certain
pieces of personal information, for example: unique identifiers such as cookie
IDs, device ID, and IP address (where that information is not held by us in
connection with directly identifiable information).
There may be exceptions to
these rights in certain circumstances, and where you cannot exercise a right
due to an exception, PokÃ©mon will provide that information.

in response to a legal obligation or legal process.
Such obligations may
include lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national
security and law enforcement requirements.

to comply with a legal obligation or legal process, we will take reasonable steps
to ensure that we disclose only the minimum personal data necessary for the
specific purpose and circumstances to comply with legal obligations or valid
legal processes such as search warrants, subpoenas, or court orders.

do, transfer your personal data we use a variety of legal mechanisms, including
contracts and standard contractual clauses / model clauses, so that your rights
and protections travel with your data.

has been ruled invalid as a legal basis for data transfers to the U.S., we
continue to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to all
personal information transferred from the European Union, the United Kingdom,
and/or Switzerland to the United States in reliance on the Privacy Shield.
If
there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Notice and the Privacy
Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.

We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers
of the U.S.
Federal Trade Commission.
If third-party agents process personal
data on our behalf in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles,
we remain liable unless we prove we are not responsible for the event giving
rise to any damages.

United Kingdom, or Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our
adherence to Privacy Shield Principles should first contact us at privacyquestions@pokemon.com, or

Supplemental Kids' Privacy Notice

Last updated May 25, 2018
Effective May 1, 2019

OUR ADDITIONAL PRIVACY COMMITMENT TO KIDS AND THEIR PARENTS

PokÃ©mon has developed its Services with the goal of creating
an enjoyable experience for all users.
Building on our general Privacy Notice,
we recognize the need to provide additional privacy protections when kids visit
the Services on which this Kids' Privacy Notice is posted.
This Kids' Privacy
Notice is designed to answer your questions regarding our privacy policies and
principles with respect to kids.
As used in this Notice, âchildrenâ, âchildâ,
and âkid(s)â refer to children under the age of 13, except for those
jurisdictions where the privacy law specifies a different age.
Also, when we
use the term âparentâ, we include legal guardians.
TABLE OF CONTENTS


What types of information do we collect about kids?


How do we use and share the personal information that we collect from kids?


How do we notify and obtain consent from parents for the collection of personal information from their kids?


How can parents access, change, or delete personal information about their kids?


How will we notify parents if our Kids' Privacy Notice changes?


CARU's COPPA Safe Harbor Program



1.
What types of information do we collect about kids?

Our guests can use some of our Services, view content, and
enjoy many features without registering for an account or our collection of any
personal information subject to COPPA.
If a user has indicated that they are a kid when trying to
create a PokÃ©mon account, we will collect a parent's email address and obtain
verifiable parental consent before allowing the kid to provide any additional
personal information.
See below to learn how we seek parental consent.
Once we obtain parental consent, a kid can use our services
much like any other user.
And we may collect from the kid the same types of
personal information, and use and share that information for the same purposes,
as described in the general Privacy Notice with the exception that PokÃ©mon does
not, nor does it allow third parties to, collect kids' personal data (including
persistent identifiers) for behavioral advertising, amassing a profile, or any purpose
other than to support its internal operations unless we have obtained explicit
prior parental consent.
We receive information from our guests directly and from
third parties such as Play! PokÃ©mon Tournament Organizers.
We collect personal
information from parents on behalf of their kids to create an account for
PokÃ©mon's Services.
PokÃ©mon does not condition participation in any of its
Services for kids on the collection of more personal information than is
reasonably necessary.

2.
How do we use and share the personal information that we collect from kids?

As noted above, once we obtain parental consent, a kid can
use our Services much like any other user.
And we may collect from the kid the
same types of personal information, and use and share that information for the
same purposes, as described in the general Privacy Notice, unless otherwise
specified in this Supplemental Kids' Privacy Notice.
For example, once a parent
has provided consent to create an account, a kid can:


Link an account from one of PokÃ©mon's Services with an account from another Service operated by PokÃ©mon or an affiliate of PokÃ©mon


Participate in games, reward programs, contests, sweepstakes, events, or promotions


Send us questions or correspond with us via email or our customer support portal concerning the Services or the kid's participation in organized events


Participate in polls, surveys, or questionnaires


Use our Email-a-Friend feature and participate in âcanned chat,â where a kid can select words from a list prepared by PokÃ©mon to send messages to other website users


Enable push notifications (you can turn push notification on or off by modifying the settings within the applicable Service, or within your device's settings)


Note that some Services may enable a
kid to publicly disclose personal information and/or communicate with other users.
We do not have control over third parties (e.g., other users) who may have
copied or reposted publicly posted information.
Until we receive verifiable parental consent, the parent's
contact information gathered from a kid is used only to obtain the parent's
consent for our information collection practices.
With parental consent, we may also use a kid's contact
information to send the kid emails and messages with promotional information
about new products and features, special offers, contests, and sweepstakes, as
well as other interesting information concerning new products, events, and
updates about PokÃ©mon.
Parents can always choose whether their kid may receive
these promotional messages by visiting their account profile settings or
contacting us.
If a kid wins a prize from a sweepstakes, contest, or other
promotional event, we will notify the parent at the parent's email address and
request that the parent provide their postal address for the purpose of
delivering the prize.
With the appropriate consent, we may publish a winner's
first name, city, state of residence, and country/region.
PokÃ©mon shares kids' personal information with the same
entities and for the same purposes described in the general Privacy Notice.
Also, if a parent chooses to allow a kid to participate in
the Play! PokÃ©mon tournament ratings and rankings portion of our websites, we
will use personal information about the kid to track the kid's tournament
results, player ranking, rating, player status (e.g., active, terminated,
winner, etc.).
A parent can choose to post a kid's screen name, full name, or
first name and last initial in the player rankings.
We will also share the
kid's personal information with independent third parties (such as League
Leaders and Tournament Organizers) so they can run offline Play! PokÃ©mon events
that the kid may participate in.
If a parent doesn't want their kid's personal
information shared with independent third parties who run Play! PokÃ©mon events,
then they should not allow their kid to participate in the Play! PokÃ©mon
tournament ratings and rankings portion of our websites.

3.
How do we notify and obtain consent from parents for the collection of personal information from their kids?

When a kid seeks to register with our Services, we will
email their parent.
This email notifies the parent that their kid wishes to
register, and it asks the parent to create an account to grant consent for
their kid to register.
If the parent ignores or refuses to register their kid,
we will delete the kid and parent's contact information within 14 days of such
notice.
If the parent permits the registration, we will grant the kid access to
the features described in the email and this Privacy Notice.
To help verify that the parent is the person providing
consent, PokÃ©mon (in the US in conjunction with Veratad, a leading age and
identity verification company) asks for the sum of the first and last digit of
the parent's Social Security number, as well as other pieces of information to
verify the parent's identity, such as name, birth date, and physical address.
Note that PokÃ©mon does NOT store this information anywhere in our records.
Parents can revoke consent at any time by contacting our
customer service department and submitting a request on the https://support.pokemon.com/hc/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000012406 website or emailing privacyquestions@pokemon.com.

4.
How can parents access, change, or delete personal information about their kids?

At any time, a parent can log into their PokÃ©mon Trainer
Club account to access their âEdit Profileâ section or contact our customer
service department to access or change the personal information in their kid's
account.
A parent may delete the personal information that we have
collected from their kid by submitting a request on the https://support.pokemon.com/hc/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000012406
website or emailing privacyquestions@pokemon.com.
The parent should include their kid's username and the parent's email address
in the email so that we can better assist with the inquiry or request.
