Privacy.
ETNT! LLC (hereinafter "Company", "us", "our", "we") recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of all users who visit the website located at www.eatthis.com (the "Information Site"), and its affiliate website, www.shop.eatthisnotthat.com (the "Shopping Site, and together with the Information Site, the "Sites").
All "Personal Information" that you give to us will be protected and kept confidential among Company and its affiliated companies in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Privacy Policy.
When we use the term "Personal Information," we mean any information that can be used to personally identify or contact a specific individual, such as a name, address(es) (e.g., home, shipping, billing address etc.), telephone number or email address.
Our Privacy Policy applies only to such Personal Information as is collected by us via the Sites and does not extend to any other website, whether or not it is affiliated or linked to the Sites or to Company.
Company reserves the right to change our Privacy Policy at any time.
Each time you use the Sites, you are accepting and consenting to the practices described in this Privacy Policy and in the Terms and Conditions, the current version of our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions will apply, and you should review our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions for any changes that may have been made since your last visit to the Sites.
All capitalized terms used in our Privacy Policy that are defined in the Terms and Conditions and not otherwise defined herein shall have the same respective meanings given to them in the Terms and Conditions.

Personal information may be collected about you ("Personal Information") when you voluntarily register with the Shopping Site, subscribe to the newsletter with the Information Site, or contact the Company via the Site in order to purchase products or to receive newsletters from us with information regarding, without limitation, new product launches and/or special events or notifying you of other Company promotions ("Promotional Material"), or when you otherwise voluntarily provide Personal Information when you use or visit the Sites.
Company may use the Personal Information you provide for various purposes, such as to create a personal customer profile in order to let you know of products, services or events that may be of interest to you.
However, Company will neither disclose nor sell any Personal Information about you to a party unaffiliated or unrelated to Company except (i) to comply with applicable laws, regulations, subpoenas or court orders or otherwise respond to government inquiries, (ii) protect the rights or property of Company or its affiliated or related entities or (iii) if Company reasonably believes that you have used information from the Sites in order to commit unlawful acts or acts that may endanger the health and/or safety of any person or the public.
Company may appoint third-party service providers to administer and/or operate certain functions or services relating to the Sites or Company's operations and businesses, the performance of which may require or be facilitated by a transfer of the Personal Information submitted by you.
Any such transfer shall be under strict confidentiality and security obligations and for the sole purpose of the performance of those obligations.
Additional Privacy Protection for Children Using the Internet.

If we learn that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to any of the Sites, we will promptly remove such information from the Sites' files.

The types of aggregate information we may collect may include frequency of visits to the Sites, products purchased, search terms entered, Site pages most frequently accessed and/or location, age or gender of Users and/or Members and other commercial information (collectively, "Aggregate Information").
By knowing more about the general profile of our Users and/or Members (without identifying any specific individual's characteristics), we believe we can improve your experience on our Sites.
Aggregate Information collected on the Sites may be used and disclosed in any way.
For example, we may collect and analyze collected Aggregate Information to determine how many visitors arrived at certain pages of the Sites, how long they stayed on those pages, and where they went afterwards.
This information allows us to determine which pages might be the most interesting to our visitors and enables us to provide them with a better and richer experience on the Sites.
Additionally, we may use Aggregate Information to improve the performance of our Sites, and to customize the content and layout of our Sites pages for you.
