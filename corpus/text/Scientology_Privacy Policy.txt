WHO IS THE CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY?

The Church of Scientology (âthe Churchâ) is formed into an ecclesiastical structure which unifies and aligns a multitude of diverse religious activities.
Spanning all entities belonging to the ecclesiastical structure is a system of international ecclesiastical management from Church of Scientology International through a series of Continental Liaison Offices responsible for geographic zones.
This management structure supports, coordinates and works to ensure that the spiritual philosophy and technologies of Dianetics and Scientology are available to anyone who wishes to receive them and that Scientology services and practices are applied precisely as L. Ron Hubbard (âLRHâ), the founder of the Scientology religion, set forth. 
Further, and to realize Scientologyâs greater humanitarian objectives, the Church supports a series of social betterment campaigns in the fields of morality (The Way to Happiness), drug prevention (Narconon), rehabilitation (Criminon) and literacy (Applied Scholastics), or humanitarian programs in the domains of mental health (Citizens Commission on Human Rights), universal human rights (United for Human Rights) and disaster response (Volunteer Ministers).
Social betterment campaigns are coordinated by the Association for Better Living and Education (ABLE).
The IAS (International Association of Scientologists) is the official membership organization of Scientology.
Its purpose is to unite, advance, support and protect the Scientology religion and Scientologists in all parts of the world.
Thanks to the support of its members, the IAS provides grants to sponsor the humanitarian and social betterment programs supported by the Church.

or
target our promotional information (such as a marketing company).
or
process your order (such as a transport company to deliver you the materials).
or
process your payment (such as a payment service provider or a credit checking agency).

These third parties are only allowed to process your personal data on our behalf and upon our written instruction.
We also warrant that all those third parties are selected with due care and are committed to observing the safety and integrity of your personal data.

Your personal data may be shared between national, regional or local affiliated organizations of the Church of Scientology, such as local Churches, missions and social betterment and humanitarian programs (ABLE â if you require more information about the personal data that ABLE processes, you are kindly requested to consult its privacy policy: www.able.org/online-privacy-policy.html.

However, we will ensure that all Scientology organizations will take due care that all processing of your personal data is in line with what is set out in this Privacy Policy.
Your personal data will also be processed by the CSEU, Fabriksparken 15, 2600 Glostrup, Denmark, our main European establishment managing the Scientology Churches and missions in Europe.

We process your personal data both within and outside the European Economic Area (EEA), including in the USA.
In order to process your personal data for the purposes outlined above, we may also transfer your personal data to third parties who process on our behalf outside the EEA.
Each entity outside the EEA that processes your personal data will be bound to observe adequate safeguards with regard to the processing of your personal data.
For CSI, such safeguards result from the fact that we are directly bound by compliance with EU legislation in the context of personal data protection.
For third parties, such safeguards may be the consequence of: 
The recipient country having legislation in place which may be considered equivalent to the protection offered within the EEA.
or
A contractual arrangement between us and that entity.
or

We will deâidentify your personal data when they are no longer necessary for the purposes outlined above, unless there is: 
An overriding interest of CSI, or any other third party, in keeping your personal data identifiable.
or
A legal or regulatory obligation or a judicial or administrative order that prevents us from deâidentifying them.



If you fill out a Three Mailings Form, your personal data provided on the Three Mailings Form will only be retained until one year after the third mailing was sent unless you notify us that you object to such processing, except as otherwise permitted or required by a legal or regulatory obligation or a judicial or administrative order.
If during this retention period you fill out another Three Mailings Form, your personal data provided on the Three Mailings Form you filled out second will only be retained as long as your personal data provided on the Three Mailings Form you filled out first is retained.
If during this retention period, you enroll for a Church service or sign up to volunteer in a social betterment and humanitarian program, the personal data you provided in the context of your purchase will become part of your personal record for such Church service or program, and we may use it for the purpose of your participation therein consistent with our related privacy policies.
You understand that an essential aspect of our marketing efforts pertains to making our marketing materials more relevant to you.
We do this by customizing your unique profile based on relevant characteristics as outlined in Article 6 of this Privacy Policy and then use this profile to provide you with communications, promotions, offerings, newsletters and other promotional information about materials and services that may interest you.
We will take appropriate technical and organizational measures to keep your personal data safe from unauthorized access or theft as well as accidental loss tampering or destruction.

More specifically, you have the right to request access to all personal data processed by us pertaining to you, meaning that you have the right to ask us for a copy of your personal data.

Each request must specify which data categories you wish access to and for what processing activities.
You have the right to rectification, i.e. to ask that any personal data pertaining to you that are inaccurate, are corrected free of charge.
If you submit a request for correction, your request needs to be accompanied of proof of the flawed nature of the data for which correction is asked.
You have the right to withdraw your earlier given consent for processing of your personal data.

However, you need to keep in mind that a request for deletion will be evaluated by us against: 
Our and a third partiesâ interests which may override your interests.
or
Legal or regulatory obligations or administrative or judicial orders which may contradict such deletion.


You have the right to restriction instead of deletion, i.e. to request that we limit the processing of your personal data if: 
We are verifying the accuracy of your personal data.
or
The processing is unlawful and you oppose the deletion of your personal data.
or
You require your personal data to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim, while we do no longer need your personal data for the purposes listed above.
or
We are verifying whether our legitimate interests override your interests if you exercise your right to object (see below).


You have the right to object to the processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes and, in addition, if: 
There are justified reasons connected with your particular situation that warrant such objection.
and
The processing is based on our legitimate interest and our legitimate interests do not override your interests.


You have the right to data portability, i.e. to receive from us in a structured, commonly-used and machine-readable format all personal data you have provided to us if the processing is based on your consent or a contract with you and the processing is carried out by automated means.
If you wish to submit a request to exercise one or more of the rights listed above, you can contact our Data Protection Officer by sending an eâmail to dpo@scientology.net.
An eâmail requesting to exercise a right will not be construed as consent with the processing of your personal data beyond what is required for handling your request.
Such request should meet the following conditions: 
State clearly which right you wish to exercise.
and
State clearly the reasons for exercising your right if such is required.
and
Your request should be dated and signed.
and
Your request should be accompanied by a digitally scanned copy of your valid identity card proving your identity.

If the request meets the conditions above and proves valid, we will honor it as soon as reasonably possible and at the latest thirty (30) days after having received your request.
If you have any complaints regarding the processing of your personal data by us, you may always contact our Data Protection Officer by sending an eâmail to dpo@scientology.net.
