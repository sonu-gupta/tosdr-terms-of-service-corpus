Last Updated: January 29, 2021 Introduction
Welcome to MediaMathâs Privacy Policy (âPolicyâ).
In this Policy, we use the terms âMediaMathâ, âourâ, âusâ and âweâ to refer to MediaMath, Inc.
and our affiliates.
MediaMath is committed to protecting the privacy of individuals (âusersâ, âyouâ, âyourâ) when we process data about them via our proprietary TerminalOneâ¢ platform (the âPlatformâ), when they visit our website at www.mediamath.com (the âWebsiteâ) and when we engage in marketing activities based on contact information they provide to MediaMath through other means described in this Policy.
This Policy is provided in a layered format, so you can click through to the specific sections that may interest you. 1.
Important information and who we are


Purposes of this Policy


This Policy sets out how MediaMath collects and processes personal data, personal information or the equivalent terminology in your jurisdiction (âpersonal dataâ or âpersonal informationâ) about you via the Platform, when you visit the Website, and when we engage in marketing activities based on contact information you provide to MediaMath through other means described in this Policy.
It also sets out our practices regarding our use of such personal data, the steps we take to protect it, the parties to whom we disclose it, and the choices and rights that you have regarding how we collect and process personal data about you.
You should read this Policy carefully so that you are fully aware of how and why we are using your personal data.


Who we are


MediaMath is a global provider of digital advertising media and data management technology.
We provide a technology platform and services which help advertisers do a more effective job of reaching their desired audiences.
This technology delivers greater performance, transparency, and control to advertisers and a better Internet experience to users.
Our Demand-Side Platform enables our clients, including advertisers and advertising agencies, to purchase advertising inventory, including display, video, audio, social, native, digital out-of-home (e.g., billboards or ads you may see in taxis or buses) and mobile ads, from publishers in an automated fashion.
Our Data Management Platform provides our clients with tools to onboard, segment, activate, and understand their data.
When MediaMath processes your personal data as a controller in the context of operating the Platform, the Website and our marketing activities, the controller of your personal data is MediaMath, Inc.
If our clients have contracted with MediaMath GmbH, both MediaMath, Inc.
and MediaMath GmBH are controllers of your personal data.
MediaMath is an active member of the industry associations that govern policies around user privacy in the context of digital advertising, including at the time this Policy was written: the Network Advertising Initiative (âNAIâ).
the Digital Advertising Alliance (âDAAâ), the DAA Canada, and the European Interactive DAA.
the Interactive Advertising Bureau in the US, Europe and various countries around the world.
and the Association of National Advertisers.
MediaMath complies with the âNAI Code of Conductâ, the DAA âSelf-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertisingâ, and their âApplication of Self-Regulatory Principles to the Mobile Environmentâ.
We believe that these programsâ principles help protect user privacy.

Changes to the Policy


From time to time, MediaMath may revise this Policy.
The date of the last update can be found at the top of the Policy, and this policy describes how we have handled personal data in the twelve months prior to the date indicated.
If we make revisions that materially change or affect whether or how we collect or use personal data, we will notify you by email (if, as a user of our Website or recipient of our marketing communications, you have provided us your email address) or by means of a notice on our Website prior to the change becoming effective.
If you would like to stay up-to-date on our most current policies and practices, you should periodically review this Policy.


Personal data pertaining to children


MediaMathâs products and services are not designed to deliver personalized ads to children, the definition of which varies by jurisdiction, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from or about children.
If we are made aware that we have received personal data from or about a child, we will use reasonable efforts to remove that data from our records.


Links, other websites and other third parties


This Policy relates solely to the personal data we collect and process about you in relation to our Platform, our Website, and other interactions you may have with MediaMath that are described in this Policy.
MediaMathâs Website contains links to other sites, and the ads delivered by the Platform may run on a variety of other sites.
Clicking on those links, accessing other sites, or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about you.
MediaMath does not control these third-party sites and is not responsible for the privacy practices of such sites.
You should refer to the privacy statements of such third-party sites to find out how they collect and use your personal data.
Also, as explained below in Section 5, third parties may process personal data from you when you visit the Website.
Such processing is governed by the privacy statements of such third parties. 2.
The personal data collected via the Platform
While MediaMath collects certain categories of personal data in the course of delivering an ad to you via the Platform, we do not intentionally collect directly identifiable data such as your name, home address, phone number, or any government identifiers such as your Social Security Number unless you provide such data in connection with any request that you may choose to make directly to MediaMath.
Instead, MediaMath collects certain personal data related to your computer or device through the use of cookies and other similar technologies, as explained below.
We may assign a unique identifier called a MediaMath ID to your browser, your devices, such as your mobile device, connected television, or over-the-top television devices (âOTT TV Deviceâ), or other screens you may encounter when we serve an ad to it or when you use it to access a clientâs digital properties.
Digital Properties include websites, emails, apps (âDigital Propertiesâ).
The MediaMath ID enables the Platform to determine within a reasonable level of confidence that a browser or devices is the same one with which the Platform has previously interacted.
For example, the MediaMath ID allows us to determine that a browser or device to which we served an ad on Monday is likely to be the same browser or device for which we observed a purchase on Tuesday.
In some cases, based on data we receive from our clients or partners, we are able to infer within a reasonable probability that a particular browser or device should be associated with the same MediaMath ID.
Where we are able to associate more than one browser or device with the same MediaMath ID, we may use this information to deliver targeted ads across multiple browsers or devices.
This is sometimes referred to as cross-device advertising.
The MediaMath ID can be a cookie ID (a unique ID assigned randomly by MediaMath to an unrecognized browser), a mobile advertising ID (a unique ID assigned by the mobile operating system, e.g.
Apple ID for Advertising or Android Advertising ID), or an OTT TV Device Identifier for Advertising (a unique ID assigned by an OTT TV provider, e.g., Roku ID for Advertising)).
Your MediaMath ID is personal data and is associated with other categories of personal data that we collect about you.
These categories include the following:


Bid Request Data and Impression Data: MediaMath receives personal data about you when we have the opportunity to show you an ad on Digital Properties and collects additional data when we deliver an ad.
We refer to this data as Bid Request Data and Impression Data.
The sources of Bid Request and Impression Data are your browser or device and media supply sources, such as publishers (i.e.
organizations who operate Digital Properties) and exchanges or supply-side platforms who display ads on publishersâ Digital Properties.
This includes data that may be considered personal data in your jurisdiction such as your Internet Protocol (âIPâ) address, imprecise location (e.g., country, region, postal or zip code), browser type (e.g., Chrome or Internet Explorer).
operating system (e.g., Mac OS or Windows).
browser language (e.g., English or Spanish).
and Internet Service Provider (e.g., Comcast or Verizon).
It also may include IDs that our partners assign to your browser or device, including Google advertising identifiers associated with your browser or device and used by MediaMath as part of its syncing processes.
See Googleâs Privacy Policy to learn more about its use of the personal data which it receives from partner sites and your ability to control the information which Google collects on these sites.

Pixel Data and Other Client Data: MediaMath clients may import personal data to the Platform regarding your interactions with them when you visit their Digital Properties.
We may similarly collect personal data when you visit our Website.
This includes data that may be considered personal data in your jurisdiction such as the time you visited the site, the page URL, your IP address, your browser type (e.g., Chrome or Internet Explorer), the operating system (e.g., Mac OS or Windows), the type of device you used (e.g.
laptop or desktop), and data regarding your activities on the Digital Properties.
For example, if you are shopping online for a product, place a product in your online shopping cart, or make an online purchase, the client associated with the website or app may use the Platform to collect that personal data and later show you an ad on a different site or app related to that product.
MediaMath clients also may use the Platform to collect hashed personal data that does not reveal your direct identity, such as hashed email addresses.
The process of hashing is commonly used in digital advertising to convert directly identifiable personal data to pseudonymous personal data.
We refer to everything described above as Pixel Data.
Clients also may import personal data that they have obtained outside of the Platform, such as segments that our clients create or obtain independently from third-party sources.
A segment is a grouping of individuals who share one or more attributes (e.g., âcar enthusiastâ).
These individuals are identified by an online identifier in these segments but are not identified by name or other personal data that directly reveals their identity.
Clients also may import personal data that they collect or independently obtain offline, such as personal data regarding a purchase you made in the clientâs store.
The clientâs offline data is first processed by the client or a third party, which removes any directly identifiable personal data, appends a MediaMath ID, and transmits the file to MediaMath for processing.
We refer to this data as Other Client Data.

Third-Party Segment Data and Other Third-Party Data: We work with audience providers who create and provide us with segments for us and our clients to use for advertising purposes.
We refer to this as Third-Party Segment Data.
We also receive personal data from third-party partners that allows them and/or us to associate the MediaMath ID with those partnersâ identifiers (through a process called âcookie syncingâ) as well as personal data that associates your different devices with each other.
Certain third parties may provide personal data to us regarding video content that you view on television.
We refer to this personal data in the Policy as Other Third-Party Data.

Special or Sensitive Categories of Personal Data: We do not knowingly collect any special categories of personal data about individuals in the EEA, including: personal data revealing your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership.
personal data concerning your health, sex life, or sexual orientation.
and genetic or biometric data.
MediaMath also does not knowingly collect any data about other sensitive categories such as personal data about children, financial account numbers, insurance plan numbers, and criminal convictions or offenses.
 3.
How we collect personal data via the Platform
 
The Platform uses various technologies to collect your personal data.


Personal data we collect from your browser or device


Like most digital marketing platforms, MediaMath uses cookies and other technologies to recognize browsers and devices and collect the categories of personal data described above in Section 2 so that we and our clients can infer your interests, deliver more relevant advertising to you, measure the impact of that advertising, and better understand your digital media usage patterns.
The types of technologies used via the Platform that enable us to identify a computer or device, and enable the Platform to function and serve more relevant ads include:


Cookies â Cookies are small text files.
MediaMath uses cookies to uniquely identify an Internet browser.
Certain browsers or browser settings sometimes block cookies or prevent them from working effectively.

Pixels â Pixels are transparent images, iFrames, JavaScript or mobile SDKs that we, our clients, and our partners use to understand how users interact with their Digital Properties.

 


Personal data we collect from third parties


As described above, we receive personal data from third parties such as our clients and partners, including audience data partners, media supply sources, and exchanges or supply-side platforms.
We receive this personal data in a number of ways, including through server-to-server transfers, a process called âcookie syncingâ and other client and partner calls to MediaMath originating from the browser.
We process all of this personal data in the Platform. 4.
How the Platform uses personal data
 
We use the personal data in the Platform to deliver more relevant ads to you on behalf of our clients.
We also use the personal data to improve our Platform and the products and services that we provide to our clients and partners, as well as to create new products and services.

Segments


As described above, a segment is a grouping of users who share one or more attributes.
Where allowed by applicable data protection law and industry self-regulatory associations:

Our clients may use health-related segments about non-sensitive conditions such as an inferred interest in health and wellness or cough medicine and allergy medications.
Click here for a list of the standard health-related segments and a sample of custom health segments provided for use by clients in MediaMathâs Platform.
Our clients may use segments based on political information or interests.
Click here for a list of the standard political interest segments and a sample of custom political segments provided for use by clients in MediaMathâs Platform.

While MediaMath does not knowingly create segments that are based upon what we consider to be sensitive information (for example, we do not create segments of EEA users based on personal data considered to be sensitive in the EEA, such as personal data revealing your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, personal data concerning your health, sex life or sexual orientation, or genetic or biometric data), our clients may use the Platform to process some sensitive data (but excluding sensitive categories in the EEA), which may come from our clientsâ Digital Properties or our partners.
MediaMath may process segments based on demographic information such as race, gender and income range where such is information is not considered sensitive.
We take steps designed to ensure that this is done in compliance with applicable laws and self-regulatory guidelines, including through our contracts and policies with our clients and partners, but our clients are responsible for this processing, and any queries should be directed to them.


Automated decision-making and profiling


The Platform uses proprietary algorithms to make decisions about whether or not to bid on opportunities to serve you ads and, if so, how much to bid.
The ads you see are the result of client campaigns that specify how much to spend and on what basis to spend combined with the use of our algorithms.
The ways in which we use algorithms to determine bid prices may be considered automated decision-making in certain jurisdictions.
Additionally, these processes, in combination with client campaigns described below, may constitute profiling in certain jurisdictions.
As explained above, we assign a MediaMath ID to your browser or device.
Using proprietary technology, we associate data that we collect about you with this MediaMath ID and create segments using inferred details about certain of your preferences, behaviors, and demographic information.
Many of our clientsâ campaigns rely on such segments.
For example, if you are browsing a shoe retailerâs website on your mobile device, we may infer that you are interested in buying sneakers and associate that mobile device with a sneaker-buyer segment.
If a client subsequently wants to advertise sneakers, the client may choose to target that segment across your devices.
If MediaMath then receives an opportunity to show you an ad on your computer browser, which has been associated with your mobile device by our algorithm, MediaMathâs bidding technology will automatically decide whether to bid and if so what price to bid, based on the data and algorithms outlined above.
The automated processes that we use do not affect your legal rights (such as your right to vote, take legal action, or freely associate with others) or your ability to receive social benefits or obtain citizenship, nor do they have legal effects on you.
Also, we do not knowingly process or make automated decisions about EEA users based on any data that falls into special categories in the EEA.
As described below, you have the right to object to this automated decision-making at any time and you may have additional rights described in Section 11.


Legal basis for processing 


Our legal basis under the GDPR for collecting and using the personal data described above will depend on the personal data concerned and the specific context in which we process it.
However, we will normally collect personal data from you only where the processing is in our (or a third partyâs, such as our clientsâ) legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights, such as your right to opt out.
If we collect and use your personal data in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), this interest will normally be to operate the Platform and serve you ads on behalf of our clients.
We may have other legitimate interests and, if appropriate, we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.
If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal data, please contact us using the contact details provided under the âHow to contact usâ heading above.


Sale of personal information


For the purposes of the CCPA, MediaMath has sold all of the categories of personal information collected on the Platform for certain processing purposes in the past twelve months.
If you are a California resident and want to exercise your right to opt out of the sale of your personal information, please see the instructions below in the section Opt out of sale for California residents.


Opt-out and choice mechanisms


Opt out of tailored advertising
If you want to limit the data that MediaMath collects about you and want us to not target ads that are based on your interests to your browsers or devices, you may opt out from MediaMath tracking and tailored advertising at any time through one of the ways described below.
If you opt out, you will still see ads, but those ads are less likely to have anything to do with products or services you care about. With tailored advertising, you receive ads and offers that are more likely to be useful to you.
Your opt-out is only applicable to the Platform and does not opt you out from platforms provided by third-party companies.
However, you can opt out from both MediaMath and many third-party companies at once.
to do so, please see âOther ways to opt out of tailored advertisingâ below.
When you opt out, MediaMath will collect data from your browser, app, or device only as needed to honor your opt-out and for limited research and development purposes to improve our browser- and device-recognition technology, which also helps to improve our ability to honor your opt-out.
When you opt out, MediaMath also stops targeting tailored advertising to the opted-out browser, app, or device.
If you use multiple browsers or devices and wish to limit the data that MediaMath collects and do not wish to receive MediaMath tailored advertising on any of them, you must opt out from each browser and device individually.


Opt out of tailored advertising in a browser


You may opt out if you are using a browser by clicking the âClick here to opt outâ link below.
Please note that if cookies are not enabled in your browser, including if third-party cookies are disabled, or if you use certain ad-blocking tools, our opt-out mechanism may not work properly.
Please also note that deleting your cookies does not opt you out.
If you clear your cookies, or if you use a different browser or device, you will need to renew your opt-out choice.

If MediaMath negotiates to or sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, we may transfer or assign the personal data to a third party as part of any proposed or actual transaction.
We also may publish or otherwise make public anonymous, aggregate, or summary information regarding campaigns run in the Platform on behalf of our clients.
For example, we may publish a report that reflects aggregated statistics regarding seasonal trends in shopping patterns or geographic differences in advertising impression opportunities. 8.
International transfers
 
The information that we collect from you and about you may be transferred to and stored in a country other than your country of residence, such as the United States, which may not offer the same level of protection of personal data as your country of residence.
However, we will take contractual and/or other measures to ensure your personal data is protected.

MediaMath has its headquarters in the United States and many of our partners or vendors are based outside of the EEA, UK and Switzerland.
Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, UK and Switzerland we ensure that it receives a similar degree of protection by entering into the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission (and/or the applicable UK and/or Swiss authority) with our group companies and applicable partners or vendors.
