See the âCollection of Information,â âUse of Information and Purpose of Data Processing,â âDisclosure of Information,â and other relevant sections of this Privacy Policy for more details.

Sleeper does permit third parties to collect the information described above through our Services as described in our Privacy Policy, including, but not limited to, enabling Sleeper to provide advertising based on usersâ online activities over time and across different sites, services, and devices (so-called âinterest-based advertisingâ).

Please see âYour Rights and Choicesâ for information about how to exercise rights to access your personal information or submit a request for deletion of information under certain circumstances.
Once we receive your request, we may verify it by requesting information sufficient to confirm your identity, including by asking you for additional information.
If you would like to use an agent registered with the California Secretary of State to exercise your rights, we may request evidence that you have provided such agent with power of attorney or that the agent otherwise has valid written authority to submit requests to exercise rights on your behalf.
