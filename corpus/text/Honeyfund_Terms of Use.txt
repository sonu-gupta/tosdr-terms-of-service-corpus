Last Updated January 24, 2022 

 
Honeyfundâs mission is to provide its site users with support, community, tools and information to succeed in planning an authentic wedding, taking a fantastic honeymoon and building a successful marriage.
The Honeyfund websites and app exist for the purpose of providing a personal website, crowdfunding page and gift registry to couples.
Any use outside of this purpose is prohibited.

These terms of use apply exclusively to your access and use of Honeyfund.com, and any parts or sections thereof including, but not limited to, web content, member-personalized website or registry information, member profile information, photos, and graphics (herein after referred to collectively as âSiteâ).

If you do not agree with any of these terms, do not access or otherwise use the Site or any information or materials contained on the Site.
Your use of the Site shall be deemed to be your agreement to abide by each of the terms set forth below.

You understand and agree that the Site is provided "AS-IS" and that Honeyfund.com, Inc.
assumes no responsibility for your ability to (or any costs or fees associated with your ability to) obtain access to the Site.
Nor does Honeyfund.com, Inc.
assume any liability for the failure to store or maintain any user communications or personal settings.

Privacy Policy.
Information and data provided by you are subject to our Privacy Policy.
This policy, as updated from time to time, may be found at https://www.honeyfund.com/Privacy.
2.
Payment Services.
Honeyfund.com, Inc.
provides multiple payment services for users to choose from, including links and interfaces to third-party payment services, such as Stripe and PayPal which permit gift givers to send funds to couples (or couple's representative) registered with Honeyfund.com, Inc.
You acknowledge that Honeyfund.com, Inc.
does not control and is not responsible for payments made or received through these third-party services.
Any use of third-party payment services by you will be subject to the fees, terms and conditions of such third-party payment services, and at your own risk.
Please consult the terms for your chosen payment service provider at PayPal Terms, Stripe Terms.
In cases where the third party payment service chosen by you is not available due to incomplete account setup, internet or service outages or any other reason, you acknowledge that Honeyfund.com, Inc.
may collect payment on your behalf in order to facilitate a successful gift transaction for your Honeyfund page visitors.
For users of Honeyfund in the US, Honeyfund offers a bank account payments solution powered by Stripe, a third-party payment processor.
In order for you to use these payment processing services on Honeyfund, you will be registered with Stripe as a merchant and therefore agree to their terms of service.
You also agree to be charged and pay the fee for this service as published on Honeyfund.com and in your Honeyfund account, which is subject to change at any time. You further agree that funds processed to your Stripe merchant account that go unclaimed for a period of 120 days will be moved into a Honeyfund Gift Card account balance and locked for your security.
(See below for more information about the Honeyfund Gift Card balance and how to claim funds.)
The Stripe Terms of Service are available at https://stripe.com/connect-account/legal (United States).
By accepting this agreement with Honeyfund.com, Inc., you agree that you have reviewed the Stripe Terms of Service.
If you have questions regarding the Stripe Terms of Service, please contact Stripe at https://stripe.com/contact.
Honeyfund.com, Inc.
collect payments via its merchant processors (such as Stripe, PayPal, or Braintree) in order to add Honeyfund Gift Card balance funds to Honeyfund accounts that have been configured to receive such types of payments, either because the user registered for gift cards or because they requested to receive all funds in the form of the Honeyfund Gift Card balances.
Further, unclaimed funds processed via the memberâs own Stripe merchant accounts that go unclaimed for a period of 120 days are converted to Honeyfund Gift Card account balance.
See Honeyfund Gift Card Terms of Use for more information about the Honeyfund Gift Card balance and how to claim the funds via Honeyfund eGift Card Partners.
A full list of Honeyfund digital gift card partners can be found here.
Further, Honeyfund.com, Inc.
may collect payment on your behalf in order to facilitate a successful gift transaction for your Honeyfund page visitors.
In these cases, the funds will be available in your Honeyfund Gift Card balance in your Honeyfund account where they can be redeemed for eGift Cards provided by Honeyfund partners, or in your PayPal account in the case of a PayPal outage. 
In some circumstances and in order to reduce transaction fees, Honeyfund.com may collect and pay PayPal fees on behalf of the user.
You acknowledge these fees will automatically be paid to Honeyfund.com from your PayPal account.
Gift givers acknowledge when they are submitting payment directly to the registered couple or couple's representative via a third party payment service such as Stripe, WePay or PayPal, Honeyfund.com, Inc.
cannot be responsible for lost payments, identity theft, fraud or refunds.
