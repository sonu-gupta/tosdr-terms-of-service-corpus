ABOUT USAGE DATA AND TRACKING DATA


Usage Data and Tracking Data Collected by the JW Player Technology.
The JW Player Technology collects Usage Data and Tracking Data from a User when he or she views video on a Customer Property.
As used in our discussion about the JW Player Technology in this Section B:
âUsage Dataâ is the information that a Userâs browser automatically sends to JW Playerâs servers when a User accesses video or sees an ad on a Customer Property.
This information includes a Userâs device type, screen resolution, operating system version, and Internet browser type and version.
âTracking Dataâ is the information collected by the JW Player Technology from Users who access videos on a Customer Property, and consists primarily of the following:


Proprietary tracking technologies used by the JW Player Technology for video delivery and performance reporting.
These tracking technologies include the following:

Local ID, which is stored on a Userâs computer to identify a Userâs player on a given Customer Property.
Global ID, which is stored on a Userâs browser and JW Playerâs servers and identifies a User across different players and Customer Properties.
The JW Player Technology does not assign a Global ID to Users whose Internet Protocol (IP) addresses are based in the EEA, Switzerland and the UK.

Viewer ID, which is stored on JW Playerâs servers to identify a User.


Other tracking technologies include pixel tags, web beacons, and scripts, and are used for ad delivery and reporting.


As with other Internet services, our web servers gather information automatically each time a Userâs browser or device interacts with the JW Player Technology, and store that information in âlog files.â The information stored in our web serversâ log files includes Usage Data and Tracking Data.

We will retain those elements of Usage Data and Tracking Data that are Personal Data under the GDPR for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required for the security or integrity of the JW Player Services or JW Player Technology, or to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our legal agreements or policies.



Legal grounds for processing Personal Data on Customer Properties. For Users who access the JW Player Technology from IP addresses in the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK, we process the elements of Usage Data and Tracking Data that are considered Personal Data under the GDPR.
The GDPR makes a distinction between organizations that process Personal Data for their own purposes (known as âdata controllersâ) and organizations that process Personal Data on behalf of other organizations (known as âdata processorsâ).
When we handle Personal Data strictly on behalf of our customers in order to provide our services to them, as is the case with the JW Player Technology, we are a data processor and our customers, as the data controllers, have primary responsibility for your Personal Data and are responsible for obtaining a legal basis to collect such data.
If you have questions about Personal Data that is used primarily by a Customer Property on which the JW Player Technology is embedded or utilized, you should contact those companies with your questions about how they handle your Personal Data.
With that in mind, if you have concerns about JW Player, you may contact our privacy officer, at privacy@jwplayer.com. **Note for California Residents who visit our Customer Properties** Similar to the above, when our technology is employed on a website (or a mobile property or other service), we generally act as a âservice providerâ to the website provider for purposes of the California Consumer Privacy Act â i.e., providing them services to help them display, curate and/or integrate content shown through our player technology.
Thus, if you If you have questions about personal information collected or used by a Customer Property on which the JW Player Technology is embedded or utilized, you should contact the particular website or content provider that you are engaging with.
(If you have questions about information that we collect when you visit our Corporate Website(s), please go to SectionA(1).
