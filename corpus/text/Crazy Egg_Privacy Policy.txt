 Privacy Policy Last Updated: January 16, 2022
This Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices of Crazy Egg, Inc.
(âCrazy Eggâ, âweâ, âusâ, âourâ) on our websites located at the domains crazyegg.com, crazyeggvcr.com, and crazyeggproxy.com, as well as such other websites or mobile applications that we own or operate (individually and collectively, âOur Websiteâ or the âCrazy Egg Websiteâ).

 Scope of this Privacy Policy As further discussed, below, data protection laws, regulations, and directives in certain jurisdictions distinguish between the rights and responsibilities of âController(s)â of personal information or data (âInformationâ), from those who are âProcessor(s)â of such Information or data on the applicable controllersâ behalf.
Crazy Egg is generally the controller of Information that it collects from and about the persons and entities who are visiting Our Website (âCrazy Egg Visitorsâ), and this Privacy Policy applies to Crazy Egg Visitors.
We also provide certain services to commercial persons and entities (each, a âClientâ and collectively, âClientsâ), who, in turn, own and operate their own websites or mobile applications (âClient Site(s)â), and who wish to utilize our code, software and services and reports (the âService(s)â) to analyze how third party visitors to their Client Sites (âClient Site Visitor(s)â) use, interact with, and engage their Client Sites.
The applicable Clients are the Controllers of Information collected from their Client Site Visitors, whether or not such information is accessed, analyzed, or otherwise utilized by or on behalf of the Client via the Service (âClient Visitor Informationâ).
Crazy Egg is not the Controller of such Client Visitor Information.
This Privacy Policy applies to the use of Services by our Clients.
However, this Privacy Policy does not apply to the Client Sites themselves, nor to any Client Visitor Information.
For any questions regarding the privacy, security, or other practices or policies on the Client Sites, please contact the applicable Client.
