Cookies and other electronic technologies.

They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our website.

Analytical/Performance cookies. They allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our website when they are using it.
This helps us to improve the way our website works, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.

Functionality cookies. These are used to recognize you when you return to our website.
This enables us to personalise our content for you, greet you by name and remember your preference (for example, your username)

Targeting cookies. These cookies record your visit to our website, the page you have visited and the links you have followed.
We will use this information to make our website and any advertising displayed on it more relevant to your interest.

Cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us, e.g., your email address, in hashed, non-human readable form.
We and our vendors may also use other Internet technologies, such as Flash technologies, web beacons or pixel tags, and other similar technologies, to deliver or communicate with cookies and track your use of the Services (including to serve you ads when you are on other websites or the Internet when we can access those cookies).
We also may include web beacons in email messages or newsletters to determine whether the message has been opened.
Web beacons allow us to understand the time and date of when a user has opened an email and when he/she has utilized a link within the email to visit a website.

Users wishing to disable web beacons should do so by turning images "off" in their email client (e.g., Outlook, Outlook Express).

We may also capture other data, such as search criteria and results.
In some cases, we will associate this information with a unique Monitor identifier (that cannot be used by itself to identify you) for our internal use, in which case your Monitor identifier will be considered Monitor information and nothing in this Privacy Policy restricts how the Monitor may use this information.
Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can modify your browser setting to decline cookies by visiting the Help portion of your browserâs toolbar.
If you choose to decline cookies, please note that you may not be able to sign in, customize, or use some of the interactive features of the Services.
