Facebook is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement: https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000GnywAAC&status=Active.
With the help of the Facebook pixel, it is possible, on the one hand, for Facebook to classify the visitors to our online offer as a target group, for the display of advertisements (so-called "Facebook ads").
Accordingly, we use the Facebook Pixel to display the Facebook Ads we submit to those Facebook users alone, who have also shown an interest in our online offering or who have certain characteristics (eg interests in certain topics or products, as determined by the websites visited), that we then transmit to Facebook (so-called "Custom Audiences").
With the help of the Facebook pixel, we also want to make sure that our Facebook ads are in line with the potential interest of users and are not annoying.
With the help of the Facebook pixel, we can also understand the effectiveness of the Facebook ads for statistical and market research purposes, by seeing whether users were redirected to our website after clicking on a Facebook ad (so-called "conversion").
The processing of the data by Facebook is part of Facebook's data usage policy.
Accordingly, general guidelines for the presentation of Facebook Ads, in Facebook's Data Use Policy, apply: https://www.facebook.com/policy.php.
For specific information and details about the Facebook Pixel and how it works, visit the help section of Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/business/help/651294705016616.
You may object to tracking via the Facebook pixel and the use of their data to display Facebook ads at any time via the Cookie Settings.
In order to adjust the types of advertisements displayed to you within Facebook, you can access the page set up by Facebook and follow the instructions for the usage-based advertisement settings: https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads
