Last Updated: August 13, 2020Data Privacy at CitizenCitizenâs mission is to keep you safe and informed.

At Citizen (as in sp0n, Inc the company that operates the Citizen mobile app and www.citizen.com), our stance is that we will only use and share your data for the limited purposes described in this privacy policy.
We do not and will not serve advertisements in the app.
Citizen Privacy PracticesOur principles for protecting your data
We record the information we need to provide our services: Informing you of incidents happening around you, and helping you get emergency assistance when youâre in need.  
The personal information we do collect we store for as short a duration as possible.
And, where possible, we store only de-identified or aggregate data that is not tied to you.
We involve as few third-party service providers as possible when touching your data.
The third parties we work with have contracts in place to prohibit reuse or sale of your data.
We generally limit access to your data to a subset of the engineering team.
We have specific systems to control data access, and all access is logged and regularly audited.
We perform a privacy review for all new features.
We take protecting your location data seriously.
We need accurate real-time location data to alert you of any emergencies and to help you get emergency assistance, but we lower the resolution of historical location data where possible.
We test the stability and security of our infrastructure, including annual penetration testing and review of our security systems and their configuration.
We use an information security firm to provide these services under a strict non-disclosure agreement. 
Our services are designed to provide real-time notifications of incidents occurring near you, and to help you get assistance in the case of an emergency.
We can only provide those services in certain areas, so if you are located outside of one of those areas, the services may not work for you.
We only provide our service in the United States, so we apply U.S.
law to our privacy practices.
Public data
Content visible to any other user on the Citizen platform is considered public data (for example, publicly posted comments and videos).
You have control over public data on Citizen tied to your account, and can delete comments and videos you have posted.
Furthermore, you can email support@citizen.com to request to delete your account and coordinated information.
Private data Content not publicly accessible to other users on the platform is considered private data:


Contact information: We use your email address and phone number to set up and validate your user account and to prevent abuse of the platform.&nbsp.
If you subscribe to Citizen Protect, we will also collect your name.

Payment information: We will request your payment card details and billing address if you subscribe to paid features of the app, such as Citizen Protect.

Health information: If you elect to use Citizen Protectâs Watch My Back feature, you may connect your phone or activity-tracking device, such as your Fitbit or Apple Watch, to share your walking pace and heart rate with the family members and friends you choose to watch over you in unsafe situations (your âWatchersâ).&nbsp.

We may record your audio conversations with our agents for quality assurance and legal purposes.

User locations: We use your geolocation data to send you safety notifications for incidents reported near you and, if you sign up for Citizen Protect, to notify your Watchers, your emergency contacts, our agents, and first responders of your whereabouts.
You choose whether to share your location, and can always revoke Citizenâs access to your location data in your device settings, but the app will not properly function if the app canât access location data.

If another Citizen user shares their contacts with us, and you are one of those contacts, we may recommend to you that user and the userâs contacts as friends to connect with on Citizen.
Just as you can provide contact information about other users, they may share your information with us for the same purposes.

Content you capture through Citizen: If you use Citizen to capture a video or other content you wish to make publicly available, we collect and store that content and additional information about the content and device you used (like the metadata associated with the content, unique device identifier, wireless network, etc.).

Cookies: Like many online services, Citizen uses cookies to collect information on its website.
We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to tailor your experience with Citizen, and advertise Citizen on third-party websites and apps.
We also work with Facebook and Google ads integrations.
These integrations allow us to track the efficacy of our own advertising campaigns across the web.
