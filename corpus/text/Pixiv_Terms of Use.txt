When a Creator has Accepted a Request from a Fan by Company-prescribed method as specified in the preceding paragraph, a Request Agreement shall be formed as a two-party agreement between the Creator and the Fan stipulating that the Creator will provide the relevant Request Reward within the extent of the Plan set by such Creator, and that the Fan will pay the Sale Proceeds as consideration for such provision.

*Cooling off is a system enabling unconditional withdrawal of agreement applications or termination of agreements, for a certain period after application for or execution of an agreement.
However, online sales are outside the scope of such systems, and cooling off systems thus cannot be used for Request Agreements as in Paragraph 1 of this article.


A Fan will not be entitled to Cancel or refund any already-paid Sale Proceeds for reason of the particulars of the Request Reward provided by a Creator.
provided, however, that if the Creator has not provided the Request Reward in accordance with the relevant Plan, or if there is noncompliance with the agreement in formal terms (e.g., if there is an error in the file format provided by the Creator, if the Fan cannot download the Reward), the Fan shall be entitled to contact the Company about such matter using the âInquiry Formâ on the Site.
If the Company has considered such communication from the Fan and determined that the Fanâs claims are reasonable, the Company will be entitled, but not obligated, to instruct the Creator to make corrections, refund the Sale Proceeds, or take other such action.
In such case, the Fan and the Creator shall act in accordance with the Companyâs instructions, and except where explicitly specified otherwise, the Company will bear no liability for any damage etc.
arising due to any decision or action by the Company.
Creators shall comply with the Act against Unjustifiable Premiums and Misleading Representations, the Act on Specified Commercial Transactions, and other related laws and regulations.

Article 7: Deletion or Termination of Requests
A Fan will be entitled to rescind the transmission of Requests by Company-prescribed procedures if the relevant Creator has not yet Accepted such Request.
A Request will be retracted automatically if seven days have passed from the date of transmission of such Request without the relevant Creator Accepting such Request.
All Sale Proceeds advances received by the Company will be refunded to the relevant Fan.
If, after the formation of a Request Agreement, 60 days have passed from the date of transmission of a Request without the relevant Creator providing the Request Reward to the Fan, such Request Agreement will be deemed terminated, and all Sale Proceeds received by the Company will be refunded to such Fan.
The following items shall apply in the case where a Creator account has been deleted.
If account deletion occurred before the formation of a Request Agreement (before Request Acceptance), the Plan set by the relevant Creator will be deemed to have been retracted, and will be deleted.
If account deletion occurred after the formation of a Request Agreement (after Request Acceptance) but before full provision of the Request Reward, all Sale Proceeds paid shall be refunded to the relevant Fan.


The following items shall apply in the case where a Fan account has been deleted.
If account deletion occurred before the formation of a Request Agreement (before Request Acceptance), the Fan will be deemed to have retracted the relevant Request.

When paying Sale Proceeds as specified in the preceding paragraph, the Company shall subtract the Platform Fee (defined in Item (1) below) from the relevant Creatorâs Sale Proceeds (the amount thereby calculated is hereinafter the âReceived Amountâ), subtract from the Received Amount a Remittance Fee (defined in Item (2) below), and pay the Creator the resulting amount, in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 7, by remittance to a remittance destination determined in accordance with this article.

Cases of flawed account information etc.
shall be handled in accordance with the terms of Article 9.
No interest shall accrue for the period from receipt of Sale Proceeds by the Company or a third party designated by the Company until payment by the Company to the relevant Creator.

Received Amounts shall include consumption tax equivalents for the prices of any Request Rewards sold.
When a payment date falls on a non-work day of the Company or a relevant financial institution, the Company shall make remittance within five business days of the business day immediately following such payment date.

Creators shall consent to the foregoing.

provided, however, that if the unpaid Received Amount is less than the Remittance Fee, the Company shall make no payment to the Creator.

In such case, the Company shall contact the Creator indicating the flaw or error in remittance account information and urging another request for payment.
When the Company has made remittance to a remittance account designated by a Creator pursuant to a Remittance Request by such Creator, the Company will be entitled to deem such payment a payment to the Creator.

in remittance destination information, the Company shall attempt to remit the Sale Proceeds of the relevant Remittance Request within five business days of the 20th of each month, starting from the month immediately following the month in which the remittance date falls.
provided, however, that in the case where the 19th of the month immediately following the month in which a remittance procedure implementation date falls is more than 180 days from the transmission date of the relevant Request, the Company shall not carry out remittance on or after such remittance implementation date, and shall instead act in accordance with the following paragraph.
