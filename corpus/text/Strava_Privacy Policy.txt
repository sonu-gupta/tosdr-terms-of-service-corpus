 DPO@strava.com Information Strava Collects
Strava collects information about you, including information that directly or indirectly identifies you, if you or your other members choose to share it with Strava.
We receive information in a few different ways, including when you track, complete or upload activities using the Services.
Strava also collects information about how you use the Services.
There are also several opportunities for you to share information about yourself, your friends, and your activities with Strava.
For example: Account, Profile, Activity, and Use Information
We collect basic account information such as your name, email address, date of birth, gender, weight, username and password that helps secure and provide you with access to our Services.

Profile, activity and use information is collected about you when you choose to upload a picture, activity (including date, time and geo-location information as well as your speed and pace and perceived exertion) or post, join a challenge, add your equipment usage, view othersâ activities, or otherwise use the Services.
We use your contact information so we can respond to your support requests and comments. Location Information
We collect and process location information when you sign up for and use the Services.
We do not track your device location while you are not using Strava, but in order to provide Stravaâs core Services, it is necessary for us to track your device location while you use Strava.
If you would like to stop the device location tracking, you may do so at any time by adjusting your device settings. Content You Share
We gather information from the photos, posts, comments, kudos, ratings, reviews, and other content you share on the Services, including when you participate in partner events or create segments or routes. Contacts Information
You can choose to add your contactsâ information by connecting your contacts from your mobile device or social networking accounts to Strava.
If you choose to share your contacts with Strava, Strava will, in accordance with your instructions, access and store your contactsâ information in order to identify connections and help you connect with them.
Learn more about how we collect information about your contacts, how we use that information, and the controls available to you. Connected Devices and Apps
Strava collects information from devices and apps you connect to Strava.
For example, you may connect your Garmin watch or Flywheel account to Strava and information from these devices and apps will be passed along to Strava. Health Information

Certain health information may be inferred from sources such as heart rate or other measurements, including power, cadence, and weight or other indicators.

Record your activities and analyze your performance. For example, to compare your past efforts, analyze your training, and (with your consent) use your heart rate information to provide you with interesting and useful performance analysis.

Interact with other athletes. For example, to compete on segments, participate in clubs, challenges, or events, follow other athletes, and use features that help athletes interact with one another, such as group activities or flyby.

Manage your training. For example, to set goals and use your training dashboard.

Explore new places to go. For example, to discover routes or segments where you can run or ride.
To visualize your activities in new ways.
For example, by creating personal heatmaps or using your training log.

Subject to your privacy controls, your information, including parts of your profile, username, photos, members you follow and who follow you, clubs you belong to, your activities, the devices you use, and kudos and comments you give and receive will be shared on Strava so that you may be able to participate in the Services, for example to show your place on a leaderboard.

Your precise location information, such as where you run or ride, may also be shared on Strava or to non-members, in accordance with your privacy controls. To customize your experience

If we see that you run in a certain area, we may suggest a race in that area. To protect you and the Services

These service providers only have access to the information necessary to perform these limited functions on our behalf and are required to protect and secure your information.

Strava relies on a number of legal bases to collect, use, share, and otherwise process the information we have about you for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, including:

as necessary to provide the Services and fulfill our obligations pursuant to the Terms of Service.
For example, we cannot provide the Services unless we collect and use your location information;
where you have consented to the processing;
where necessary to comply with a legal obligation, a court order, or to exercise and defend legal claims;
to protect your vital interests, or those of others, such as in the case of emergencies.
and
where necessary for the purposes of Stravaâs or a third partyâs legitimate interests, such as our interests in protecting our members, our partnersâ interests in collaborating with our members, and our commercial interests in ensuring the sustainability of the Services.
 Transfers
The Services are operated from the United States.
If you are located outside of the United States and choose to use the Services or provide information to us, you acknowledge and understand that your information will be transferred, processed and stored in the United States, as it is necessary to provide the Services and perform the Terms of Service.
United States privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. Retention of Information
We retain information as long as it is necessary to provide the Services to you and others, subject to any legal obligations to further retain such information.
Information associated with your account will generally be kept until it is no longer necessary to provide the Services or until your account is deleted.
In addition, you can delete some items of information (e.g., profile information) and you can remove individual activities from view on the Services without deleting your account.
For example, after you withdraw your consent to Strava processing your health-related information, Strava will delete all health-related information you upload.

Information connected to you that is no longer necessary and relevant to provide our Services may be de-identified or aggregated with other non-personal data to provide insights which are commercially valuable to Strava, such as statistics of the use of the Services.
For example, we may retain publicly available segments or routes and other depersonalized geolocation information to continue to improve the Services and we use aggregated information in Strava Metro and our Global Heatmap.
This information will be de-associated with your name and other identifiers. Other Strava Sites
Strava maintains certain websites that can be accessed outside of https://strava.com, such as https://blog.strava.com (the âOther Sitesâ).

If you interact with the Other Sites, you acknowledge that you may be subject to the terms and conditions and policies applicable to such Other Site.
