Do Not Track
Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and

signals to websites that a user does not want to have his or her online
activity and behavior tracked.
If a website that responds to a
particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the browser can block
that website from collecting certain information about the browserâs
user.
Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet
uniform.
For this reason, many website operators, including this picoCTF
website, do not respond to DNT signals. CHILDRENâS PRIVACY IF YOU ARE UNDER THE AGE OF 13, DO NOT USE THE SERVICES.

verify your identity before we respond to your requests to exercise your
rights.
If you are entitled to these rights, you may exercise these
rights with respect to your personal data that we collect and store:

If you reside within the EU, you have the right to lodge a complaint
with a Data Protection Authority about how we process your personal data

Processing EU Personal Data

In the event that your personal data is subject to the GDPR, we will
only use your personal data for the original purpose for which we
collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for
another purpose and that purpose is compatible with the original
purpose.
If we need to use your EU personal data for an unrelated
purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which
allows us to do so.
We require third parties to only use your EU
personal data for the specific purpose for which it was given to us and

no longer necessary for the legal or business purposes for which it is
processed, we will generally destroy or anonymize that data.

International Transfers of Personal Data

Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EU, we ensure a
similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one
of the following safeguards is implemented:


European Commission Standard Contractual Clauses: We may use
specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give
personal data the same protection it has in the EU.


Privacy Shield.
Where we use providers based in the US, we may
transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which
requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared
between the Europe and the US.


For additional information on the mechanisms used to protect your
personal data, please contact our Data Protection Officer at
GDPR-info@andrew.cmu.edu. Changes To This PICOCTF PRIVACY STATEMENT** We may update this picoCTF Privacy Statement based upon evolving laws,
