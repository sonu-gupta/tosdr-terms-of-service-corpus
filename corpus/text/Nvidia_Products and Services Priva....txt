GeForce Experience helps you configure your graphics card for the best gaming and content creation performance, get software updates and new features, such as tools for you to record and broadcast your gameplay, and redeem codes for free games.
To make this happen, we need to know your PCâs hardware, software for gaming and content creation (including settings, usage, and how well they run), GeForce Experience feature usage, and geographical region.
If you opt-in to recommendations, we will show you games, apps, and rewards that you might enjoy.
If you opt-in to sharing technical data, youâll send us error logs to help us find and fix bugs.
You can configure collection and usage of your data by visiting Privacy Settings. View more details on GeForce Experience data GeForce Graphics Drivers

GeForce Graphics Drivers is an essential software that controls the graphics card â it is the operating system of your GeForce graphics card.
If you opt-in to send us technical and error data from your driver, you help us find and fix bugs.
This data includes your hardware, software for gaming (including their settings, usage, and how well they run), driver feature usage, error logs, and geographical region.
You can choose to send us this data when you install the drivers, or through the NVIDIA Control Panel by selecting Help from the menu bar, then clicking on âSend technical and error data to NVIDIAâ so that the check mark is showing.
You can opt-out anytime by clicking again to clear the check mark.
GeForce NOW

GeForce NOW (GFN) is a service that allows you to play your PC games from the cloud to your Mac, PC, SHIELD, and mobile devices.
To allow the service to stream games to your machine at the best performance and highest quality, we need to know your geographical region, internet speed, games played, session data and system information such as CPU, GPU, and system memory.
If GeForce NOW is provided by a GeForce NOW Alliance Partner, we will share with them certain information such as your feedback and data relating to quality and usage so they can better service you.
If you opt-in to recommendations, we will show you games that you might enjoy.
If you opt-in to sharing technical data, NVIDIA will collect additional feature usage (like your common search terms to find the game you want faster) and error logs to help us improve our quality of service.
You can set your privacy preferences by&nbsp.
