. Arkose Labs and its licensors, suppliers, partners, parent, subsidiaries or affiliated entities, and each of their respective officers, directors, members, employees, consultants, contract employees, representatives and agents, and each of their respective successors and assigns (Arkose Labs and all such parties together, the âArkose Labs Partiesâ) make no representations or warranties concerning the Services, including without limitation regarding any Content contained in or accessed through the Services, and the Arkose Labs Parties will not be responsible or liable for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of material contained in or accessed through the Services or any claims, actions, suits procedures, costs, expenses, damages or liabilities arising out of use of, or in any way related to your participation in, the Services.

.
You agree to indemnify and hold the Arkose Labs Parties and its licensees and licensors harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses and expenses (including attorneysâ fees) arising from or in any way related to any claims relating to (a) your use of the Services, and (b) your violation of these Terms.


Assignment
.
You may not assign, delegate or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder in any way (by operation of law or otherwise) without Arkose Labsâ prior written consent.
We may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations without consent.


Choice of Law
.
These Terms are governed by and will be construed under the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the State of California, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.


Arbitration Agreement
.
Please read the following ARBITRATION AGREEMENT carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Arkose Labs and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from Arkose Labs.
Both you and Arkose Labs acknowledge and agree that for the purposes of any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms, Arkose Labsâ officers, directors, employees and independent contractors (âPersonnelâ) are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Personnel will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third-party beneficiary hereof.
(a) Arbitration Rules.
Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.
The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms directly through good-faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party initiating arbitration.
If such negotiations do not resolve the dispute, it shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in San Francisco County, California.
The arbitration will proceed in the English language, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the âRulesâ) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes.
The arbitrator shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules.
Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
(b) Costs of Arbitration.
The Rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees.
Arkose Labs will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than seventy-five thousand ($75,000) dollars.
Arkose Labs will not seek its attorneysâ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.
(c) Small Claims Court.
Infringement.
Either you or Arkose Labs may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Francisco County, California or any United States county where you live or work.
Furthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction, to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a partyâs copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.
(d) Waiver of Jury Trial.
YOU AND ARKOSE LABS WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY.
You and Arkose Labs are instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration.
Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court.
In any litigation between you and Arkose Labs over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND ARKOSE LABS WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.
(e) Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.
ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS.
CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.
If however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor Arkose Labs is entitled to arbitration.
instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in (g) below.
(f) Opt-out.
You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Section by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: Arkose Labs, Inc., c/o Arbitration Opt-Out, 250 Montgomery Street, Floor 10, San Francisco, CA 94104 United States,  postmarked within thirty (30) days of first accepting these Terms.
You must include (i) your name and residence address, (ii) the email address and/or telephone number, and (iii) a clear statement that you want to opt out of these Termsâ arbitration agreement.
(g) Exclusive Venue.
If you send the opt-out notice in (f), and/or in any circumstances where the foregoing arbitration agreement permits either you or Arkose Labs to litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms in court, then the foregoing arbitration agreement will not apply to either party, and both you and Arkose Labs agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or federal courts located in San Francisco County, California.
(h) Severability.
If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration Agreement section will be null and void.
This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Arkose Labs.


Miscellaneous
.
You will be responsible for paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services, provided that the Arkose Labs may, in its sole discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or for itself as it sees fit.
The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.
If any provision of these Terms are found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.
You and Arkose Labs agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and Arkose Labs, and that these Terms supersede and cancel all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms.
You hereby acknowledge and agree that you are not an employee, agent, partner, or joint venture of Arkose Labs, and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Arkose Labs in any respect whatsoever.
Except as expressly set forth in the section above regarding the arbitration agreement, you and Arkose Labs agree there are no third party beneficiaries intended under these Terms.
