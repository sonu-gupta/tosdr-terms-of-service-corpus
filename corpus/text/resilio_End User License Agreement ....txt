The Resilio TechnologiesDownloading and Updates
The Software downloads only those files that are both authorized by you for download (specifically or by category or subscription), except that the Software may automatically update itself.

Automatic Uploading
The Software accelerates the synchronization of data by enabling your computer to grab pieces of files from other users of the Software simultaneously.
Your use of the Software to synchronize files will, in turn, enable other users to synchronize pieces of those files from you, thereby maximizing synchronization speeds for all users.
In the Software, only files that you are explicitly synchronizing or sharing or have synchronized or shared through the Software will be made available to others.
You consent to other users' use of your network connection to download portions of such files from you.
At any time, you may uninstall the Software through the Add/Remove Programs control panel utility on Windows Operating Systems or drag the Application to the Trash on MacOS.
In addition, you may control the Software in multiple ways through its user interface without affecting any files you have already synchronized.

No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained from Resilio, Inc.

has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
The foregoing limitations will survive even if any limited remedy specified is found to have failed of its essential purpose.
