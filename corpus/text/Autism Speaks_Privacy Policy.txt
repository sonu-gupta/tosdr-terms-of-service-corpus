The Site does not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, so although your session will be logged, you will remain anonymous to us.

Cookies allow us to measure activity on the Site and to improve your user experience, for example by remembering your passwords and viewing preferences.

We will make available cookies, containing non-personally identifiable information such as IP address and pages viewed, regarding your activity on the Site to certain third party providers with whom we work, in order to show advertisements relating to this Site that may be of interest to you.
Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies.
If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent.
However, it is possible that some parts of the Site will not function properly if you do so.
