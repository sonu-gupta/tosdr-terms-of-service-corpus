Newsletter - Success Measurement
The newsletters contain a so-called "web-beacon", ie a pixel-sized file that is retrieved from the server when the newsletter is opened by our server or, if we use a shipping service provider. This call will initially collect technical information, such as information about the browser and your system, as well as your IP address and time of retrieval. 
This information is used to improve the technical performance of services based on their specifications or audience and their reading habits, based on their locations (which can be determined using the IP address) or access times. Statistical surveys also include determining if the newsletters are opened, when they are opened, and which links are clicked. For technical reasons, this information can be assigned to the individual newsletter recipients. However, it is neither our goal nor, if used, that of the shipping service provider to observe individual users. The evaluations serve us much more to recognize the reading habits of our users and to adapt our content to them or to send different content according to the interests of our users. 
A separate revocation of the performance measurement is unfortunately not possible, in this case, the entire newsletter subscription must be terminated.

DSGVO), we use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google LLC ("Google"). Google uses cookies. The information generated by the cookie about the use of the online offer by the users are usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. 
Google is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement, which provides a guarantee to comply with European privacy legislation ( https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active ). 
Google will use this information on our behalf to evaluate the use of our online offer by users, to compile reports on the activities within this online offer and to provide us with further services related to the use of this online offer and the internet usage. In this case, pseudonymous usage profiles of the users can be created from the processed data.

Google is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement, which provides a guarantee to comply with European privacy legislation (https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active). 
We use Google's online AdWords marketing tool "AdWords" to place ads on the Google advertising network (eg, in search results, in videos, on websites, etc.) so that they are shown to users who have a suspected interest in the ads. This allows us to more specifically display ads for and within our online offering so that we only present ads to users that potentially match their interests. For example, if a user sees ads for products he's been looking for on other online offerings, that's called remarketing. For these purposes, upon access to our and other websites where the Google Advertising Network is active, Google will immediately execute a Google code and become so-called (re) marketing tags (invisible graphics or code, also known as ")." Web beacons ") incorporated into the website. With their help, the user can store an individual cookie, ie a small file (instead of cookies, comparable technologies can also be used). In this file is noted which websites the user visited, for what content he is interested and what offers the user has clicked, as well as technical information about the browser and operating system, referring websites, visit time and other information on the use of the online offer. 
Furthermore, we receive an individual "conversion cookie". The information obtained through the cookie is used by Google to generate conversion statistics for us. However, we only hear the anonymous total number of users who clicked on our ad and were redirected to a conversion tracking tag page. However, we do not receive any information that personally identifies users. 
The data of the users are pseudonym processed within the Google advertising network. For example, Google does not store and process users' names or e-mail addresses, but processes the relevant data in a cookie-related manner within pseudonymous user profiles. That is, from the perspective of Google, the ads are not managed and displayed to a specifically identified person, but to the cookie owner, regardless of who that cookie owner is. This does not apply if a user has explicitly allowed Google to process the data without this pseudonymization. The information collected about users is transmitted to Google and stored on Google's servers in the United States. 
For more information about Google's data usage, hiring and disparaging options, please read Google's Privacy Policy ( https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads ) and Google's Ads Ads Settings ( https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated ).
