Term of Service
Initial Term
Service is provided on paid subscriptions only for a term of one month if you choose the monthly plan, or one year if you choose the annual plan (the âTermâ).
The initial Term begins on the date that you subscribe to the Service.
You are subscribing to the Service for the full length of the applicable Term.
This means that if you terminate the Service prior to the end of the then-current Term or we terminate the Service as a result of your Default (any reason, including without limitation, for your failure to pay any sum due hereunder, for suspected fraud or other illicit activity, and/or for any other breach of these Terms of Service â each, a âDefaultâ), you will be responsible for any applicable charges for the full Term as if you remained a customer through the end of the then-current Term, including, without limitation, outstanding charges and unbilled charges.
In addition, you will not be entitled to a refund for any unused portion of prepaid Term charges.
You may switch to a lower or higher cost plan at any time.
In the event you make such a switch during a Term, you immediately will be credited or billed a prorated amount of the difference between your previous plan fee and that associated with your new plan based on the amount of time left in the current Term.
The credited amount can be used for payment in future periods, or for any add-ons, but will not be reimbursed in cash.
Renewal
The Term for all Service plans will renew automatically for successive Terms of the same length without further action by or notice to you.

Upon termination of your account, we will delete all information stored in your account (including voicemails, recorded calls, text messages, calls history) within 30 calendar days unless you request transfer of the information before the end of that period, in which case, once you have paid all outstanding debts on your account, we will use reasonable efforts to provide the information to you in electronic format at your expense.
Business phone numbers acquired with the MightyCall service and ported into MightyCall will be automatically released and lost after 7 (seven) calendar days of the account subscription being terminated either by your request or by non-payment.
If you transfer or port a Number or Ported Number (as defined in Section 3.3) to another service provider, you must notify MightyCall about requesting a port out by calling MightyCall at +1 (888) 256-8312 during working hours (8 am to 8 pm EST) 7 days a week.

We will not be liable for reimbursement for business cards, stationary, or press releases under any conditions if we are not able to give you a requested number.
A request by you to port your Number from MightyCall to another provider may be deemed a request by you to terminate your account with us.
If you decide to port your Number to another service provider, you remain liable to us for any outstanding balances accrued on your account, all of which must be paid before porting your Number out of the Service.
Your account must remain active until the port is complete.
When the port out is completed you remain responsible for canceling any Services related to such Numbers or Ported Numbers or service charges will continue.
If your service is terminated prior to porting, it will result in the loss of the Number and the Number will not be eligible for porting.
Service Distinctions
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTAND THAT THE SERVICE HAS DIFFERENT TECHNICAL LIMITATIONS AND OTHER TECHNICAL CHARACTERISTICS AS COMPARED WITH TRADITIONAL TELEPHONE SERVICES.

In addition, you acknowledge that the Numbers you obtain from us may not be listed in any telephone directory (except for Numbers ported to us from your local phone company, which may be listed).
One of the consequences of this is that a reverse directory lookup of your Number will most likely not reveal your address.
