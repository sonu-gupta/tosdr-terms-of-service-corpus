 STANFORD COURSES ON THE LAGUNITA LEARNING PLATFORM Current Page 












 STANFORD COURSES ON THE LAGUNITA LEARNING PLATFORM Looking for your Lagunita course? Stanford Online retired the Lagunita online learning platform on March 31, 2020 and moved most of the courses that were offered on Lagunita to edx.org.
Stanford Online offers a lifetime of learning opportunities on campus and beyond.
Through online courses, graduate and professional certificates, advanced degrees, executive education programs, and free content, we give learners of different ages, regions, and backgrounds the opportunity to engage with Stanford faculty and their research.  Find Free Courses Health &amp.

HumanitiesBrowse All About the Lagunita Platform
Stanford released the first open source version of the edX platform, Open edX, in June 2013.
We named our instance of the Open edX platform Lagunita, after the name of a cherished lake bed on the Stanford campus, a favorite gathering place of students.
Stanford Online used Open edX technology to offer more than 200 free and open online courses on the Lagunita platform to more than 10 million learners in 190 countries.
Most courses on Lagunita offered the ability to earn a Statement of Accomplishment, based on one's overall grade in the course.
A Statement of Accomplishment acknowledged that a Stanford Online course offered through Lagunita was completed with a passing grade by a particular participant.
This Statement of Accomplishment serves as verification of the successful completion of the course.
Information for Learners
Learners who were actively engaged with the platform, as well as anyone who had been issued a Statement of Accomplishment, were notified throughout the beginning of 2020 that the Lagunita platform was closing.
These learners were invited to download any course content and Statements of Accomplishments by March 31, 2020.
Answers to many frequently asked questions for learners prior to the Lagunita retirement were available on our FAQ page.
Information for Stanford Faculty
The Stanford Center for Professional Development works with Stanford faculty to extend their teaching and research to a global audience through online and in-person learning opportunities.
While the Lagunita platform has been retired, we offer many other platforms for extended education.
Faculty can find answers to many frequently asked questions here.
