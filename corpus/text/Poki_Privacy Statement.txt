Children UsersWe recognize the importance of safeguarding the privacy of children and encourage parents to check and monitor their children's use of online activities regularly.
This is why we created a separate age-appropriate experience for Children Users through the Poki Kids Site, or through an age-gate in certain games on the Poki General Site: in order to comply with the legislation, you could be presented to an age screen when starting the game.
When presented with this age screen, it is important that you state the correct age.
Based on your age information and your device settings, Poki does not process personal data of children under the minimum age limit (Children Users) that is prescribed by the legislation in the individual jurisdictions for behavioral advertisement.
The Children Users' experience of games with an age-gate on the Poki General Site, and the Poki Kids Site supports and complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").
The Children Users' experience of games with an age-gate on the Poki General Site and the Poki Kids site will not request any personal information from Children Users.
There is no registration required for the Poki Kids Site and any advertising shown on the Poki Kids Site, or in the the Children Users' experience of games with an age-gate on the Poki General Site, is age-appropriate.
The Poki Kids Site and the Children Users' experience of games with an age-gate on the Poki General Site will not show behaviorally targeted ads or allow third parties to track the activity of Children Users for that purpose.
The Poki Kids Site and the the Children Users' experience of games with an age-gate on the Poki General Site may collect and use IP addresses and other persistent identifiers, including cookies, from Children Users, but only for purposes of supporting our internal operations, such as to help us:

Identify whether you are a child or adult for data protection purposes to determine the legal requirements for our processing of your data
Maintain or analyze the functioning of the Poki Kids Site
Perform network communications
Authenticate users of, or personalize the content on, the Poki Kids Site
Serve contextual advertising on the Poki Kids Site and cap the frequency of advertising

We have separated our platform into a few sections.
Poki Kids was created for our youngest audience and is fully COPPA compliant.
If you are a Child User, you should only use the Poki Kids Site and only with the permission of a parent or legal guardian.
On Poki.com, you'll find games that are intended at users that are over 13.
Poki.com is not targeted towards children under the age of 13 and it will not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
To learn more about COPPA, please reference this simple one-page informational guide from the kidSAFE Seal Program: https://www.kidsafeseal.com/knowaboutcoppa.html.10.

You have consented to this collection and processing for a specific purpose;
It is necessary to fulfil our contractual obligations.
