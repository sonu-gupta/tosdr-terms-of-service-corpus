Severability. If a court finds part of the Agreement illegal, the rest will continue in force.
Each of the paragraphs of these terms operates separately.
If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.

No Waiver. Even if we delay in enforcing the Agreement, we can still enforce it later.
If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking this contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you later.
For example, if you miss a payment and we do not chase you but we continue to provide the services, we can still require you to make the payment at a later date.
