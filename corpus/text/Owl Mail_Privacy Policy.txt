California Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)CalOPPA is the first state law in the United States to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy.
The lawâs reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.
