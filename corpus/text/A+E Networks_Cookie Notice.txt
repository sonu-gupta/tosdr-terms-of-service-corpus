Last updated: 01/01/2020

This Cookie Notice explains how A&E Television Networks, LLC and its affiliates collectively âA+E Networksâ, âweâ, âusâ)&nbsp.
use cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our U.S.-based digital properties, such as websites, mobile apps, smart TV apps, games or other interactive features, or installed software (each a âSiteâ).
It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.

1.
What are cookies?

Cookies are small data files that are placed on your device when you visit a Site Cookies are widely used by Site owners in order to make their Sites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
There are several types of cookies:
Session cookies expire at the end of your browser session and allow us to link your actions during that particular browser session.
Persistent cookies are stored on your device, and they remain there when you close your web browser.
The cookies can be read by the Site that created them when you visit that Site again.
First-party cookies are set by the Site owner, in this case, A+E NetworksÂ®.
Third-party cookies are set by parties other than the Site owner.
Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the Site (e.g., advertising, interactive content and analytics).
The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the Site in question and also when it visits certain other Sites.
Cookies can be disabled or removed by tools that are available in most commercial browsers.
The preference for each browser you use will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options.

2.
Why do we use cookies?

We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons.
Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Sites to operate, and we refer to these as âessentialâ or âstrictly necessaryâ cookies.
Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Sites.
Third parties serve cookies through our Sites for advertising, analytics and other purposes.
The specific types of first- and third-party cookies served through our Sites and the purposes they perform are described below (please note that the specific cookies served may vary depending on the specific Site you visit):

3.
Strictly Necessary Cookies: 

These cookies are strictly necessary in order to enable you to move around our Sites, provide you with services available through our Sites and to use some of their features, such as access to secure areas.
As these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the Sites to you, if this category of cookie is disabled, certain functionality [(like navigating our Sites)] may become unavailable.

4.
Performance and Functionality Cookies: 

These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our Sites but are nonessential to their use.
However, without these cookies, certain functionality [(like videos)] may become unavailable.

Analytics and customization cookies: 

These cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our Sites are being used or how effective are marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our Sites for you.
However, without these cookies, certain functionality [(like analytics and customization)] may become unavailable.

Advertising cookies: 

These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you.
They perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed for advertisers, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests.

Social networking cookies:
These cookies are used to enable you to share pages and content that you find interesting on our Sites through third party social networking and other websites.&nbsp.
These cookies may also be used for advertising purposes.
However, without these cookies, certain functionality [(like sharing pages and content through third-party social networking and other websites)] may become unavailable.

5.
What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?

Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a Site.
We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called âtracking pixelsâ or âclear gifsâ).
These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Sites or opened an email that we have sent them.
This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Sites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Sites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of e-mail marketing campaigns.
In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.
In the United States, we use Adobe Marketing Cloud Device Cooperative to better understand how you use certain websites and apps across the various devices you use.
Visit the Adobe website to learn more about how Adobe does this and how you may opt-out of this program.

6.
Do you serve targeted advertising?

Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to serve advertising through our Sites.
These companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to personalize content, and provide relevant advertisements about goods and services that you may be interested in.
They may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements.
This can be accomplished by their using cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to our Sites and third party.
The information collected through this process does not enable us or them to identify your name, contact details or other personally identifying details unless you choose to provide these.
