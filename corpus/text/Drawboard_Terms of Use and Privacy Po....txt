The above provides a high level view of how and why we collect your personal data.
So letâs take a deep dive into those areas where we gather and use this data. Website Tracking Like many websites, www.drawboard.com and app.bullclip.com collect certain information through the use of âcookiesâ, web beacons, device identifiers, pixels and other technologies to provide functionality and to recognize you across different services and devices.

Who do we disclose information to? Outside of authorised personnel employed by Drawboard, we only disclose personal data to third-parties that meet our data privacy conditions (as guided by the Australian Privacy Act and the GDPR).
When this occurs, it occurs in a secure and contractually-regulated manner.
These third parties include:

product tracking and marketing platforms, communication platforms, and contractors who we engage with to help process personal data and other data;
government third parties, including government agencies, regulatory bodies and law enforcement agencies as required, authorised or permitted by law.
and
a third party that acquires or intends to acquire Drawboard or its assets.

We may also share or publish aggregate information that does not specifically identify you, such as statistical information about how our users use our products or their demographic characteristics. International Transfer Your information may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.
Please be advised that Drawboard reserves the right to transfer your data (including personal data) to and from any country, including Australia and the United States of America.
We do this in order to provide high performance of our products and services, and also to process data and prepare it for processing in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
You agree to your data being transferred to other countries when you share your data with us.
If you later wish to withdraw your consent, you can delete your account as described in the âChanging or Deleting your Informationâ section.

The European Commission has the power to determine, on the basis of the GDPR, whether a country outside the European Union offers an adequate level of data protection by making an âadequacy decisionâ.
To date, the European Commission has not adopted an adequacy decision in respect of Australia.
Instead, we rely on other legal bases to lawfully transfer personal data around the world (including transfers to countries like Australia where an adequacy decision has not been adopted).
These bases include your consent and the European Commission-approved model contractual clauses, which require certain privacy and security protections.
You may obtain a copy of the model contractual clauses by contacting us in accordance with the âContact usâ section. Links to Other Sites and Services Our services may contain links to other websites and services.
The fact that we link to a website or service is not an endorsement, authorization or representation that we are affiliated with that third party.
We do not exercise control over third party websites or services, and are not responsible for their actions.
Other websites and services follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal data you submit to them.
We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit and services you use. Voluntary Public Disclosure of Personal Information We may make available on our site, or link to, certain opportunities for our customers and other users to share information online (e.g., on message boards, in chat areas, in file uploads, through events, etc.).
Please be aware that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online, that information becomes public and can be collected and used by others.
We have no control over, and take no responsibility for, the use, storage or dissemination of such publicly-disclosed personal information.
By posting personal information online in public forums, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties. Changing or Deleting your Information All Bullclip account holders may access, review, update, rectify or delete their personal data in their profile by logging into their account.
Removing your information may limit our ability to provide the service to you.
If you opt to completely delete all such information, your account will be deactivated and you will lose access to the service.
All Drawboard PDF users may access, review, update, rectify or delete their personal data by contacting us.
You may contact us directly to request data modification outside of our services or if you have additional questions.
Weâll take reasonable steps to provide, modify or delete your information as soon as is practicable, but some information may remain in archived/backup copies for legal reasons or to prevent harm, including as described in our âWho do we disclose information to?â section.
You may also contact us directly to receive (in a commonly used file format) the personal data you have provided to us.
We may limit or reject your request in certain cases, including without limitation where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy in the case in question, where the rights of other persons would be violated, or as required by law.
We will respond to all requests within 30 days.
If you need further assistance regarding your access and control of your personal data, please contact our Data Protection Officer and we will consider your request in accordance with applicable laws.
If you reside in a Designated Country and are unhappy with our data practices, you also have a right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority. Security The security of your personal data is important to us.
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it (including encrypted storage and password protection).
Each of our employees is aware of our security policies, and your information is only available to those employees who need it to perform their jobs.
No method of transmission over the Internet using industry standard technology is 100% secure.
Therefore, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.
For more information, please see the Drawboard Approach to Security document at www.drawboard.com/terms. Data Retention We keep your account information, like your name and email address, for as long as your account is in existence because we need it to operate the accounts you have with us.
We keep other data, including information about how you use our products and services, until you request that we delete this data because we use this data to provide our products and services to you and for the other purposes set out in the âHow we use Personal Dataâ section above. Privacy Policy Changes We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time.
We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.
If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy you will be notified via email (if  we have your contact information) or otherwise in some manner through the Services that we deem reasonably likely to reach you (which may include posting a new Privacy Policy on our website â or a specific announcement on this page or on our blog).
Any modifications to this Privacy Policy will be effective upon our posting of the new terms and/or upon implementation of the new changes on the service (or as otherwise indicated at the time of posting).
In all cases, your continued use of the service or site after the posting of any modified Privacy Policy indicates your acceptance of the terms of the modified Privacy Policy.
