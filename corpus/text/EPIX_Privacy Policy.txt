More Information About Cookie Controls.
For the following Internet browsers, you may prevent or exercise choices regarding browser cookies for a particular Device and Internet browser combination by using the controls described in the following:
Internet Explorer 11
Chrome
Safari
Firefox
If your Internet browser is not listed above or you otherwise are having difficulties with the links, you may be able to access controls to:
Delete existing browser cookies through the âInternet Optionsâ, âSettingsâ, Preferencesâ, âOptionsâ, or similar menu selection in your browserâs menu or otherwise as directed by your browserâs support feature, which means that all pre-existing browser cookies are deleted but does not prevent browser cookies from being used in the future.
Disable browser cookies through the same browser controls, which means that browser cookies shall not be used in the future but pre-existing browser cookies may not be deleted.
Additional information on enabling or disabling browser cookies and other Tracking Technologies may be available through your browserâs support feature.
(See the âhelpâ section of your browser for more information.) Disabling may sometimes be referred to as blocking or opting out of browser cookies and relies on browser cookies to remember your choices.
If you delete browser cookies using the controls in your Web browser (as described above) after disabling browser cookies, you may have to disable browser cookies again to re-establish your preferences.
Choose to have the Device you use to access the Applications warn you each time a browser cookie or certain other non-Flash LSO Tracking Technology is being set.
(You can later choose to turn-off such warnings.) This may be available through your Internet browser on the Device you use to access the Applications.
Additional information on warnings and removal of warnings may be available through your browserâs support feature.
Seek additional information from the provider of your Internet browser through your browserâs support features.
The above options may cover browser cookies set by the Applications, browser cookies not set by the Applications (sometimes called third party cookies), and/or both types of browser cookies.Many tools discussed above are âInternet browser cookie basedâ.
This means that such tools rely on cookies to remember your choices.
For example, if you delete Tracking Technologies using the controls in your Web browser, after disabling such Tracking Technologies, you may have to disable such Tracking Technologies again to reestablish your preferences and, if you exercise opt-outs through the mechanisms described above, and then delete or block browser cookies, you may need to exercise your opt-outs through these mechanisms again.The tools are âInternet browser and Device-specificâ or âDevice-specificâ.
Note that when you exercise your options using controls for the Internet browser, your choices shall only apply to the specific Internet browser on that Device and not across Devices and platforms.5.2.3.2.
Automatic Disabling of Third Party Cookies and Effect on Certain Opt-Outs.
Some Device manufacturers and/or browsers (such as Safari) may preset their browser to automatically disable browser cookies from websites, applications, or other interactive services other than those you visit directly (sometimes referred to as third party cookies) and, if so, the opt-out choices you have exercised with regard to third parties may not function and you may need to enable third party cookies in order for your opt-out choices to function.
For example, unless you enable third party cookies on Safari, your opt-out choices made on the Digital Advertising Allianceâs Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising site and on the Network Advertising Initiative site may not function.5.2.3.3.
You will still receive advertisements.
Deleting or disabling Third Party Service Providersâ, Advertisersâ or the Applicationsâ Tracking Technologies does not mean that you will no longer receive online ads.
If you delete or disable third party Tracking Technologies (or, if third party Tracking Technologies are automatically disabled, if you do not enable such Tracking Technologies), this only means that such ads may no longer be tailored to your specific viewing habits or interests, but you will continue to see ads on the Applications and you may see the same advertisement repeatedly or may see advertisements more frequently unless you enable Tracking Technologies set by third parties or unless we offer alternative means such as enlisting the assistance of Third Party Service Providers in order for the Applications to set Tracking Technologies for frequency capping purposes as described in the âInformation Collected Through the Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologiesâ section.5.2.3.4.
