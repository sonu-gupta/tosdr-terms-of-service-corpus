Your Flux Service

The Flux Service offers you the ability to store e-receipts from Retailers for purchases you make with the credit and debit cards associated with your Bank Account.
These e-receipts are created by matching data regarding the transactions associated with those cards provided by you via your Bank Account, by Retailers and by the companies operating the Retailersâ payment or data systems (the âRetailersâ Data Providersâ).
All data will be handled in accordance with our Privacy Policy found here: https://tryflux.com/legal/privacy.


The data and e-receipts which are attached to the transaction in your Banking App and are powered by the Flux Service will be owned by Us.
By using your Flux Service, you agree to give Us access to the information in your accounts held at your bank and the information about your transactions held by the Retailers, the Retailersâ Data Providers and to use that information in the ways set out in the Privacy Policy.


The creation of this data and the e-receipts is dependent on Flux receiving correct, timely data regarding your account via your bank, Retailers and Retailersâ Data Providers.
Flux shall not be responsible for any errors arising from incorrect or incomplete data, or data which is delivered to your Flux Service late.


You will provide Flux with such information as may reasonably be required by Flux in order to provide your Flux Service.


Over time, your Flux Service may provide you with access to information relating to the purchases you have made with Retailers that we think will be interesting and helpful to you, for example nutritional information relating to the food products you have purchased.
We will write to you to tell you about these new services and features and you will be given the ability to opt in to receive these additional services.Open banking and account information services

These services allow us to collect your banking information on one or more of your payment accounts held by your payment service providers, i.e.
the transaction data held by the providers of your bank account, (âconsolidated informationâ).


If you wish to use the account information service, you hereby:


consent to Flux collecting and using your consolidated information in order to provide the account information service to you.
and


to the extent that any intellectual property rights are contained in the consolidated information, and such intellectual property rights belong to you, grant to Flux a non-exclusive licence to use such intellectual property rights to the extent necessary for Flux to perform the account information service.

4.
Your Privacy

We only use any personal data We collect through your use of your Flux Service in the ways set out in Our Privacy Policy which can be found here: https://tryflux.com/legal/privacy.


Please be aware that internet transmissions are never completely private or secure and that any message or information you send using your Flux Service may be read or intercepted by others, even if there is a special notice that a particular transmission is encrypted.



5.
Loyalty Schemes And Cashback

If you have consented, Retailers may use your Flux Service to send you offers, including inviting you to participate in loyalty schemes with one or more Retailers (each a âLoyalty Schemeâ).


Where available, your participation in Loyalty Schemes across the Banking App and other Flux enabled applications will be aggregated.
This will allow you to participate in a Loyalty Scheme using multiple payment methods and may mean that your entitlement to Cashback (as set out below) arises sooner.
We will inform you in writing when and where this aggregated participation method is available.


The Retailer is solely responsible for any retargeting (such as direct advertising or offers to you) which it carries out through the Flux Service and for the content of any messages.
You will only receive these if you have explicitly consented either at sign-up or as an option in your Banking Appâs marketplace for example.
These retargeting messages may include discounted offers on items which may be of interest.
Flux commits to ensure that you are always able to easily opt out by emailing help@tryflux.com and any available channels in the Banking App.
Flux is committed to build transparency into how your data is used.
Your may receive retargeting messages and access to Loyalty Schemes through the Flux Service but the Retailer remains responsible for ensuring that the retargeting and Loyalty Schemes are compliant with applicable laws.


If you decide to participate in a Loyalty Scheme offered by a Retailer, you may be eligible to receive a payment from Us (âCashbackâ) as follows.
The Retailer may provide Flux with a commission in exchange for anonymised information about transactions you make with the Retailer and for promoting the Retailerâs Loyalty Scheme to you.
Flux in turn makes Cashback available to you in exchange for your participation in the Loyalty Scheme and for providing access to the anonymised information about your transactions.


When Flux receives commission from the Retailer, Flux will hold the commission as its own funds.
Our obligation to pay Cashback to you arises under these Terms and not under any agreement you or We may have with the Retailer.


Once We have verified information that your transactions with a Retailer have met the requirements of that Retailerâs Loyalty Scheme, We will notify you that there is Cashback due to you.
We will then make a Cashback payment to you by paying the value of the Cashback straight into the bank account from which you paid for the transaction within 1 working day that triggered the entitlement to Cashback, subject to the following limitations.


We reserve the right not to make a payment of Cashback if these Terms are terminated by you or Us before a Cashback payment becomes due.


The exact amount of Cashback you will receive is set by the terms of each Loyalty Scheme as provided to Us by the Retailer, and Our ability to operate the Loyalty Scheme is dependent on the information We receive from Retailers and the Retailersâ Data Providers.


Flux shall be entitled to stop providing any Loyalty Scheme:


for legal or regulatory reasons;


if a Retailer has failed to pay Fluxâs fees for providing the Loyalty Scheme to you.
or


if a Retailer has decided to stop providing a Loyalty Scheme.


However in the event that We stop providing any Loyalty Scheme, we will still provide Cashback in relation to any redemption event that you may have earned prior to the end of the Loyalty Scheme, but do not redeem until after the Loyalty Scheme is no longer provided.
