6 (1) b. Video Recordings Whenever the Pupil Invisible device is mounted on the head of an individual (the âwearerâ) and switched to the record mode, each eye of the wearer is filmed by one eye camera integrated into the spectacle frame.
The two videos recorded by the two eye cameras are fed into a machine learning algorithm (neural network) which calculates the 2D gaze coordinates, and if the world camera is connected, an egocentric third video is recorded which can serve to visualize the gaze point of the wearer.
Therefore, two (or three) videos are recorded and stored per recording â one from the world camera (if connected) and one from each of the two eye cameras.
The data is saved into a recording folder on the cell phone (companion) device.
During each recording, metadata are also collected and these include recording timestamps, world camera and spectacles serial numbers, world camera image coordinates (2D gaze coordinates), cell phone (android) device ID/model/name, IMU (gyroscope) raw data, wearer ID (uuid), and audio data from the world camera microphone if switched on.
The processing of this data is based on Art.
6 (1) b.
GDPR. Training Videos In order to improve individual gaze estimation accuracy, users will be able to perform a special routine for a wearer, which consists of recording a short video while looking at a reference gaze target on the cell phone screen.
We then use the eye-tracking data and metadata to fine-tune the âuniversalâ neural network into a personalized neural network, which can then be uploaded to the corresponding spectacle device.
For this process, we collect the spectacle serial number, cell phone ID and wearer ID (uuid).
The processing of this data is based on Art.
6 (1) b.
and f.
GDPR as the training data is used to improve the accuracy of the Services in order to best fulfil the contractual obligations and to improve the quality of the Services in general.
