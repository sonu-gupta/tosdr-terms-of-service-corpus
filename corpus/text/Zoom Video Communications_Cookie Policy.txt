What are Cookies and Does Zoom Use Them?
Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by websites and services that you visit or access.
They are widely used to make websites and services work and function with greater efficiency, and to provide information about our usersâ experience during use of, or interaction with, our websites, Products, services and advertisements.
Some cookies last only for the duration of your web session and expire when you exit your browser.

Purpose


Required Cookies 
Core
These cookies are required to enable basic site functionality such as providing a secure login and remembering your progress through an order. 
Performance
Zoom uses performance cookies for load balancing to ensure that websites and Products remain up and operating.
Functional Cookies
Preferences and Settings
These cookies are used to record a userâs choice and settings that enable our websites and Products to operate correctly or that maintain your preferences over time and may be stored on your device.
For example, Zoom saves preferences, such as language, browser and multimedia player settings, which enables the browser to remember these setting each time you return to the site. 
Sign-in and Authentication
When you sign into a website or Product using your Zoom account, we store a unique ID number, and the time you signed in, in an encrypted cookie on your device.
This cookie allows you to move from page to page within the website without having to sign in again on each page.
You can also save your sign-in information, so you do not have to sign in each time you return to the site.
Analytics
To provide our products and improve your user experience on our websites and with our Products, Zoom uses cookies and other identifiers to gather usage and performance data.
For example, we use cookies to count the number of unique visitors to a web page or service or to our blog and to develop other statistics about the operations of our Products.
This includes cookies from Zoom and from third-party analytics providers.
We use the information to compile reports and to help us improve our websites and Products.

Note: If you opt out of interest-based advertising, we store your opt-out preference in a cookie on your device.
Social Media Cookies
Some of our websites and Products include code snippets provided by social media companies that can sense if you are already logged into a given social media account so you can easily share Zoom content with other social media users via that account.
