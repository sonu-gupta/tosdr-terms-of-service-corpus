naturesbounty.com 
will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court or to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a partyâs copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights.

However, an arbitrator can award all remedies (except for class, consolidated, or representative action remedies) to which a Party is entitled under applicable law and which would otherwise be available in a court of law (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow these Terms of Use as a court would.

Arbitration Process: As specified in the AAAâs rules, to begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a written Demand for Arbitration that describes your claim and the relief you seek to our registered agent at Corporation Service Company, 80 State Street, Albany, NY, 12207.
Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAAâs rules.
We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.
Likewise, the Company will not seek attorneysâ fees and costs in arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.
You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.

Applicable Law

The Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the state of New York, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Terms of Use and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and the Company or its affiliates.
