Notice of Right to Opt-Out of Sale of Personal Information


California residents may opt out of the âsaleâ of their personal information.&nbsp.
Under the CCPA, âsaleâ is broadly defined to mean the sharing of personal information with third parties who are not acting as our service providers or who are otherwise not restricted from using data only on our behalf or pursuant to an applicable CCPA exception.
In some circumstances, we may share certain of your information with third parties to provide you with offers, promotions, and opportunities that may be of interest to you, which may be considered a âsaleâ under the CCPA.&nbsp.
Under the CCPA, âsaleâ may also include allowing third parties to âcollectâ certain information, such as IP address, and/or browsing behavior, through cookies and similar technologies, to deliver targeted advertising on the Services or other services.&nbsp.
Advertising, including targeted advertising, enables us to provide you certain content for free and allows us to provide you offers relevant to you.
If you would like to opt out of our use of your information for such purposes that are considered a âsaleâ under California law, you may do so as outlined on the following page:&nbsp.
Do Not Sell My Personal Information.&nbsp.
Please note that we do not knowingly sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age without legally-required affirmative authorization.
The CCPA further provides you with the right to not be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising your access, deletion or sale opt out rights.


California âShine the Lightâ Disclosure


 
If a company shares âpersonal informationâ (as defined in Californiaâs âShine the Lightâ law, Civil Code Â§ 1798.83) with third parties for their direct marketing purposes (e.g., to send offers and information that may be of interest to you), California law requires either providing a mechanism by which consumers can obtain more information about such sharing over the prior calendar year, or providing a mechanism by which consumers can opt out of such sharing.&nbsp.
As discussed above, we provide an opt out for this sharing.&nbsp.
If you are a California resident and would like to opt out of sharing pursuant to this law, please use the âDo Not Sell My Personal Informationâ link above.
