Processing (Personal) Data through the Siteimprove Intelligence Platform
At customers' authorization, Siteimprove runs the Siteimprove Intelligence Platform on customers' websites.
Customers are the data controllers and responsible for establishing the legal basis for the use of the Siteimprove Intelligence Platform.
Siteimprove encourages customers to conclude a data processing agreement (DPA) with Siteimprove.
Siteimprove's DPA-template can be found here.
The Siteimprove Intelligence Platform is only intended for use on the publicly available websites and the processing of Personal Data on those websites, including: name, address, photo, email and phone.
2.1.
What Personal Data does Siteimprove process through the Siteimprove Intelligence Platform?
The Siteimprove Intelligence Platform is designed and developed to collect and process content on customersâ websites, such as storage of cached copies of customersâ website content.
Accordingly, Siteimprove may only collect Personal Data which are present on the website on which Siteimprove services (Web accessibility, Performance ...) are being used.
The categories of Personal Data collected through the Siteimprove Intelligence Platform depend on the content of the websites but will most likely not include processing sensitive data.
If using Siteimprove Analytics, IP addresses of visitors to the customerâs website will also be processed unless IP anonymization has been set as standard by the customer.
If using Siteimprove Ads, emails connected to customer's existing Google accounts will also be processed. 
2.2.
How does Siteimprove get Personal Data in these instances?
Collection of Personal Data may occur when the Siteimprove Intelligence Platform crawls customers' websites.
This may include Personal Data and any other identifier which are present on the website on which Siteimprove services are being used.
2.3.
What is the legal basis for processing Personal Data in these instances?
Customer acts as the data controller and determines the legal basis.
Siteimprove acts as data processor and processes Personal Data on behalf of customer on the basis of a contractual relationship for the purpose of providing its services to the customer.

2.4.
Does Siteimprove use any sub-processors in these instances (and why)?
Siteimprove uses two sub-processors for data storing:
- Interxion, Denmark (server/storage vendor)
- Amazon Web Services, Germany (server/storage vendor)
2.5.
How long does Siteimprove keep Personal Data in these instances?
Crawls of customers' websites will be overwritten after five days while under contract.
Following termination of the contract, scans will be removed from the backup scheme within 30 days. 
2.6.
Where is Personal Data physically located?
Personal Data is stored in data centers located in the EU (see section 2.4 above) and will not be transferred to vendors outside the EU/EEA.

This depends on the specific customer and prospect.
Personal Data may include, but is not necessarily limited to: name, address, phone, photo, email, CVR/VAT, bank account etc.
