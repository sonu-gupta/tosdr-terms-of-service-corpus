Arbitration shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state arbitration law.
The arbitration shall be conducted before one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes from the American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ) or JAMS.
As modified by these Terms of Use, and unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties in writing, the arbitration will be governed by the AAAâs or JAMSâs rules for commercial arbitration and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the procedures for consumer-related disputes.
You are thus GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights EXCEPT for matters that may be taken to small claims court.
Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury.
You are entitled to a FAIR HEARING, BUT the arbitration procedures are SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT.
Arbitrator decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT.
You and we must abide by the following rules: (1) ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR US MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIESâ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
(2) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSONâS CLAIMS, MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF, (3) in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation, (4) we also reserve the right in our sole and exclusive discretion to assume responsibility for all of the costs of the arbitration.
(5) the arbitrator shall honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law.
(6) the arbitratorâs award shall be final and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.
(7) the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are permitted by applicable law.
and (8) each side pays its own attorneysâ fees and expenses unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid its feesâ and litigation expenses, and then in such instance, the fees and costs awarded shall be determined by the applicable law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or we may bring an individual action in small claims court.
Further, claims of infringement or misappropriation of the other partyâs patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret shall not be subject to this arbitration agreement.
Such claims shall be exclusively brought in the state or federal courts located in New York, New York.
Additionally, notwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before the state or federal courts located in New York, New York in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration, and hereby agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts located within New York, New York for such purpose.
A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to arbitrate.
With the exception of subparts (1) and (2) in the above stated rules (prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis), if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Agreement, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein.
If, however, either subparts (1) and (2) in the above stated rules (prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor we shall be entitled to arbitration.
If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the dispute shall be exclusively brought in state or federal court in New York, New York.
