The Markup investigates how powerful institutions use technology to change our society.
We make a promise to you, our readers: The Markup will collect as little personal information about you as possible when you visit our site, and we will never monetize this data.
We do not intend to display advertisements on our site, because they so often contain tracking technology.
We do want to collect some basic information so we can better serve you.
The data we collect includes information about the device and software you use to access our Website (user-agent header), the time of your visit, and the page you were visiting before arriving at our Website (referrer header).
We generally attempt to prevent the logging of your IP addresses.
However, we may need to log them from time to time, for example to mitigate abuse or investigate issues with our site.
We will keep such data only for as long as is needed.
Some of you voluntarily share some personal information with us when you sign up for newsletters or to be contacted by us.
We will not rent, lease, or sell this voluntarily submitted data to third parties without your explicit consent, unless required by law.
If we are compelled to share data about users with law enforcement, we will attempt to give notice to those users.
We will, by necessity, share your email address with our email service provider, Revue.
Please consult Revueâs privacy policy for further details.
We also collect data from donors when they donate to support our work.
As with all other personal information, we do not share, loan, trade, rent, or sell donor information to third parties, nor will we send mailings to our donors on behalf of any other organization.
If you share personal information with The Markup, it stays with The Markup.
Our donor payment processor is Stripe, whose privacy policy is here.
In order to comply with credit card processing requirements, The Markupâs Website includes third-party javascript from Stripe that may contain other tracking.
However, this content is only loaded upon clicking the âDonate!â button on the donations page.
We also use hCaptcha (whose privacy policy is here) to minimize credit card testing fraud on our website. 
We maintain historical records of donor giving histories for certain types of gifts.
This information is gathered so The Markup can properly acknowledge gifts for IRS purposes and is also used by The Markup to analyze giving histories.
This applies to donations and donor information received both online and offline.
We take reasonable steps to protect the data that we collect.
The data that we store is encrypted.
We use HTTPS to encrypt the data sent to and from our Website.
We do not use âcookies,â a technology that would allow us to identify unique users by a temporary device-related ID.
We host our Website on Amazon Web Services, whose privacy policy is here.
Our privacy policy will likely evolve as our Website evolves.
We promise to update it when our practices change and to be transparent about what weâve changed and why weâve made those changes.

The criteria used to determine our retention periods include: whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example, certain laws require us to keep records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete them), or whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (for example, in light of applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).

Email subscription information is retained until you unsubscribe from the mailing list(s).
If you communicate by email with The Markup, we may keep records of those communications indefinitely.

However, please understand that deleted information may continue to persist on backup media. â© link Security
The Markup employs reasonable measures to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control, including appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.
