Your California Privacy Rights


Sharing for Direct Marketing

A.
A California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (âCalifornia customerâ) is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes.
In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request by a California customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed.
B.
However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing customerâs personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy.
Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right.
C.
California customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing support@tvtime.com.
Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this e-mail address.
