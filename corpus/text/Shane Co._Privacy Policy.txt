For example, like many websites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses shaneco.com or advertisements.
We may collect information about the browser you're using.
We might look at what site you came from, or what site you visit when you leave us.
We may also look at clickstream data.
We may combine this information with other information we collect from you.
This includes anything we collect from third parties.
If you use our mobile website, we may collect your GPS location and your unique device identifier.
Device Identifiable Information.
We may collect information that does not identify you personally, but is linked to your computer or device ("Device Identifiable Informationâ).
We collect Device Identifiable Information from you in the normal course of operating our Website.
When you visit our Website to browse, read or download information, we automatically collect information about your computer that your browser sends, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times, pages visited, and referring website addresses.
We may use Device Identifiable Information we collect to analyze trends, help administer the Web Site, track the movement of visitors, to learn about and determine how much time visitors spend on each page of the Web Site, how visitors navigate throughout the Web Site or the Service and to gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
We may also collect Device Identifiable Information through "cookiesâ or "web beaconsâ as explained below.
We may also collect information about your mobile device such as the type and model, operating system (e.g.
iOS or Android), carrier name, mobile browser (e.g.
Chrome, Safari), applications using our Website, and identifiers assigned to your device, such as its iOS Identifier for Advertising (IDFA), Android Advertising ID (AAID), or unique device identifier (a number uniquely given to your device by your device manufacturer), sometimes referred to as a mobile carrier ID.
We may also collect your location information, such as your zip code or the approximate geographic area provided by your Internet service provider (ISP) or location positioning information provided by the location services and GPS features of your mobile device when location services have been enabled.

 We collect information in different ways.

We collect information from you passively.
On our platforms, which include our sites, we collect information passively.

For example, to get purchase information from Affiliates, we may gather information passively on their platforms.
Tools we use include browser cookies and web beacons.

 What are "cookies", "pixels", "widgets" and "analytics"? Cookies are unique identifiers that we transfer to your device to enable our systems to recognize your device and to provide features, such as Shane Co.
MyWay, personalized advertisements on other Web sites, and storage of items in your Shopping Cart between visits.

The Help feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.
Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the Web site of its manufacturer.
Because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of ShaneCo.comâs essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on.
For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to add items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to Checkout, or use any ShaneCo.com products and services that require you to Sign in.

âPixelsâ/âWeb Beaconsâ (also known as Web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our Services for several purposes, including to deliver or communicate with Cookies, to track and measure the performance of our Services, to monitor how many visitors view our Services, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising.
Unlike Cookies, which are stored on the userâs hard drive, Web Beacons are typically embedded invisibly on web pages (or in an e-mail).

âSocial Media Widgetsâ such as the Facebook âLikeâ button and LinkedIn (that might include widgets such as the share this button or other interactive miniprograms) may be on our Site.
These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.
These social media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Website.
Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

 We may also use Google Analytics and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting to collect information regarding visitor behavior and visitor demographics on some of our Services, and to develop website content.
This analytics data is not tied to any Personal Information.
For more information about Google Analytics, please visit https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites.
You can opt out of Googleâs collection and Processing of data generated by your use of the Services by going to tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.

Functionality Related.
We may use cookies, web beacons, or other similar technologies that allow us to offer you enhanced functionality when accessing or using our sites, services, applications, or tools.

These cookies contain no personally identifiable information.
The cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us, e.g., your email address, that we may share with a data provider solely in hashed, non-human readable form.

Depending on your choice we may send this type of information via email, text, call, push notifications in apps, or notifications by regular mail.
We also use information to customize offers you receive.
This includes using your shopping history on Affiliates or other third-party platforms.
We utilize Third-Party service providers, and use your information to perform those functions. We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.

We may share information with any successor to all or part of our business.
As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or business units.
In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise).
Also, in the unlikely event that Shane Co., or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets
We may share information for other reasons we may describe to you.

 You have certain choices about sharing and marketing practices.
You can choose not to provide us with information.
You can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to make a purchase or to take advantage of such ShaneCo.com features as Your Account, Shane Co.

Except where prohibited, by visiting and using ShaneCo.com, you agree that: (1) any and all questions, controversies, claims and causes of action arising out of or connected with the construction, validity, interpretation, and enforceability of this Privacy Policy shall be resolved exclusively by means of arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules, in Denver, Colorado, and shall be resolved individually, without resort to any form of class action or representative action, and you agree that you shall not seek to aggregate any claims with other individuals.
(2) SHANE CO.âS LIABILITY ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY WHETHER IN CONTRACT, IN TORT, UNDER ANY WARRANTY, IN NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF $1.00 AND SHALL BE FURTHER LIMITED TO ACTUAL DAMAGES EQUAL TO OR LESS THAN SUCH AMOUNTS, RESPECTIVELY, AND TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, NEGLIGENCE, SHANE CO.
SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR, AND YOU WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO CLAIM ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES OR ATTORNEYS FEES ARISING OUT OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, AND ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE DAMAGES MULTIPLIED OR OTHERWISE INCREASED (EVEN IF YOU OR ANY OF YOUR AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), AND TO RECOVER OTHER SUCH RELATED COSTS OF BRINGING A CLAIM, NOR SHALL AN ENTRANT BE ENTITLED TO RESCIND THIS AGREEMENT NOR SEEK INJUNCTIVE OR ANY OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF.
Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

Claims shall be heard by a single arbitrator.
The place of arbitration shall be Denver, Colorado.
The arbitration shall be governed by the laws of the State of Colorado without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules of the State of Colorado or of any other jurisdiction.
Depositions shall be limited to a maximum of three per party and shall be held within twenty days of the making of a request.
Additional depositions may be scheduled only with the permission of the arbitrators, and for good cause shown.
Each deposition shall be limited to a maximum of seven hours duration.
Time is of the essence for any arbitration under this agreement and arbitration hearings shall take place within ninety (90) days of filing and awards rendered within one hundred twenty (120) days.
The Arbitrator shall agree to these limits prior to accepting appointment.
The arbitrator will have no authority to award punitive or other damages not measured by the prevailing party's actual damages, except as may be required by statute.
The prevailing party shall not be entitled to an award of attorney fees.
Except as may be required by law, neither a party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of both parties.
The parties agree that failure or refusal of a party to pay its required share of the deposits for arbitrator compensation or administrative charges shall constitute a waiver by that party to present evidence or cross-examine witness.
In such event, the other party shall be required to present evidence and legal argument as the arbitrator may require for the making of an award.
Such waiver shall not allow for a default judgment against the non-paying party in the absence of evidence presented as provided for above.
