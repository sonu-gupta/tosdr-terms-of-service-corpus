Abuse PolicyWe treat all abuse reports concerning Zoho seriously and are dedicated to investigating all violations submitted to us.
If you come across content on Zoho that you think violates our Terms of Service, please report a violation.
After you submit a report, we'll investigate it and take the appropriate action.
We'll get back to you only if we require additional details or have more information to share.
We may close your report without a response, if we believe that the reported instance does not amount to a violation.
Report AbuseTypes of AbuseWe have sorted various kinds of abuse into the following categories:

Spam, Malware and Phishing â Users are prohibited from using Zoho Services for the transmission of "junk mail", "spam", "chain letters", âphishingâ or unsolicited mass distribution of email.
An example of a phishing attempt is an email requesting you to reveal your credit card number to be eligible for a prize amount.

Promotes Hatred, Violence or Illegal/Offensive Activitiesâ Transmission or publishing any content that (i) is unlawful, illegal, hateful, promotes racism or promotes discrimination or hatred based on ethnicity, and (ii) defames, abuses, harasses, stalks, threatens or otherwise violates privacy and other legal rights of others, are explicitly considered as prohibited activities by Zoho.

Sexually Explicit Materialâ Sexually explicit materials are those materials that contain adult or mature content.
We do not authorize users to publish or transmit sexually explicit material using Zoho Services.

Child Exploitationâ We have a zero tolerance policy towards content that exploits children.
This means we will terminate the accounts of any user that we find sharing or publishing child abuse content.
We will also report the content and its owner to law enforcement authorities.

Personal and Confidential Information â We do not allow use of Zoho services to publish personal and confidential information of persons that is not publicly accessible without their explicit consent.
Examples of personal and confidential information are full name, phone number, address, social security number, credit card number, government issued identification card details and bank information.

Copyright infringementâ Copyright infringement occurs when someone other than the copyright holder copies the âexpressionâ of a work.
If you discover that there has been copyright infringement by a Zoho user involving your work we will take necessary action as specified here.

Other Violationsâ If you believe that you have a violation to report, that does not fall within any of the categories mentioned above, you may choose this to report such violation.
Please note that you will be required to provide a description of such violation for us to take an appropriate action. Apps
