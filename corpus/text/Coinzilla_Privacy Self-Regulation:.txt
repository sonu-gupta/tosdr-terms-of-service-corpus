Customers are able to control the interest-based content and ads they receive through several options:



The display of interest-based ads from Coinzilla can be disabled by clicking on the opt-out button below. It should be noted that you will still be able to see Coinzilla's content recommendations even if the opt-out function is enabled.
Opting out prevents Coinzilla from using your Information to generate recommendations based on your particular interests.
The recommendations you will receive from now on will be based on the specific website you are visiting (i.e., contextually based ads).

You can opt-out using our form at Coinzilla opt-out page.



Not Opted Out: You will receive personalized recommendations from Coinzilla based on your browsing history.


Opted Out: Your activity will no longer be tracked by Coinzilla, and, therefore, you will not be receiving personalized content recommendations derived from your past online activities


As we individually track device or browser operations, you will need to opt-out on each device and browser, individually, in order to completely opt out across multiple devices.


Your opt-out may not come into effect if your browser is set to reject cookies, as we have already recognized your opt-out configuration based on an opt-out cookie that we've sent to you.
For the opt-out to be effective in this scenario, you will be required to confirm that your browser has the proper configuration.
Users that have a Safari browser on iOS11 or macOS High Sierra first have to change their Privacy and Security Settings in order to disable "Prevent Cross-Site Tracking" and "Block All Cookies", and then access, once again, this privacy policy or their opt-out platform of choice to reset the opt-out settings.


Technologies that do not use cookies may be used by Coinzilla in very few specific situations.
These technologies work in a similar manner to cookies, as they help us to create tailored ad recommendations based on your interests and keep track if the opt-out function was enabled.
Please keep in mind that you may not be able to restrict the use of non-cookie technologies with certain web browsers, but you can go to the "User Choices" section on this page and click on the Opt-Out feature to have this function enabled.




Users can also disable getting targeted ads from Coinzilla and other advertising companies.


The NAI opt out tool stops Coinzilla and other NAI-approved member companies from sending you targeted ads.
The NAI offers a guideline on how to opt out from mobile devices that run on Android, iOS, and Windows Phone operating systems.


The Digital Advertising Alliance affiliate websites also feature more information regarding User Choices and how to disable targeted advertising for each of the member companies.
