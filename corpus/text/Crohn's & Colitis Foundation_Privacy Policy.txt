We want to share with you all the ways that we use and protect the important information you provide to us.
We collect information in order to further our mission to cure Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, and to improve the quality of life of children and adults affected by these diseases. When we collect information, that allows us to help you on a more personal level.
We can better respond to your questions, understand your needs, and quickly provide you with relevant information. We can also compare your information with that of others to identify trends.  
The information below details our policy, procedures and practices, as well as how you can opt out from sharing your information with us.

Donor privacy policy/donor information sharing and opt-out
The Crohn's &amp.
Colitis Foundation will sometimes share our donorâs names and physical mailing addresses with other reputable healthcare non-profit organizations in order to maintain an active and growing donor list, which is part of our efforts to fulfill our mission.
We have found this to be a very cost-effective approach to finding new donors who care about finding cures for IBD.

We DO NOT share email addresses, phone numbers, or health-related data with any other organizations.&nbsp.
 

Your name is only available to these organizations for a very limited time and your name and address will be grouped with other donor records from other organizations, and will not be identified in the mailing list as coming from the Crohnâs &amp.
Colitis Foundation.

Your contact information will not be reusable by these other organizations unless you choose to respond to their initial mailing. 

To opt-out from donor mailing address list sharing with other reputable health organizations at any time, simply: 
Email us at info@crohnscolitisfoundation.org with the request âDo Not Shareâ in the subject line or message (please include the physical mailing address) 
Call us at 1-800-932-2423 to ask us to update the record.
Send a letter to us at: 733 3rd Avenue, Suite 510, NY, NY 10017 Attention: Donor Relations



You may also opt-out at any time to cease receiving direct communications from the Foundation.
