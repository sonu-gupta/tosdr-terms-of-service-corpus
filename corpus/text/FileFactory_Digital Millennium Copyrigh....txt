A person "authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed."

Identify the copyrighted work that you believe is being infringed, or if a large number of works are appearing at a single website, a representative list of the works.
Identify the material that you claim is infringing your copyrighted work, to which you are requesting that FileFactory.com disable access over the World Wide Web.
Identify the location of the material on the World Wide Web by providing "information reasonably sufficient to permit FileFactory.com to locate the material."
