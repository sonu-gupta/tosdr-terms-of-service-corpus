Childrenâs Online Privacy and Protection Act (âCOPPAâ) requires that online service providers obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting personal information from children under 13.
If you are a School providing the Service to children under 13 (whether in the U.S.
or elsewhere), you represent and warrant that you have received consent from parents, or have the authority to provide consent on behalf of parents, for us to collect information from students before allowing children under 13 to access DeltaMath Services.
We recommend that all Schools provide appropriate disclosures to students and parents regarding their use of service providers such as DeltaMath.
When DeltaMath is used by a School for an educational purpose, DeltaMath may collect or have access to Student Data that is provided by the School or by the Student.
âStudent Dataâ is personal information that is directly related to an identifiable Student and may include âeducational recordsâ as defined by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (âFERPAâ), 20 U.S.C.

Student Data Retention and Deletion Requests.DeltaMath retains Student Data, but for educational purposes only.
Oftentimes students will want to refer back to their DeltaMath student accounts for college or other future courses.
However, if a student does not utilize their account for a period of two years, their account and personally identifiable information will be deleted.
Additionally, Schools may request that we delete Student Data in our possession at any time by providing such a request in writing.
We shall respond to the deletion request as soon as possible, but in most instances within 45 days, other than for data stored on backup tapes which shall be deleted in the ordinary course of business.
A Parent seeking to modify, correct, or delete personal information in a Student Account that is connected to an active School account will be instructed to contact the School to discuss data deletion or modification.
We are not required to delete data that has been derived from Student Data so long as it has been anonymized such that it does not reasonably identify an individual.Use LicenseThe Service and the DeltaMath Technology are intended solely for the personal, non-commercial use of our users and may only be used in accordance with this Agreement.
