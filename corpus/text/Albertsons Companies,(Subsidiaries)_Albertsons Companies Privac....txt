Once you elect to apply earned Rewards toward a Grocery Rewards offer and confirm your selection, the applicable Rewards are deducted from your Account and cannot be used for another Grocery Reward offer or for Gas Rewards or be reinstated in any way.
You may claim your redeemed Grocery Rewards item through the end of the following calendar month (e.g., Grocery Rewards items redeemed and confirmed in April are available to pick up through the end of May).

Rewards earned during each calendar month may be used only until the end of the following calendar month, after which such Rewards expire (Rewards earned in January, for example, expire at the end of February).
Moreover, any remaining Point totals less than 100 Points expire at the end of each calendar month. 4.

UPDATED Supplemental Privacy Statement For California Consumers
Effective: January 1, 2021&nbsp.
 Updated: February 2, 2021
If you are a California Consumer, this Supplemental Privacy Statement (âCA Statementâ or âNoticeâ) also applies to you and appends the terms of our Privacy Policy.
Capitalized terms used but not defined herein, shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in California Civil Code Â§ 1798.100, et seq.
(together with the regulations thereunder, the âCCPAâ), as applicable.
Consistent with the CCPA, information concerning job applicants, current and former employees and independent contractors (collectively, âPersonnelâ), and subjects of certain business-to-business communications acting solely in their capacity (âB2B data subjectsâ) as representatives of another business is exempt from some or all of the requirements of the CCPA.&nbsp.
This Notice does not apply to B2B data subjects, and only Sections 1 and 2 apply to Personnel.&nbsp.
Publicly available information is also not treated as Personal Information (âPIâ) under the CCPA, so this notice is not intended to apply to that data and your Consumer privacy rights do not apply to that data.
Sections 1 and 2 of this Notice cover our Collection, use, disclosure, and Sale of California Consumersâ and our Personnelâs PI for the twelve months preceding January 1, 2021, and will be updated annually.
Our practices in calendar year 2021 may change.
However, if our practices are materially different such that we think a Consumer would reasonably expect notice, we will provide notice in connection with the applicable collection and use in other applicable privacy policies and notices.
Section 4 of this Notice describes the rights California Consumers have under the CCPA and how to exercise them, but does not apply to Personnel.


This Notice reflects our good faith understanding of the law and our data practices as of the date posted (set forth above).&nbsp.
Accordingly, we may from time-to-time update information in this and other notices regarding our data practices and your rights, modify our methods for responding to your requests, and/or supplement our response to your requests, as we continue to develop our compliance program to reflect the evolution of the law and our understanding of how it relates to our data practices.

If you cannot meet that standard, we will treat your request as a âcategories requestâ as explained in the next section.
To protect your security and the rights of others, we may not be able to provide you all of the PI we may have on you.
See Section 4(f) below for more details.

Categories

California Consumers have the right, no more than twice in a twelve-month period, to request that we disclose the categories of PI collected in the prior 12 months.

You will be asked to provide your name, email address, country of residence, state, and request details.
A confirmation email will be sent to the email address you provide to begin the process to verify your identity.
To protect your privacy and security we require verification of your identity to a reasonable degree of certainty based on information we already have about you.
If you cannot meet that standard, we will refer you to this Notice where you can review our categories disclosures generally in Sections 1 and 2 above
(b) Right to Delete
Except to the extent we have a basis for retention under the CCPA, you may request that we delete your PI that we have Collected directly from you and are maintaining.&nbsp.
Our retention rights include, without limitation, to complete transactions and provide services you have requested or that are reasonably anticipated, for security purposes, for legitimate internal business purposes, including maintaining business records, to comply with law, to exercise or defend legal claims, and to cooperate with law enforcement.
Note also that we are not required to delete your PI that we did not Collect directly from you.
To make a request, click here, or call us at (877) 251-6559 (toll free).
You will be asked to provide your name, email address, country of residence, state, and request details.
A confirmation will be sent to the email address you provide to begin the process to verify your identity and to confirm that you want to delete your information.
To the extent that we are able to sufficiently verify your identity and have a basis for retaining some of the PI you requested that we delete, we will explain the basis for the retention and will only retain it for such purpose and for so long as the retention purpose continues to exist.
Rather than exercising a deletion request, you may alternatively exercise more limited control of your PI by instead opting out of e-mail marketing communications by following the unsubscribe instructions on the footer of those emails.  
(c) âDo Not Sell My Personal Informationâ
While California law also allows for California residents to opt out of the sale of their PI, we do not believe that we currently Sell PI of California Consumers as those terms are defined by the CCPA, but reserve the right to do so in the future.&nbsp.
However, we offer California Consumerâs the ability to opt-out of future Sales here or call us at (877) 251-6559 (toll free).&nbsp.
Although we believe that Third Party cookies we permit to be associated with our online Services restrict their data processing to what is permitted by Service Providers under the CCPA as to California Consumers, and thus do not result in a Sale of PI by us, to learn more about cookie choices here.

(d) Verification Process
After you (or a qualified agent which you duly authorize) submits a request to know or delete your PI, we are required to Verify your request to ensure that the request is not fraudulent (âVerifiable Consumer Requestâ)â.
Thus, upon receiving your request we will take measures to verify that the request is legitimate.
These verification efforts may require additional information from you which may include information you have provided us in the past.
For instance, if you have previously provided your name to us, we may ask you for other information (e.g., last four digits of your credit card, email address, phone number, or transaction history) so that we can match the new information you provide with the information we have.
We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
If through reasonable efforts we are unable to verify your request to the appropriate degree of certainty, we will notify you.
We will use PI provided in a Verifiable Consumer Request only to verify your identity or your authority to make the request and to track and document request responses, unless you also gave it to us for another purpose.
(e) Agent Requests
Note you can authorize an agent to exercise any of these California privacy rights on your behalf, subject to the agent request requirements of the CCPA.
Note that we will take additional measures to verify the legal authority of your agent.
Agents should contact us here.
(f) Exceptions
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, we may Collect, use and disclose your PI as required or permitted by applicable law and this may override your CCPA rights.
In addition, we need not honor any of your requests to the extent that doing so would infringe upon our or any other person or partyâs rights or conflict with applicable law.
Further, to protect your privacy and security we will not provide you with access to or copies of sensitive PI such as government identification or financial account numbers, passwords or answers to security questions or biometric identifiers.
provided, however, that we will inform you if we maintain any such applicable types of PI. 
Some PI we maintain about Consumers is not sufficiently associated with enough PI about the Consumer for us to be able to verify that it is a particular Consumerâs PI when a Consumer request that requires verification pursuant to the CCPAâs verification standards is made (e.g., clickstream data tied only to a pseudonymous browser ID).&nbsp.
As required by the CCPA, we do not include that PI in response to those requests.
If we cannot comply fully with a request, we will explain the reasons in our response, unless we are prohibited from doing so by applicable law.  
We will make commercially reasonable efforts to identify Consumer PI that we Collect, process, store, disclose and otherwise use and to respond to your California Consumer rights requests.
In some cases, particularly with voluminous and/or typically irrelevant data, we may suggest that you receive the most recent or a summary of your PI and give you the opportunity to elect whether you want the rest or not.
We reserve the right to direct you to where you may access and copy responsive PI yourself.
We will typically not charge a fee to fully respond to your requests.
provided, however, that we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act upon a request, if your request is excessive, repetitive, unfounded or overly burdensome.
If we determine that the request warrants a fee, or that we may refuse it, we will give you notice explaining why we made that decision.
You will be provided a cost estimate and the opportunity to accept such fees before we will charge you for responding to your request.
As permitted by the CCPA, we are also not required to search for PI not maintained in a searchable or reasonably accessible format that is used for certain internal purposes only, but we apply this exception we will respond to your request with a description of the categories of PI to which this exception applies. 
In addition, as explained above, we will reject requests to the extent we are not able to sufficiently verify your identity, or your agentâs authority.
If we conclude we have a basis for not fully responding to your request, our response to you will explain the basis for the limitation, unless we are prohibited from doing so by applicable law.
(g) Financial Incentives and Non-discrimination
California residents also have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment for the exercise of any of the privacy rights conferred by the California Consumer Privacy Act.
As of the Effective Date of this CA Statement we did not offer any programs requiring you to limit any of your CCPA rights, or otherwise require you to limit your CCPA rights in connection with charging a different price or rate, or offering a different level or quality of good or service.
If we do so, the CCPA requires certain program terms and notices for California Consumer and the material aspects of any such program, and the rights of California participants, will be explained and described in its program terms.
Participating in any such programs will be entirely optional.
We may add or change programs and/or their terms by posting notice on the program descriptions so check them regularly.
Although you may participate in all of our loyalty programs on an anonymous basis (e.g., obtaining but not registering a club card) our loyalty programs allow you to provide us PI (e.g., to use your phone number as your account identifier or providing an email address to receive email communications).
Our loyalty programs provide members with various membership benefits from time-to-time explained at âjust for U,â âMonopoly,â and Gas Rewards/ Grocery Rewards / Club Card.&nbsp.
While membership is optional (you must opt-in and you can terminate at any time, as explained in the program descriptions and terms available by using the links in the prior sentence or by simply calling customer service at 877-723-3929, and you can remain in the program and still opt-out of our promotional emails and exercise your CCPA rights while electing to remain in the program and receive all of its benefits, the collection of PI for account credentials and communications, and to monitor program-related activity and otherwise operate the programs, could be characterized as a âfinancial incentiveâ under the CCPA given that we provide member-only benefits and collect PI from some, but not all members, to help facilitate that.&nbsp.
Accordingly, we provide members notice that we value the PI collected through our loyalty programs as the equivalent of our total program operating expenses (excluding the value of member benefits such as discounts), the details of which we maintain as a trade secret, and we pay these expenses and provide the program benefits to foster a positive relationship with members that is invaluable.&nbsp.
In addition, we value the PI collected through our loyalty program, as well as the value of the loyalty program, as the equivalent of the value of member benefits, such as discounts and other savings, received by members, which is also a trade secret.
However, we have determined, to the extent we can track relevant consumer activities, that our customers that use our loyalty programs redeem more manufacture coupons and Albertsons offers than do consumers not participating in our loyalty programs, which we conclude benefits them and us mutually.&nbsp.
Consumers should review the benefits description and program terms linked to in this paragraph above, as well as our full Privacy Policy, which applies to the Identifiers, Personal records, Commercial information, Online usage information, Inferences from program data and other PI we may collect in connection with our loyalty programs so that they can make an informed decision on whether to participate.&nbsp.
Also, please note that if you make a CCPA deletion request your program PI will be maintained for loyalty program operations, unless you also terminate your applicable loyalty accounts, which you may do at any time by following the instructions in the applicable program terms or calling customer service at 877-723-3929.
