Applicability Of This Privacy PolicyThis Privacy Policy applies to Slackâs online workplace productivity tools and platform, including the associated Slack mobile and desktop applications (collectively, the âServicesâ), Slack.com and other Slack websites (collectively, the âWebsitesâ) and other interactions (e.g., customer service inquiries, user conferences, etc.) you may have with Slack.
If you do not agree with the terms, do not access or use the Services, Websites or any other aspect of Slackâs business.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party applications or software that integrate with the Services through the Slack platform (âThird Party Servicesâ), or any other third party products, services or businesses.
In addition, a separate agreement governs delivery, access and use of the Services (the âCustomer Agreementâ), including the processing of any messages, files or other content submitted through Services accounts (collectively, âCustomer Dataâ).
The organization (e.g., your employer or another entity or person) that entered into the Customer Agreement (âCustomerâ) controls its instance of the Services (its âWorkspaceâ) and any associated Customer Data.
If you have any questions about specific Workspace settings and privacy practices, please contact the Customer whose Workspace you use.
If you have an account, you can check http://slack.com/account/team for contact information of your Workspace owner(s) and administrator(s).
If you have received an invitation to join a Workspace but have not yet created an account, you should request assistance from the Customer that sent the invitation.Information We Collect And ReceiveSlack may collect and receive Customer Data and other information and data (âOther Informationâ) in a variety of ways:


Customer Data.
Customers or individuals granted access to a Workspace by a Customer (âAuthorized Usersâ) routinely submit Customer Data to Slack when using the Services.

Other Information. Slack also collects, generates and/or receives Other Information:
Workspace and Account Information.
To create or update a Workspace account, you or your Customer (e.g., your employer) supply Slack with an email address, phone number, password, domain and/or similar account details.
For details on Workspace creation, click here.
In addition, Customers that purchase a paid version of the Services provide Slack (or its payment processors) with billing details such as credit card information, banking information and/or a billing address.
Usage Information.

Services Metadata.
When an Authorized User interacts with the Services, metadata is generated that provides additional context about the way Authorized Users work.
For example, Slack logs the Workspaces, channels, people, features, content and links you view or interact with, the types of files shared, and what Third Party Services are used (if any).

Log data.
As with most websites and technology services delivered over the Internet, our servers automatically collect information when you access or use our Websites or Services and record it in log files.
This log data may include the Internet Protocol (IP) address, the address of the web page visited before using the Website or Services, browser type and settings, the date and time the Services were used, information about browser configuration and plugins, language preferences and cookie data.

Device information.
Slack collects information about devices accessing the Services, including type of device, what operating system is used, device settings, application IDs, unique device identifiers and crash data.
Whether we collect some or all of this Other Information often depends on the type of device used and its settings.

Location information.
We receive information from you, your Customer and other third-parties that helps us approximate your location.
We may, for example, use a business address submitted by your employer, or an IP address received from your browser or device to determine approximate location.
Slack may also collect location information from devices in accordance with the consent process provided by your device.


Cookie Information.
Slack uses a variety of cookies and similar technologies in our Websites and Services to help us collect Other Information.
For more details about how we use these technologies, and your opt-out opportunities and other options, please see our Cookie Policy.
Third Party Services.
A Customer can choose to permit or restrict Third Party Services for its Workspace.
Typically, Third Party Services are software that integrate with our Services, and a Customer can permit its Authorized Users to enable and disable these integrations for its Workspace.
Slack may also develop and offer Slack applications that connect the Services with a Third Party Service.
Once enabled, the provider of a Third Party Service may share certain information with Slack.
For example, if a cloud storage application is enabled to permit files to be imported to a Workspace, we may receive the user name and email address of Authorized Users, along with additional information that the application has elected to make available to Slack to facilitate the integration.
Authorized Users should check the privacy settings and notices in these Third Party Services to understand what data may be disclosed to Slack.
When a Third Party Service is enabled, Slack is authorized to connect and access Other Information made available to Slack in accordance with our agreement with the Third Party Provider and any permission(s) granted by Customer (including, by its Authorized User(s)).
We do not, however, receive or store passwords for any of these Third Party Services when connecting them to the Services.
For more information on Third Party Services, click here.
Contact Information.
In accordance with the consent process provided by your device, any contact information that an Authorized User chooses to import (such as an address book from a device) is collected when using the Services.
Third Party Data.
Slack may receive data about organizations, industries, lists of companies that are customers, Website visitors, marketing campaigns and other matters related to our business from parent corporation(s), affiliates and subsidiaries, our partners, or others that we use to make our own information better or more useful.
This data may be combined with Other Information we collect and might include aggregate-level data, such as which IP addresses correspond to zip codes or countries.
Or it might be more specific: for example, how well an online marketing or email campaign performed.
Additional Information Provided to Slack.
We also receive Other Information when submitted to our Websites or in other ways, such as if you participate in a focus group, contest, activity or event, apply for a job, enroll in a certification program or other educational program hosted by Slack or a vendor, request support, interact with our social media accounts or otherwise communicate with Slack.



Generally, no one is under a statutory or contractual obligation to provide any Customer Data or Other Information (collectively, âInformationâ).
However, certain Information is collected automatically and, if some Information, such as Workspace setup details, is not provided, we may be unable to provide the Services.How We Use InformationCustomer Data will be used by Slack in accordance with Customerâs instructions, including any applicable terms in the Customer Agreement and Customerâs use of Services functionality, and as required by applicable law.
Slack is a processor of Customer Data and Customer is the controller.
Customer may, for example, use the Services to grant and remove access to a Workspace, assign roles and configure settings, access, modify, export, share and remove Customer Data and otherwise apply its policies to the Services.
Slack uses Other Information in furtherance of our legitimate interests in operating our Services, Websites and business.
More specifically, Slack uses Other Information:


To provide, update, maintain and protect our Services, Websites and business. This includes use of Other Information to support delivery of the Services under a Customer Agreement, prevent or address service errors, security or technical issues, analyze and monitor usage, trends and other activities, or at an Authorized Userâs request.

As required by applicable law, legal process or regulation.


To communicate with you by responding to your requests, comments and questions. If you contact us, we may use your Other Information to respond.

To develop and provide search, learning and productivity tools and additional features. Slack tries to make the Services as useful as possible for specific Workspaces and Authorized Users.
For example, we may improve search functionality by using Other Information to help determine and rank the relevance of content, channels or expertise to an Authorized User, make Services or Third Party Service suggestions based on historical use and predictive models, identify organizational trends and insights, to customize a Services experience, or create new productivity features and products.

To send emails and other communications. We may send you service, technical and other administrative emails, messages, and other types of communications.
We may also contact you to inform you about changes in our Services, our Services offerings, and important Services-related notices, such as security and fraud notices.
These communications are considered part of the Services and you may not opt out of them.
In addition, we sometimes send emails about new product features, promotional communications or other news about Slack.
These are marketing messages so you can control whether you receive them.
If you have additional questions about a message you have received from Slack please reach out through the contact mechanisms described below.

For billing, account management and other administrative matters. Slack may need to contact you for invoicing, account management, and similar reasons and we use account data to administer accounts and keep track of billing and payments.

To investigate and help prevent security issues and abuse.

Customer may also apply different settings to messages, files or other types of Customer Data.
The deletion of Customer Data and other use of the Services by Customer may result in the deletion and/or de-identification of certain associated Other Information.
