Important health warning about photosensitive seizures 
A very small percentage of people may experience a seizure when exposed to certain visual images, including flashing lights or patterns that may appear in video games or other online activities.
Even people who have no history of seizures or epilepsy may have an undiagnosed condition that can cause these âphotosensitive epileptic seizuresâ while playing video games. You and your Students should immediately stop playing and consult a doctor if you or they experience any symptoms such as lightheadedness, altered vision, eye or face twitching, jerking or shaking of arms or legs, disorientation, confusion, or momentary loss of awareness. Seizures may also cause loss of consciousness or convulsions that can lead to injury from falling down or striking nearby objects.
Parents and Teachers should watch for or ask their children about the above symptoms.
You can reduce risk of photosensitive epileptic seizures by taking the following precautions: 

Play in a well-lit room
Do not play if you are drowsy or fatigued

If you or any of your relatives have a history of seizures or epilepsy, consult a doctor before playing video games or other screen-focused activities.
Privacy
For information about Prodigyâs treatment of personal information, please review our current Privacy Policy, which is hereby incorporated by reference.

Prodigy will jointly comply with FERPA, along with the educational institution, by complying with requests from the educational institutions and relevant Teacher, Parent, and Student Users, as applicable, to access, correct, and disclose Student personally identifiable information in accordance with this Agreement and the Privacy Policy.

Arbitration and dispute resolution.
class action waiver
This provision allows us to promptly and efficiently resolve any dispute that may arise between us.
You and Prodigy agree that any dispute, controversy, or claim under any legal theory, including but not limited to any federal or state statutory claims, common law claims, including those based in tort, fraud, misrepresentation, or contract, arising out of or relating in any way to the Services or these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, formation, or the validity thereof, and the issue of arbitrability (collectively, the Dispute), you and Prodigy agree to the following resolution process.
All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope, conscionability, severance, and enforceability of this arbitration agreement.
The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce.
Notwithstanding the substantive law applicable to any arbitration, any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this agreement to arbitrate.
The parties agree that good-faith informal efforts to resolve disputes often can result in a prompt, low-cost, and mutually beneficial outcome.
The parties therefore agree that, before either party demands arbitration against the other, we will personally meet and confer, via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to resolve informally any claim covered by this arbitration agreement.
If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you shall also fully participate in the conference.
The party initiating the claim must give notice to the other party in writing of their intent to initiate an informal dispute resolution conference, which shall occur within 30 days after the other party receives such notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties.
To notify Prodigy that you intend to initiate an informal dispute resolution conference, write to Prodigy at legal@prodigygame.com or by mail ATTN: Legal Department at 226 Wyecroft Rd., Oakville, ON, L6K 3X7, providing your name, the contact information by which to reach you, a description of your claim, and a proposed resolution.
Engaging in an informal dispute resolution conference is a condition precedent that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration, and the Arbitrator shall dismiss any arbitration demand filed before completion of an informal dispute resolution conference.
If you and Prodigy do not reach an agreed-upon resolution within 30 days of the meet and confer, you and Prodigy agree that the Dispute will be resolved solely by binding arbitration in accordance with the then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA).
The arbitration will be heard and determined by a single neutral arbitrator who is a lawyer or retired judge, who will administer the proceedings in accordance with the AAAâs Consumer Arbitration Rules.
In resolving the Dispute, the arbitrator will consider applicable law, the provisions of this Agreement, and any facts based upon the record and no other basis, and will issue a reasoned decision.

A.
Nature, Limitations, and Location of Alternative Dispute Resolution. In arbitration, the arbitrator will resolve the submitted Dispute.
WITH ARBITRATION, THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY.
THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND ARBITRATION ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY RULES.
AND JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATION OUTCOME IS LIMITED.
All parties to the arbitration will have the right, at their own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other advocate of their choosing.
If an in-person arbitration hearing is required, then it will be conducted in the âmetropolitan statistical areaâ (as defined by the U.S.
Census Bureau) where you are a resident at the time the Dispute is submitted to arbitration.
You and we will pay the administrative and arbitratorâs fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules, but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require us to pay a greater portion or all such fees and costs in order for this arbitration agreement to be enforceable, then we will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration.
Discovery will be permitted pursuant to the applicable arbitration rules.
The arbitratorâs decision must consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim of the Dispute and must provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and any award (if any) is based.
Judgment on the arbitration decision and award (if any) may be entered into any court that has jurisdiction over the parties.

B.
Small Claims Matters Are Excluded.
As an exception to binding arbitration, you and Prodigy both retain the right to pursue, in a small claims court, any Dispute that is within that courtâs jurisdiction and proceeds on an individual (non-class) basis.
We will not demand arbitration in connection with any individual Dispute that you properly file and pursue in a small claims court, so long as the Dispute is pending only in that court.

C.
Injunctive Relief.
This arbitration agreement will not apply to any legal action taken by either party to seek an injunction or other equitable relief to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a partyâs copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights.

D.
Timing of Claim. To help resolve any Disputes promptly, you and Prodigy agree that any notice of intent to initiate an informal dispute resolution conference, or any small claims or injunctive relief complaint permitted under this Agreement must be filed, within one year after the events giving rise to the Dispute arise.
otherwise, the Dispute is waived.

E.
No Class Actions.
You and Prodigy agree that each of us may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action or proceeding.
You and Prodigy further agree that any Disputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be consolidated with any other arbitrations or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party.
Also, the arbitrators may award relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that partyâs individual claim(s).

F.
Opt-out.
You can choose to reject this arbitration agreement by sending us a written opt-out notice (Opt-Out Notice) within 30 days following the date you first agree to this Agreement, by email at legal@prodigygame.com or by mail ATTN: Legal Department at 226 Wyecroft Rd., Oakville, ON, L6K 3X7.
If mailed, the Opt-Out Notice must be postmarked no later than 30 days following the date you first agree to this Agreement.
To be effective, the Opt-Out Notice must contain your name, address, and signature.
If you opt-out of the arbitration agreement, all other parts of the Agreement will continue to apply to you.
Opting out of this arbitration agreement has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may enter with Prodigy.

G.
Survival of Arbitration Agreement.
You and Prodigy agree that the agreement to arbitrate shall survive termination of this Agreement, and the termination of any membership or account you may have Prodigy.

H.
Severance of Arbitration Agreement. If the arbitrator decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this arbitration agreementâs limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.
In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if any part of this agreement to arbitrate is deemed invalid or inapplicable, the remainder of the agreement to arbitrate shall still be considered valid and enforceable.
Nothing herein shall be construed as consent by Prodigy to the jurisdiction of any court regarding claims unrelated to the use of the Services or this Agreement.
Indemnity
You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Prodigy and its subsidiaries, agents, licensors and affiliates, and their employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors from claims, damages, obligations, losses, cost or debt and expenses (including but not limited to attorneyâs fees) arising from: (i) your use of and access to the Prodigy Content and/or the Services, including any data or content transmitted by you.

You may terminate your use of the Services at any time.
Prodigy may terminate or suspend your access to the Services or your account at any time, without prior notice or liability, if you violate any term or condition of this Agreement, if your account is inactive for a period of time, or for any other reason, which may result in the forfeiture and destruction of all information associated with your account, including progress and any upgrades or features obtained or purchased in any Prodigy game.
Upon termination of your account, your right to use or access the Services and any Prodigy Content will immediately cease. 
When an educational institutionâs use of the Services is terminated, upon request Prodigy will transfer any U.S.

Prodigy will handle the institutionâs personally identifiable information in accordance with the âAccess, correction, or deletion of informationâ section of the Privacy Policy. 
This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until terminated by Prodigy.
For clarity, your termination of your use of the Services or deletion of your account, or Prodigyâs termination or suspension of your account, does not terminate this Agreement.
