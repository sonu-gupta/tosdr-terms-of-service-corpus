Publication and disclosure of Data We can publish and disclose Data as follows:

Publication of Data

Certain of our Services provide for publication of Data.
Published Data can generally be accessed anywhere, also outside of Switzerland.
For example, the published directory data are publicly available (e.g., at local.ch, search.ch, Ã¶ffentliches-verzeichnis.ch in print editions of directories, etc.).
Data published using corresponding functions of our Services (e.g., posts, pictures, texts, videos comments, evaluations, etc.) may also be accessible to the public.
This applies likewise to the user names used for those purposes We or third parties can also publish published Data on other platforms and in other media (for instance, print media), in adapted form as necessary.
Data that are published via our Services may possibly also be indexed by search machines (such as Google) or processed by third parties on whom we have no influence.
in this way, such Data may continue to be publicly available in every country on Earth, even after this Data may have been deleted from our system.

Data processors

We can commission third parties to provide specific services (e.g., in the areas of IT, operation of applications, administration printing, shipping, etc.) and to process and store Data (known as Â«data processorsÂ»).
Data processors may have access to Personal Data and process them on Our behalf.
We obligate the data processors to comply with data protection law and only to process Data in the way that We do it Ourselves.
Data processors that may receive Personal Data may be located in any country, particularly in Switzerland, in EU and EEA countries, and in the US.

Contract partners

We can disclose Data to contract partners (for example, sales partners, service providers, customers, suppliers, financial companies etc.).
This occurs, for instance, to fulfil contractual obligations, to offer specific Services, to compare, validate, and update databases (including central address and contact data directories of Ours and of our contract partners), for debt collection and marketing purposes, to analyse the use and operation of our Services, systems, and infrastructure, for payment processing and factoring.
Possible recipients can also be acquirers or persons interested in acquiring business units, companies, or portions thereof.
Contract partners may receive access to Personal Data and process it for their own purposes (for instance, to perform a contract or to perform their own legal obligations).
In this context, they themselves are obligated to comply with applicable data protection laws.
Contract partners that may receive Personal Data may be located in any country, particularly in Switzerland, in EU and EEA countries, and in the US.

Disclosure to government agencies and other disclosure on legal grounds

In certain situations, We may disclose Data to government agencies, official bodies, and other third parties (e.g., in connection with inquiries, investigations, and clarifications from government agencies or official bodies, administrative investigations, criminal investigations, and civil and/or criminal proceedings).
We do this in cases where We are called on to do so by government agencies or official bodies, or are obligated according to Our assessment, or where We can assume in good faith that the access to the relevant Data or their use, storage, or disclosure is reasonably necessary in order to enforce applicable terms of use, to discover, prevent, o fight fraud or security flaws, or to protect the rights and property of localsearch.
If Data that is not otherwise public is transferred to a country without reasonable data protection provisions, We will ensure suitable data protection by deploying adequate contractual guarantees on the basis of EU standard contract clauses, binding corporate rules, or based on the exception of consent, of contract processing, of the determination, assertion or enforcement of legal claims, o overriding public interests, or because the transfer is necessary to protect the physical integrity of a data subject.
Where applicable data protection law so provides, You can obtain a copy of the contractual guarantees with regard to Your Personal Data from our Data Protection Office, or You can find out where such a copy can be obtained.
We reserve the right to redact such copies for reasons of data protection or for reasons of secrecy. 6.
Retention period We store Personal Data as long as this is necessary for the purpose for which We have collected them.
Specific Personal Data are also subject to legally binding retention obligations of ten or more years, which we comply with.
We can also store Personal Data for at least the term of the applicable limitation periods, which in many cases are five or ten years.
We generally delete Personal Data that accrue in connection with the use of our Services (e.g., logs, analyses, etc.) and that are not subject to any such retention or limitation periods earlier, as soon as We no longer have any interest in the Processing.
Data can also be retained for a longer period in each case in anonymized form.
Subject to any express contractual agreement, We are not obligated to You to retain Data for any particular period of time. 7.
Cookies, web analysis and tracking tools, and other technologies We use various common technologies in order to collect, store, and analyse Data when You use Our Services.
You will find more details in the Cookie policy of the respective Service. 8.
Social media plugins and integration of third-party services We integrate plugins from social networks (e.g., Facebook, Google Plus, Twitter) into our Services.
These plugins make it easier to share content on these platforms.
When visiting Our Services that contain such plugins, a connection to the server of the corresponding provider can be established automatically.
In this case, certain Data (such as, for instance, the time of visiting the Service, browser type, IP address) are collected and stored by the provider.
If You have a user account at one of these providers, that provider can assign this information to Your profile.
If You additionally interact with these plugins (e.g., by clicking on the Â«LikeÂ» button or by making a comment), this information is also transmitted to this provider, stored there, and possibly published.
When using a social login service (e.g.
Facebook Connect), the provider can transmit Personal Data to Us, such as name, e-mail address, and profile picture, which are stored at that provider about You.
In addition, We integrate services from third parties into Our Services, which make it possible for You to interact with customers and other Users of localsearch as well as third parties (as, for example, making a reservation using a booking service or providing evaluations and comments).
Any provided Data will be forwarded to these third parties for processing and performance of the corresponding service or directly processed by them.
Please note that the terms of use and data protection provisions of these third parties apply to the data processing by these third parties. 9.
Rights of data subjects Each data subject has a right to access his or her Personal Data.
In addition, he or she has the right to require Us to correct, delete and limit Personal Data relating to him or her and to object to such processing of Personal Data.
Exercise of such rights generally presumes that the data subject can unequivocally prove his or her identity.
If the processing of personal data is based on consent, the data subject is entitled to revoke his or her consent at any time.
In states of the EU or the EEA, the data subject has the right in certain cases to receive the Data generated during the use of online services in a structured, commonly used and machine- readable format that permits further use and transmission.
Please click here to exercise your rights.
We reserve the right to restrict the rights of the data subject within the limits laid down by the law from time to time in force, for instance, to only provide limited information or to refrain from deleting Data.
In addition, please note that deletion of Your Personal Data may mean that Services may no longer be available or cannot be used in whole or in part.
If We automatically make a decision affecting an individual that has legal effects vis-Ã -vis the data subject or considerably impairs this person in a similar way, the data subject can speak with a responsible person at Our offices and demand recon sideration of the decision from that person, or demand an evaluation by a person from the start, insofar as applicable law permits such an action.
In this case, the data subject may in some circumstances no longer be able to use certain automated services.
The person will be informed of such decisions separately.
Each data subject has the right to make a complaint to the responsible data protection authority.
If the data controller is based in Switzerland, the relevant authority is the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (www.edoeb.admin.ch).
