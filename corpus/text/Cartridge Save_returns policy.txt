3 year warranty on own-brand cartridges
We are proud of our own-brand cartridges, so weâve made trying them a no-brainer.
If within three years of purchase you have any problem whatsoever, weâll happily offer either a replacement or a refund.
We are confident that no other own-brand cartridges are better than ours.
They produce vibrant prints with accurate colour densities and dark blacksâand their page yields are as good as the genuines, if not better
Any items damaged in transit should be reported to us within three working days.
Printer Protection Guarantee
In the unlikely event that Cartridge Save own brand cartridges cause damage to your printerâregardless of how old your printer isâwe will repair or replace your printer for free.
If your printer is less than one year old, your manufacturerâs warranty wonât be affected by using our cartridges (this is the law).
However, in the unlikely event that our own brand products are to blame, we will take over the manufacturerâs warranty offering phone support and, if needed, repair or replace your printer.
One year returns on unopened printer cartridges
Provided that the products are unopened, and in brand-new condition, you can send anything back to us for a refund for up to one year after making the purchase.
You've ordered the wrong printer cartridges
Our printer cartridge compatibility information is highly accurate.
However, if there is any error on our website which has caused you to order the wrong printer cartridges, we will happily accept them for a full replacement or refund, even if you have opened the packaging. If you've ordered the wrong cartridges for another reason (and have opened the packaging), we may still be able to help.
Just call our team to discuss.
