TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, ZAPPOS DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DATA ACCURACY, DATA SECURITY, AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
ZAPPOS.COM MAY INCLUDE INACCURACIES, MISTAKES OR TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS.
WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE CONTENT WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, OUR TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES (REGARDLESS OF THE FOUNDATION FOR THE ACTION) SHALL NOT EXCEED IN THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US FOR THE APPLICABLE PRODUCT OR SERVICE. DISPUTES, REMEDIES &amp.
APPLICABLE LAW 
Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of any Zappos Service, or to any products or services sold or distributed by Zappos or through Zappos.com or any other Zappos website will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court.
You agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the state of Nevada (without regard to principles of conflict of laws), will govern these Conditions of Use and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and Zappos.

There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.
However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Conditions of Use as a court would.

To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent CSC Services of Nevada, Inc., 2215-B Renaissance Drive, Las Vegas, Nevada 89119.
The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes.
The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
The AAA's rules will govern payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees.
You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in Clark County, Nevada or at another mutually agreed location.

You and Zappos both agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration you and Zappos each respectively waive any right to a jury trial.
You and Zappos also both agree that either of us may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. MODIFICATION &amp.
SEVERABILITY We reserve the right to make changes to our websites, policies, Service Terms, and these Conditions of Use at any time and without notice to you.
If any of these conditions shall be deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that condition shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining condition. OUR ADDRESS Zappos.com LLC, 400 E.
Stewart Avenue, Las Vegas, NV 89101
