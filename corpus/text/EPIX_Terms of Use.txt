Resolution of Disputes: Binding Arbitration.
No Class or Representative Actions or ArbitrationsSee our FAQ for more information.20.1.
Binding Arbitration and Exclusions from Arbitration. Except as provided below OR UNLESS YOU SUBMIT A VALID ARBITRATION/CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT NOTICE (AS DESCRIBED IN SECTION 20.5), any and all Claims between you and EPIX will be resolved in binding arbitration rather than in court.You and EPIX agree to submit to individual binding arbitration for the resolution of any and all Claims by or between you and/or EPIX, except that you and EPIX agree that the following will not be subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions in this Section 20.1: (A) any Claim filed by you or EPIX with respect to any violation, enforcement or validity of patent, trademark, trade dress, service mark, copyright and/or trade secret rights of you, EPIX, or any third party, including, but not limited to, Claims related to Postings and/or other content that you upload to or share on the Applications and/or (B) you or EPIX may seek a preliminary injunction, restraining order or other provisional equitable relief in any court as provided in Section 21 in connection with any Claim whereby you or EPIX, as applicable, may suffer immediate and irreparable harm for which money damages may be inadequate and impossible to calculate (including, but not limited to, a Claim under Section 20.1(A)), where such Claim under this Section 20.1(B) will not be subject to the informal dispute resolution procedures described in Section 20.2 below.
provided, however, that, subsequent to obtaining such preliminary injunction, restraining order or other provisional equitable relief, the Claim will then be submitted to arbitration in accordance with Section 20.
You and EPIX agree that this Agreement affects interstate commerce, and that the enforceability of Section 20 will be governed by, construed, and enforced, both procedurally and substantively, by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.
sections 1â9 (âFAAâ).
Arbitration is the referral of a dispute to one or more impartial persons for a final and binding determination.
There is no judge or jury in arbitration, discovery is more limited than in court, there are no class or representative proceedings, and court review of an arbitration decision is limited.
An arbitrator must follow this Agreement and can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including, but not limited to, injunctive and declaratory relief, statutory damages, and attorneysâ fees).
âClaim(s)â means any dispute, claim or controversy by or between you and/or EPIX relating to the Applications and/or this Agreement (including, but not limited to, the Applicationsâ Privacy Policy and all Additional Terms, Rules, regulations, procedures and policies which we refer to in this Agreement), as may be modified from time-to-time, and the subject matter hereof, including, but not limited to, any contract, tort, statutory, or equity claims.20.2.
Informal Dispute Resolution. Except with respect to Claims described in Section 20.1(B) above, before either you or EPIX pursue or participate in any Claim against the other party in arbitration or court proceedings, you or EPIX must notify the other party of the Claim in writing at least 60 days in advance of initiating the arbitration or court proceeding in order to provide a reasonable opportunity to resolve the Claim.
You may send a written notice of your Claim to EPIX at 260 Madison Avenue, 9th Floor, New York, New York 10016, Attention: Business &amp.
Legal Affairs.
EPIX may send written or electronic notice of its Claim to your email address, EPIX account or any physical or other address that you have provided EPIX.
The notice must describe the Claim in reasonable detail and set forth the relief requested so that the other party has an opportunity to adequately address the Claim.
Except with respect to Claims described in Section 20.1(B) above, you and EPIX agree to negotiate in good faith with each other to try to informally resolve the Claim and, if you and EPIX do not reach an informal resolution of the Claim within 60 days from which such notice is received, then the Claim may be submitted to binding arbitration as set forth in Section 20 or court as permitted by Section 20.1.20.3.
Arbitration Proceedings and Costs. Any arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ) pursuant to its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the âAAA Rulesâ), as modified by this Agreement.
The AAA Rules, and other information about the AAA, are available at the AAAâs website at www.adr.org.
A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAAâs website (see Demand for Arbitration at: https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Demand%20for%20Arbitration%20Consumer%20Arbitration%20Rules.pdf, but contact the AAA if you have issues accessing these links) and arbitration proceedings shall be initiated in the location described in Section 21.
As required by the AAA Rules, if you initiate the arbitration proceedings, you must send the original copy of the completed form to EPIX, which should be sent to EPIX at the following address: 260 Madison Avenue, 9th Floor, New York, New York 10016, Attention: Business &amp.
Legal Affairs.
If your Claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely based on documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing under the AAA Rules.
In all cases, you and EPIX shall exchange documents and other information that you or EPIX intend to use in the arbitration.Upon filing of an arbitration demand for Claims up to $75,000, EPIX will reimburse you for all necessary filing, administration and arbitrator fees paid by you to the AAA or, if you wish EPIX to pay such fees directly to the AAA, you must request payment of such fees by EPIX by mail to the AAA along with your form initiating arbitration and EPIX will make arrangements to pay such fees directly to the AAA.
In the event the arbitrator determines that the Claim(s) you assert in the arbitration are frivolous or vexatious, you agree to reimburse EPIX for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by EPIX on your behalf.
You agree that EPIX shall have no obligation to pay any other fees except as determined by the arbitrator.For Claims that total more than $75,000, the AAA Rules will govern payment of filing, administration and arbitrator fees to the maximum extent permitted by law.
The decision of the arbitrator will be binding and conclusive on all parties, and judgment to enforce the decision may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction.20.4.
Class Action Waiver. UNLESS YOU SUBMIT A VALID ARBITRATION/CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT NOTICE (AS DESCRIBED IN SECTION 20.5), YOU AND EPIX AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR IN COURT WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.
You and EPIX expressly agree that any Claim is personal to you and EPIX, shall only be resolved by an individual arbitration (or individual court proceedings with respect to Claims excluded from mandatory arbitration as described in Section 20.1 of this Agreement), and shall in no event be brought as a class arbitration, a class action, or any other representative proceeding.
The arbitrator (or court if the Claim is excluded from mandatory arbitration as described in Section 20.1 of this Agreement) may only conduct an individual arbitration (or court action if the Claim is excluded from mandatory arbitration as described in Section 20.1 of this Agreement), and may not consolidate more than one personâs Claims and may not preside over any form of representative or class proceeding.
If a court or arbitrator determines that this class action waiver is unenforceable in an action between you and EPIX, then this Agreement to arbitrate will be unenforceable.
Neither you nor EPIX consent to class arbitration.20.5.
Right to Opt Out of Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver. If you do not wish to be bound by the mandatory arbitration and class action waiver provisions in Sections 20.1, 20.3 and 20.4, you must notify EPIX in writing (the âArbitration/Class Action Waiver Opt-Out Noticeâ), where the arbitration/class action waiver opt-out notice meets all of the following requirements:20.5.1.
