Privacy Policy
Last Revised: August 17, 2020

Parsec Cloud, Inc.
("Parsec") is committed to protecting your privacy.
We have prepared this Privacy Policy (the "Policy") to inform you of our practices regarding the data we collect from and about users of our website, (the "Site") and our downloadable desktop and mobile applications (together with the Site and any other products and services provided by Parsec, the "Services").
We provide important information for individuals located in the European Union, European Economic Area, and United Kingdom (collectively, "Europe" or "European") here and information for California residents here.

Changes to this Policy: We will post any modifications or changes to the Policy on the website.
We may modify the Policy at any time, so we encourage you to review it frequently.
The "Last Updated" legend above indicates when this Policy was last changed.
If we make any material change to the Policy, we will post a notice on the website prior to such changes taking effect.

A Note About Children.We do not intentionally gather personal information from individuals who are under the age of 13.
If we learn that a child under 13 has submitted personal information to Parsec, we will make reasonable efforts to delete the information as soon as possible.
If you believe that we might have collected any personal information from a child under 13, please contact us at legal@parsec.app.

Types of Data We Collect.We collect information about you when you use the Service or otherwise interact with us.
The types of information we collect about you includes:

Third-party platform data, such as information we collect when you visit or interact with our pages on third-party platforms as well as information that third-party platforms may provide to use when you choose to connect your account on a third-party platform.
For example, if you connect to the Service through your Discord account, we may collect information about the games you purchase or play, and information about how you interact with content on Discord.

Content you upload, the personal information that may be contained in any video, comment, or other submission you upload or post to the Service.

Data collected automatically by us, our service providers and third-party partners, who may automatically log information about you, your computer or mobile devices and your activity over time on the Service, such as:

Device data. Information about your computer or mobile device operating system type and version number, manufacturer and model, device identifier (such as the Google Advertising ID or Apple ID for Advertising), information about your deviceâs central processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU) (such as the model, number of processors, and supported features), graphics APIs in use, amount of device memory present, browser type, screen resolution, IP address, the website you visited before browsing to our website, and general location information such as city, state or geographic area.

Online activity data. Information about your use of and actions on the Service, such as pages or screens you viewed, how long you spent on a page or screen, navigation paths between pages or screens, information about your activity on a page or screen, access times, and length of access.


Sensitive personal information.We ask that you not provide us with any sensitive personal information (e.g., information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background or trade union membership) on or through the Service, or otherwise to us.
If you provide us with any sensitive personal information to us when you use the Service, you must consent to our processing and use of such sensitive personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
If you do not consent to our processing and use of such sensitive personal information, you must not submit such sensitive personal information through our Service.User Generated Content.We may make available on our website, or link to, features that allow you to generate your own content or share information online (e.g., in chat areas).
Please do not embed personal information in the content you generate or share personal information online in public or in community forums, because any such information can be collected and used by others.

Cookies.Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information.
"Cookies" are small pieces of information that a website stores to your computer or mobile device while you access the website.
We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our website.
This type of information is collected to make the website more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs.
We use the following types of cookies:


Essential Cookies - These cookies are essential to provide you with the Services and to enable you to use some of its features.
For example, they allow you to log in to secure areas of the Services and help the content of the pages you request load quickly.
Without these cookies, the Services that you have asked for cannot be provided.

Functionality Cookies -  These cookies allow the Services to remember choices you make when you use the Services, such as login details and progress within a course.
The purpose of these cookies is to provide you with a more personal experience and to avoid you having to re-enter your preferences every time you visit the Services.

Analytics and Performance Cookies -  These cookies are used to collect information about traffic to the Services and how they are used.
The information gathered does not identify any individual visitor, and is aggregated and anonymized.
It includes information like the number of visitors to our website, referring websites, pages viewed on our website, what time of day they visited our website, and whether they have visited our website before.
We use this information to help operate our website more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information and to monitor the level of activity on our website.
We use Google Analytics, and Facebook for this purpose.
You can find out more information about how to opt out of tracking technologies in our Online Tracking Opt-out Guide below.

Social Media Cookies -  These cookies are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or "like" button on the Services or you link your account or engage with our content on or through a social networking website such as Facebook, Twitter or Instagram.
The social network will record that you have done this.

Pixel Tag. In addition, we use "pixel tags" (also referred to as clear GIFs, Web beacons, or Web bugs).
Pixel tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, which are used to track online movements of Web users.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a userâs computer hard drive, pixel tags are embedded invisibly in web pages.
Pixel tags also allow us to send e-mail messages in a format users can read, and they tell us whether e-mails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users.
We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user.
We do not tie the information gathered by pixel tags to our usersâ personal information.

Do Not Track Signals. Some internet browsers may be configured to send "Do Not Track" signals to the online services that you visit.
We currently do not respond to do not track signals.
To find out more about "Do Not Track," please visit https://allaboutdnt.com/.

Online Tracking Opt-Out Guide

You can find out more information about Google Analytics cookies here and about how Google protects your data here.
