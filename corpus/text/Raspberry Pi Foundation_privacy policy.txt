We do not keep your information for any longer than we need to in order to fulfil the purpose or purposes for which it was collected, or for any longer than is required by law, if that is longer (for example, in order to comply with HMRC requirements).

the amount of harm that could be caused by a data breach.
the benefits of the purposes the data is being used for.
and any legal requirements that we are bound by.
We review the data we hold, and erase or anonymise it as appropriate, according to the retention periods specified in the table below.
You may request that we erase your personal data at any time.
In some cases where there is a relevant or legal reason that requires us to keep the data, we may opt to restrict the amount of processing being conducted to what is absolutely necessary.
This will be in line with your legal rights in order to minimise the impact the processing will have and we will explain to you the reasons for our decision.

Any transmission is at your own risk.
Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features such as encryption to try to prevent unauthorised access.
