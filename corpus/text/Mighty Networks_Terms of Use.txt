We will promptly notify you of any such claim, and will provide you (at your expense) with reasonable assistance in defending the claim.
You will allow us to participate in the defense, and will not settle any such claim without our prior written consent.
We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you.
In that event, you will have no further obligation to defend us in that matter.
You also agreed to release, indemnify, and defend your Hosts and Members from all third-party claims and costs arising out or related to:&nbsp.
i) your use of the Service, ii) Your Content, iii) your conduct or interactions with Hosts or Members, or iv) your breach of any part of this Agreement.10.
Dispute Resolution, Arbitration, and Class Action WaiverWe hope that our customer success team can resolve any issues you may have.
However, if that does not work, then both parties agree to resolve any dispute arising out of these terms exclusively by individual, binding arbitration.
The term âdisputeâ is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced, and will include disputes related to your use of the Service, this Agreement (including the scope of this provision), regardless of whether such disputes are based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, unfair competition, or some other legal theory.
Disputes regarding privacy shall be resolved by the mechanisms outlined in our&nbsp.
Privacy Policy.
The arbitration process can be a faster, simpler, less formal, and less expensive route than filing a lawsuit and going to court.
In arbitration you are still entitled to a fair hearing, but your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator (and not a judge or jury).
Arbitrator decisions are as enforceable as any court order, and are subject only to very limited review by a court.
Each party is giving up the right to sue in court and to have a trial before a judge or jury.
Each party here agrees to try in good faith for 30 days to informally resolve any dispute before starting arbitration.
A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send the other a written notice that describes the nature and basis of the dispute as well as the relief sought.
If you want to send such a notice to us, send it to legal@mightynetworks.com.
If we want to send such a notice to you, we will send it to the email address associated with your account.
If the parties do not reach an agreement to resolve the dispute within 30 days after the date the notice was sent, then the parties may start arbitration as described below.
The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the arbitration, and the arbitration will be governed by the AAAâs Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes, as modified by these terms.
Those rules and information about how to start arbitration are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
The arbitrator is bound by these terms.
The arbitration will be conducted through the submission of documents, by phone, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.
The arbitratorâs award will be final and specifically enforceable under applicable law, and judgment may be entered upon it in any court with jurisdiction.
The arbitration costs, including arbitrator compensation, will be shared between you and us according to the AAAâs Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes.
Any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action.
By agreeing to these terms, you are waiving the right to participate in a class action. Further, unless the parties mutually agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one personâs claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
If this waiver is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then the parties agree that this entire section will be unenforceable, that any dispute will be resolved exclusively in a state or federal court located in Santa Clara County, California, and that the parties both submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.
If a claim proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, the parties waive any right to a jury trial.
This section does not: (i) prevent either party from litigating any dispute in small claims court.
(ii) apply to disputes arising out of or related to infringement or other misuse of our intellectual property rights.
or (iii) prevent either party from bringing a dispute to the attention of any federal, state, or local government agencies.
If you do not want to be bound by this binding arbitration provision and class action waiver, you must notify us within 30 days of the date that you first accept or receive these terms by sending a written notification to legal@mightynetworks.com that includes your actual name and Mighty Networks user name, address, and a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with us through arbitration.11.
