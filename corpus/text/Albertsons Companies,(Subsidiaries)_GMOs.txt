Albertsons Companies believes you should always have a choice in products that align with your lifestyle and budget.
As part of our ongoing efforts to provide you that option, we require that all of our private label-suppliers meet USDA and FDA regulations.
To date, the USDA, FDA and available science make no health or nutrition distinction between approved Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) and non-GMO products and ingredients.
Our stores carry more than 45,000 products.
This includes approximately 9,500 private label-products, which feature a range of options regarding GMOs.
For instance:

Our O Organicsâ¢ line meets USDA organic standards, which do not allow the use of GMO ingredients.
We further require that all O Organicâ¢ suppliers obtain third-party organic certification.
Many of the ingredients used in our Open Natureâ¢ products are non-GMO.
Weâve begun the process to obtain Non-GMO Project verification for our Open Nature product line.
Our stores also carry a wide variety of organic produce, which is not genetically modified.


For shoppers whose lifestyles or budgets do not focus on non-GMO, we provide an extensive selection of conventional private label and national brand products.
Although Albertsons Companies supports the voluntary labeling of products making non-GMO or GMO-free claims, we are also committed to continuing to provide our customers with choices across our many categories and brands.

Genetically Engineered Salmon

Genetically Engineered (GE) salmon has been a topic of debate recently.
We are not considering nor do we have any plans to carry GE salmon.
The seafood products we offer will continue to be selected consistent with our Responsible Seafood Purchasing Policy.
