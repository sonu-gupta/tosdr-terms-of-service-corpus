Where Hotjar is in use:
 Cookie Name Purpose Expires _hjClosedSurveyInvites Hotjar cookie that is set once a user interacts with an External Link Survey invitation modal.
It is used to ensure that the same invite does not reappear if it has already been shown.
365 days _hjDonePolls Hotjar cookie that is set once a user completes a survey using the On-site Survey widget.
It is used to ensure that the same survey does not reappear if it has already been filled in.
365 days _hjMinimizedPolls Hotjar cookie that is set once a user minimizes an On-site Survey widget.
It is used to ensure that the widget stays minimized when the user navigates through your site.
365 days _hjShownFeedbackMessage Hotjar cookie that is set when a user minimizes or completes Incoming Feedback.
This is done so that the Incoming Feedback will load as minimized immediately if the user navigates to another page where it is set to show.
365 days _hjSessionTooLarge Causes Hotjar to stop collecting data if a session becomes too large.
This is determined automatically by a signal from the WebSocket server if the session size exceeds the limit.
Session _hjid Hotjar cookie that is set when the customer first lands on a page with the Hotjar script.
It is used to persist the Hotjar User ID, unique to that site on the browser.
This ensures that behavior in subsequent visits to the same site will be attributed to the same user ID.
365 days _hjRecordingLastActivity This should be found in Session storage (as opposed to cookies).
This gets updated when a user recording starts and when data is sent through the WebSocket (the user performs an action that Hotjar records).
Session _hjTLDTest When the Hotjar script executes it tries to determine the most generic cookie path to use, instead of the page hostname.
This is done so that cookies can be shared across subdomains (where applicable).
To determine this, it stores the _hjTLDTest cookie for different URL substring alternatives until it fails. After this check, the cookie is removed.
Session _hjUserAttributesHash User Attributes sent through the Hotjar Identify API are cached for the duration of the session in order to know when an attribute has changed and needs to be updated.
Session _hjCachedUserAttributes This cookie stores User Attributes which are sent through the Hotjar Identify API, whenever the user is not in the sample.
These attributes will only be saved if the user interacts with a Hotjar Feedback tool.
Session _hjLocalStorageTest This cookie is used to check if the Hotjar Tracking Script can use local storage.
If it can, a value of 1 is set in this cookie.
The data stored in_hjLocalStorageTest has no expiration time, but it is deleted almost immediately after it is created.
Under 100ms _hjIncludedInPageviewSample This cookie is set to let Hotjar know whether that user is included in the data sampling defined by your siteâs pageview limit.
30 minutes _hjIncludedInSessionSample This cookie is set to let Hotjar know whether that user is included in the data sampling defined by your siteâs daily session limit.
30 minutes _hjAbsoluteSessionInProgress This cookie is used to detect the first pageview session of a user.
This is a True/False flag set by the cookie.
30 Minutes _hjFirstSeen This is set to identify a new userâs first session.
It stores a true/false value, indicating whether this was the first time Hotjar saw this user.
It is used by Recording filters to identify new user sessions.
Session _hjViewportId This stores information about the user viewport such as size and dimensions.
Session _hjRecordingEnabled This is added when a Recording starts and is read when the recording module is initialized to see if the user is already in a recording in a particular session.
