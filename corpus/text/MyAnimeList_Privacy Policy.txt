Please exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal information in public activities or submissions.

From time to time, we may deploy technology such as application programming interfaces (or âAPIsâ) for use by third party application developers and make information concerning your public activities on the Sites, such as your comments on community message boards, available to third party websites and applications.

In other cases, we operate stores, provide services, or sell digital content or other offering jointly with these affiliates. 5.
Your choices, cookies and other tracking technologies and âdo not trackâ signals Deactivating your account If the Sites functionality permits, you can deactivate your account at any time by visiting the preferences page for your profile or delete any content you provide from the Sites, though we may retain a copy of any deactivated accounts or deleted content for compliance purposes.

We have no responsibility, other than as may be required by applicable law, to take down, remove, or edit any of your public activities or any submissions that are a result of your public activities.
For more information, please review our Terms of Use. Cookies and other tracking technologies Some information that is collected about you is collected automatically through cookies and other tracking technologies.
Cookies are small amounts of information stored in files within your computer's browser.
We may use these technologies to collect information about your activity, browser and device, and to collect information when you interact with services we offer through one of our third party partners, such as advertising.
Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default, but, if you prefer, you can usually remove or reject cookies through the settings on your browser or device.
However, please note that removing or rejecting cookies could affect the availability and functionality of our Services.
Please see our Cookie Policy for more information about how we use cookies and your choices.
 âDo not trackâ signals The âdo not trackâ (or âDNTâ) concept has been promoted by regulatory authorities for the internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites.
Various web browsers offer a DNT option that sends a signal to websites visited by the userâs browser about the user's DNT preference.
You can usually access your browser's DNT option in your browser's âpreferencesâ or similar settings.
As of the time of the posting of this Privacy Policy, there is no internet industry DNT technology standard.
We take privacy and security seriously.
With regard to DNT, the Sites do not currently respond to DNT signals in browsers because, as mentioned above, no DNT standard has been adopted.
However, as explained above, you do have choices regarding how your browser handles cookies and other similar technologies.
 Third Party Online Advertising Some of the advertisements you see on the Sites are from third parties, such as advertising agencies, advertisers, ad networks, and audience segment providers.
These third parties may collect information about you and your online activities, either on the Sites or on other websites, through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to understand your interests and tailor certain advertisements to your interests.
The Company does not have control over, or access to the information these non-affiliated third parties may collect.
Such third parties' information practices are not covered by this Privacy Policy.
If you choose to opt out of having your information used to deliver advertisements tailored to your interests, you will continue to see advertisements on the Sites, but these advertisements may not be as relevant to you.
For more information about how we use cookies and your choices, please see our Cookie Policy.

Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.

 The What and the Why In the course of using our Services, you may provide us, directly and indirectly, with both personal and non-personal information.
Personal information is information that can be used to identify you as an individual.
Non-personal information is information that does not permit direct association with you.
Both personal information and non-personal information may be used alone or in the aggregate with information collected from other users.
Certain non-personal information would be considered a part of your personal information if it were combined with other identifiers (e.g., combining your zip or postal code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified.
But the same pieces of information are considered non-personal information if they are taken alone or combined only with other non-personal information (e.g., your viewing preferences).

We describe the categories of personal information we may collect above in Section 2 of our Privacy Policy (âWhat information the Sites collectâ).
Some data we collect is necessary for enabling us to provide the registration to and usage of our Services.

This information may be used to undertake user trend analyses, demographic profiling, and analytics, and to provide to you tailored and personalized ads and advertising (behavioral advertising).

With Strategic Business Partners
We may share your information with our non-affiliated strategic business partners in connection with offering you co-branded services, selling or distributing our content, offering content or products that you may be interested in on our Services or on our partnersâ services, or engaging in other joint marketing activities.
We may also share aggregated information or certain personal information with such partners or other non-affiliated third parties to help us develop or provide you services, content, and advertising that may be of interest to you and our users.

With our Service Providers
Sharing of your information may also occur where we engage or employ service providers, vendors, or other non-affiliated third parties to help us provide our Services (e.g., improvement of our Services' features, promotion and marketing, administration, analytics, customer service, cloud storage, hosting, and other related services) (âService Providersâ), to provide the Services on our behalf, or to assist us in analyzing how our Services are being used.

If you use such third party websites and applications, they may also collect, process and share your information, including personal information.
You should review the privacy policies of any third party websites or applications before using them.

At times, we may disclose information about you to law enforcement officials or private parties as we believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of MAL or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity.
