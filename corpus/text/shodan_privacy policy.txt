 Privacy Policy
SHODAN respects and protects the privacy of the individuals that use SHODAN's search engine
services ("SHODAN Search Services").
Individually identifiable information about you is not
willfully disclosed to any third party without first receiving your permission, as explained
in this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy").

SHODAN and cookies
Upon your first visit to SHODAN, SHODAN sends a "cookie" to your computer.
A cookie is a piece
of data that identifies you as a unique user.
SHODAN uses cookies to improve the quality of our
service and to understand our user base more.
SHODAN does this by storing user preferences in
cookies and by tracking user trends and patterns of how people search.
SHODAN will not disclose
its cookies to third parties except as required by a valid legal process such as a search warrant,
subpoena, statute, or court order.

Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies.
You can reset your browser to refuse all
cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.
Be aware, however, that some parts of the
SHODAN Search Service may not function properly if you refuse cookies.

What information do we collect?
SHODAN does not collect any unique information about you (such as your name, email address, etc.)
except when you specifically and knowingly provide such information.
SHODAN notes and saves
information such as time of day, browser type, browser language, and IP address with each query.
That information is used to verify our records and to provide more relevant services to users.
For example, SHODAN may use your IP address or browser language to determine which language to
use when showing search results or advertisements.

Links to other sites
The sites displayed as search results or linked to by SHODAN Search Services are developed by
people over whom SHODAN exercises no control.
SHODAN may choose
to exhibit its search results in the form of a "URL redirecter." When SHODAN uses a URL redirecter,
if you click on a URL from a search result, information about the click is sent to SHODAN, and
SHODAN in turn sends you to the site you clicked on.
SHODAN uses this URL information to understand
and improve the quality of SHODAN's search technology.
For instance, SHODAN uses this information
to determine how often users are satisfied with the first result of a query and how often they
proceed to later results.

With whom does SHODAN share information?
SHODAN may share information about you with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and
other third parties.
However, we only divulge aggregate information about our users and will
not share personally identifiable information with any third party without your express consent.
For example, we may disclose how frequently the average SHODAN user visits SHODAN.
Please be aware, however, that we
will release specific personal information about you if required to do so in order to comply with
any valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order.

Your consent and changes to the Privacy Policy
By using the SHODAN Search Services and our web site, you consent to the collection and use
of your information as we have outlined in this policy and to our Terms of Service Policy.
SHODAN may decide to change this Privacy Policy from time to time.
When we do, we will post
those changes on this page so that you are always aware of the information we collect, how we
use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.

Feel free toÂ contact us any time and we'll answer any additional questions you may have.
