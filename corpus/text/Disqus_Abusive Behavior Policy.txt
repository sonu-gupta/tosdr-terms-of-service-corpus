         Abusive Behavior Policy Written by Disqus  Updated over a week ago Engaging in targeted abuse or harassment on Disqus is a violation of the Basic Rules and Terms of Service.
We want to foster a positive and diverse community for rich discussions.
Itâs our responsibility to cultivate an environment for communities and discussions to thrive and for users to feel safe when participating.
To that end, weâve established this policy to help us evaluate abusive behavior in its various forms. We do not condone and can take action on the following types of abusive behavior including but not limited to:

targeted harassment or encouraging others to do so
threat of violence or inciting it
self-harm or suicide
impersonating someone in a misleading or deceptive manner
posting personally identifiable information
improper use or breaking Disqus in such a way that it negatively hurts the experience for others
posting illegal content such as copyrighted material or child pornography

All types of content is tolerated as long as it does not violate the Disqus Basic Rules and Terms of Service.
Additionally, we do not mediate content or intervene in disputes between users. As Disqus doesn't provide moderation, nor do we know the ins and outs of each community, the site moderators are the people you should contact to report abusive behavior that isnât covered by the Basic Rules.

comments, discussions)
warning the user of the violation
resetting the user's profile to default
global banning accounts or communities
