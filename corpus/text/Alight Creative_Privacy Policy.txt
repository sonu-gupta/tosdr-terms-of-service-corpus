We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it by clearly communicating what information we collect and how we use it, and providing you options for managing our use of your personal information.
Overview
Although you should read this entire Privacy Policy, here are a few important points that you should understand:

When you use Applications and Services we provide, we collect anonymous analytics data to help us improve our products, design future products, and make smart business decisions.
This anonymous data can include things like how frequently product features are used, general information about the kind of media and files used with our Applications and Services, and information about the language, country and city where our Applications and Services are used.
When you sign in to our Applications or Services, we may store your full name and email address as part of your account information.
This information may be provided directly by you, or by your sign-in provider such as Google, Facebook, or Sign in with Apple.
We also record the model and operating system of devices you use to access our Services, as well as a special code that lets us tell how many devices you are using to access our Service.
We only use this data to provide our Service and enforce licensing limits on how many devices you can use at once, and not for marketing or any other purpose.
When you use or connect to our Applications or Services, we may receive information such as your IP address.
We use this only to improve security and improve the robustness and stability of our services.
Some of our Applications provide the option to store content on our cloud service.
We will never share your uploaded content with third parties and we take great care to limit even our own access to this uploaded material, but there is a chance we might view file names or other metadata as part of routine maintenance of our Service.
Certain features of our Applications and Services allow you to share work you have created by providing a link to your uploaded content.
Access to uploaded content is controlled by knowing this link.
You can send it to other users, in which case they will have access to view and download the linked content.
To enable such content sharing functionality, we have to store content you have chosen to upload in our cloud storage, which is typically hosted by a 3rd party provider such as Google or Amazon.
Even if your data is deleted from our Services, copies of it may remain stored in offline backups for a period of time, and we might keep copies of data such as payment transactions if we are required to by law.
We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time.
You can always find the latest version at www.alightcreative.com/privacy.
You must discontinue your use of our Services if you do not agree to the changes.
If you have any questions about your privacy, or need assistance removing personal data stored in our services, you can contact us at any time.
