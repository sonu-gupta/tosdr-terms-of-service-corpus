Cookies: Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on the computer that you are using.
Cookies allow us to collect information such as browser type, time spent on the Digital Services, pages visited, language preferences, and other web traffic data.

We retain the information we collect from or about you, our products, and our services for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Notice unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
When the information is no longer necessary for these purposes, we delete it or keep it in a form that does not identify you.
When determining this retention period, we take into account various criteria, such as the type of products and services requested by or provided to you, the nature of our relationship with you, the impact on the services we provide to you if we delete some information from or about you, and retention periods required by law.
We also collect information in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual.
We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personally identifiable data for any purpose.
If we do combine non-personally identifiable data with your personal information, the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.


From or about your Tesla Vehicle

We may collect a variety of information from or about your Tesla vehicle.
The type of information collected and processed varies based on your vehicle year, configuration and model.
Examples of information collected include:


Telematics log data: To improve our vehicles and services for you, we may collect certain telematics data regarding the performance, usage, operation, and condition of your Tesla vehicle, including: vehicle identification number.
speed information.
odometer readings.
battery use management information.
battery charging history.
electrical system functions.
software version information.
infotainment system data.
safety-related data and camera images (including information regarding the vehicleâs SRS systems, braking and acceleration, security, e-brake, and accidents).
short video clips of accidents.
information regarding the use and operation of Autopilot, Summon, Sentry and other features.
and other data to assist in identifying issues and analyzing the performance of the vehicle.
We may collect such information either in person (such as during a service appointment) or via remote access.

Remote analysis data: We may be able to dynamically connect to your Tesla vehicle to diagnose and resolve issues with it, and this process may result in access to personal settings in the vehicle (such as contacts, browsing history, and navigation history).
This dynamic connection also enables us to view the current location of your vehicle, but such access is restricted to a limited number of personnel within Tesla.

Safety analysis data: In order to help improve our products and services, we may collect and store other vehicle data, including: data about accidents or near accident-like circumstances involving your Tesla vehicle (e.g., air bag deployment, camera sensor data and images, and other recent sensor data).
data about remote services (e.g., remote lock/unlock, start/stop charge, and honk-the-horn commands).
a data report to confirm that your vehicle is online together with information about the current software version and certain telematics data.
vehicle connectivity information.
data about any issues that could materially impair operation of your vehicle.
data about any safety-critical issues.
and data about each software and firmware update.
We may collect such information either in person (such as during a service appointment) or via remote access.

Service history: In order to facilitate the servicing of your car, we may collect and process data about the service history of each Tesla vehicle, such as the customerâs name, vehicle identification number, repair history, any outstanding recalls, any bills due, any customer complaints, and any other information related to its service history.

Charging information: We may collect information regarding the charge rate and charging stations used by you (including use of superchargers, as well as home or commercial outlets) in order to, for example, analyze which charging stations are being utilized, how long and efficient battery charges are, where additional charging stations are needed, and in some jurisdictions, may participate in government fuel standard programs.

Autopilot information: To further help develop and improve autonomous safety features, we may collect non-personally identifiable images or short video clips using the carâs external cameras to learn how to recognize things like lane lines, street signs, and traffic light positions.
These images and short video clips are not linked to your vehicle identification number and we have safeguards that prevent the search of our internal system for clips associated with a specific car.
Separately, if you agree to allow us to collect video clips, Sentry Mode will send recorded video clips linked to your VIN to Tesla for temporary backup.
We may also use these clips to help enhance detection for Sentry Mode.
You can enable or disable the collection of these clips any time via the âData Sharingâ setting in Controls &gt.
Safety &amp.
Security.


Advanced features: We may provide you with advanced features in your Tesla vehicle, such as real-time traffic, Autopilot, and Summon, which make use of the road segment data of your vehicle and we may share this data with partners in a non-personally identifiable manner (e.g., by masking the vehicle identification number) in order to help us provide the service to you.
We also may collect similar data in connection with other features, such as the navigation data for the online routing feature, and may share it with business partners in a non-personally identifiable manner, where necessary to provide the feature to you.
We also only collect or share this data if you enable this collection, although if you do so, your vehicle may send this data to Tesla and its partners even if you are not actively using a feature that needs this information.
You can enable or disable the collection and sharing of this data at any time via the âData Sharingâ setting in Controls &gt.
Safety &amp.
Security.

Please note that if you opt out from the collection of telematics log data or any other data from your Tesla vehicle (with the exception of the Data Sharing setting detailed above), we will not be able to notify you of issues applicable to your vehicle in real time.
This may result in your vehicle suffering from reduced functionality, serious damage, or inoperability, and it may also disable many features of your vehicle including periodic software and firmware updates, remote services, and interactivity with mobile applications and in-car features such as location search, Internet radio, voice commands, and web browser functionality.


From or about your Tesla energy products

We may collect a variety of information from or about your Tesla energy products or your home from you, via a certified installer when one of our energy advisers visits your home, from your electric utility, or from the installed products (directly or via paired equipment, such as an inverter), including:


Energy installation information: We may collect information about your home, such as the dimensions of your roof, the configuration of your electric system, the capacity of any existing solar system, your installation date, number of products installed, and serial number(s).


Energy product performance data: In order to provide and improve our energy products and services, we may collect data regarding where your product is installed and how it is configured, data related to the productâs use and performance (e.g., usable energy capacity, rated power, battery efficiency, and other energy logs), information regarding your home energy consumption, and other information relevant to diagnose issues.

Opting out of Data Sharing: If you no longer wish us to collect performance data or any other data from your Tesla energy product, please contact us as indicated in the âHow to contact usâ section below.

When you add a payment method to your Tesla account, such as a credit card, certain information including, but not limited to device location, device identification number, and card information may be sent to Tesla and shared with our payment processor.
Card information is encrypted during the transmission and Tesla will not have access to the actual card number.
When the stored payment method or a new credit card is used for purchasing goods and services on a Tesla hosted website or application, the necessary information to process payment will be shared with our global processors and our banking partners, to process your payment, comply with financial regulations, to prevent fraud, and for troubleshooting any payment issues.
Payments made by using your bank information is stored by Tesla in an encrypted format that prevents unauthorized access without specific permissions.

You must maintain at least one valid payment method in your account supported by Tesla.
Your failure to maintain accurate, complete, and up-to-date account and payment information, including having an invalid or expired payment method on file, may result in your inability to access or use certain services.
Charges will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required by law.
Tesla may amend these terms and any changes are effective when posted to this page.

When you request a bank payment such as an Automated Clearing House (ACH) or Pre-Authorized Debit (PAD) payment transfer, and where required by law, we will inform you at least three days before the initial payment due date, and up to one day before payment is collected.
You may amend or cancel this authorization at any time by providing us with thirty (30) days notice.
You have certain recourse rights if any debit does not comply with this agreement, such as the right to receive reimbursement in the event of an unauthorized debit inconsistent with these terms.
To obtain more information on your recourse rights, contact your financial institution.
For Charges that support automatic payments, you understand that your payment method will be charged again when your service automatically renews at the end of the prescribed period unless turned off at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to the end of the current billing period.
You can manage or turn off automatic payments in your Tesla Account at any time.

The services received may result in charges to you, even if someone else is using your vehicle.

If you do not pay past due amounts we may limit or block your vehicle's ability to use the related services until payment issues are resolved.
For information on how we handle your payment information, please see Tesla's Privacy Notice. Supercharger 
Idle Fee
In consideration of others who need to use a Supercharger, we ask that you move your vehicle when it is finished charging.
To encourage this, you will incur an idle fee for the time your car remains parked in a charging stall after it is finished charging.
We will waive the idle fee if your car is moved within five minutes after it is finished charging, and the idle fee will not accumulate while less than half of the charging stalls at your location are occupied.
All vehicles are subject to idle fees, regardless of when your vehicle was purchased.
To avoid idle fees, we recommend you monitor your vehicle while using a Supercharger and encourage you to use the Tesla mobile app to track your vehicle's charge status.
Idle fees are incurred on a per minute basis.
The idle fee rate for each location may change from time to time, and the latest information is provided in the map pin pop-up (accessible through the navigation application on your vehicleâs infotainment).
By remaining parked in a charging stall after your vehicle is finished charging, you accept the idle fee rate communicated to you through the map pin pop-up.
For additional information, please see our idle fee support page.

Pay Per Use
All vehicles ordered after January 15, 2017, and vehicles ordered by January 15, 2017 but built after April 15, 2017, are enabled for Supercharging on a pay per use basis.
Any credits for free Supercharging that are given with the purchase of a vehicle, including any annual renewal of credits, expire upon the sale or transfer of the vehicle and are not transferable to any subsequent vehicle owner, or to any other vehicle.
Credits for Supercharging expire after a set period of time and do not rollover into future periods.
Pay per use billing is on a per kilowatt hour basis in jurisdictions where this is feasible, and as a service fee on a per minute basis in other jurisdictions.
The pay per use billing unit and rate for each location may change from time to time, and the latest information is provided in the map pin pop-up (accessible through the navigation application on your vehicle touchscreen).
By charging your vehicle in a particular location, you accept the price of charging communicated to you through the map pin pop-up.
For additional information, please see our Supercharger support page. Premium Connectivity Subscription Agreement

  Supercharger Fair Use Policy 
Introduction

We are continually expanding our global network of Supercharger stations to enable personal long distance travel and to provide a charging solution for those without immediate access to home or workplace charging, thereby accelerating the widespread adoption of electric vehicles.
When Superchargers are used beyond their intended purpose, it negatively impacts the availability of Supercharging services for others.

Supercharger Fair Use

To help ensure that Superchargers are available for their intended use, unless you charge on a pay per use basis, we ask that you not charge your vehicle using a Supercharger if your vehicle is being used: 

as a taxi;
for ridesourcing or ridesharing (through Uber, Lyft or similar services);
to commercially deliver or transport goods;
for government purposes.
or
for any other commercial venture.

If you charge your vehicle in a manner that does not comply with this Supercharger Fair Use Policy, we may ask you to modify this behavior.
We may also take additional action to protect the availability of Superchargers for their intended purpose, such as limiting or blocking your vehicleâs ability to use Supercharger stations.
This Policy applies to all Superchargers worldwide and all Tesla vehicles with free unlimited Supercharging or free Supercharging for the lifetime of vehicle ownership, purchased, either new or used, whether from Tesla or a third party, after December 15, 2017.
Tesla may choose to exclude certain Supercharger stations or occasional trips from the scope of this Policy, such as to accommodate specific local circumstances.

Charging Alternatives

We encourage the commercial use of Tesla vehicles while using appropriate charging solutions.
Please reach out to your local sales contact to explore vehicle and charging options that suit your needs.

Last Updated June 2021 Human Rights And Conflict Minerals Policy Tesla expects our suppliers to conduct their worldwide operations in responsible manner in adherence of this policy and the principles enumerated herein.
Tesla works collaboratively with our suppliers to encourage compliance with the following principles:

Legal And Regulatory Compliance

Tesla suppliers are to ensure their operations and the products and services supplied to Tesla comply with all national and other applicable laws and regulations.

Conflict Minerals

Tesla's suppliers are expected to use reasonable efforts to ensure that parts and products supplied to Tesla are DRC "conflict-free," meaning that such conflict minerals do not benefit armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Conflict-free means such parts and supplies do not contain metals derived from "conflict minerals" which are defined as: (i) columbite-tantalite (tantalum).
(ii) cassiterite (tin).
(iii) gold.
(iv) wolframite (tungsten).
and (v) any derivatives of the above.

The goal of this policy is to ensure that Tesla's products do not directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups through mining or mineral trading in the DRC and adjoining countries.
Tesla requires its suppliers to establish policies, due diligence frameworks, and management systems, consistent with the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas, that are designed to accomplish this goal.
Tesla expects its suppliers to stay up-to-date with and to use validated conflict free smelters and refiners assessed by the Responsible Mineral Initiative and similar organizations.
Tesla performs ongoing due diligence and files annual reports with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

Human Rights

Tesla is committed to ensuring that its suppliers do not use slave or child labor or engage in human trafficking.
Tesla does not, and will not, tolerate the use of slave or child labor in the manufacture of its products and does not, and will not, accept products or services from suppliers that engage in human trafficking in any form.
Human trafficking, child labor and slavery are crimes under state, federal and international law.
These crimes exist in countries throughout the world.

Supplier Compliance

Tesla will do the following to ensure compliance by its suppliers with this policy as required by law and as needed:

Evaluate its supply chain to address risks related to conflict minerals, human trafficking, slavery and child labor;
Audit suppliers, to evaluate supplier compliance with Tesla's Human Rights and Conflict Minerals Policy;
Require direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into Tesla products comply with the laws regarding conflict minerals, slavery, child labor and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they are doing business;
Discipline employees or contractors, including potential termination of contract, who fail to meet Tesla's Human Rights and Conflict Minerals Policy;
Train certain Tesla employees regarding conflict minerals, human trafficking, child labor and slavery, particularly with respect to mitigating risks within the Tesla's supply chain;
Investigate if Tesla has a reasonable basis to believe that a Tesla supplier is engaging in human trafficking, slave or child labor, or use of conflict minerals.
and
Transition away from purchasing goods or services from any supplier that is believed to be engaging in human trafficking, slave or child labor, or use of conflict minerals if the supplier does not take corrective actions within a reasonable period of time.

 Patent Pledge On June 12, 2014, Tesla announced that it will not initiate patent lawsuits against anyone who, in good faith, wants to use its technology.
Tesla was created to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport, and this policy is intended to encourage the advancement of a common, rapidly-evolving platform for electric vehicles, thereby benefiting Tesla, other companies making electric vehicles, and the world.
These guidelines provide further detail as to how we are implementing this policy.


Teslaâs Pledge

Tesla irrevocably pledges that it will not initiate a lawsuit against any party for infringing a Tesla Patent through activity relating to electric vehicles or related equipment for so long as such party is acting in good faith.
Key terms of the Pledge are explained below.

Definition of Key Terms

"Tesla Patents" means all patents owned now or in the future by Tesla (other than a patent owned jointly with a third party or any patent that Tesla later acquires that comes with an encumbrance that prevents it from being subject to this Pledge).
A list of Tesla Patents subject to the Pledge will be maintained at the following URL: https://www.tesla.com/about/legal#patent-list.
A party is "acting in good faith" for so long as such party and its related or affiliated companies have not:

asserted, helped others assert or had a financial stake in any assertion of (i) any patent or other intellectual property right against Tesla or (ii) any patent right against a third party for its use of technologies relating to electric vehicles or related equipment.

challenged, helped others challenge, or had a financial stake in any challenge to any Tesla patent.
or
marketed or sold any knock-off product (e.g., a product created by imitating or copying the design or appearance of a Tesla product or which suggests an association with or endorsement by Tesla) or provided any material assistance to another party doing so.



Transfer of Tesla Patents

Should Tesla ever transfer a Tesla Patent to a third party, it will do so only to a party that agrees, by means of a public declaration intended to be binding on such party, to provide the same protection that Tesla provided under the Pledge and to place the same requirement on any subsequent transferee.

Legal Effect

The Pledge, which is irrevocable and legally binding on Tesla and its successors, is a "standstill," meaning that it is a forbearance of enforcement of Teslaâs remedies against any party for claims of infringement for so long as such party is acting in good faith.
In order for Tesla to preserve its ability to enforce the Tesla Patents against any party not acting in good faith, the Pledge is not a waiver of any patent claims (including claims for damages for past acts of infringement) and is not a license, covenant not to sue, or authorization to engage in patented activities or a limitation on remedies, damages or claims.
Except as expressly stated in the Pledge, no rights shall be deemed granted, waived or received by implication, exhaustion, estoppel or otherwise.
Finally, the Pledge is not an indication of the value of an arms-length, negotiated license or a reasonable royalty.
What this pledge means is that as long as someone uses our patents for electric vehicles and doesnât do bad things, such as knocking off our products or using our patents and then suing us for intellectual property infringement, they should have no fear of Tesla asserting its patents against them.

Download 2016 Report PDF Unsupported or Salvaged Vehicle Policy An unsupported or salvaged vehicle is a vehicle that has been declared a total loss, commonly after extensive damage caused by a crash, flooding, fire, or similar hazard, and has been (or qualifies to be) registered and/or titled by its owner as a salvaged vehicle or its equivalent pursuant to local jurisdiction or industry practice.
Salvage registration/titling typically can never be removed from the vehicle so that all future persons understand the condition and value of the vehicle.
Tesla does not warrant the safety or operability of salvaged vehicles.
Repairs performed to bring a salvaged vehicle back into service may not meet Tesla standards or specifications and that is why the vehicle is unsupported.
Consequently, any failures, damages, or injuries occurring as a result of such repairs or continued operation of an unsupported vehicle are solely the responsibility of the vehicle owner.
Until Tesla can confirm that the vehicle is in compliance with Teslaâs safety standards and vehicle specifications, Tesla does not perform or support repairs involving the HV (high-voltage) battery systems in the vehicle because of the potential for the salvage vehicle to have sustained damage that:

Makes the vehicle unsafe to drive
Makes the vehicle unsafe for any repair technicians that might work on the vehicle
Might damage Tesla equipment, such as Superchargers

When a vehicle is classified as a salvaged vehicle:

Any Tesla limited warranties and extended service agreements for the vehicle are void.
NOTE: Repairs due to recalls will be performed unless the safe repair of the vehicle is prevented either by the condition of the vehicle or by vehicle modifications not installed by Tesla.
If the Tesla Service Center determines that the vehicle is not safe to repair, the recall-related repair will not be performed until the customer has returned the vehicle to a condition that the Service Center determines is safe to repair.
Supercharging is permanently disabled.
Parts availability is not affected.
Any Unrestricted or Over-the-Counter part may be purchased for a salvage-titled vehicle.
A âSalvage-Titled Vehicle HV Safety Inspectionâ may be performed (at the customerâs expense) on the vehicle to determine if the HV-related components are safe to work on or access.
