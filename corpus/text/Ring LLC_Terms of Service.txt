DISPUTE RESOLUTION

Mandatory, Bilateral Arbitration and Waiver of Class Actions

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY â IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.
YOU AND RING AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY, OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF, OR RELATING TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES AND/OR PRODUCTS, TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR TO THE CONTENT, ANY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN US AND/OR ANY RECORDING ON THE SERVICES AND/OR PRODUCTS SHALL BE RESOLVED ONLY BY FINAL AND BINDING, BILATERAL ARBITRATION, except that (1) you may assert claims in small claims court in your county of residence within the United States if your claims qualify.
and (2) this agreement to arbitrate does not include your or Ringâs right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in state or federal court in Los Angeles County California to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a partyâs copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights.
The Federal Arbitration Act (the âFAAâ), 9 U.S.C.
Â§ 1, et seq., and federal arbitration law apply to this Agreement and govern all questions as to whether a dispute is subject to arbitration.
There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.
An arbitrator, however, can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Terms.
âDisputesâ shall include, but are not limited to, any claims or controversies between you and Ring against each other related in any way to or arising out of in any way from this Agreement, the Services, the Products, and/or the Content, including but not limited to sales, returns, refunds, cancellations, defects, policies, privacy, advertising, or any communications between you and Ring, even if the claim arises after you or Ring has terminated Services or a user account.
Disputes also include, but are not limited to, claims that: (a) you bring against our employees, agents, affiliates, or other representatives.
or (b) Ring brings against you.
Disputes also include, but are not limited to, (i) claims in any way related to or arising out of any aspect of the relationship between you and Ring, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, advertising claims, or any other legal theory.
(ii) claims that arose before these Terms or out of a prior set of Terms with Ring.
(iii) claims that are subject to on-going litigation where you are not a party or a class member.
and/or (iv) claims that arise after the termination of these Terms.

Dispute Notice

Before initiating an arbitration, you and Ring each agree to first provide the other a written notice (âNotice of Disputeâ), which shall contain: (a) a written description of the problem and relevant documents and supporting information.
and (b) a statement of the specific relief sought.
A Notice of Dispute should be sent to: 1523 26th Street Santa Monica, CA 90404, Attention: Legal Department.
We will provide a Notice of Dispute to you via the email address associated with your Ring account.
You and Ring agree to attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute prior to commencing an arbitration and not to commence an arbitration proceeding until a forty-five (45) day post-notice resolution period expires.
*Arbitration Process and Procedure *

If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within forty-five (45) days from the original Dispute Notice, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to these terms.
Arbitration shall (1) be administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc.
(âJAMSâ), pursuant to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules &amp.
Procedures then in effect (the âJAMS Rulesâ) and as modified by this agreement to arbitrate, including the rules regarding filing, administration, discovery, and arbitrator fees.
(2) be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator.
and (3) take place in the county where you reside or any reasonable location within the United States convenient for you.
To the extent that this agreement to arbitrate conflicts with the JAMS Policy on Consumer Arbitrations Pursuant to Pre-Dispute Clauses Minimum Standards for Procedural Fairness (the âMinimum Standardsâ), the Minimum Standards in that regard will apply.
WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION.
Further, unless both you and Ring expressly agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one personâs claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this subsectionâs limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.
If, for any reason, a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive our right to a jury trial.
YOU THEREFORE UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND RING ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION FOR ANY CLAIMS COVERED BY THIS AGREEMENT.
The JAMS Rules are available on its website at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/.
Notwithstanding any JAMS Rules to the contrary or any other provision in the arbitration rules chosen, by agreement, to govern, you and Ring each agree that all issues regarding the Dispute are delegated to the arbitrator to decide.
Further, the arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration.
The arbitratorâs award shall be written, and binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.

Hearing

If your claim does not exceed $10,000 (USD), you and Ring agree to waive an oral hearing by the arbitrator and the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Ring submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary.

If your claim for damages does not exceed $25,000 (USD) and you follow the dispute notice procedure set forth above, Ring will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your Dispute or the relief sought was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
*Small Claims &amp.
Government Actions *

As an alternative to arbitration, you or Ring may resolve Disputes in a small claims court that has jurisdiction over your claim.

g.
How the Monitoring Service Works

The Monitoring Service consists of (a) continuously (i.e., 24 hours a day, seven days a week) monitoring the Alarm Product for purposes of receipt by the Monitoring Station of any listed signal codes from the Alarm Product, and (b) the notification of you, and/or your emergency contacts and/or emergency responders of the receipt of any such listed signal codes by the Monitoring Station, as provided for herein.
Notification to you and your emergency contacts may be made by one or more means, to include: calls to the telephone numbers, emails to the email addresses and text messages to the wireless devices you provide Ring for yourself and your emergency contacts.
So that the Monitoring Service can be performed, you must provide Ring with all the information it and/or the Monitoring Station requests for you and your emergency contacts, and notify Ring immediately with any change to any of that information.
You agree that any person that you have designated as an emergency contact is authorized to act on your behalf, and has the authority to verify or cancel a listed signal code received by the Monitoring Station prior to, or after, the notification of emergency responders.
You understand and agree that Ring and the Monitoring Station will rely, and are entitled to rely, solely on the contact and other information you provide for yourself and your emergency contacts.
Upon receipt of a listed signal code from the Alarm Product, the Monitoring Station will make commercially reasonable efforts to notify you, your emergency contacts and/or emergency responders within a commercially reasonable period of time in accordance with your instructions, the policies and procedures of the Monitoring Station, and any applicable municipal, local or state/provincial law, code or ordinance.
In the case of notification to you, if emergency responders have not already been notified by the Monitoring Station, and the response from you indicates notification to emergency responders is appropriate or required, the Monitoring Station will then make commercially reasonable efforts to notify emergency responders.
In the case of notification to your emergency contacts, (a) if there is no response from such first contact, and the Monitoring Station has been provided a second contact by you, it will then make commercially reasonable efforts to notify such second contact, and (b) if emergency responders have not already been notified by the Monitoring Station, and the response from your first or second emergency contact indicates notification to emergency responders is appropriate or required, the Monitoring Station will then make commercially reasonable efforts to notify emergency responders (hereinafter the âNotification Protocolâ).
In the case of notification to your emergency contacts, the Notification Protocol shall be satisfied upon receipt by the Monitoring Station of verbal confirmation of notification from an emergency contact, or by leaving a message with such emergency contact on a telephone answering service, or any mechanical, electrical, electronic or other technology permitting the recording of voice or data communications.
In the case of notification to emergency responders, the Notification Protocol shall be satisfied upon receipt by the Monitoring Station of verbal confirmation of notification to any person authorized to respond to such notification.
Ring and the Monitoring Station may be subject to applicable laws and industry standards designed to reduce false alarms, and these laws and standards may result in practices and procedures that delay either the notification of emergency responders, or other verification procedures in response to listed signal codes.
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, codes and ordinances, you agree that the Monitoring Station may, in its reasonable discretion, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, attempt to contact you and/or your emergency contacts to verify that a signal is not a false alarm before dispatching emergency responders.
IF THE MONITORING STATION HAS REASON TO BELIEVE THAT NO EMERGENCY CONDITION EXISTS, IT MAY ELECT, IN ITS REASONABLE DISCRETION AND IF NOT OTHERWISE PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, CODES AND ORDINANCES, NOT TO DISPATCH EMERGENCY RESPONDERS AND/OR FOLLOW THE NOTIFICATION PROTOCOL.
If you experience a life/safety, property risk, fire, flood, burglary, robbery, medical issue or other emergency event, do not wait to be contacted by the Monitoring Station.
Instead, if you are able to do so safely, you should immediately contact the police, fire department, 911 or appropriate emergency response service.

h.
Changes to the Monitoring Service

Ring and the Monitoring Station may from time to time, in response to applicable law or otherwise, revise, replace, change, modify, discontinue or rescind certain policies or procedures relating to the Monitoring Service and the response to listed signal codes.
Ring shall endeavor to provide you with notification pursuant to Section III of the Alarm Terms and Conditions of any such revisions, replacements, changes, modifications, discontinuance or rescission within a commercially reasonable period of time either before or after they are effective.

i.
False Alarm

In the event a fine, penalty or fee is assessed against you or Ring or the Monitoring Station by any local government as a result of any false, excessive or other alarm condition or non-compliance with any local ordinance or standard intended to reduce false alarms not caused by the negligence or other wrongdoing of Ring or the Monitoring Station, you agree to be solely responsible for payment, and shall reimburse Ring and the Monitoring Station for any such fines, penalty or fees.
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you hereby expressly authorize Ring to charge the payment card associated with your Monitoring Service account the full amount of any such fine, penalty or fee.
Please be warned that if your Alarm Product generates more than three (3) false alarm signals within a twenty-four (24) hour period, Ring and/or the Monitoring Station may, if not prohibited by applicable municipal, local or state/provincial law, code or ordinance, place your Alarm Product back in Initial Test Status, as defined above in IX.f of the Alarm Terms and Conditions.
However, before placing the Alarm Product back in the Initial Test Status, Ring and/or the Monitoring Station will provide you with at least twenty-four (24) hours advance notification pursuant to Section III of the Alarm Terms and Conditions.

j.
Changes to the System Elements

PLEASE BE WARNED THAT IF YOU SWITCH OR CHANGE ANY OF YOUR SYSTEM ELEMENTS (AS DEFINED IN SECTION XI OF THE ALARM TERMS AND CONDITIONS), THIS MAY LEAVE YOUR ALARM PRODUCT UNABLE TO TRANSMIT SIGNALS TO THE MONITORING STATION AND, THEREFORE, THE MONITORING SERVICE WILL NOT WORK.
It is your sole duty to assure that your System Elements are at all times compatible with your Alarm Product and Monitoring Service, and properly functioning.

k.
Use of Communications

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you hereby consent to the Monitoring Station intercepting, recording, retrieving, reviewing, copying, disclosing and using, for purposes of providing the Monitoring Service, the contents of all telephone, video, wire, oral, electronic and other forms of transmission or communication to which you or your emergency contacts are parties.

l.
Force Majeure

The obligation to provide the Monitoring Services shall immediately terminate, without prior notice, in the event of any of the following: (i) the telephone lines, network or equipment, other communications equipment, software, or physical facilities of the Monitoring Station are destroyed, damaged, or inoperable for any reason whatsoever.
or (ii) any war whether declared or undeclared, fire, flood, extreme weather, accident, explosion, act of terrorism, governmental orders, regulations, restrictions or priorities, strike, lockout or other labor troubles, or any other cause beyond the absolute control of the Monitoring Station for the duration of the interrupted service.
Ring shall provide you with notice pursuant to Section III of the Alarm Terms and Conditions of such termination as soon as commercially reasonable following any such Force Majeure event.

m.
Optional Private Guard Verification Service

To reduce the high costs of false alarms, your local jurisdiction may require that an alarm signal received by the Monitoring Station from your Alarm Product first be verified by a person physically at the Registered Address as an actual emergency before your local emergency responders (such as police and fire departments) may be dispatched, or will respond to a dispatch request, to your Registered Address (âAlarm Verificationâ).
Generally, Alarm Verification may be provided by you or your emergency contacts when contacted by the Monitoring Station in response to an alarm signal received at the Monitoring Station from your Alarm Product.
However, if you or your emergency contacts are unable to provide the Alarm Verification, or if otherwise required by your local jurisdiction, the Monitoring Station may be required, even in the event of an actual emergency, to first dispatch a local private security guard responder to your Registered Address to provide the Alarm Verification before attempting to dispatch emergency responders, or before emergency responders will respond to any dispatch request (âPrivate Guard Alarm Verificationâ).
If you subscribe to the Monitoring Service, you will have the option of selecting the Private Guard Alarm Verification Service, and additional fees which you agree to pay shall apply.
If you choose the Private Guard Alarm Verification Service (which is recommended by Ring), and if a private guard responder is dispatched to your Registered Address by the Monitoring Station for Private Guard Alarm Verification, you hereby authorize the private guard responder to access the exterior areas of the Registered Address (including, but not limited to, doors, windows, gates and all entry points) in an effort to provide the Private Guard Alarm Verification.
You understand and agree that the private guard responder will not make entry into any interior areas of your Registered Address and may not jump or climb over fences, walls, gates, or any other physical barrier, or enter areas that are considered inaccessible due to a locked gate, animals present or other safety-related concerns.
Further, you understand and agree that the private guard responderâs sole responsibility is to provide Private Guard Alarm Verification.
The private guard responder is not an emergency responder and has no duty to provide any emergency or other assistance or aid (medical or otherwise), guard or personal protection services for you or your family members or others, otherwise confront or apprehend any intruder, or otherwise intervene with regard to the emergency in any manner whatsoever.
Alarm Verification and the Private Guard Alarm Verification Service may cause delays in the dispatch and arrival of emergency responders to your Registered Address, even in the event of an actual emergency.
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU HEREBY RELEASE AND HOLD RING, THE MONITORING STATION, AND ANY CONTRACTOR AND PRIVATE GUARD RESPONDER PROVIDING THE PRIVATE GUARD ALARM VERIFICATION SERVICE, HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST, ALL LIABILITY AND DAMAGES, INJURIES OR LOSS OF LIFE CAUSED BY ANY DELAY IN THE DISPATCH OR ARRIVAL OF EMERGENCY RESPONDERS.
IF YOU DO NOT CHOOSE THE PRIVATE GUARD ALARM VERIFICATION SERVICE (WHICH IS NOT RECOMMENDED, AS RING RECOMMENDS YOU CHOOSE THE PRIVATE GUARD ALARM VERIFICATION SERVICE), YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT IF YOU OR YOUR EMERGENCY CONTACTS ARE UNABLE TO PROVIDE ALARM VERIFICATION OR IF PRIVATE GUARD ALARM VERIFICATION IS OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY YOUR LOCAL JURISDICTION, THE MONITORING STATION MAY BE UNABLE, EVEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACTUAL EMERGENCY, TO DISPATCH EMERGENCY RESPONDERS TO YOUR REGISTERED ADDRESS, OR EMERGENCY RESPONDERS MAY NOT RESPOND, MAY DELAY IN RESPONDING, OR MAY REFUSE TO RESPOND, TO ANY DISPATCH REQUEST.
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU DO NOT CHOOSE THE PRIVATE GUARD ALARM VERIFICATION SERVICE, YOU HEREBY RELEASE AND HOLD RING AND THE MONITORING STATION HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST, ALL LIABILITY AND DAMAGES, INJURIES OR LOSS OF LIFE CAUSED BY ANY DELAY IN THE DISPATCH OR ARRIVAL OF EMERGENCY RESPONDERS, THE FAILURE OR REFUSAL OF EMERGENCY RESPONDERS TO RESPOND, OR ANY DELAY BY FIRST RESPONDERS IN SO RESPONDING, TO ANY DISPATCH REQUEST TO YOUR REGISTERED ADDRESS, EVEN IN THE EVENT OF AN ACTUAL EMERGENCY.

The Alarm Services and Monitoring Service will not work or be accessible without: (i) a working wifi network at your Registered Address that is positioned to communicate reliably with your Alarm Product.
(ii) an active, current and properly completed account with Ring.
(iii) an enabled and supported wireless device.
and (iv) always-on broadband internet access at your Registered Address with bandwidth sufficient to support your Alarm Product (collectively, the or your âSystem Elementsâ).

You agree not to use the SIM card except in your Alarm Product.
Any violation of the restrictions on the use of the SIM card may, in Ringâs sole discretion, result in the termination of the Alarm Services or Monitoring Service in accordance with Section XIII hereof.
In addition, if Ring detects unauthorized or excessive use of the Alarm Services or Monitoring Service or SIM card, you agree to reimburse Ring for all the data usage associated with the unauthorized or excessive use.
You hereby expressly authorize Ring to charge the payment card associated with your account for all related unauthorized or excessive data charges.
You understand and agree that neither Ring nor the Monitoring Station are responsible for the operation or non-operation of any of your System Elements or Back-Up Wireless Data Service.
You acknowledge and agree that the System Elements and Back-Up Wireless Data Service are not error-free and may be interrupted, delayed, refused, or otherwise limited for a variety of reasons, including insufficient coverage, power outages, termination of service and access, environmental conditions, interference, non-payment of applicable fees and charges, unavailability of radio frequency channels, system capacity, upgrades, repairs or relocations, and priority access by emergency responders in the event of a disaster or emergency (âService Problem(s)â).
Service Problems may result in an inability of your Alarm Product to send listed signal codes to the Monitoring Station and, in such event, the Monitoring Service will be unavailable for the duration of the Service Problem.
Further, Service Problems may result in the Alarm Service being unreliable or unavailable for the duration of the Service Problem.
Neither Ring, the Monitoring Station, nor any wireless data carrier is responsible or liable for any such Service Problems.
SPECIFICALLY, REGARDING THE BACK-UP WIRELESS DATA SERVICE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BACK-UP WIRELESS DATA SERVICE IS MADE AVAILABLE ONLY WITHIN THE OPERATING RANGE OF THE NETWORKS.
