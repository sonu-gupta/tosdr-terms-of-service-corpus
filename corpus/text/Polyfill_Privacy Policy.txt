         Privacy Policy #  The Financial Times Limited (âFTâ, âweâ, âusâ) is committed to safeguarding the privacy of our users.

We treat personal information in accordance with the following principles:

We will be transparent with users about the types of information we are collecting and what we are allowed to use it for.
 We will not use the information we collect for other purposes without permission or notification (unless we have a lawful basis or are legally required to do so).

We will use appropriate technical and organisational measures to secure the information that we collect.
We will respect our usersâ rights to privacy, including the right not to receive marketing from us.

This Privacy Policy applies to:

the Polyfill.io website (âSiteâ).
and/or
the public instance of the Polyfill Service made available by us, as described on the Site (âServiceâ):

 This Site and the Service are referred to together as âPolyfill.ioâ.

 We collect and use information in different ways for the Site and the Service.
This Privacy Policy sets out details of these different ways in which we collect and use information.
 What information do we collect from the Service? #  The Service is a hosted instance of software known as Polyfill Service.
Polyfill Service provides snippets of code, called âpolyfillsâ, that allows websites operated by FT and by others to provide a consistent experience across different browsers.
When you load a web page which uses Polyfill Service, your browser will download any polyfills required in order to present the web page successfully in your browser.

In order to provide the polyfills, the Service receives from your browser certain technical information including:

browser details;
connection details (such as your IP address which can identify your approximate location and/or name of your ISP).

the URL of the web page which has made the request to the Service.


 We use that information to determine which polyfills are required by your browser.
We then retain only the following information: 

the domain of the web page which has made the request to the Service;
the user agent string for your browser;
the set of polyfills that were requested by the web page.

 The information we retain cannot identify you.
We retain it in order to identify which websites are using the Service and whether any websites are abusing the Service.

 The website which uses the polyfills is not subject to this privacy policy.
We are not responsible for third party websitesâ content, use of personal information, or security practices.
