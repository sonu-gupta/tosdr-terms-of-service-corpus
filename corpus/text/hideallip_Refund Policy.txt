 Why we have a Refund Policy:
 We believe in happy customers.
We believe all our products do their job, and do it well.
 But we're realistic enough to know that our software isn't going to fit every situation.
That's why we have a strong refund policy.
If you aren't satisfied with our products, we would like them back - and we will refund you the money.
 This allows you to purchase our products with confidence.
