Last updated: December 22nd, 2019
ADHD Boss is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to (âADHD Bossâ (amazon.com, or endless.com, MYHABIT.com, SmallParts.com, or AmazonWireless.com).
In other words, some of the links on this website contain affiliate IDâs.
This means that I may receive a commission at no additional cost to you when you purchase a product, or click on an advertisement associated with ADHD Boss.
I will almost always link to products that I have personally used, and have benefited from first-hand.
On occasion, I will link to a product that I have not yet used if I believe that it will add genuine value to your life.
Iâll normally only do this if Iâm familiar with the brand or product line.
This works out to be a win-win for all.
I will do my best to provide you with products that add legitimate value to your life, and youâll also be able to support ADHDBoss.com at no additional cost to you.
Thank you for your support.
