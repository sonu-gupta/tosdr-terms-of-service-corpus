Schedule 2 â Data Security Practices At Klevu
Data importer will maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the security, confidentiality and integrity of personal data submitted to the subscribed services as described below.
Klevu stores all production data in a combination of dedicated and multi-tenant environment on servers managed by Klevu.
It maintains and stores all production data in physically secured data centres that are 24/7 monitored by CCTV and security personnel.
Where agreed with the Client, the Client specific servers may be hosted in data centres closer to the Clientâsâ own premises with no data other than their own indexes and any related data required to serve the Client.
To maintain high level of security and avoid data theft, Klevu uses industry standard encryption schemes and protocols to encrypt data transmissions between the data centres.
Klevuâs API servers support HTTPS and all current versions of TLS (1.0, 1.1, and 1.2).

Each storeâs index is stored in its own index, isolated from any other storeâs index.
The infrastructure has been designed to avoid single points of failures and data loss and to allow maintenance with minimal impact on the production systems.
Proper health checks are installed to monitor APIs for real-time visibility of these servers across the globe.
Where applicable, the personal data is encrypted and irreversibly anonymised following termination of the applicable Contract.
The data is made available to the Client to be downloaded for a period of up to 90 days.&nbsp.
