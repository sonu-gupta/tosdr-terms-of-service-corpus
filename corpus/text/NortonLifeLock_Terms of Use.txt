Dispute Resolution
LifeLock believes that most disagreements can be resolved informally and efficiently by contacting LifeLock customer support.
If you are a U.S.
customer, and the dispute is not resolved through LifeLock customer support, you and LifeLock agree that any such dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to the Services or these Service Terms (a "Claim"), shall be determined by binding arbitration or small claims court, instead of in courts of general jurisdiction, as follows: 
A.&nbsp.
Small Claims Court: You may elect to litigate your Claim in small claims court if all the requirements of the small claims court are satisfied, including any limitations on jurisdiction and the amount at issue in the dispute.
You agree to bring a Claim in small claims court in your county of residence or in the Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara.
B.&nbsp.
Arbitration:&nbsp.
Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.
Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts.
Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.
You agree that, by agreeing to these Service Terms, the U.S.
Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision, and that you and LifeLock are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.
This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Service Terms and/or the termination of your Service.
a.
Notice of Claim:&nbsp.
If you elect to seek arbitration, you must first send to LifeLock, by certified mail, a written Notice of Your Claim ("Notice of Claim").
The Notice of Claim to LifeLock should be addressed to: General Counsel, LifeLock, Inc., 350 Ellis Street, Mountain View, CA 94043 and should be prominently captioned "NOTICE OF CLAIM".
The Notice of Claim should include both the mailing address and email address you would like LifeLock to use to contact you.
If LifeLock elects to seek arbitration, it will send, by certified mail, a written Notice of Claim to your billing address on file.
A Notice of Claim, whether sent by you or by LifeLock, must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.
(b) set forth the specific amount of damages or other relief sought ("Demand").
and (c) whether you reject any subsequent modification of the Dispute Resolution section by Symantec (see Section 17(B)(e)).
b.
Arbitration Proceedings:&nbsp.
If you and LifeLock do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice of Claim is received, you or LifeLock may commence an arbitration proceeding (or, alternatively, file a claim in small claims court).
 You may download or copy a form of notice and a form to initiate arbitration at www.adr.org.
The arbitration will be governed by the Consumer or Commercial Arbitration Rules, as appropriate, of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") (collectively, the "AAA Rules"), as modified by these Service Terms, and will be administered by the AAA.
 The AAA Rules and Forms are available online at www.adr.org.
The arbitrator is bound by the terms of these Service Terms.
All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision.
Unless LifeLock and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of either your residence or of the mailing address you provided in your Notice of Claim.
If your claim is for U.S.
$10,000 or less, LifeLock agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.
If your claim exceeds U.S.
$10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
If the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of LifeLock's last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected (or if LifeLock did not make a settlement offer before an arbitrator was selected), then LifeLock will pay you, in addition to the award, either U.S.
$500 or 10% of the amount awarded, whichever is greater.
c.
Injunctive and Declaratory Relief:&nbsp.
Except as set forth in Section 17.A., the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by you or LifeLock, and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.
To the extent that you or LifeLock prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the general public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration.
The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.
d.
Arbitration Fees:&nbsp.
If your claim for damages does not exceed $10,000, LifeLock will pay all fees imposed by the AAA to conduct the arbitration, including reimbursement of your initial filing fee, unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
If your claim for damages exceeds $10,000, standard AAA Rules will govern the payment of all AAA fees, including filing, administration and arbitrator fees.
e.
Class Action Waiver:  YOU AND LIFELOCK AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
Further, if you have elected arbitration, unless both you and LifeLock agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.
f.&nbsp.
Modification of Dispute Resolution Section: Notwithstanding Section 3 or the last paragraph on the opening Section, if LifeLock changes this "Dispute Resolution" section after the date you first accepted these Service Terms, and you have not otherwise affirmatively agreed to such changes, you may reject any such change by so stating within your Notice of Claim.
By failing to reject any changes to this Dispute Resolution section in your Notice of Claim, you agree to resolve any Claim between you and LifeLock in accordance with the terms of the Dispute Resolution section in effect as of the date of your Notice of Claim.
g.
Severability:&nbsp.
With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 17.B.e of this Agreement ("Class Action Waiver"), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of these Service Terms is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of these Service Terms shall still apply.
18.
General
Neither these Service Terms, nor any rights hereunder, may be assigned by operation of law or otherwise, in whole or in part, by you without our prior written permission.
Any purported assignment without such permission shall be void.
Any waiver of our rights under these Service Terms must be in writing, signed by LifeLock, and any such waiver shall not operate as a waiver of any future breach of these Service Terms.
In the event any portion of these Service Terms is found to be illegal or unenforceable, such portion shall be severed from these Service Terms, and the remaining terms shall be separately enforced.
Your use of the Services shall at all times comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations.
These Service Terms, and all documents incorporated into these Service Terms by reference, are the entire agreement between the parties with respect to this subject matter, and supersede any and all prior or contemporaneous or additional communications, negotiations, or agreements with respect thereto.
Our failure to enforce any of these Service Terms is not a waiver of such term or right.
The proprietary rights, disclaimer of warranties, representations made by you, indemnities, limitations of liability and general provisions shall survive any termination of these Service Terms.
These Service Terms are solely and exclusively between you and LifeLock and you acknowledge and agree that (i) no third party, including a third-party partner of LifeLock is a party to these Service Terms, and (ii) no third party, including any third-party partner of LifeLock has any obligations or duties to you under these Service Terms.
