Late Payments

The most important thing that you must understand as a borrower is the repercussions of making late payments on your loan.
Although each lender that we work with has its own terms and conditions for the loan and the repayment of the loan, there are some general repercussions that it is important for you to understand.
There will likely be charges for making a late payment.
Similarly, if you are extending a loan, the finance charge for the original loan must be paid on the original due date.
Then your loan principal will be deferred with an additional finance charge.
We recommend paying as much as possible towards your original due date in order to further reduce the charges you incur.
If you plan to deviate from your payment plan, you should contact your lender immediately to setup a new payment arrangement.
If your loan payment is rejected for any reason by your bank, the lender may initiate collection procedures and you will be prevented from receiving future loans from the lender until all of your payment obligations are met in full.
The most important thing to remember is to read about the payment options and penalties for the specific lender that you are connected with and to make sure that you fully understand these policies.
Lastly, remember that personal loans should be used only for short-term financial needs.
They are not a long-term financial solution.
In general you should always make sure to pay all of your outstanding loans/bills/debts on time.

Missing a Payment

BadCreditLoans.com strongly recommends that you pay all of your outstanding debt/loans/bills when they are due.
This will ensure that you will have a good payment record and minimize negative repercussions.
Each lender that BadCreditLoans.com works with has their own terms and conditions governing the specific implications of missing a payment.
However, if the lender does not receive a payment the likely result is that the lender will begin collection procedures against you and you will no longer be able to receive any more loans from the lender.
Therefore, it is important for you to both understand the specific requirements for repayment and the repercussions of missing a payment.
And, again we strongly urge you to pay all outstanding debts/loans/bills on time.
