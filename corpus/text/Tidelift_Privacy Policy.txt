This Privacy Policy explains and governs how data gathered by, and submitted to, those sites is used and processed.
We Care About Your Privacy
We aim to respect your privacy.
At the same time, it is necessary for us to store and process some data so that:

you can use the service effectively.
and
we can improve the services you use.

This policy explains what information we collect, what we do with it, and how we do it.
It also describes your choices regarding use, access and correction of your personal information.
Information We Collect and Use
Information From Website Users
When you visit our website, you may choose to interact with our services in ways that require us to gather personally-identifying information.
The amount and type of information that we gather depends on the nature of the interaction.
For example, we ask visitors who want to receive updates from us to provide an email address for that purpose.
Similarly, visitors who engage in transactions with Tidelift â by purchasing our services, for example â may be asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions.
Other types of information we may collect include:

Contact information, such as name, email address, mailing address, or phone number;
Unique identifiers for other services, such as usernames and account information for GitHub;
Information about your business, such as company name, company size, business type.

In each case, Tidelift collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitorâs interaction with Tidelift.
Tidelift does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below under âUses and Sharing of Your Dataâ.
You can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, but it may prevent you from using certain Tidelift features.
Information Collected from Other Sources
With your authorization, and to provide you with better services, we may also obtain information about you from other sources.
For example, if you create or log into your account through GitHub, we may receive information from that service (such as your username, basic profile information, and repository list).
The information we receive depends on which services you authorize and any options that are available.
Cookies and other Tracking of Website Visitors
In order to help continuously improve our service, we use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track how people use the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our website or service.
As is true of most websites, we also gather certain information automatically.
This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, and tracking of specific behavior on the site.
Where this information is personally identifying, we do not disclose it information other than as described below under âUses and Sharing of Your Dataâ.
We may partner with a third party to manage our advertising on other sites.
In that case, our third party partner may use cookies or similar technologies in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests.
You can opt out of interest-based advertising here, out of Google Analytics here, or if you live in the European Union here.
Uses and Sharing of Your Data

For example, we may develop and publish reports on website usage based on this data.
Legal Compliance
In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including meeting national security or law enforcement requirements.
We may also disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or other legal process, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.
Business Transfers
If Tidelift is acquired or merges with another company, or some or substantially all of our assets, are acquired, or in the unlikely event that Tidelift goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information could be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.
By using our site, you acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Tidelift may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.
