What does this Policy cover? This Cookie Policy describes how OpenX (âOpenXâ, âweâ, âusâ or âourâ) processes your data collected via cookies placed on your browser or device as you browse or otherwise interact with our website (your âcookie dataâ).
It applies only to visitors to the OpenX website.
We encourage you to read this whole Cookie Policy, because it provides important information about how we may process your cookie data, and the choices or rights you may have with respect to our processing of your cookie data.
If you would like to know how we process personal data, including cookie data, in the context of the OpenX Ad Exchange, please view our Ad Exchange Privacy Policy for more information.
If you would like to know how we may process personal data other than cookie data in the context of our website, please view our Website Privacy Policy. 2.
What are cookies? We use cookies on our website.
A cookie is a very small text document containing a string of characters that, in many cases, uniquely identifies your web browser or device.
Cookies are created when your browser loads a particular website.
The website sends information to the browser which then creates a text file, which is stored on your browser or your device.
Each cookie allows its issuer to identify certain information about the browser or device on which it is stored, such as whether it is a computer, tablet, or mobile device.
OpenX may place cookies on your browser or device every time you come back to our website or load a new page on our website.
You can find out more about the use of cookies on www.allaboutcookies.org. 3.
What cookies do we use and what information do they collect? 

Strictly necessary (required) cookies: these cookies are required to enable core website functionality.
Without these cookies, services you have asked for via this website cannot be provided.
If you disable these cookies, certain parts of the website may not function for you (for example, the website may not display properly on your device).
Because of that, we do not seek your consent for these cookies.

Analytics and functional (performance) cookies: these cookies help us improve or optimise the experience we provide or enable various helpful features on our website.
For example, they allow us to measure how visitors interact with our website, collect technical information such as the number of pages visited, whether or not email communications are opened or which parts of our website are clicked on.
They may also be used to remember your preferences (such as your language preference), your interests and the presentation of the website.
We use this information to improve the user experience and performance of our website.
Where required, we will ask for your consent to use these cookies.

Targeting cookies: we or third parties may use these cookies to collect information about your browsing habits in order to make advertising more relevant to you and your interests.
They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as to help measure the effectiveness of an advertising campaign.
Where required, we will ask for your consent to use these cookies.

Social media pixels or tags: These solutions are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or "like" button on our website, or when you engage with our content on or through a social site such as Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter.
These cookies collect information about your social media interaction with our website, such as whether or not you have an account with the social media site and whether you are logged into it when you interact with content on our website.
This information may be linked to targeting/advertising activities.

Please note that whenever our website displays content from a third party website or service (e.g., via a social media plug-in), it may result in cookies (or similar solutions, such as a Facebook pixel) from third parties being stored on your browser or device or third parties having access to information about how you use our website.
We do not control the storage and use of these cookies by these third parties and you should refer to the privacy policies of the relevant third parties for more information.
A list of performance and targeting cookies used on our website can be found here. 4.
What if we update this Cookie Policy? We reserve the right to update this Cookie Policy at any time.
