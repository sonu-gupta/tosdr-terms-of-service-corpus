Tawk.to mostly provides a support chat feature to the platform but with that comes the collection of statistics and usage information is collected.
To maintain a reasonable expectation of privacy as well as to minimize the technical requirements on the day-to-day running of the platform, the chat library is only loaded when explicitly required.
It is loaded dynamically when the user clicks on the button âNeed help? Letâs chat!â in the main menu.
Once loaded, tawk.to records some information on the user as well as their activities on the platform so that the agent that is connected to the chat has the necessary contextual information to help the user. User assistance
Simitless aims to provide a high quality of service to its users.
This is why we try to automatize to the largest extent the services we provide to our users.
This also allows us to provide a service regardless of opening hours and phone availability.
In addition to the contextual help that has been integrated into the platform, users can find specific help on our support site https://faq.simitless.com and, if needed, they can reach out to us by using the following communication means :

As a project established in France, the publisher of the Simitless platform is subject to the provisions of the data protection law of 6 January 1978 governing the processing of personal data.
In accordance with the CNIL, I have taken the necessary measures to comply with the regulations on data processing within the framework of the CNIL declarations 1773959 and 1774235.
Each user creating their applications is responsible for the declarations falling within their jurisdiction.
In accordance with the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), the publisher only processes personal data in the following situations:
with your consent;
when there is a contractual obligation (a contract between the publisher and you);
to meet a legal obligation (under EU or national law). Data Gathering
CNIL declaration number 1773959 and 1774235.
The personal information that can be collected on the platform is mainly used by the publisher for the management of relations with you, and, if necessary, for the processing of your orders.
They are recorded in the publisher's client file, and the file thus prepared from personal data is declared to the CNIL.
In accordance with the provisions of law n Â° 78-17 of January 6, 1978 modified, relating to data processing, files and freedoms, you are informed that the publisher uses automated processing systems on your personal data, in particular during your connection to the platform or as part of the online forms filled out by you.
The information collected may possibly be communicated to third parties linked to the publisher by contract for the execution of subcontracted tasks necessary for the management of your account and without your having to give your authorization.
You can oppose this transfer by expressing your refusal to our contact mentioned above.
In the event of a proven breach of legal or regulatory provisions, the user data and information may be communicated to judicial authorities, upon an explicit and motivated request.
When information is mandatory to use specific functionalities of the platform, the platform will mark this mandatory nature when entering data, most often by the use of the * symbol near the data field. List of main data collected directly by the platform
The Simitless platform does not require any specific information to be used.
The user name is optional and can be filled in with a pseudonym if the user wishes.
It is only present to allow other users to identify the account when collaborating in applications.
Only an email address is required for authentication and validation when creating an account.
All of the information collected is securely available to each user, in the user management page (https://simitless.com/user/).
Guest accounts can be used without any registration (but at the cost of certain technical limitations on collaborative features).
During the subscription procedure, additional information is requested in order to process the payment and to identify the parties involved in the subscription contract, payment and billing.
This information only covers the legal minimum that the publisher is asked to collect and includes the name, billing address, administrative jurisdiction (VAT, sales taxes, etc.), VAT number (if applicable) and any other information as required by the payment provider to process the payment by the payment methods available on the platform.
Simitless's web service collects indirect data and statistics (frequency of use, type and amount of data processed) to analyze and respond more precisely to user needs.
 
The payment data are processed directly by the payment provider on its secure PCI-compliant platform. User rights
In accordance with the law on the protection of personal data, you have the following rights which you can exercise by going to your user profile page https://simitless.com/user/ in your browser, by contacting us on https://contact.simtiless.com, by email at data@simitless.com or by contacting us at the postal address listed in the legal notice above.
The right to information: we have an obligation to inform you of how we use your personal data (as described in this privacy policy).
The right of access: it is your right to make a request for access to any data about you in order to receive a copy of the personal data that we hold.
however, due to the security and confidentiality obligation in the processing of personal data which rests with the publisher, you are informed that your request will be processed provided that you submit a proof of your identity, in particular by communicating a scan or a photocopy of your valid identity document to us and by abiding to a validation process.
The right to rectification: the right to ask us to rectify personal data about you that is incomplete or inaccurate.
Under this right, the law authorizes you to request the rectification, updating, blocking or erasure of data concerning yourself, which may be inaccurate, erroneous, incomplete or obsolete.
The right to erasure, also known as the âright to be forgottenâ: in certain cases, you can ask us to delete the personal data that we have concerning you (except if there is a legal reason which obliges us to keep them).
The right to limit processing: in certain cases, you have the right to ask us to suspend the processing of personal data.
The right to data portability: you have the right to ask us for a copy of your personal data in a common format (for example, a .csv or .json file, depending on the type of data).
The right to object: you have the right to object to the processing of your personal data (for example, by prohibiting us from processing your data for direct marketing purposes).
However, the use of this right is only possible in one of the following two situations: when the use of this right is based on legitimate grounds or when the use of this right is intended to prevent that the data collected is used for commercial prospecting purposes.
You will not have to pay any fees for access to your personal data (or for the use of any other right).
However, we may charge you a reasonable fee if your request is manifestly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.
In this case, we can also refuse to respond to your request.
The publisher will be entitled, if necessary, to oppose manifestly abusive requests because of their systematic, repetitive nature, or their number.
