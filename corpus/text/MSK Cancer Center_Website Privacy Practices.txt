 Notice to Individuals Located in the EU/EEA This Website Privacy Policy describes ways in which you may provide information to MSK using the Sites.
Personal Data about individuals located in the European Union or European Economic Area (generally referred to here as the âEUâ) are subject to special protections under EU law when the processing of those data are within the scope of the European Unionâs General Data Protection Regulation (âGDPRâ).
This Website Notice to Individuals Located in the EU/EEA (the âEU Website Noticeâ) applies to MSKâs processing of Personal Data that is within the scope of the GDPR, which we call collectively the âEEA Processing Activities.â The EU Website Notice applies only to EEA Processing Activities involving Personal Data collected through the Sites.
When you use the Sites to transfer your Personal Data to MSK in the United States for EEA Processing Activities, MSK is a controller of this Personal Data.
Please be aware that if you use the Sites to transfer your Personal Data to MSK in order to seek care at an MSK facility or a second opinion at MSK, you will be provided a copy of our EU Patient Notice and our Notice of Privacy Practices, which will govern our use of protected health information.
The EU Website Notice will not apply to MSKâs use of such information.
We rely on separate and overlapping bases to process your Personal Data lawfully.
MSK will use the Personal Data transferred or collected on the Sites only for the purposes described in this Website Privacy Policy.
MSKâs legal bases for processing your Personal Data include providing you with the information or services that you have requested, protecting your vital interests, furthering our legitimate interests, and your consent, if applicable.
When we process special categories of Personal Data, including data concerning your health, our legal bases for processing such data include protecting your vital interests, furnishing a medical diagnosis, performing preventive or occupational medicine or assessment of the working capacity of our workforce, carrying out our obligations under employment or social protection laws, and your consent, if applicable.
Legitimate interests that we rely on in processing your Personal Data include (i) improving and customizing the Sites for you, (ii) understanding how the Sites are being used, (iii) exploring ways to develop and grow our operations, (iv) ensuring the safety and security of the Sites, and (v) enhancing protection against fraud, spam, harassment, intellectual property infringement, crime and security risks.
Without the ability to collect and process your Personal Information, MSK would not be able to achieve those interests.
We may also use your Personal Data for purposes, including scientific research, that are compatible with the purposes for which such data were initially collected.
If our processing is based solely on consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent.
You may withdraw your consent by contacting us as set forth in the âContact Usâ section below.
Please note that, in certain cases, we may continue to process your Personal Data after you have withdrawn consent, if we have a legal basis to do so.
For example, we may retain certain information if we need to do so to comply with an independent legal obligation, or if it is necessary to do so to pursue our legitimate interest in keeping the Sites safe and secure, or if deleting the information would undermine the integrity of a research study in which you are enrolled.
MSK is located in the United States.
When you enter your Personal Data through one of the Sites, the data is being transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States, and could be transferred to, stored and processed in another country outside of the EU.
Please be aware that the European Commission has not found the United States, and possibly other countries to which your Personal Data may be transferred, to provide adequate safeguards for the protection of Personal Data.
However, MSK will take steps to maintain the privacy of your Personal Data as described in this Website Privacy Policy.
If MSK transfers your Personal Data outside the EU, we will do so in reliance on mechanisms recognized under the GDPR.
This includes (i) transferring your Personal Information to countries that the European Commission has determined to provide adequate data protection, (ii) obtaining your consent to transfer your Personal Data outside the EU after first informing you about the possible risks of such a transfer, (iii) transferring your information outside the EU if the transfer is necessary to the performance of a contract between you and MSK, including to provide treatment to you, or if the transfer is necessary to the performance of a contract between your physician or other health care provider located in the EU, and the contract was entered into in your interest, (iv) transferring your information outside the EU if necessary to establish, exercise or defend legal claims, or (v) transferring your Personal Data outside the EU to protect your vital interests.
We will retain your Personal Data for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Website Privacy Policy (for example, if you have an account, for as long as your account is active), subject to your right, under certain circumstances, to have certain of your Personal Data erased, as discussed in the next paragraph, unless a longer period is required under applicable law or is needed to resolve disputes or protect our legal rights.
If your Personal Data is processed for EEA Processing Activities, you have the right to (1) see Personal Data that MSK holds about you and receive any details required to be provided to you under applicable law, (2) correct or update your Personal Data, if inaccurate, (3) limit collection and use of your Personal Data under certain circumstances (for example, if you think it is inaccurate), (4) receive your Personal Data in an electronic format as required by law, except Personal Data that has been used for public interest purposes or for MSKâs required legal obligations, (5) request deletion of your Personal Data, subject to MSKâs need to keep such data to comply with legal requirements, for purposes of public health or to preserve the integrity of a research study, or to allow itself to defend itself from legal claims, and (6) file a complaint with a data protection authority (see http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm).
If you have questions about the processing of your Personal Data or rights associated with your Personal Data, see the section âContact Usâ below.

 Policy Changes This Website Privacy Policy is subject to occasional revisions.
We will notify you of changes by posting the new policy on the Sites and updating the effective date of the policy.
Any changes to this Website Privacy Policy will be effective upon thirty calendar days following our posting of notice of the changes on the Sites.
If you do not wish to permit changes in our use of your Personal Data, you must notify us that you wish for us to delete your Personal Data prior to the effective date of the changes.
Continued use of the Sites following such changes will indicate your acknowledgement of and agreement to be bound by the changes.
