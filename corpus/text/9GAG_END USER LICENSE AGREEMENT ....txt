We are not liable for any problems or disputes that you may have with such Payment Processors.
You authorize 9GAG and our Payment Processors to charge all sums for the purchases that you make on the Website.&nbsp.
Any processing or other transaction fees, whether imposed by an issuing bank of a credit card or Payment Processor involved in the processing of a payment transaction, are the sole responsibility of the User, as established by the Payment Processor.&nbsp.
You must be authorized to use the payment method used to make purchases through the Service.&nbsp.
9GAG may seek pre-authorization of your credit card prior to a purchase or charge to verify the credit card is valid and/or has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase.&nbsp.
These pre-authorizations will reduce your available balance by the authorization amount until it is released or reconciled with the actual charge.&nbsp.
Charges for Merchandise occur within a reasonable time of the transaction or shortly thereafter, and 9GAG reserves the right to aggregate multiple charges together into one transaction where such multiple charges occur in close proximity to one another.&nbsp.
This aggregation will help reduce 9GAGâs credit card transaction fees and enable us to continue to offer the Service for free.&nbsp.

7.7         &nbsp.
Taxes.&nbsp.
When you are a buyer of Merchandise, you are solely responsible for the payment of any taxes and fees arising out of such transaction.&nbsp.
You agree to indemnify and hold 9GAG harmless from any claims by any taxing authority arising out of your purchase of Merchandise on or through the Service.
7.8         &nbsp.
Refunds and Exchanges.&nbsp.
ALL SALES OF MERCHANDISE FROM THE SERVICE (BUT NOT NECESSARILY FROM EXTERNAL SERVICES) ARE FINAL, and 9GAG does not offer refunds for any purchased Merchandise.&nbsp.
If the Merchandise you purchased is misprinted, damaged, or defective, then in order to be eligible to exchange the Merchandise, you must submit a claim to us by sending an email to shop@9gag.com within four weeks from the date of receipt of the Merchandise.&nbsp.
If you do not receive your purchased Merchandise and believe it was lost in transit, then in order to be eligible to receive replacement Merchandise, you must submit a claim to us by sending an email to shop@9gag.com within four weeks of the estimated delivery date.
9GAG is not obligated to provide you with any exchanges or replacement merchandise if you fail to comply with the timing requirements set forth in this Section 7.8.
7.9         &nbsp.
Cancellation of Payments and Purchases.&nbsp.
Payments and purchases may not be cancelled by the User, except as required by law.&nbsp.
However, 9GAG reserves the right to refuse or terminate any purchase or attempted purchase at any time in its sole discretion.&nbsp.
You understand and agree that if you authorize a payment transaction with your credit card, debit card or other payment method, but your charge is rejected for any reason, there may be a hold on your use of that transaction amount for several days.
7.10       &nbsp.
Disputed Charges.&nbsp.
NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS EULA, YOU AGREE TO SUBMIT ANY DISPUTES REGARDING ANY CHARGE TO YOUR ACCOUNT OR CREDIT CARDS FOR PURCHASES THROUGH THE SERVICE (BUT NOT ANY EXTERNAL SERVICES) IN WRITING TO 9GAG WITHIN 60 DAYS OF SUCH CHARGE, OTHERWISE SUCH DISPUTE WILL BE WAIVED AND SUCH CHARGE WILL BE FINAL AND NOT SUBJECT TO CHALLENGE.
