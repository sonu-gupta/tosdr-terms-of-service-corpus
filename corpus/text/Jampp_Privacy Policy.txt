 1.
What do we do? Jampp provides solutions for app performance marketers.
Jamppâs technology powers advertisements that can appear on websites and mobile phone applications.
Jamppâs Demand Side Platform provides advertising technology which allows marketers to run their online media campaigns by facilitating the buying of auction-based display media across multiple inventory and data suppliers in a centralised management platform (theâServicesâ).
Jamppâs Demand Side Platform enables our clients, including advertisers and advertising agencies, to purchase advertising inventory, including display, video, audio, native, and mobile ads from publishers in an automated fashion.
Our Data Management Platform provides our clients with tools to onboard, segment, activate, and measure results of their advertising campaigns.
Depending on the case, we act as âData Controllersâ, âData Processorsâ or âData Sub-Processorsâ.
Jampp collaborates with Programmatic Ad Exchanges that act as âData Controllersâ.
In this scenario, we are âData Processorsâ (and âData Co-Controllersâ in some specific cases).
In these cases we may collect and securely forward data to be used for attribution purposes to third party Mobile Measurement Partners.
In certain cases at the specific request of customers which act as Data Controllers, through third party Mobile Measuring Platforms that act as âData Processorsâ, we act as âData Sub-Processorsâ.
Jampp follows IAB Europe principles on online behavioural advertising (available at https://www.iab.com/iab-member-code-of-conduct/) and is integrated with the IAB Europe unsubscription platform âYourOnlineChoicesâ which offers users the opportunity to express their choices about online advertising to all its stakeholders, including the desire to disable services (available at https://www.youronlinechoices.com/ie/), applicable to users in the EU.
