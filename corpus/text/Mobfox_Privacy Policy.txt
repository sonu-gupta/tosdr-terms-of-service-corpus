This policy explains our privacy practices for processing personally identifiable information on Mobfoxâs advertising solutions and platforms (the âServiceâ) and Mobfoxâs Website (the âSiteâ).
We process your personally identifiable information subject to the terms of this policy.
Mobfox provides data driven technology to
Mobfox Customers.
The Service
Mobfox provides Customers custom digital and programmatic based advertising solutions supported by large data analytics, proprietary platforms and optimization technologies.
As such, Mobfox has no direct interaction with the individuals that visit Customersâ websites (âUsersâ).
The personally identifiable information Mobfox collects is typically used for Real-Time Bidding complex technological tools or platforms that enable advertising buyers to bid in âreal timeâ for the opportunity to show an online advertisement when a web page is loaded, or an app is used by the User.
Customers required, according to Mobfoxâ agreements with Customers, to provide an appropriate notice to Users about this Privacy Policy.
We collect information you provide to our

The Personally Identifiable Information That We Collect
Mobfox collects personally identifiable information in several ways (as described below) to provide the Service and for other specific purposes, as described in this policy.
Please note that you are not required by law to provide us personally identifiable information.
Data collected through Customersâ websites and ads When Users engage with Customersâ website or Customersâ ads, we will obtain the following types of personally identifiable information through our engagement with Customers:
1.Data that User provides to the Customers, including registration details, age, gender and geo-location;
2.Data about Userâs device, including device dimensions, model, manufacturer, operating system and the origin of the data (the application or website that User used);
3.IP address and connection type;
We obtain such information by using digital identifiers.
You can find more information on our digital identifiers below:

Beacons, Pixels and Tags: Beacons (also sometimes referred to as web beacons or pixels) and tags enable online advertising companies to collect data, serve advertising, and provide related services, such as measurement or fraud prevention, on websites by allowing communication between a web browser and a server.
A beacon is a small transparent image that is placed on a web page.
A tag is a small piece of computer code that is run by the web browser.
Mobile SDK: A mobile SDK is the mobile app version of a beacon or tag (see Beacons and Tags above).
The SDK is a piece of computer code that publishers include in their apps to enable ads to be shown and to enable related services, such as measurement or fraud prevention, including by collecting and analyzing data which is available through the device on which the mobile SDK is installed.
Cookie: A cookie is a small text file that is stored in a web browser by a website or ad server.
By saving information in a cookie, websites and servers can remember preferences or recognize browsers from one visit to another or from one website to another.
Non-Cookie Technology: Todayâs online world is becoming increasingly complex, with a proliferation of new devices, software platforms, online services and other technology.
As such, cookies are not always available.
Therefore, companies are using alternative methods to distinguish devices.
For example, some platforms, such as Appleâs iOS and Googleâs Play Services for Android, provide unique IDs to be used for advertising.
Most mobile devices are assigned unique identifiers that also may be used to distinguish devices.
Additionally, it is possible to use mathematical techniques to make intelligent guesses about recognizing devices.
