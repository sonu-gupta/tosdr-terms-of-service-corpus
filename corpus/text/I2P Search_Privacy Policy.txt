Our Use of Cookies
We make use of the cookies technology, as most other websites do.
This makes it easy for our website to recognize you and your browser anytime you log on to the website and allows us to offer you an enhanced and personalized experience anytime you use the website.

Cookies are tiny files that are automatically downloaded to your computer to improve your experience.
You have the choice of allowing or disabling cookies on your web browser.

You can disallow the setting of cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser.
In most cases, however, disabling cookies often disables the functionality and features of the website.
It is therefore recommended that you leave cookies all on, especially if you are not sure whether you need them.
We use cookies for a host of reasons, as detailed below.

The cookies we set: I2P Search uses adverts to offset the costs of running this website as well as in the provision of funding for further development.
We thus use behavioral advertising cookies to ensure that we provide you with the most relevant advertisements where possible, and do this by anonymously tracking your interests so that we can present similar things that may interest you.
Third-party cookies: In certain special cases, we may also use cookies that are provided by trusted third parties.

Google Analytics: We also make use of Google Analytics, which is one of the most universally used and trusted analytics solutions to assist us in our understanding of how you use the website.
This allows us to brainstorm on possible ways that we can improve your browsing experience and helps us to keep on producing engaging content.
These cookies track characteristics such as how long you spent on the website and the pages that you clicked on.
Others: We occasionally test new features on the website and make subtle changes to the manner that the website is delivered.
During this phase, we deploy cookies that ensure that you receive a consistent experience on the website, while ensuring that we understand which optimizations our users (including you) appreciate the most.
Minors
Our website and its content and services are specifically meant for an adult audience and are not targeted towards minors.
We will never intentionally collect personal information from persons under the age of 18, except this is done with full parental consent or as permitted by the law.

Information Security
We do all that is in our power to make sure that your personal information is safe, and we implement a host of security measures to do this.
These security measures include physical, administrative, and technical safeguards as well as the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption technology.
Also, your personal information can only be accessed by a limited number of authorized professionals who are thereafter mandated to keep the information confidential.

You however, understand and fully accept that there is no full assurance of data security for information available on or through the internet.
We will thus not be liable for the unauthorized access to your personal information that is beyond our control.
Changes to Privacy Policy
We may occasionally modify and review this Privacy Policy as deemed necessary by us and without notifying any user beforehand.
We will, however, publish such modifications and/or revisions on the website so that you are always informed about the type of information that we collect and how we use such information.
Any use by you of our website after changes are published shall mean that you agree with the modified privacy policy.
