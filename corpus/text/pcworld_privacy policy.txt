Getting in touch What information we collect IDGC collects data about you that is limited to the kind of information that can be found on a typical business card: first name, last name, job title, employer/company name, work address, work email, and work phone number.

See our Cookie Policy for further details or if you are an EU resident or California consumer, visit our Member Preferences Center to modify your cookie settings.

However, to the extent that any cookie can uniquely identify a computer, mobile device, or tablet (âDeviceâ), or the person using that Device, and you are an EU resident, under the GDPR, this is personal data.
Therefore, this privacy policy shall apply to such personal data collected by IDGC.


Similarly, if you are a California consumer, under the CCPA, to the extent that any cookie can uniquely identify you or the device you, or any other person is using, via an IP address or other online identifier, this is also personal data.

What happens if you donât provide personal data? In order for us to provide the products, content or services you request, we need your personal data.
Therefore, if you do not provide such personal data, we cannot deliver the products, content or services. IDG Communications Publishing Network This website is one of many that IDGC and its group of undertakings operates, all of which we collectively refer to as the IDG Communications Publishing Network.
Where permitted by law, we may share the personal data we collect about you with another IDG Communications Publishing Network company so that we can provide you with information about products, content and services that might interest you, and for internal analytical and business development purposes. Please click here for a list of the online and print publications included in the IDG Communications Publishing Network. How do we safeguard your personal data? Security of your personal data IDGC maintains safeguards which include technical and organizational security measures to protect your personal data from loss, misuse, unauthorized use, access, inadvertent disclosure, alteration, and destruction, and we require the third parties we contract with to support IDGCâs business operations to employ reasonable security measures as well (see âWhen and how we share your information with othersâ below).
We update and test security on an ongoing basis and restrict access to your personal data to only those who need to know in order to provide IDGCâs products, content or services to you. Storage of your personal data We may store your personal data using IDGCâs own secure on-site servers or other internally hosted technology.
Your personal data may also be stored by third parties, via cloud services or other technology, to whom IDGC has contracted with, to support IDGCâs business operations (see âWhen and how we share your information with othersâ below).
These third parties do not use or have access to your personal data other than for cloud storage and retrieval, and IDGC requires such parties to employ at least the same level of security that we use to protect your personal data (see âSecurity of your personal dataâ above). What we do with the personal data we collect We use the personal data that we collect to communicate with you, deliver what you request, improve our service, and to present other information and business offers that may be of interest.

The legal basis we have for processing your personal data 
The GDPR requires data collectors, such as IDGC, to have a legal basis to use the personal data of EU residents.
Therefore, this section shall apply to any such personal data collected by IDGC.

We may also use your personal data to offer you products, content or services that may be of interest to you, based upon your interests or the preferences you shared with us, and may share your personal data with third party sponsors of content, events, and other business services or offers.
The legal basis for processing your personal data is your consent.
In certain circumstances we may otherwise process your personal data if IDGC has a legitimate interest in doing so and IDGC is not infringing any of your rights and freedoms.
When IDGC processes your personal data for IDGCâs legitimate interests, IDGC will consider and balance any potential impact on you and your rights under data protection and any other relevant law.
Our legitimate business interests do not override your interests.
IDGC will not use your personal data in circumstances where your rights and freedoms override our legitimate interests, unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law. When and how we share your personal data with others IDGC may share your personal data to deliver content and services from our sites, affiliated companies and third parties services that might interest you, including sponsored content and events, for business operations, and to comply with valid legal processes.

 For content and services that may interest you or that you request As we mention above, your personal data may be shared within the IDG Communications Publishing Network to provide you with information about products, content and services that might interest you and for internal analytical and business development purposes (see âIDG Communications Publishing Networkâ above).
We may also share your personal data with third parties to deliver third party sponsored content or other services that you request (see âthird party sponsored content and eventsâ below).
As indicated above (see âTo present offers that may be of interest to youâ), however, your personal data continues to be held by IDGC, unless you specifically indicate that IDGC can share it with the third party sponsor. For business operations We may also share your personal data with third parties we have contracted with to support IDGCâs business operations including delivery, fulfillment, payment processing, email deployment, suppression list management and data processing. For third party sponsored content and events IDGC partners with third party sponsors to make available a large library of content to our users, such as white papers, professional events (live or online), as well as other business services or offers.
In return for access to such offers, we may ask you to provide us with personal data as part of the registration.
We may use your personal data to send you the business offer you request.
In addition, your personal data may be shared with the third party sponsor(s) of the offer to communicate with you regarding the offer.
Please note that once your personal data is shared with the sponsor, the sponsorâs privacy policy, including information on how to opt-out in the future, will apply to your personal data. As required by law Your personal data may be shared when authorized by law or necessary to comply with a valid legal process. In the event of new ownership If part or all the ownership of IDGC or any of its products or services are sold or transferred, your personal data will be transferred to the new owner.

This section shall apply to any personal data collected by IDGC from EU residents.

If IDGC shares your personal data within the IDG Communications Publishing Network or with any other third party as described in this privacy policy and your personal data will be transferred to a State which is not a Member State of either the European Union or the EEA, or deemed adequate by the European Commission, IDGC (as a data controller/data exporter) will only conduct such transfer (to a data processor/data importer) if there are suitable safeguards in place, such as binding corporate rules, standard contractual clauses, approved Codes of Conduct, or approved certification mechanism.
