We do not store your credit card information, unless you choose the option to save such information in order to make recurring payments easier without having to re-enter your details each time.

We do not store any credit card code verification values and merely forward such values and your credit card number in an encrypted manner for the purpose of processing your payment by our payment service provider.

For improving your experience on the Platform and developing new functionalities of the Platform



 


We use clickstream data to :


offer you tailored content, such as giving you more relevant search results when using our Services.
to determine how much time you spend on our Platform and in what manner you navigate through our Platform in order to understand your interests and to improve our Services based on this data.
For example, we may provide you with suggestions on content that you can visit based on the contents you have clicked.
to monitor and report the effectiveness of the campaign delivery to our business partners and for internal business analysis.

 

If you choose to provide us with your location data, we use your location data for following purposes:


to compile anonymous and aggregated information about the characteristics and behaviour of OLX users, including for the purposes of business analysis, segmentation and development of anonymous profiles.
to enhance the performance of our Services and to personalise the content we direct towards you.
For example - with the help of location data we display ad listings which are in your vicinity to improve your buying experience.
For this purpose, Google Maps is integrated into our Platform.
This means that both Google and we are responsible for the processing of your location data in the context of Google Maps.
In any case, we will not process your location data for any other purposes but those explained in this Privacy Statement.
However, Google might process such location data for their own purposes as explained in the Google Privacy Policy which can be reviewed Your use of Google Maps through our Platform is subject to Google Mapsâ Terms of Service.
to measure and monitor your interaction with the third-party advertisements banners we place on our Platform.

 

With the help of your account information which includes your email ID and phone number, we map the different devices (such as desktop, mobile, tablets) used by you to access our Platform.
This allows us to associate your activity on our Platform across devices and helps us in providing you a seamless experience no matter which device you use.

 

We use the images you upload, the descriptions and prices you provide in your ad listings to train machine learning models to personalize search results in relation to ad ranking and user interest, to improve the identification and presentation of ad listings, to improve the search function and to increase the likelihood of a successful sale.
This helps us to improve our Services and to provide you with a better user experience.

 

To show and recommend ad listings on our Services that may be of interest to you, we make use of algorithms that use information related to your browsing behaviour, items you bought, clickstream data, your user ID and your location data if you have given us permission to use this.
We use this form of automated decision-making on the basis of our legitimate interest in improving our Services and provide a better user experience by offering you more relevant ad listings.

 

We access and analyze your chat messages with other users conducted through the chat function on our Platform for product enhancement and to provide you with a better user experience (e.g.
to identify sold items and to provide you with active listings only).
Therefore, we develop and train machine learning models and algorithms to automatically analyze your chat content.
To build and train our machine learning models our machine learning specialists may review exemplary chat content manually.
In these circumstances highly restricted access rights apply to selected machine learning specialists analyzing the chat content.
During this analyzation process, we are de-identifying chat content as much as possible by applying a scanning filter to detect and hide personal data such as names, phone numbers, e-mail addresses.
However, there may still be cases beyond our control in which the chat content may show certain personal data that you have chosen to provide.

 

In case you agree to opt for KYC verification as available on our Services, depending on the device camera permission we will request you to click in real time an image of your face and an image of your identity proof in quick succession in order to verify your identity.
Upon completion of the KYC process, in case the image on the identity proof matches with the image of the face captured, your account will be considered as verified.
Such verification will help you to build trust among other users and receive better responses to your listings.

 

In case you agree to provide the RC while posting an ad for your car on our Services, we will request to provide an image of your RC during the posting flow, along with images of you car.
Upon submitting your listing, if the RC details matches with registration number of your car, your ad listing will state âRC reviewed by OLXâ.
Such verification will help you to build trust among other users and receive better responses to your listings.
The RC will be reviewed internally and no details of the RC will be displayed on our Services.

 
We process the above information for adequate performance of our contract with you and on the basis of our legitimate interest to improve your experience of our Services.


To provide you a safe and secure Platform



 


We use your mobile number, log data and unique device identifiers to administer and protect our Platform (including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, fraud prevention, system maintenance, support, reporting and hosting of data).

 

We access and analyze your chat messages with other users conducted through the chat function on our Services for customer satisfaction, safety and for fraud prevention purposes (e.g.
to block spam or abusive messages that may have been sent to you by other users).
Therefore, we develop and train machine learning models and algorithms helping us to automatically detect and prevent inappropriate and fraudulent user behaviour.
During the analyzation and training process, we are de-identifying chat content as much as possible by anonymizing the unique identification values assigned to users.
However, there may still be cases beyond our control in which the chat content may show certain personal data that you have chosen to provide.
Only in limited cases and circumstances our customer safety and security specialists review chat content manually, for example if we have strong indications leading to the urgent suspicion of fraudulent activities.
In these circumstances highly restrictive access rights apply to selected customer safety and security specialists analyzing the chat content. 


To prevent and detect fraud on our Services, we make use of algorithms that recognize suspicious or fraudulent user behaviour based on certain information such as user activity and posted content, which may lead to us banning certain user accounts.
Automated banning happens when there is a very high degree of certainty that an account or action is fraudulent.
Otherwise human review takes place by selected customer safety and security specialists on the basis of highly restrictive access rights.
We use this form of automated decision-making on the basis of our legitimate interest to detect and prevent fraud and to keep our Services safe and secure for our users.
If you think that your account was wrongfully banned, you can contact our Customer Support team in which case our team will review the decision to ban your account. 


We collect certain information from and in relation to the electronic device from which you are accessing our Services on the basis of our legitimate interest in preventing fraud on our Services.

The device related information is used to determine whether the same device is being used when users interact with our Services.
We associate such information with a user fraud score on the basis of which we may ban certain users.
For more information on this please be referred to our Policy for Cookies and Similar Technologies.
