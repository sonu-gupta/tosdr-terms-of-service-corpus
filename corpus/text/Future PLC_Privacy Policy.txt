We use web beacons in our emails to track the success of our marketing campaigns.
If you open an email from us, we can see which of the pages of our website you visited.
Our web beacons donât store any information on your computer but, by communicating with our cookies on your computer, they can tell us when you have opened an email from us.
We may keep track of the emails that we send you.
We also keep a record of what communications you have selected to receive or not to receive.
If you would like to opt out of receiving such emails you can unsubscribe at any time or contact our DPO.

It may be shared with our advertising partners and other third party advertising companies globally for the purpose of enabling interest-based content or targeted advertising throughout your online experience (e.g.

You have the right to express a choice regarding our sharing of this data with LiveRamp for the above purposes, of the creation of this code, or of our sharing of the code with our advertising partners.

What lawful bases do we rely on for processing?

In order to process your personal data, we must have a lawful reason for doing so.
GDPR sets out six lawful bases under which organisations can collect, use and store personal data.
We rely on four of the lawful bases:
Necessary for the performance of a contract
If you are our customer, for example a subscriber of a magazine or an attendee at one of our events, we will process your personal data on the basis that it is necessary for us to provide our products and services to you.
Consent
In some instances we rely on your specific consent to process your personal information.
This is where you have actively agreed and âopted-inâ, for example to receive marketing communications from us, and you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.
Compliance with laws
We may have to process and share your personal data in order to comply with our legal obligations, or to protect our rights or the rights of others.
For example, we are required to collect certain information from you when processing your subscription payment for tax or financial reporting reasons.
Legitimate interests
In some situations we rely on our legitimate business interests in order to collect and use your personal data.
In these situations, we have conducted a balancing test to carefully consider the impact of the processing on your interests, rights and freedoms.
We will only undertake the processing if we are satisfied there is no negative impact on you.
We rely on Legitimate Interests for the following activities:

providing, maintaining, improving and developing our products and services;
sending direct marketing communications about our products and services to customers;
sending marketing communications related to the products and services of carefully selected companies in a business-to-business context;
managing suppression and unsubscribe requests;

researching publicly available business contact details;

managing certain aspects of our events;
analysing the use of our products and services;
using analytics to identify usage trends and determining the effectiveness of campaigns;
allowing you to comment on on our sites;
dealing with queries and complaints;
personalising your experience on our sites;
identifying fraudulent behaviour and ensuring our websites and systems are secure.

If you object to our reliance on Legitimate Interests for any purpose please contact our DPO.

Agents
We use third parties to perform certain functions on our behalf including fulfilling orders, sending emails, organising and managing events, running competitions and promotions, conducting surveys or polls, removing repetitive information from customer lists, comment hosting, website analysis, data analysis and processing credit card payments.
They will have access to your personal information if necessary to perform their function but they cannot use it or disclose it for any other purpose, unless you have specifically given them consent to do so.

The use of your personal information by such third parties will be subject to their own privacy policy and practices.
We are not responsible for the privacy policy or practices of any such third party.

Storage and retention of data

Your information is collected and stored on our secure systems, mainly based in the UK and European Economic Area (EEA).
Where we use third party service providers to store data, we have appropriate agreements in place to ensure that your personal data is protected.
Your personal data may be transferred to a country outside the EEA if, for example, a supplier or service is based outside the EEA.
We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure your data is treated securely, including ensuring the location has been granted âadequacy statusâ by the European Commission, or using our agreement with the supplier contains model contractual clauses approved by the European Commission, or ensuring the company we are transferring the data to is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield.
We hold personal data for a variety of different purposes and the length of time we keep your data will vary depending on the services or products we are providing.
We will only keep your data for a reasonable period of time, which is based on the purpose for which we are using your data.
Once that purpose has been fulfilled, we will securely delete that data or anonymise your information (so that we, or anyone else, can no longer tell that data relates to you) unless we are required to retain the data longer for legal, tax or accounting reasons.

Security

We are committed to protecting the personal data we hold.
In accordance with GDPR, we adopt appropriate technical and organisational measures to help prevent unauthorised access to your information and ensure data is held securely.
We also require any third parties to whom we may transfer personal data to have appropriate security measures in place.
We ask third parties to complete Data Security Questionnaires so we can be sure they are a safe place for your data.

Protecting childrenâs privacy

Our products and services are for a general audience and not aimed at children.
However, we recognise that some of our publications, for example in our Knowledge and Gaming portfolios, may appeal to a younger audience.
We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of sixteen or send any marketing communications to children.
If we are running a competition which might be of interest to children, our competition rules specify that a parent or guardian must consent to entry.
If, in the future, we collect personally identifiable information from children in connection with our products and services, we will do so in compliance with all relevant laws and regulations including, without limitation, obtaining parental consent where necessary.
The Internet offers children wonderful educational and entertainment resources.
Your guidance and involvement are essential to help ensure that children have a safe and rewarding online experience.
We encourage you to visit https://www.google.co.uk/intl/en/safetycenter/families/start/ for more information about keeping your family safe online.

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights).
If you have authorised a third party to submit a request on your behalf, we will ask them to prove they have your permission to act.
This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request.

You will not usually have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the rights), however, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is unfounded, repetitive or excessive.
Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
If we choose not to action your request we will explain to you the reasons for our refusal.

Important Information for California Residents

This section applies only to California residents.&nbsp.
It describes how we collect, use and share Personal Information of California residents in operating our business, and their rights with respect to that Personal Information.&nbsp.
For purposes of this section, âPersonal Informationâ has the meaning given in the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (âCCPAâ) but does not include information exempted from the scope of the CCPA. 

Your California privacy rights.


As a California resident, you have the rights listed below.
However, these rights are not absolute, and in certain cases we may decline your request as permitted by law. 


Information.&nbsp.
You can request the following information about how we have collected and used your Personal Information during the past 12 months:

The categories of Personal Information that we have collected.
The categories of sources from which we collected Personal Information.
The business or commercial purpose for collecting and/or selling Personal Information.
The categories of third parties with whom we share Personal Information.
Whether we have disclosed your Personal Information for a business purpose, and if so, the categories of Personal Information received by each category of third party recipient.
Whether weâve sold your Personal Information, and if so, the categories of Personal Information received by each category of third party recipient.  



Access.&nbsp.
You can request a copy of the Personal Information that we have collected about you during the past 12 months. 

Deletion.&nbsp.
You can ask us to delete the Personal Information that we have collected from you.

Opt-out of sales.&nbsp.
If we sell your Personal Information, you can opt-out.
In addition, if you direct us not to sell your Personal Information, we will consider it a request pursuant to Californiaâs âShine the Lightâ law to stop sharing your personal information covered by that law with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
We share your Personal Information with third parties in the following circumstances, which California law classifies as a âsaleâ of your Personal Information:

supplying your data to third parties with your express consent (e.g.
where you opt in to receive third party marketing or where you have requested to be contacted by a third party);
supplying your data to list brokers (but only where you have consented to be contacted by third parties);
 supplying attendee data to third parties who provide services in connection with our events, and sending your data to suppliers of certain products and services (where you have consented to hear from such third parties); 
like many companies, we use services that help deliver interest-based ads, content and services to you.&nbsp.
California law classifies our use of these services as a âsaleâ of your Personal Information to the companies that provide the services.
This is because we allow them to collect information from our website users (e.g., online identifiers and browsing activity) so they can help serve ads, content and services&nbsp.
more likely to interest you. 



Opt-in.&nbsp.
If we know that you are younger than 16 years old, we will ask for your permission (or if you are younger than 13 years old, your parentâs or guardianâs permission) to sell your Personal Information before we do so.

Nondiscrimination.&nbsp.
You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination.
This means that we will not penalize you for exercising your rights by taking actions such as denying you services.
increasing the price/rate of services.
decreasing service quality.
or suggesting that we may penalize you as described above for exercising your rights.  


How to exercise your right to information, access, deletion or your right to opt-out of the âsaleâ of your Personal Information

You may exercise your California privacy rights by submitting a request form or emailing dpo@futurenet.com quoting âCalifornia Privacy Rightsâ in the subject header.
We will need to confirm your identity and California residency to process your requests to exercise your information, access or deletion rights.&nbsp.
