We will not sell, distribute or lease your personal information unless we have your permission or are required by law to do so. 3.
Legal basis for processing personal information Our legal basis for collecting and using your personal information as described above will depend on the specific context in which we collect it.
Our main reason for collecting and using your personal information is to perform our contract with you (i.e.
to make sure you get your Order when you want it).
However we will also use your personal information where it is in our legitimate business interests to do so (but only if our interests are not overridden by your data protection interests or your fundamental legal rights and freedoms).
In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you (e.g.
in the event of legal proceedings) or we might need to process it or share it with others to âprotect your vital interestsâ (this is legal speak for saving your life) or those of another person (e.g.
in a case where another personâs life is in danger).
If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (and weâll also explain the possible consequences of you not providing it).
Similarly, we may collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party).
Relevant legitimate interests include a) to market to you or make you offers that we believe will interest you.
b) to analyse and understand how our services are used and so to improve them.
c) for fraud prevention or prevention of other criminal acts.
or d) to keep our systems secure.
If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the âHow to contact usâ below. 4.
International data transfers We may transfer your personal information to countries other than the country in which you are resident.

This means that when we collect your personal information we may process it in any of these countries.
Whilst these countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country, you can rest assured that Just Eat takes care to implement appropriate safeguards to protect your personal information in those countries in accordance with this Privacy Notice.
Some of the safeguards we rely on include, where appropriate, using the European Commissionâs approved standard contractual clauses with our suppliers, intra-group transfer agreements (so that we can safely transfer your data between the Just Eat group of companies all over the world). 5.
Security We place great importance on keeping your personal information safe and secure.
As such, we put in place appropriate technical and organisational measures / industry standard technology to protect it from unauthorised access and unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage.
The security measures we use are designed to provide a level of protection security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information.
Where you have chosen a password which allows you to access certain parts of the Services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.
We advise you not to share your password with anyone and to use a unique password for our Services.
We will not be liable for any unauthorised transactions entered into using your name and password. 6.
Data retention Just Eat will retain your personal information where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, while you hold an account with us or to enable us to meet our legal, tax or accounting obligations).
If you object to us processing certain categories of your personal information (including in relation to receiving marketing communications from us), we will retain a record of your objection to the processing of your information so that we can continue to respect your wishes.
We will destroy or permanently anonymise your personal information at the point that we no longer need to process it for our ongoing legitimate business needs or for any legal reason.
If this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store it and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. 7.

Below is a summary of your rights in respect of the personal information of yours which Just Eat handles:
