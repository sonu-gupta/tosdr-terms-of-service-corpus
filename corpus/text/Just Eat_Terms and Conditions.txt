We advise you to print a copy of these Website Terms for future reference.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE AND SALE 1.
INTRODUCTION AND OUR ROLE 1.1.
Company details: JUST EAT is a company registered in England and Wales with registered company number 04656315, whose registered office is at Fleet Place House, 2 Fleet Place, London, EC4M 7RF.
1.2.
VAT number: Our VAT number is GB 945 7192 91.
1.3.
Product Orders: We provide a way for you to communicate your orders (âOrderâ or "Orders") for products (âProductâ or "Products") to delivery or takeaway restaurants in the UK (âRestaurantâ or "Restaurants") displayed on the Website.
The legal contract for the supply and purchase of Products is between you and the Restaurant that you place your Order with and we will conclude the sale of Products on behalf of, and as commercial agent for, the Restaurants in all cases.
1.4 Delivery Services: The majority of Restaurants on our Website provide their own delivery service in order to bring the Product(s) you order to you.
In this case, the Restaurant may charge you a delivery fee (which we will collect on behalf of the Restaurant).
In some cases, however, we provide the delivery services, and in those cases we may charge you the delivery fee ourselves (in respect of that delivery fee only, as principal, rather than as commercial agent for the Restaurant). 2.

Website access: You may access some areas of the Website without making an Order or registering your details with us.
Most areas of the Website are open to everyone.
2.2.

If you do not accept these Website Terms, you should leave the Website immediately, and you will not be able to order any Products through the Website.

You should check the Website regularly to review the current Website Terms, because they are binding on you.
You will be subject to the policies and terms and conditions in force at the time that you place an Order through us.
2.4.

Capacity and age: By placing an Order through the Website, you warrant that:


3.1.1.
You are legally capable of entering into binding contracts with Restaurant.
and


3.1.2.
You are at least 18 years old.


3.2.
You acknowledge and agree that if you have a specific food allergy or intolerance, you will contact the Restaurant directly to check that the food is suitable for you, before placing your order directly with them.
3.3.

3.3.2.
If your Order includes any alcohol, cigarettes or other smoking products, you will be asked to provide proof of your age on collection or delivery of your Order.
If you are unable to provide proof that you are aged 18 or over to the satisfaction of your chosen Restaurant, or if the Restaurant reasonably believes that the alcohol, cigarettes or other smoking products you have ordered have been bought by you on behalf of someone under the age of 18, the Restaurant reserves the right not to complete the delivery of the alcohol, cigarettes or other smoking products to you.

 4.
HOW TO MAKE AN ORDER AND HOW IT IS PROCESSED 4.1.
Compiling your Order: Once you have selected the Products you wish to order from the menu of your chosen Restaurant and provided the other required information, you will be given the opportunity to submit your Order by clicking or selecting the "proceed", "place my order" or similar button.
It is important that you check all the information that you enter and correct any errors before clicking or selecting this button.
once you do so you will be entering into a contract with the Restaurant and errors cannot be corrected (subject to paragraph 4.2.
below).
Where you have not logged in or created an account previously, then you may have the option to continue with your Order as a guest.
By electing to complete your Order as a guest, you are agreeing that Just Eat will create a temporary Just Eat guest account for you which will, unless otherwise stated in these Website Terms, be accessible only (a) from the device which you use to place the Order.
and (b) for a period of up to twelve months following the date of the Order.&nbsp.
Your access to your temporary guest account will expire on the âExpiry Dateâ which shall be the earlier of (i) the date falling six months after the date on which you last accessed the temporary guest account.
(ii) the date falling twelve months after the date on which the temporary guest account was created.
and (iii) the date on which you logout of your temporary guest account, or clear the cache on the device which you used when the temporary guest account was created.
4.2.
Amending or cancelling your Order: Once you have submitted your Order and your payment has been authorised, you will not be entitled to change or cancel your Order, nor will you be entitled to a refund (please refer to paragraphs 4.4 and 5.6 for details of the process relating to rejected Orders and refunding of payment).
If you wish to change or cancel your Order, you may contact our Customer Care team as described in paragraph 6.3 and they will attempt to contact the Restaurant in order to communicate your requests.
However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to reach the Restaurant or that the Restaurant will agree to your requests as they may have already started processing your Order.
4.3.
Payment authorisation: Where any payment you make is not authorised, your Order will not be processed or communicated to the relevant Restaurant.
4.4.
Processing your Order and Restaurant rejections: On receipt of your Order, we will send it to the relevant Restaurant and will notify you by email that your Order has been received and is being processed.
Please note that any confirmation page that you may see on the Website and any Order confirmation e-mail that you may receive each confirm that you have a contract for the sale of Products with a Restaurant but does not necessarily mean that your Order will be fulfilled by the Restaurant.
We encourage all our Restaurants to accept all Orders and to communicate any rejection promptly, and we will notify you (generally by email) as soon as reasonably practicable if a Restaurant rejects your Order.
However, Restaurants have the ability to reject Orders at any time because they are too busy, due to weather conditions or for any other reason.
In doing so, Restaurants will be in breach of their agreement with you and any payment made in respect of the order will be returned to you in accordance with paragraph 5.6 below.
4.5.
Delivery of your Order: Estimated times for deliveries and collections are provided by the Restaurants and are only estimates.
Neither we nor the Restaurants guarantee that Orders will be delivered or will be available for collection within the estimated times. 
4.6.
Commercial agency: For the avoidance of doubt, any orders processed by JUST EAT through the Website are processed by JUST EAT in its capacity as commercial agent of the relevant Restaurant. 5.
PRICE AND PAYMENT 5.1.
VAT and delivery costs: Prices will be as quoted on the Website.
These prices include VAT but may exclude delivery costs (if you opt for delivery instead of collection) and any administration or service charge imposed by the Restaurant.
These will be added to the total amount due where applicable.
5.2.
Incorrect pricing: This Website contains a large number of menus and it is possible that some of the menus may include incorrect prices.
If the correct price for an Order is higher than the price stated on the Website, we will normally contact you before the relevant Order is dispatched.
In such an event, neither we nor the relevant Restaurant is under any obligation to ensure that the Order is provided to you at the incorrect lower price or to compensate you in respect of incorrect pricing.
5.3.
Payment methods: Payment for Orders must be made by an accepted credit or debit card through the Website or in cash to the Restaurant at the point of delivery to, or collection by, you.
5.4.
Card payments: If you pay by credit or debit card, you may be required to show the card to the Restaurant at the time of delivery or collection as proof of identification and so that they can check that the card corresponds with the receipt data for the Order.
Please note that from time to time there may be delays with the processing of card payments and transactions.
this may result in payments taking up to sixty (60) days to be deducted from your bank account or charged to your credit or debit card.
5.5.
Credit and discount vouchers: A credit or discount may apply to your Order if you use a promotional voucher or code recognised by the Website and endorsed by JUST EAT, and you pay for any balance by credit or debit card.
Please refer to our Voucher Terms &amp.
Conditions for the full terms and conditions applicable to the use of credit and discount vouchers.
Please note that because of standard banking procedures, your bank or card issuer will initially "ring-fence" the full amount of the Order (before any credit or discount) in your account for between 3 to 5 working days (or longer, depending on your bank or card issuer), and this amount will therefore be unavailable in your account for that period.
The credit or discount will be applied at the time your bank or card issuer transfers the funds for your Order to us, at which point the credit or discounted amount will not be transferred to us and will instead be released by your bank or card issuer back into your available balance.
You acknowledge and agree that neither we nor the relevant Restaurant will be responsible or liable to you in relation to this delay by your bank or card issuer in the release of funds back into your account.
Where you use the Website as a guest, any account credit which you accrue against your temporary guest account can only be redeemed for an Order placed via your temporary guest account and cannot be transferred for use on another account.
5.6.
Rejected Orders: Because of standard banking procedures, once you have submitted an Order that you are paying for by credit or debit card and your payment has been authorised, your bank or card issuer will "ring-fence" the full amount of your Order.
If your Order is subsequently rejected by the Restaurant (as described in paragraph 4.4 above) or cancelled for any other reason, your bank or card issuer will not transfer the funds for the Order to us, and will instead release the relevant amount back into your available balance.
However, this may take between 3 to 5 working days (or longer, depending on your bank or card issuer).
You acknowledge and agree that neither we nor the relevant Restaurant will be responsible or liable to you in relation to this delay by your bank or card issuer in the release of funds back into your account. 6.
CUSTOMER CARE 6.1.
General: Customer care is extremely important to us.
Subject to paragraphs 6.5 and 11, our Customer Care team will therefore try to assist you where possible if you have any problems with your Order.
You can contact our Customer Care team by clicking or selecting the "Need help?", "Help" or similar button or by calling the telephone number shown on the Website.
6.2.
Questions about your Order: If your Order is taking longer than expected or you have any other problems with your Order, you can contact our Customer Care Team as described above and one of our Customer Care Advisers will attempt to contact the Restaurant in order to follow up on your query.
6.3.
Changing or cancelling your Order: If you wish to change or cancel your Order after it has been submitted and payment has been authorised, you may contact our Customer Care team as described above and they will attempt to contact the Restaurant in order to communicate your requests.
However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to reach the Restaurant or that the Restaurant will agree to your requests as they may have already started processing your Order.
6.4.
Complaints or feedback: In the event that you are dissatisfied with the quality of any Products or the service provided by a Restaurant, please consider providing feedback in the form of ratings, comments and reviews on the Website (together, "Reviews") to reflect your experience.
The Reviews are an important part of our quality control process.
6.5.
Compensation: If you are dissatisfied with the quality of any Products or the service provided by a Restaurant and wish to seek a refund, a proportionate price reduction or any other compensation, you should contact the Restaurant directly to lodge your complaint and, where appropriate, follow the Restaurant's own complaint procedures.
If you are unable to contact the Restaurant, or the Restaurant refuses to deal with your complaint, you can contact our Customer Care Team as described above within 72 hours of placing your Order and one of our Customer Care Advisers will attempt to contact the Restaurant in order to request compensation on your behalf.
Please note, however, that the legal contract for the supply and purchase of Products is between you and the Restaurant that you place your Order with.
We have no control over Restaurants and the quality of the Products or service that they provide, and we are not able to provide, and have no responsibility or liability for providing, any compensation to you on behalf of any Restaurant. 7.

Unless otherwise provided or specified in the Specific Voucher Terms, any credit must be used within six (6) months of the date on which the Paycode Voucher is issued.
Where a Paycode Voucher is credited against a temporary guest account, such credit must be used by the Expiry Date (as defined in the Website Terms).
Any credit which remains unused by the Expiry Date will no longer be available for you to use.
6.
If the order value is less than the Paycode Voucher value that has been credited to the customer account or temporary guest account, no change or cash will be given.
However, any balance will be left as a credit in the customer account or temporary guest account, and may be redeemed against subsequent orders.

The right to use a Voucher is personal to the original recipient and may not be transferred.
No Voucher may be copied, reproduced, distributed, or published directly or indirectly in any form or by any means for use by an entity other than the original recipient, or stored in a data retrieval system, without our prior written permission.
In particular, Vouchers distributed or circulated without our written approval, for example on an Internet message board or on a "bargains" website, are not valid for use and may be refused or cancelled.
12.
Unless otherwise provided or specified in the Specific Voucher Terms:
12.1 Vouchers may not be used in conjunction with other Vouchers or any other discounts or promotions provided or advertised from time to time;
12.2 each Voucher will be valid for use by a recipient only once;
12.3 each customer or household is limited to one Voucher per promotion or offer.
and
12.4 the right to use a Voucher is personal to the original recipient and may not be transferred.
13.
When you use a Voucher you warrant to us that you are the duly authorised recipient of the Voucher and that you are using it in accordance with these terms, lawfully, legally and in good faith.
If we believe in our sole discretion that a Voucher is being used in breach of these terms, unlawfully, illegally or in bad faith, we may reject or cancel the Voucher. Miscellaneous 14.
Please note that because of standard banking procedures, your bank or card issuer will initially "ring-fence" the full amount of an Order (before any Voucher credit or discount is applied) in your account for between 3 to 5 working days (or longer, depending on your bank or card issuer), and this amount will therefore be unavailable in your account for that period.
The credit or discount will be applied at the time your bank or card issuer transfers the funds for your order to us, at which point the credit or discounted amount will not be transferred to us and will instead be released by your bank or card issuer back into your available balance.
15.
Vouchers may not be exchanged for cash.
16.
We shall not be liable to any customer or household for any loss or claim arising out of the refusal, rejection, cancellation or withdrawal of any Voucher or any failure or inability of a customer or household to use a Voucher for any reason.
17.
We reserve the right, at any time and in our sole discretion, to add to or amend these terms and conditions in relation to the use of Vouchers or to vary or terminate the operation of a Voucher at any time without notice.
