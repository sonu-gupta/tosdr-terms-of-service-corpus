3.
Contractual Relationship coming into Effect

It is hereby explicitly stated that the content of DSwissâ website or of the account registration simply represents an invitation to submit an offer and does not constitute a binding offer by DSwiss.
The customer, on his part, indicates his intention to avail himself of the Internet Data Safe services offered by DSwiss by supplying the necessary details and through express confirmation of his consent to the provisions governing the Contractual Relationship.

The Contractual Relationship comes into effect only upon the statement of acceptance by DSwiss having been received in the customer's account.

5.
Description of the Services performed by DSwiss


5.1 Data Upload, Change and Deletion

On conclusion of the Contractual Relationship, DSwiss shall allocate the customer a personal storage space of an agreed-upon size (quota) in a data storage device.
This will enable the customer to upload his electronic data and to save them in the storage space allocated to him (hereinafter referred to as "Data Upload"), to the extent that the storage space is sufficient for this purpose.

The customer retains all rights in the uploaded data.
The customer authorizes DSwiss to process the data within the meaning of data reproduction solely for the purpose of storage.

The customer may download, change or delete the uploaded data at any time.


5.2 User Name, Password and Login Recovery Code

As part of uploading data, the customer chooses an access name (hereinafter referred to as the âUser Nameâ) and an access password (hereinafter referred to as the âPasswordâ).
This will ensure that only the customer has access to his archived data.
The customer also receives a login recovery code to be used in case he does not remember his User Name and/or Password.

DSwiss has no access to the customerâs account and archived data.
DSwiss therefore does not gain any knowledge of the content of the archived data.

The customer is responsible for taking care of the safe custody and use of his User Name and Password.
Should these access codes become known to any third party, DSwiss shall not be liable for any resulting loss or damage, and the customer must indemnify and hold DSwiss harmless against damages in accordance with Section 7 hereof.


5.3 Data Inheritance

The customer has the option to make the uploaded data available to beneficiaries (so-called data inheritance).
The customer can use an input mask provided by DSwiss to designate the beneficiaries of these data (hereinafter referred to as the âBeneficiariesâ) and the persons being able to activate the data inheritance process (hereinafter referred to as the âPersons Authorized to Perform the Activationâ or âTrusteesâ).
This information is not mandatory.
The customer does not have to designate any Trustees or Beneficiaries.
The data stored in the Team Space of the product âSecureSafe for Teamsâ may not be transferred via data inheritance to Beneficiaries.

Following the allocation of the data, the customer receives the activation code, which he may pass on to one or more Trustees.
This is a code that, when entered on DSwiss' website, initiates the process enabling the Beneficiaries to access the data.
The customer may change the activation code at any time, thereby canceling the previous activation code.

The customer instructs his Trustees that, in the circumstances specified by the customer, they are to enter the activation code on the DSwiss website and thereby initiate the data inheritance process.
The customer shall be exclusively responsible for the Trustees following his instructions.

First, entering the activation code triggers the sending of an automatic notification to the customer, following which the data inheritance will be executed unless the customer intervenes to halt the process.
At the same time, the Trustee receives a message that the customer has been notified and has been given the opportunity to halt the process, and that the data inheritance process will continue unless halted by the customer within a safety delay specified by the customer.

If the activation code has been entered but the customer intervenes and halts the process, the activation code is rendered invalid.
The customer must arrange for a new activation code to be issued in accordance with the provisions stipulated above.

If the data inheritance process is not interrupted within the safety delay, the data allocated by the customer are made accessible to the Beneficiaries designated by the customer.
This takes place by means of an automated procedure whereby the Beneficiaries are given the access code (User Name and Password) for their data area.
The customer has already chosen the various methods of contacting him (email, SMS) at the time of registration when submitting his offer.

The customer shall be exclusively responsible for the contact information regarding the Beneficiaries and Trustees being up to date and accurate.
DSwiss is in no event obligated to scrutinize this information itself.

The Beneficiaries are informed that they will have the option, exercisable within a period of 90 days, to download the data allocated to them or to conclude a contract with DSwiss regarding an account of their own.

The customer is obligated to ensure that he can provide data access to the Beneficiaries without violating third party rights or applicable statutory provisions.

The customer is responsible for ensuring that, in the event of his death, the allocation to the Beneficiaries of the data uploaded by the customer meets the relevant formal requirements under inheritance law.
In particular, the customer shall ensure that any bequest or appointment as heir by disposition will satisfy the applicable formal requirements under inheritance law.
Necessary documents (e.g.
wills) may be handed over to a Trustee.


5.4 Data Storage Period

Throughout the duration of the Contractual Relationship, DSwiss shall ensure that the customerâs uploaded data are securely archived.

On expiration or termination of the Contractual Relationship, DSwissâ safekeeping obligation shall also come to an end subject to Subsection 9.3 below.
In this case, DSwiss shall have the right to release the customerâs account and the relevant quota in the online data storage and to delete the data archived therein.

The safekeeping obligation of DSwiss will also come to an end on completion of the data inheritance relating to all data uploaded by the customer, at the end of the 90 day period communicated to the Beneficiary in Subsection 5.3 above, regardless of whether the Beneficiaries have downloaded the data, have concluded their own contract with DSwiss, or have not obtained access within the time allowed.


5.5 Additional Services provided by DSwiss

For all intents and purposes, DSwissâ products and the services to be performed by DSwiss under this Contractual Relationship as well as all rights and obligations of the customer pertaining thereto are described on DSwissâ website.
These descriptions form an integral part of this Contractual Relationship.


6.
Customerâs Usage Fee

Depending on the type of subscription, DSwissâ services are either subject to a charge (hereinafter referred to as âPaid Subscription Typesâ) or free of charge (hereinafter referred to as âFree Subscription Typeâ).
Any usage fee becomes due for the contractual period chosen by the customer and is payable in advance.
The amount of the usage fee depends on the scope of performance granted to the customer (e.g.
quota).
The customer is informed of the usage fee upon submitting his offer and choosing his quota.

The amount of the usage fee and the payment terms for Paid Subscription Types are published on DSwissâ website.
The prices and payment terms published on DSwiss' website at the time of entering into or renewing the Contractual Relationship shall be the applicable prices and terms.
The related information published on the website of DSwiss forms an integral part of this Contractual Relationship.

Any contract renewal of Paid Subscription Types requires the prior payment of the applicable usage fee for the chosen scope of performance.
In the event of late payment of such fee, the Contractual Relationship shall terminate automatically.

The usage fee shall be due and payable upon receipt of the acceptance in the customerâs account according to Section 3 above, and must be paid by the customer immediately unless explicitly agreed otherwise between the parties hereto.
The customer shall be in default without any further reminder from DSwiss.
Default interest shall be 5% p.a.

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in these T&C, DSwiss shall not provide any services to the customer for Paid Subscription Types unless the usage fee has been paid in full.


7.
Customerâs Responsibility and Liability

DSwiss is unable to inspect the content of the data stored by the customer.
Consequently, it cannot check the content transmitted by the customer for its legality.

The customer alone is responsible for his uploaded data.
DSwiss accepts no liability whatsoever for the content of the customerâs uploaded data.

The customer undertakes to comply with Swiss law and the law of his country of residence in connection with the use of the services provided by DSwiss.
The customer undertakes in particular that he will only upload data for which he has the necessary rights and which do not violate Swiss law, the applicable laws of any other jurisdiction, or any rights (including, but not limited to, the right to privacy) of third parties or DSwiss.
The customer further agrees that he will never upload credit card data, illegal or pornographic content, or content that glorifies violence.

The customer also agrees to ensure that his data do not contain any malware that harm or might harm DSwiss or other customers or third parties.

Should the customer violate any of the provisions above and DSwiss be held liable therefor, DSwiss shall be free to take any legal action deemed necessary.
The customer hereby agrees and undertakes that he will fully indemnify and hold DSwiss harmless against any liability for loss or damage, claims, demands, costs and reasonable legal fees (including, but not limited to, third party claims) arising in connection with the data uploaded by the customer, or suffered by DSwiss due to the customerâs violation of the provisions of these T&C.

If the customer has paid for a SecureSafe for Teams, he is subject â in his capacity as the administrator (hereinafter âAdministratorâ) of the SecureSafe for Teams â to special liability in accordance with the provisions of these T&C.
He shall be entitled to transfer his duty as the Administrator at any time to another customer of DSwiss who has access to the corresponding SecureSafe for Teams (hereinafter âFuture Administratorâ) if the transfer process described on the DSwissâ website can be completed successfully.
The same shall apply to any other transfer to Future Administrators.
However, each former Administrator continues to be responsible in any event for the content and the activities of SecureSafe for Teams concerning the period during which he was the Administrator.


8.
Warranty and Liability of DSwiss

DSwiss places high demands on itself when it comes to fulfilling the most stringent security requirements.
Nonetheless, any and all warranty claims of the customer shall be excluded hereby unless explicitly agreed upon otherwise in these T&C.
DSwiss is, in particular, not in a position to guarantee that the Internet Data Safe services will be retrievable at all times free of faults or that a certain level of availability is present.
Moreover, DSwiss, in particular, does not guarantee that it will be possible in future for all data types to be reproduced on the hardware and software then available.

DSwissâ liability arising from and in connection with the Contractual Relationship is excluded to the extent legally permitted.

The customer alone shall bear the risk of unauthorized third parties gaining access to the data stored by him either in the context of data inheritance or in another context.

The customer shall bear the risk resulting from any changes in the law.
This shall apply in particular if anonymous and encrypted data may no longer be stored on the Internet as a result of a changed legal position and DSwiss is obligated to delete all anonymously stored data because of an official order.

DSwiss has no access to and no knowledge of the customerâs passwords and will not be able to reset or restore them.
The customer acknowledges and agrees that his data may irretrievably be lost if he forgets the password (cf.
also Subsection 5.2 above).
The customer acknowledges and agrees that DSwiss has no possibility to consult the SecureSafe for Teams.
Therefore, the only persons responsible for the content and the activities of the SecureSafe for Teams are the persons having uploaded the content (hereinafter âResponsible Customerâ) as well as the Administrator of the relevant SecureSafe for Teams.
In the event of violations of these T&C or the applicable law by the Responsible Customer the Administrator of the SecureSafe for Teams must provide for the immediate elimination of the violation of the law.
The Responsible Customer as well as the Administrator of the SecureSafe for Teams are jointly and severally liable to DSwiss and shall fully indemnify and hold DSwiss harmless from any loss or damage, cause of action, claims, costs and reasonable legal expense related to the data uploaded by the Responsible Customer or suffered by DSwiss because the Responsible Customer or the Administrator of the SecureSafe for Teams have violated these T&C or applicable law.

The customer acknowledges and agrees that when using the SecureSafe for Teams he may be exposed to contents that he considers humiliating, offensive or otherwise unpleasant.
The customer waives any claim based on the content of the data stored or distributed through the use of the services.
