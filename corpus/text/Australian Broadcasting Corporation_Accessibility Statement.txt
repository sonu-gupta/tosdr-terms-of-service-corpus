People with limited hearing often need captions to understand dialogue and important sounds in video and audio.
Captions are mostly prepared in advance for accuracy.
However sometimes publishing information fast is considered more important than absolute accuracy, such as breaking news.

Limitations of this siteâs accessibility
While weâve done a lot to ensure this site is accessible, you may find some limitations.

We always aim to communicate clearly and simply.
This is not always possible when discussing technical subjects.
Many ABC stories have rich media like audio and video that havenât all been captioned, transcribed or audio described yet.
some of ABCâs web content has not yet been fully tested by people with diverse abilities.
