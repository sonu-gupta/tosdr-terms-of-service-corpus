provided, however, (a) Sponsor shall be entitled to seek injunctive or equitable relief in the state and federal courts in or closest toTampa, Florida and any other court with jurisdiction over the Parties.
In arbitration, there is no judge or jury, and review is limited.
The arbitratorâs decision and award are final and binding, with limited exceptions, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction.
The Parties agree that, except as set forth above, any claim, suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Premier Draw Of The Week shall be resolved solely by binding arbitration before a sole arbitrator in an arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ) or any other mutually agreeable arbitration administration service.

The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA, and, where appropriate, the AAAâs Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the AAA website: www.adr.org, unless otherwise mutually agreed between the parties.
If an in-person hearing is required, except as otherwise required by applicable AAA rules or applicable law, then it will take place inTampa, Florida.
The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party.
The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.
The federal or state law that applies to these Official Rules will also apply during the arbitration.
Disputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be consolidated with any other proceedings that involve any claims or controversy of another party, including any class actions.

In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Premier Draw Of The Week be commenced more than one (1) year after the cause of action arose.
If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
The arbitrator is empowered to resolve the Dispute with the same remedies available in court, however, any relief must be individualized to you and shall not affect any other individual.
You and each Party also agree that each Party may bring claims against the other in arbitration only in their respective individual capacities and in so doing YOU WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY, to assert or participate in a class action lawsuit or class action arbitration, to assert or participate in a private attorney general lawsuit or private attorney general arbitration, and to assert or participate in any joint or consolidated lawsuit or joint or consolidated arbitration of any kind.
If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraphâs limitations as to a particular cause of action, then that cause of action (and only that cause of action) must remain in court and be severed from any arbitration.
MISCELLANEOUS: The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of these Official Rules will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision.
In the event that any provision of the Official Rules is determined to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable or illegal, the other provisions will remain in effect and will be construed in accordance with their terms as if the invalid or illegal provision were not contained herein.
Sponsorâs failure to enforce any term of these Official Rules or any other guidelines, instructions, policies, or term will not constitute a waiver of that provision.
Entrant agrees to waive any rights to claim ambiguity of these Official Rules.
Headings are solely for convenience of reference and will not be deemed to affect in any manner the meaning or intent of the documents or any provision hereof.
In the event there is a discrepancy or inconsistency between disclosures or other statements contained in any Premier Draw Of The Week-related materials, Sponsorâs Privacy Policy or Terms of Use on any website, social media platform or application and/or the terms and conditions of the Official Rules, the Official Rules shall prevail, govern and control and the discrepancy will be resolved in Sponsorâs sole and absolute discretion.
