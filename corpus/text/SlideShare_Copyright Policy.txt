Scribd removes content upon receipt of a valid DMCA notification.
Scribd notifies the uploading member at the email address on file immediately upon the contentâs removal.
Scribd members can appeal a DMCA notification through a process called counter-notification.
If you believe that a DMCA notification sent to Scribd was in error, you must send Scribd a communication that contains the following:

Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled.
A statement under penalty of perjury that the subscriber has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.
