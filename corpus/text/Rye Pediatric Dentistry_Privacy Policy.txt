         Appointment Policy
Your appointment is reserved specifically for your child.
Changes may affect many other patients.
If a change or cancellation is unavoidable and conflicts arise, please call us at the office at least 48 business hours (2 days) in advance so that we may offer that time to another patient who is in need of care.
As a courtesy to you and your child, we contact you via phone, email, and/or text to confirm your childâs appointment.
Please let the front staff know your preference, and we will make the appropriate arrangements.
We usually email one week before appointments, and call the day before to confirm your scheduled appointment.
We make every possible attempt to see all patients at their scheduled appointment time.
In rare instances, our schedule may be adjusted in order to accommodate an injured child or an emergency situation.
Please accept our deepest apology in advance should this occur during your appointment.
We will provide your child with the same courtesy should the unfortunate need for emergency treatment arise.
Please plan to arrive 5 minutes or more before your scheduled appointment.
This will allow time for the completion of any additional paperwork so that your childâs visit remains on time.
A parent or legal guardian should be present during the first visit in order to sign all legal documents and consent to treatment.
With these appropriate forms, grandparents, au pairs, and caretakers are permitted to accompany children for subsequent appointments.
It would be our pleasure to meet your extended family so that we may provide home care instructions to all of your childâs caretakers.
