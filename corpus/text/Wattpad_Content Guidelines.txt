Content GuidelinesLast Revised: November 15th, 2019At Wattpad, we set stories free with the goal of creating a safe and comfortable space for everyone to discover and create.
In order to create an inclusive and respectful space, we want to ensure our Wattpadders know what type of content they will discover as well as content they can or cannot post!
Before you take off on your writing journey, please take a peek at the following guidelines:


Itâs important to respect and protect fellow Wattpadderâs feelings, property, and personal information.


You shouldnât post anything you might regret in the future, or that your peers, family, or teachers might not want to see online.


You should read our Content Guidelines, Code of Conduct, Terms of Service, and our Privacy Policy so you have all the information you need to enjoy Wattpad and help others enjoy it too!


If you come across any content that violates our guidelines, let us know by reporting it.
See here for how to do that.

Here is a list of global helplines, because itâs important to reach out if you are feeling blue: Counseling and Prevention Resources
Keep in mind that reading about self-harm and suicide can be upsetting or triggering.
Thatâs why we want to remind you that:



Content that encourages or gives instruction on self-harm will be removed.





Content that contains lots of description might be rated Mature, and stories that glorify or do not âtell a storyâ might be removed.
âTelling a storyâ means the work must have a plot unrelated to the self-harm scene/s, or must show a progression or growth in its characters.



We want to encourage healthy discussions about these issues, so content about recovery, survival or that portray the negative consequences of self-harm are acceptable on Wattpad.

We will remove any content or accounts that are intended to shock or disgust our community.Back to topBack to topHate Groups/Extremist ContentAt Wattpad, we are committed to keeping our community safe.
