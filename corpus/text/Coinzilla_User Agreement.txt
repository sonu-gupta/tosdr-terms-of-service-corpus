Coinzilla Marketplace - Advertisers

All the articles purchased through Coinzilla Marketplace are guaranteed to remain live on the publisherâs website for an indefinite period.
However, the publisher will be allowed to remove the article if:



The advertiserâs project was proven to be a scam.


The advertiserâs project is no longer active.


The advertiser changed his domain of activity and the content is no longer reflecting the current activity of the advertiser.



If any of the aforementioned conditions are met and the publisher deletes the sponsored content, Coinzilla is in no way responsible and a refund will not be possible.


If the sponsored content was deleted by the publisher without a valid reason, the advertiser will receive a full refund for that article.


Coinzilla Marketplace - Publishers

If a publisher deletes a sponsored article delivered to his website through the Coinzilla Marketplace service, he is required to notify Coinzilla in regards to the deletion as well as the reason behind the decision.


If the publisher does not provide a valid reason for deleting the article, he will be required to fully refund the cost of the said article to Coinzilla.
Valid reasons for article deletion include:



The advertiserâs project was proven to be a scam.


The advertiserâs project is no longer active.


The advertiser changed his domain of activity and the content is no longer reflecting the current activity of the advertiser.



If the publisher does not refund the cost of the article he deleted, his Coinzilla Marketplace account will be locked, and the restrictions may extend to his Coinzilla Display account as well.


Data Reporting (Stats)

All campaigns on Coinzilla are served, tracked, and reported by Coinzilla.
For campaigns that involve third-party serving/tracking, accounting may be beyond Coinzilla's control.


The data generated by a campaign will only be available for 1 year.
After that, the data will be automatically deleted from your account.
The user is solely responsible of downloading and saving that data, if he wishes to do so.


Withdrawals


In order to withdraw funds from your account, your profile needs to be fully completed with your real personal information (first and last name, email address, country of residence, and full address).


If your account is a company account, your company details need to be completed as well.


If you request a withdrawal without having completed this information, our team will contact you in order to complete your profile.
If you refuse to provide the necessary details, your withdrawal request will be denied.


Withdrawing your Coinzilla funds to an address that does not support the selected currency will result in a permanent loss of your funds.
Coinzilla is in no way, shape, or form responsible for such actions.


You can submit a withdrawal request only once every 72 hours.


A withdrawal request is generally processed in 1-2 business days, but it may take up to a week depending on the network's working conditions.
