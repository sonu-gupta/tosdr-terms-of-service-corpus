GoGuardian Products Terms of Service and End User License Agreement 
Last Updated Date: August 7, 2020 Introduction Welcome to GoGuardian! Before using our GoGuardian Offerings, please take the time to review these combined Terms of Service and End User License Agreement (EULA) for GoGuardian offerings, together with any applicable GoGuardian Order Form(s), the Product Privacy Policy, and, if applicable GoGuardian GoGuardian's Data Processing Addendum (collectively, the âAgreementâ).
Capitalized words have the definitions set forth throughout this Agreement, including in Section 15 (Definitions).

When does this Agreement apply? This Agreement governs the use of GoGuardian offerings and is a binding contract between School (sometimes referred to as "School,â you,â or âyourâ) and Liminex, Inc.
doing business as GoGuardian ("GoGuardian, âwe,â "us",or âourâ).
This Agreement is distinct from our Website Terms of Service, which governs only use of our Website.
BY CLICKING AN "I AGREE" OR "I ACCEPT" BUTTON.
EXECUTING AN ORDER FORM THAT REFERENCES THIS AGREEMENT.
COMPLETING THE REGISTRATION PROCESS.
OR INSTALLING OR USING GOGUARDIAN OFFERINGS IN ANY WAY, SCHOOL AGREES TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT.
IF THE INDIVIDUAL ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT IS ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF A SCHOOL, SCHOOL DISTRICT, CORPORATION, ORGANIZATION OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, SUCH INDIVIDUAL REPRESENTS AND WARRANTS THAT THEY ARE AT LEAST EIGHTEEN (18) YEARS OLD AND HAVE THE AUTHORITY, THE RIGHT, AND THE CAPACITY TO LEGALLY BIND SUCH SCHOOL, SCHOOL DISTRICT, CORPORATION, ORGANIZATION OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY AND ITS AFFILIATES TO THIS AGREEMENT, IN WHICH CASE THE TERM âSCHOOLâ SHALL REFER TO EACH SUCH ENTITY AND ITS AFFILIATES.

You are free to reject this Agreement, but if you do not agree with all of the provisions of this Agreement, then you may not use our GoGuardian Offerings in any way.

IMPORTANT NOTICES: 


Section 13.2 contains provisions governing how claims are resolved between us, including a requirement for binding arbitration and class action waiver.
You understand that use of the GoGuardian Offerings may require the consent for monitoring and recording information and communications of all users on the Managed Devices or Accounts under Applicable Law.
You represent and warrant that you have obtained such requisite consent.
GoGuardian may make non-material modifications to this Agreement or changes that expand our obligations, reduce your obligations, or introduce a new product offering immediately without notice to you.
Otherwise, we will only modify or replace this Agreement, after providing notice to you in accordance with Section 14.1.
You are responsible for regularly reviewing your GoGuardian Account and our Website for any changes to the Agreement.
Your use of, and participation in, certain GoGuardian Offerings may be subject to additional terms (âSupplemental Termsâ) and such Supplemental Terms will either be listed in this Agreement, an Order Form or will be presented to you for your acceptance when you sign up to use the supplemental GoGuardian Offerings.
If this Agreement is inconsistent with the Supplemental Terms, the Supplemental Terms will control with respect to the GoGuardian Offerings with which it applies.

i.
We have included, in italics at the beginning of each section, summaries that provide short explanations of the legal language in plain English to aid in understanding, but such summaries are not legally binding.

1.
GETTING ACCESS AND GETTING STARTED WITH GOGUARDIAN OFFERINGS 
i.
This Section explains establishing and maintaining a GoGuardian Account, including orders for GoGuardian Offerings.
This Section also reminds you of the importance of being mindful about the information and settings in your GoGuardian Account â the value of our tools is dependent on the accuracy of the information you provide and the proper selection of product settings.

GoGuardian makes our Offerings available on a paid subscription-based license.
As further described in Section 4.1, from time to time and in its sole discretion, GoGuardian may offer limited free, trial or beta GoGuardian Offerings at no additional charge.
1.1 Ordering
You may purchase Subscriptions to our Offerings either directly from GoGuardian or indirectly through one of GoGuardianâs Authorized Resellers.
If you purchase a Subscription to a GoGuardian Offering through an Authorized Reseller, you will enter into an Order Form directly with such Authorized Reseller and may be subject to additional terms as agreed upon between you and the Authorized Reseller.
You expressly agree that this Agreement governs your access to and use of any GoGuardian Offering that you acquire from an Authorized Reseller, as well your relationship with GoGuardian as to any products or services you purchase through an Authorized Reseller, and that GoGuardian has the right to enforce the terms of this Agreement with respect to such purchases.
You also acknowledge that no Authorized Reseller is authorized to provide warranties with respect to any GoGuardian Offerings in excess of those provided by GoGuardian in this Agreement.
The terms regarding any value-added services provided to you by an Authorized Reseller are solely between you and the Authorized Reseller and we have no responsibility for any such services.
If during the Subscription Term, you would like to expand your base Subscription(s) to include additional licenses above your Licensed Capacity, please contact GoGuardian so that we can send you an additional Order Form for those Add-Ons.
If we do not hear from you and you deploy additional Licenses, we or, as applicable, an Authorized Reseller will send you an Order Form and invoice you for the subscriptions to the Add-Ons that you use above your Licensed Capacity.
Add-Ons, once deployed and paid, will be rolled into your base Subscription.

1.2 GoGuardian Accounts and School Account Information 
Before accessing certain GoGuardian Offerings, you may be required to create a GoGuardian Account.
When setting up your GoGuardian Account, you may link your GoGuardian Offering with your Google and/or Microsoft Active Directory account for ease of sign on and to pull in a directory of Managed Accounts or Devices.
In linking to your Google and/or Microsoft account, you are granting GoGuardian access to certain account information from your Google and/or Microsoft account, as permitted under the applicable terms and conditions that govern your use of that Google or Microsoft Active Directory account.
1.2.1 Authorized Users 

Within the GoGuardian Account, you will have the ability to enable separate accounts for Authorized Users.
You are responsible for issuing and maintaining such accounts only for appropriate Authorized Users, as well as issuing and maintaining appropriate permission settings for each Authorized User.
1.2.2 School Information 

In creating a GoGuardian Account, you agree to (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information necessary to create a GoGuardian Account and deploy the purchased GoGuardian Offerings on Managed Devices or Accounts, including accurate, up-to-date and complete School Profile Information, Authorized School Personnel Information, Personal Student Information, Parent/Guardian Information, and Association Information.
and (b) promptly update any such information to maintain its accuracy and completeness.
Because proper implementation and operation of the GoGuardian Offerings is dependent on the accuracy, completeness and timeliness of the Personal Student Information, Parent/GoGuardian Information and Association Information, it is of the utmost importance that your School take great care in maintaining and updating this Personal Student Information, Parent/Guardian Information and Association Information at all times during the Term.
You are responsible for ensuring the confidentiality and security of School Account Information, including protecting, and requiring Authorized Users to protect, usernames and passwords associated with GoGuardian Account, and notifying GoGuardian immediately if you suspect or know that (1) a username and password is known by someone other than the applicable Authorized User.
and/or (2) your GoGuardian Account (including any individual Authorized User account) has been compromised.
1.2.3 Account Settings 

You are responsible for selecting and updating the settings in the GoGuardian Offerings as you see fit and ensuring that the selections comply with all Applicable Law, as well as any guidelines and requirements you have established for monitoring Managed Devices or Accounts and parentsâ or guardiansâ authorization of such monitoring.
If you have questions about any settings in a GoGuardian Offering or GoGuardian Account, such as permissions and settings associated with Managed Devices or Accounts, please visit GoGuardianâs Help Center and/or contact support@goguardian.com.
1.3 Payment Terms
Fees due for initial orders, any Add-Ons, and any renewals of GoGuardian Offerings shall be set forth in the applicable Order Form (âFeesâ).
Fees for purchases made directly from GoGuardian shall be paid within thirty (30) days of the date of GoGuardianâs issuance of an invoice for such purchases, unless otherwise stated on an Order Form.
Payment obligations for purchases made through an Authorized Reseller shall be as agreed upon by you and the Authorized Reseller.
Fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction.
you are responsible for paying all such taxes, levies, duties and assessments associated with purchases and transactions under this Agreement.
Unless otherwise stated on an Order Form, Fees are paid in advance of each billing period.
Payment obligations under this Agreement are non-cancelable and all Fees paid are non-refundable.
Upon your cancellation or termination of any Subscription, you remain responsible for payment of all Fees allocable to the terminated portion of the Subscription Term referenced in the applicable Order Form without any refund owed to you, unless otherwise mutually agreed to in writing between you and GoGuardian.
Upon notice to you, GoGuardian may increase any Fees specified in an Order Form, provided the increase will not become effective until the expiration of the current Subscription Term.
GoGuardian may increase any Fees that are not specified in an Order Form between you and GoGuardian at any time, with or without notice to you.
GoGuardian may allow you to continue using a free, trial or beta GoGuardian Offering on a paid Subscription basis, but your continued use and your Subscription would be subject to a completed Order Form and payment of the applicable Fee.

GOGUARDIAN OFFERINGS
i.
This Section explains more about the GoGuardian Offerings to which you have subscribed, including updates and linkage with other third party integration software that GoGuardian makes available to you.
GoGuardian Offerings may experience downtime or suspend access in certain situations.

2.1 Access and Updates to GoGuardian Offerings.
GoGuardian will make our Offerings to which you have subscribed available to you, subject to the terms of this Agreement.
From time to time, GoGuardian may also make updates to its Offerings to you, including to improve its GoGuardian Offerings.
You agree that GoGuardian may automatically install updates, upgrades, and additional features to the GoGuardian Offerings that we deem to be reasonable, beneficial to you, and/or reasonably necessary.
You acknowledge and agree that any obligation GoGuardian may have to support previous version(s) of a GoGuardian Offering may end when an update, upgrade, and/or additional feature is made available for the GoGuardian Offering.
The license granted for a Subscription shall apply to any updates, upgrades, and/or additional features that are not distributed with a separate license or other agreement.
If we make any material changes to a GoGuardian Offering, we will notify you within the GoGuardian Offering interface or by sending you an email.
With respect to a GoGuardian Offering accessed through or downloaded from the Apple App Store (an âApp Store Sourced Applicationâ), you agree to only use the App Store Sourced Application (a) on an Apple-branded product that runs the iOS (Appleâs proprietary operating system) and (b) as permitted by the âUsage Rulesâ set forth in the Apple App Store Terms of Service.
In addition, you acknowledge and agree that the availability of the App Store Sourced Application is dependent on the Apple App Store.
2.2 Downtime and Suspension of GoGuardian Offerings.
You acknowledge that you may experience downtime (a) as a result of GoGuardian conducting maintenance.
or (b) in connection with a force majeure event (as described in Section 14.5).
In addition, you acknowledge that GoGuardian, may at its discretion, suspend your access to the GoGuardian Offerings for your breach of this Agreement, if GoGuardian has reasonable grounds to suspect that any School Account Information provided by you or any Authorized User is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or if GoGuardian deems it reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate harm to GoGuardian, you, any other of GoGuardianâs customers or a third party if the offerings were not suspended, or to comply, in our sole discretion, with legal requirements.
2.3 Integrations with GoGuardian Offerings.

GoGuardian may allow you to access certain third party software or offerings through your GoGuardian Account via an application programming interface (âAPIâ) or other technical connection (such software or offering, an âIntegration Offeringâ).
Because you control whether to integrate and use an Integration Offering, you are solely responsible for all interactions with the Integration Offering, including ensuring appropriate privacy, contractual, and other protections with it as well as ensuring that you are complying with any terms you are required to agree with the provider of such Integration Offering.
Integration Offerings are not âGoGuardian Offeringsâ under this Agreement and are not subject to any of the warranties, service commitments or other obligations with respect to GoGuardian Offerings hereunder.
The availability of any Integration Offering through GoGuardian Offerings does not imply GoGuardianâs endorsement of or affiliation with the provider of such Integration Offering.
GoGuardian does not control Integration Offerings and will have no liability to you in connection with any Integration Offering.
GoGuardian has no obligation to monitor or maintain access to Integration Offerings, and may disable the ability to integrate with them or restrict access to any Integration Offerings at any time, with or without notice to you (though we, of course, will endeavor to provide notice of any such disabling whenever reasonably practicable under the circumstances).
By using or enabling any Integration Offering, you are expressly permitting GoGuardian to disclose School Profile Information, Authorized School Personnel Information, Personal Student Information, Parent/Guardian Information, Association Information or other information, including support requests and School Log and Cookie Information to the extent necessary to utilize the Integration Offering.
YOUR USE OF INTEGRATION OFFERINGS IS AT YOUR OWN RISK AND IS SUBJECT TO ANY ADDITIONAL TERMS, CONDITIONS AND POLICIES APPLICABLE TO SUCH INTEGRATION OFFERINGS (SUCH AS TERMS OF SERVICE OR PRIVACY POLICIES OF THE PROVIDERS OF SUCH INTEGRATION OFFERINGS).
3.
YOUR USE OF GOGUARDIAN OFFERINGS AND YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES 
i.
This Section explains that GoGuardian licenses our Offerings to you for certain uses.
Please use our Offerings responsibly and appropriately.

3.1 License Grant to You.
Restrictions 
GoGuardian hereby grants to School a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license and right to use the specific GoGuardian Offering(s) set forth in an Order Form and the related User Documentation, during the Subscription Term and solely for Schoolâs internal business purposes.
The rights granted to School in this Agreement are subject to the following restrictions: School shall not (a) license, sell, rent, lease, transfer, reproduce, distribute, host or otherwise commercially exploit any portion of any GoGuardian Offering or User Documentation, or otherwise provide access to any portion of any GoGuardian Offering or User Documentation to any third party (other than Authorized Users as permitted herein).
(b) frame or utilize framing techniques to enclose any trademark, logo, or other portion of the GoGuardian Offering (including images, text, page layout or form).
(c) use any metatags or other âhidden textâ using GoGuardianâs name or trademarks.
(d) modify, translate, adapt, merge, make derivative works of, disassemble, decompile, reverse compile or reverse engineer any part of any GoGuardian Offering or User Documentation.
(e) use any manual or automated software, devices or other processes (including but not limited to spiders, robots, scrapers, crawlers, avatars, data mining tools or the like) to âscrapeâ or download data from any web pages contained in any GoGuardian Offering or User Documentation.
(f) access any GoGuardian Offering or User Documentation in order to build a similar or competitive website, product or service.
(g) access any GoGuardian Offering for purposes of monitoring its availability, performance or functionality, or for any other benchmarking or competitive purposes without GoGuardianâs prior written permission.
and (h) remove any copyright notices or other proprietary markings contained on or in any GoGuardian Offering or User Documentation.
Any future release, update or other addition to any GoGuardian Offering shall be subject to this Agreement.
GoGuardian and its suppliers reserve all rights not granted in this Agreement.
Any unauthorized use of a GoGuardian Offering terminates Schoolâs right to use all GoGuardian Offerings.
3.2 School Responsibilities 
School will (a) be responsible for Authorized Usersâ compliance with this Agreement (including any applicable Order Form) and the User Documentation, (b) be responsible for the accuracy, quality and legality of School Account Information, and the means by which School acquires School Account Information, Activity Information, Personal Student Information, Guardian/Parent Information, and School Log and Cookie Information and Schoolâs use of any such information, (c) use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized access to or use of GoGuardian Offerings, and notify GoGuardian promptly of any such unauthorized access or use, (d) use the GoGuardian Offerings only in accordance with this Agreement, User Documentation, and all Applicable Law, and (e) comply with the terms of service of any Integration Offering with which School uses a GoGuardian Offering.
Any use of a GoGuardian Offering in breach of the foregoing by School or any Authorized User that in GoGuardianâs judgment threatens the security, integrity or availability of a GoGuardian Offering may result in immediate suspension of access to any or all GoGuardian Offerings.
School acknowledges that it is solely responsible for compliance with any legal or policy obligations related to the protection of the well-being of its students and that it understands that certain GoGuardian Offerings are only intended to be a tool to assist School as part of a broader program intended to fulfill any legal or policy applications, to the extent applicable.
The GoGuardian Parties make no representation or warranty that any of the GoGuardian Offerings, alone or in combination with any other efforts, will be effective in detecting or stopping suicide, violence to self or others, or any other kind of risky behavior by a student of School or any other individual.
GoGuardian is not responsible for, and School expressly waives any claim for liability against GoGuardian related to, any student or other individualâs death, illness, bodily injury, disability, emotional distress or other outcome.
To the maximum extent permissible by law, such waiver shall extend to any School personnel, student, student family, estate or other third parties.
To the extent that GoGuardian is made a party to any dispute related to any such death, illness, bodily injury, disability, or other outcome, School shall indemnify GoGuardian in accordance with Section 11, below.
3.3 General Acceptable Use Policy 
We need your help to ensure that the GoGuardian Offerings are used safely and appropriately.
You agree, represent and warrant that you and your Authorized Users will not use the GoGuardian Offerings:

On any computers and/or accounts on which you do not have permission to operate and on which the GoGuardian Offerings cannot be legally and rightfully operated.
To do anything, including posting information that is abusive, harmful, threatening, harassing, libelous, bullying, stalking, or otherwise objectionable.
To do anything unlawful, deceptive, misleading, illegal, unethical, malicious, or discriminatory.
To intentionally violate another personâs privacy rights under Applicable Law.
For commercial purposes (beyond Schoolâs internal business purposes).
To do anything to burden, compromise, or interfere with any GoGuardian Offering, its appearances, security, or functionality.
In any way that jeopardizes the security of your or any other partyâs account.
To advertise, solicit, or transmit commercial advertisements, including without limitation, junk e-mail, spam, or any other unsolicited messages regardless of the medium (e.g., email, text, SMS, chat, etc.).

School is responsible for any failure by any Authorized User to comply with this General Acceptable Use Policy.

4.
SPECIAL TERMS FOR FREE, TRIAL AND BETA OFFERINGS
i.
This Section explains that we may make free, trial, or beta offerings available for you to test and provide GoGuardian with Feedback about whether a GoGuardian Offering meets your needs.
Because these offerings are different from paid Subscriptions, there are special terms for them.

4.1 Free or Trial Subscriptions 
If GoGuardian makes a GoGuardian Offering available to you on a free or trial basis, it is so you can use the GoGuardian Offering before purchasing a Subscription to determine if the offering meets your needs.
Trial subscriptions to a GoGuardian Offering shall be subject in all respects to the terms of this Agreement, except that to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, GoGuardian (a) may discontinue the GoGuardian Offering or your ability to use it at any time, with or without notice and without any further obligations to you.
(b) provides the GoGuardian Offering to you solely âAS ISâ without any warranties of any kind.
and (c) will have no liability for any harm or damages suffered by you or any third party in connection with the use or inability to use the GoGuardian Offering during the trial period.
4.2 Beta Offerings 
GoGuardian sometimes makes new GoGuardian Offerings or features within existing GoGuardian Offerings available on a beta basis (âbeta GoGuardian Offeringsâ).
Beta GoGuardian Offerings are generally prerelease or untested products or features.
Features or offerings labeled as âalpha,â âbeta,â or âtestâ within the interface of a GoGuardian Offering are beta GoGuardian Offerings subject to this Section.
Unless otherwise agreed in writing by School and GoGuardian, any GoGuardian Offering or feature provided as a beta GoGuardian Offering shall be subject in all respects to the terms of this Agreement, except that to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, GoGuardian (a) may discontinue the beta GoGuardian Offering or feature or your ability to use it at any time, with or without notice and without any further obligations to you (though we, of course, will endeavor to provide notice of any such disabling whenever reasonably practicable under the circumstances)..
(b) provides the beta GoGuardian Offering or feature to you solely âAS ISâ without any warranties of any kind.
and (c) will have no liability for any harm or damages suffered by you or any third party in connection with the use or inability to use the beta GoGuardian Offering or feature during the beta period.
Additionally, as consideration for access to and use of any beta GoGuardian Offering, you agree to (1) treat the beta GoGuardian Offering as GoGuardianâs Confidential Information.
and (2) provide regular Feedback about the beta GoGuardian Offering, if requested.
5.
TERM, TERMINATION
i.
This Section explains the duration of this Agreement as well as your and GoGuardianâs obligations after this Agreement ends.

5.1 Term 
Unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Term commences on the Effective Date and continues until all of your Order Forms and Subscription Terms expire.
5.2 Termination
Either party may terminate this Agreement (a) if the other party is in material breach of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after its receipt of notice thereof, or (b) upon thirty (30) daysâ notice to the other party.
School shall continue to be responsible for all Fees for the terminated Subscription Term and other Fees agreed to in the Order Form except to the extent School terminates this Agreement as a result of GoGuardianâs uncured material breach or GoGuardian terminates without cause (i.e., not as a result of Schoolâs uncured material breach), in which cases School shall not be obligated to pay for (and shall be entitled to a refund by GoGuardian of) the Fees allocable to the unused portion of the Subscription Term.
5.3 Effect of Termination or Expiration
Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, you will have no rights to continue use of (or to provide your Authorized Users with access to) the GoGuardian Offerings or User Documentation, and immediately will cease accessing and/or using the GoGuardian Offerings and User Documentation, including by, where applicable, erasing and/or uninstalling all downloaded or copied versions of any GoGuardian Offerings and User Documentation, and returning or destroying any accompanying User Documentation in your possession or control.
The following will survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement: Sections 1.2, 1.3 (for Fees incurred during the Term), 2.3, 3 (except as otherwise set forth therein), 5.2, 5.3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.
6.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
i.
This Section explains that we ask that you please protect our and othersâ intellectual property.

6.1 Ownership 
GoGuardian or its Affiliates (or their licensors) own all right, title and interest in and to the GoGuardian Offerings (including, but not limited to, all photographs, animations, statistics, graphics, text, and any other materials contained therein), the GoGuardian Information, including, without limitation, all intellectual property rights therein.
Subject to the limited rights expressly granted to you under this Agreement, GoGuardian and its Affiliates reserve all rights, title and interest in and to the GoGuardian Offerings and the GoGuardian Information, including, without limitation, all related intellectual property rights.
GoGuardianâs and its Affiliatesâ service marks, logos and product and service names (the âGoGuardian Marksâ) are owned by GoGuardian or its Affiliates.
You agree not to display or use any GoGuardian Marks in any manner without GoGuardianâs prior written permission.
Any trademarks, service marks and logos associated with an Integration Offering may be the property of the third party provider, and you should consult with their trademark guidelines before using any of their marks.
6.2 Feedback
Any and all of your feedback about GoGuardian or GoGuardian Offerings, such as suggestions made by School or any Authorized Users for corrections, updates, alterations, changes, or modifications to the GoGuardian Offerings (âFeedbackâ) will be the property of GoGuardian and you hereby assign any rights in such Feedback to GoGuardian, without payment to you.
6.3 Protection of GoGuardianâs Rights
You agree to protect the intellectual property and proprietary rights of GoGuardian and any provider of an Integration Offering you access in connection with a GoGuardian Account, and notify us of any unauthorized access or use of the GoGuardian Offerings or Integration Offerings of which you become aware.

Even if not required by Applicable Law, we recommend that you notify all users of Managed Devices or Accounts and their respective parents/guardians, teachers, and other appropriate School staff about your use of GoGuardian Offerings.
More specifically, we recommend that you provide such persons with a copy of GoGuardianâs Product Privacy Policy, GoGuardianâs COPPA Notice and Disclosure Form, and GoGuardianâs form Parental Letter, and any other parental information made available by GoGuardian.
8.3 Educational Records.
FERPA
Where School is located in the United States and to the extent we collect, through the provision or maintenance of GoGuardian Offerings, any information that constitutes an Education Record, the parties agree that GoGuardian is acting as a âschool officialâ with âlegitimate educational interestsâ in Schoolâs studentsâ Education Records under FERPA, or if applicable, is acting under another applicable FERPA exception listed in under FERPA regulation 34 C.F.R.
Â§ 99.31(a)(1), such as the âdirectory informationâ exception.
School acknowledges and agrees that GoGuardian may process School Account Information, Personal Student Information, Parent/Guardian Information, Activity Information and/or School Log and Cookie Information for the purpose of providing the GoGuardian Offerings and related functions.
GoGuardianâs Product Privacy Policy explains how GoGuardian cooperates with School under FERPA to fulfill Education Records requests directed from School (or through School from parents/guardians or eligible students).
School represents and warrants that it is authorized to process such information, including any Education Records contained therein, and make such information available to GoGuardian as set out in this Agreement and the Product Privacy Policy.

ALERTS AND NOTIFICATIONS
i.
This Section explains that some GoGuardian Offerings are designed to generate alerts and/or have other notification features, and that, through your settings, you have some ability to control whether to receive certain alerts and/or notifications .
It is important for you to understand these features and settings, and to review alerts and notifications carefully and promptly so that you can properly intervene to help students stay safe.

Some GoGuardian Offerings contain features that generate alerts and/or notifications for School or a designated Authorized Userâs review and attention related to a userâs activity through a Managed Device or Account.
These alerts and notifications are tools designed to help you support and protect the wellbeing of your students and school community.
If you receive an alert and/or gain access to any information that triggers a legal obligation, such as a reporting or intervention duty for you (including, for an example, an alert from a GoGuardian Offering that one of your students is potentially at risk of suicide), it is your sole responsibility to fulfill that legal obligation and take any additional, responsible actions necessary to safeguard the students in compliance with Applicable Law.
In addition, to the extent you elect not to receive one or more types of alerts and/or notifications in your settings, you are solely responsible for that decision.
GoGuardian does not review alerts generated through any of the GoGuardian Offerings or take any action based on these alerts.
or review your settings.
Your escalation and notification list for such alert and/or notification feature in your account for a particular GoGuardian Offering may change from time to time, including because contact information changes (e.g., changes in School Profile Information, Authorized School Personnel Information, Personal Student Information and Parent/Guardian Information (e.g., contact information, including an Authorized Userâs email address, or changes in Parent/Guardian Information ), and Association Information, including, for example, the relationship of an Authorized Personnel User or a guardian/parent to a child/student changes (e.g., change in guardianship or educational rights holder).
Without limiting the generality of Section 1.1.2, it is important that you maintain accurate and up-to-date Authorized School Personnel Information, Personal Student Information, Parent/Guardian Information, and Association Information to ensure the appropriateness and timeliness of any alerts and notifications generated through a GoGuardian Offering.
It is also important that you remind parents/guardians to update School of any changes, including contact information and guardianship.
Additionally, without limiting the generality of the other terms of this Agreement, if your School uses GoGuardian Beacon, your School represents and warrants that your School: (1) is solely responsible for having, to the extent legally required, an up-to-date and easily available suicide prevention policy.
(2) is solely responsible for having, to the extent legally required, a necessary suicide prevention program.
and (3) your School will notify parents/guardians about your Schoolâs adoption of GoGuardian Beacon and educate them about suicide prevention (including, suicide risk factors, warning signs, and resources) before enabling the Guardian Notification feature (or similar functionality) of GoGuardian Beacon.
10.

13.
GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION
13.1 Governing Law and Venue
This Agreement and any dispute arising from or relating to this Agreement are governed by the laws of the state of California, United States, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
You further agree to accept service of process by mail.
To the extent the parties are permitted under this Agreement to initiate litigation in court, the parties consent to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the courts located in Los Angeles County, California.
If School is a United States public and accredited educational institution, domiciled in a state within the United States that expressly requires a different choice of law other than California law, then Schoolâs stateâs law will apply.
If School is a United States public and accredited educational institution domiciled in a state within the United States that expressly requires venue or jurisdiction of a different state, then Schoolâs stateâs required venue and jurisdiction will apply.
13.2 Dispute Resolution.
Binding Arbitration.
Class Action Waiver (âArbitration Agreementâ)
 In the event of a dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any GoGuardian Offering, any personâs access to and/or use of a GoGuardian Offering, and/or the provision of content, features, and/or technology on or through a GoGuardian Offering (collectively, âClaimsâ), the parties must first give the other notice of the Claim.
This notice must include a brief written statement with the name, address, and contact information of the party giving it, as well as the facts giving rise to the Claim and the relief requested.
You must send any such notice to GoGuardian by email to terms@goguardian.com AND by U.S.
Mail to GoGuardian, 2030 E Maple Ave, El Segundo, CA 90245.
If we have your contact information, we will send any such notice to you by U.S.
Mail and your email address.
 The parties shall use reasonable, good faith efforts to resolve any Claim through consultation and good faith negotiations within thirty (30) days from the date that any notice of a Claim is sent.
After thirty (30) days, you or GoGuardian may resort to the other alternatives described in this Section 13.2.1.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the notice requirement in this section and the 30-day negotiation period required shall not apply to Claims involving patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, trade secrets or piracy or unauthorized use of a GoGuardian Offering.
13.2.1 Binding Arbitration


Arbitration Rules and Forum Except as otherwise specifically set forth below, any Claims between you and GoGuardian, if unresolved through informal consultation and negotiation pursuant to the preceding paragraph, shall be resolved by binding arbitration to be held in Los Angeles, California.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if School is a United States public and accredited educational institution domiciled in a state within the United States that expressly requires a different location for arbitration other than Los Angeles, California, then Schoolâs stateâs required location for binding arbitration will apply.
If School is a United States public and accredited educational institution and Schoolâs consent to binding arbitration is expressly prohibited by the laws of the state within the United States in which Schoolâs educational institution is domiciled, then this Section is hereby waived.
The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.
The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator, governed by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp.
Procedures (collectively, âJAMS Rulesâ), as modified by this Agreement, and administered by JAMS.
The JAMS Rules and fee information are available at www.jamsadr.org or by calling JAMS at 1-800-352-5267.
The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement, and (b) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.
The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and GoGuardian.
The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.

Exceptions: Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims Claims concerning patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, and Claims of piracy or unauthorized use of any GoGuardian Offering shall not be subject to arbitration under this Section 13.2.1.
In addition, you or GoGuardian may choose to pursue a Claim in small claims court where jurisdiction and venue over you and GoGuardian otherwise qualify for such small claims court and where the Claim does not include a request for any type of equitable relief.

Authority of Arbitrator In binding arbitration, the arbitrator shall have the authority (a) to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Claim.
(b) to award monetary damages.
and (c) to grant any non-monetary remedy or reli ef available to an individual under Applicable Law, the arbitral forumâs rules, and this Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement).
The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.
The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.
The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.

Confidentiality All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential.
Both parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law.
This paragraph shall not prevent you or GoGuardian from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.
13.2.2 Class Action Waiver

YOU AND GOGUARDIAN HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.
You and GoGuardian are instead electing that all Claims not otherwise resolved informally as permitted above shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement.
An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would.
