If we have collected your personal data, e.g., through a registration or a request for certain materials, we may associate this personal data with information gathered through the Tools.
This allows us to offer increased personalization and functionality on the Site.
Your web browser can be set to allow you to control whether you will accept cookies, reject cookies, or to notify you each time a cookie is sent to your browser.

The Help section of your browser may tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting cookies.

Certain information is collected by most browsers or automatically through your device, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, language and Internet browser type and version.
We use this information to ensure that the services function properly.

There are many ways to do this in the online advertising world.
For example, Pfizer partners with websites and applications with whom you have shared your interests, conditions and concerns directly and asks that they serve our ads to users who have expressed an interest in Pfizer products or health conditions that our products treat.
We may also partner with advertising companies that may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser (including through the use of pixel tags), or use other technologies, to serve you ads based on your web browsing activity, purchases, interests and/or other informationâa practice commonly referred to as interest-based advertising (âIBAâ) or online behavioral advertising (âOBAâ).
These advertising companies may also use these types of technologies to recognize you across the devices you use, such as a mobile phone or a laptop, and serve you ads on websites you visit and applications you use.
You can read more about IBA at a site offered by the advertising industryâs Digital Advertising Alliance (âDAAâ), aboutads.info(link is external).
We want it to be easy for you to understand how we and our business partners use information to serve ads tailored for you and to opt-out from targeting based on IBA.
To this end, we have licensed the DAA Advertising Options icon, , which appears in our ads served using IBA, and agreed to adhere to the DAA Self-Regulatory Program for IBA.
To learn how to opt-out of having the information collected from you used for IBA purposes on the particular device on which you are accessing this Privacy Policy, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp(link is external) and http://www.aboutads.info/choices/(link is external).
If you have any questions about our use of IBA or participation in the DAA Self-Regulatory Program, please do not hesitate to contact us at Privacy.Officer@pfizer.com(link sends email) .
At this time, we do not respond to browser do-not-track signals. SECURITY POLICIES We use technical, administrative and procedural measures in an attempt to safeguard your personal data from unauthorized access or use.
