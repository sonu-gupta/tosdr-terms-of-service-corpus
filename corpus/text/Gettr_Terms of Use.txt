Notice and Take Down Procedure for Claims of Infringement.


DMCA Notification. If you are a copyright owner who would like to send us a notice pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (âDMCAâ) to identify content or material posted on the Service that is infringing and that you would like removed from our Service, or if you are a user whose work has been removed in response to such a notice of infringement and would like to file a DMCA counter-notice, you may submit such notice to us by following the instructions in this Section 5.

DMCA Requirements. We are committed to complying with U.S.
copyright and related Intellectual Property laws.
Our policy is to respond to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the DMCA.
It is our policy to remove and discontinue service to repeat offenders.
If you believe your copyrighted work has been copied and is accessible on the Service in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, you may notify us by providing our copyright agent with the following information in accordance with the requirements of the DMCA:




The electronic or physical signature of the owner of the copyright or the person authorized to act on the ownerâs behalf.
A description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed and a description of the infringing activity.
Identification of the location where the original or an authorized copy of the copyrighted work exists (for example, the URL of the website where it is posted or the name of the book in which it has been published).
Identification of the URL or other specific location on the Service where the material you claim is infringing is located, providing enough information to allow us to locate the material.
Your name, address, telephone number, and email address so that we may contact you.
A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or are authorized to act on the copyright ownerâs behalf.

Our agent for notice of claims of copyright infringement on the Service can be reached as follows:
By mail: 750 Lexington Ave New York, NY 10022
By email: DMCArep@gettr.com
The email address above is only for reporting copyright infringement and may not be used for any other purpose.
If you believe an individual is a repeat infringer, please follow the instructions above to contact our DMCA agent and provide information sufficient for us to verify the individual is a repeat infringer.
It is often difficult to determine if your copyright has been infringed.
GETTR may elect to not respond to DMCA notices that do not substantially comply with all of the foregoing requirements, and GETTR may elect to remove allegedly infringing material that comes to its attention via notices that do not substantially comply with the DMCA.


DMCA Counter-Notification. If access on the Service to a work that you submitted to GETTR is disabled or the work is removed as a result of a DMCA copyright infringement notice, and you believe in good faith that the allegedly infringing works have been removed or blocked by mistake or misidentification, then you may send a âCounter-Notificationâ to the email address listed above.
Your DMCA Counter-Notification should contain the following information:


a legend or subject line that says: âDMCA Counter-Notificationâ;
a description of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled (please include the full URL of the page(s) on the Service from which the material was removed or access to it disabled);
a statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled;
your full name, address, telephone number, email address, and the username of your account with us (if any);
a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located (or, if the address is located outside the U.S.A., to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York), and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided DMCA notification to us or an agent of such person.
and
your electronic or physical signature.

Receipt of DMCA Counter-Notification. If we receive a DMCA Counter-Notification, then we may replace the material that we removed (or stop disabling access to it).
However, we will not do this if we first receive notice at the address above that the party who sent us the DMCA copyright infringement notice has filed a lawsuit asking a court for an order restraining the person who provided the material from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on the Service.
Upon our receipt of a Counter-Notification that satisfies the requirements of DMCA, we will provide a copy of the counter notification to the person who sent the original notification of claimed infringement and will follow the DMCA's procedures regarding counter notification.
All Counter-Notifications must satisfy the requirements of Section 512(g)(3) of the U.S.
Copyright Act.
In all events, you expressly agree that neither GETTR nor any of its affiliates or their employees, officers, directors, or agents will be a party to any disputes or lawsuits regarding alleged copyright infringement.
Please note you may be held liable for money damages if you materially misrepresent an activity is infringing your copyrights.

If the Dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after notification, the claimant may proceed to initiate proceedings as set forth in this Section 9.

Arbitration of Claims. Unless you give us notice of opt-out within five (5) business days of your first use of the Service, addressed to: 750 Lexington Ave New York, NY 10022, all actions or proceedings arising in connection with, touching upon or relating to any Dispute, or the scope of the provisions of this Section 9, shall be submitted to JAMS (www.jamsadr.com) for final and binding arbitration under its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures if the matter in dispute is over $250,000 or under its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures if the matter in dispute is $250,000 or less, to be held in New York, New York, before a single arbitrator.

The arbitrator shall issue a written opinion stating the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitratorâs award is based, and the prevailing party or parties shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneysâ fees and expenses in addition to any other available remedy.

provided further, however, that the losing party shall have fifteen (15) business days after the issuance of the arbitratorâs decision to fully comply with such decision, after which the prevailing party may enforce such decision by a petition to the Supreme Court, Civil Branch, New York County or, in the case of you, such other court having jurisdiction over you, which may be made ex parte, for confirmation and enforcement of the award.
To the extent there are any challenges to the arbitrability of a claim, the arbitrator shall determine any and all such challenges.

Notwithstanding the arbitration provision set forth above, if the provision regarding waiver of class, collective, representative, and private attorney general claims of this Section 9 is found to be void or otherwise unenforceable, any such class, collective, representative, or private attorney general claims must be heard and determined through an appropriate court proceeding, and not in arbitration.

Jury Waiver. AS PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO ALL CLAIMS AND ISSUES ARISING UNDER, IN CONNECTION WITH, TOUCHING UPON OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS, THE BREACH THEREOF AND/OR THE SCOPE OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION, WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT OR TORT, AND INCLUDING ANY CLAIM FOR FRAUDULENT INDUCEMENT THEREOF.
