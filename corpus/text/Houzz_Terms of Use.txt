If we are not able to resolve the dispute informally, then this section will govern any legal dispute that relates to the Houzz Platform or involves our services.


Binding Arbitration. You and Houzz agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or to your use of the Houzz Platform (collectively "Disputes") will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights.
This means that you and Houzz both agree to waive the right to a trial by jury. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may bring a claim against Houzz in "small claims" court, instead of by arbitration, but only if the claim is eligible under the rules of the small claims court and is brought in an individual, non-class, and non-representative basis, and only for so long as it remains in the small claims court and in an individual, non-class, and non-representative basis.

Class Action Waiver. You and Houzz agree that any proceedings to resolve Disputes will be conducted on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action.
This means that, in connection with any Dispute, you and Houzz both agree to waive the right to participate as a plaintiff as a class member in any class action proceeding.
Further, unless you and Houzz agree otherwise in writing, the arbitrator in any Dispute may not consolidate more than one person's claims and may not preside over any form of class action proceeding.


Arbitration Administration and Rules. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (if you use the Houzz Platform as a consumer) or Commercial Arbitration Rules (if you are a professional, vendor, seller or other business), as applicable and then in effect (the "AAA Rules"), except as modified by this "Dispute Resolutionâ section.
(The AAA Rules are available at http://www.adr.org).

The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA's roster of arbitrators with relevant experience.
If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within 7 days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with AAA Rules.

Arbitration Location and Procedure. The seat of the arbitration shall be in San Francisco, California, unless you and Houzz agree otherwise or the AAA Rules or AAA Consumer Due Process Protocol, as applicable, provide otherwise.
If your claim does not exceed USD$10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Houzz submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing and the arbitrator then determines that a hearing is necessary.
If your claim exceeds USD$10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by AAA Rules.
Subject to AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.
Hearings may be conducted by telephone or video conference, if requested and agreed to by the parties.

Arbitrator's Decision and Governing Law.
The arbitrator shall apply California law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized by law.
The arbitrator will render an award within the timeframe specified in the AAA Rules.
Judgment on the arbitration may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
Any award of damages by an arbitrator must be consistent with the "Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability" section above.
The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief in favor of the claimant only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim.

Fees. Each party's responsibility to pay the arbitration filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will depend on the circumstances of the arbitration and are set forth in the AAA Rules.

Opt-Out. You have the right to opt out of the arbitration provisions of Section 8 by sending a written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: 285 Hamilton Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94301 USA Attention: Houzz Legal Department.

You must include all of the following in the written notice: (1) your name and mailing address.
(2) the email address associated with your account.
and (3) a clear statement that you want to opt out of this Agreementâs arbitration agreement.

If you have a dispute with another user on the Houzz Platform or with any third party, you agree that Houzz is under no obligation to become involved.
In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you release Houzz, its directors, officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or the Houzz Platform.
