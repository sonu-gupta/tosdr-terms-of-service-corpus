how the data is handled (including possible pseudonymization) and how the data
is shared.
The Customer is responsible for ensuring the correct design and development
of their web service, either by a third-party developer or subcontractor or by
themselves.
If the website is a part of a larger information system, especially
one that handles sensitive information (such as medical records), the Customer
is responsible for the proper separation of the individual systems in order to
prevent a major leak in case of a security breach on the website. 3.
The Supplierâs responsibilities The Supplier does not monitor the data stored by the Customer, but the
information security practices are designed in a manner that the Customer can
store personal data in their web service.
The Supplier is responsible for developing their service in a manner that
allows for data and information security to actualize by default when the
service is used normally, and that the Customer has tools available which
support them in acting as the data controller and in providing their customers
with the required rights in the typical use of the Supplierâs service.
An
example of typical use is the inspection or removal of user data stored in the
database of a WordPress website. 4.
The rights of the data subjects The Supplier does not handle any third-party GDPR or data protection related
requests on behalf of the Customer.
The requests are forwarded to the Customer
as is, who must then verify their authenticity and take responsibility for the
requests as the data controller. 5.

breaches without unnecessary delay, and at the latest 24 hours after the
Supplier became aware of the breach.
The notification must include the

A description of the security breach, including the details of which groups of data subjects and personal data registries the breach affected, and the approximate number of the aforementioned;
Name and contact information for the liaison of the Supplierâs employee or team handling the investigation into the security breach;
A description of the consequences and/or likely consequences;

security breach.
The Customer is also required to assist in the investigation
of the security breach and to provide all the necessary information to the

The Supplier has the right to end an investigation into a security
breach if the Customer is not responding to contact attempts or if the benefit
of a continued investigation is clearly minor. 6.
Confidentiality The supplier is responsible for the contractual confidentiality of its staff.
The data stored in the service by the Customer is not read, accessed or handled
unless deemed necessary by the Supplier for the continued ability to keep
providing their services. 7.
Subcontractor access to potential personal data The Supplier is responsible to ensure that only their own staff and
management have legal access to the Customerâs information.
Subcontractors
are not granted access on a level that would enable them to gain entry to
possible personal data stored by the Customer in the service. 8.
Storing of data During the order process, the Customer has the option to choose the desired
location for their web service and the data it contains from the Supplierâs
provided list of locations available.
The Supplier does not move the service or
its data to another country without the Customerâs approval.

Auditing The Supplier will provide the Customer the necessary information for
conducting an audit when requested, and will assist in the audit to prove that
the Supplier is adhering to the decrees of this data protection appendix.
The Supplier does not have to provide the Customer with information that
have minor influence regarding data protection, or information that would
potentially harm the Supplierâs trade secrets or cause harm to another customer
or a third-party if it was disclosed.
If an audit reveals a Supplier related deficiency, the Supplier is required
to fix the deficiency without delay at their own expense. 10.
Costs related to data- and information protection If the data processor is required to assist the data controller in
fulfilling the GDPR legislation requirements related to security breaches,
the rights of data subjects and/or the evaluation of the effect of data
protection, the data processor is allowed to invoice a reasonable number of
working hours that were carried out at a hourly rate agreed to by both the
data controller and the data processor.
The invoicing of said hours does
require that the data controller has approved the spending of billable hours
to these purposes.
