Suspension of Service and Acceleration.
If any amount owing by Customer under this or any other agreement for Services is 30 or more days overdue, Canvas may, without limiting its other rights and remedies, accelerate Customerâs unpaid fee obligations under such agreements so that all such obligations become immediately due and payable, and suspend the Services until such amounts are paid in full.
