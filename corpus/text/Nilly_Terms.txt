Subscriptions
Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis (âSubscription(s)â).
You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (âBilling Cycleâ).
Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.
At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Lyo GmbH cancels it.
You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting Lyo GmbH customer support team.
A valid payment method (including credit card) is required to process the payment for your subscription.
You shall provide Lyo GmbH with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information.
By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Lyo GmbH to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.
Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Lyo GmbH will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.
Fee Changes
Lyo GmbH, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions.
Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.
Lyo GmbH will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.
Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.
Refunds
Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable.
