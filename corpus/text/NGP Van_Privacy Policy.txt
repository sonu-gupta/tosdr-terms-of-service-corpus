Please note these rights are not absolute, and there may be cases when we decline your request as permitted by law.


Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights


You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your Personal Information over the past 12 months.
Once we receive and confirm your verifiable Consumer request, we will disclose to you:

The categories of Personal Information we collected about you.
The categories of sources for the Personal Information we collected about you.

Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights.


To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable Consumer request to us by using the contact information in theContact Ussection of this Policy.
Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable Consumer request related to your Personal Information.
You may only make a verifiable Consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.
The verifiable Consumer request must:

Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information or an authorized representative, which may vary based on the nature of your request.
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you.
Making a verifiable Consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.
However, we do consider requests made through your password protected account sufficiently verified when the request relates to Personal Information associated with that specific account.
We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable Consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.


Response Timing and Format.


We endeavor to respond to a verifiable Consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt.
If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.
If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account.
If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.
Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding receipt of the verifiable Consumer request.
The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.
For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your Personal Information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance, specifically a .csv file.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable Consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.
If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.


Non-Discrimination.


We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.
Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:

Deny you goods or services.
Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.

However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that 
can result
 in different prices, rates, or quality levels.
Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your Personal Information's value and contain written terms that describe the program's material aspects.
Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.

GENERAL INFORMATION.

How EveryAction Shares Personal Information

We do not sell or allow your Personal Information to be used by third parties for their own marketing purposes.
Below are the different scenarios under which we may share your data with third parties.



Service Providers.
 With our contracted service providers, who provide services such as IT and system administration and hosting, credit card processing, research and analytics, marketing, legal, accounting, banking, auditing, insuring us, customer support and data enrichment for the purposes and pursuant to the legal bases described above.
such service providers comprise companies located in the countries in which we operate.


Non-EveryAction Applications.
 You may choose to connect any number of Non-EveryAction Applications or other integrations, including our partner applications, with your account.
If you give an integration provider access to your account, then your use of these integrations is subject to the service terms and privacy terms made available by that integrator.
We are not responsible for third-party integrators and in no case are such integration providers our sub-processors.


Compliance with Legal Obligations.
 We may disclose your Personal Information to a third party if (i) we reasonably believe that disclosure is compelled by applicable law, regulation, legal process, or a government request (including to meet national security, emergency services, or law enforcement requirements), (ii) to enforce our agreements and policies, (iii) to protect the security or integrity of our services and products, (iv) to protect ourselves, our other customers, or the public from harm or illegal activities, or (v) to respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose data to assist in preventing a death or serious bodily injury.
If EveryAction is required by law to disclose any Personal Information, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to notify you of the disclosure requirement, unless prohibited by law.
Further, we may object to requests we do not believe were issued properly.


Business transfers.
 If we go through a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, data we gather from you may be part of the assets transferred or shared in connection with the due diligence for any such transaction.
In that situation, and that situation only, we might transfer your data in a way that constitutes a sale under applicable law.
If we do, we will let you know ahead of time, and any acquirer or successor of EveryAction may continue to process data consistent with this notice.


Aggregated or de-identified data.
 We might also share data with third parties if the data has been de-identified or aggregated in a way so it cannot be used to identify you or any natural person.
Any other person with your consent.


Legal Basis for Processing Personal Information (EEA visitors only)

If you are a visitor located in the European Economic Area ("
EEA
"), our Data Protection Officer can be contacted at privacy@everyaction.com.
Our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Information described above will depend on the Personal Information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
However, we will normally collect Personal Information from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the Personal Information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.
In certain cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect Personal Information from you.
If we ask you to provide Personal Information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your Personal Information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your Personal Information).
Similarly, if we collect and use your Personal Information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.

Please contact the administrator for your Platform account regarding closing or deleting your account.
You should know that closure and/or deletion of your account will result in you permanently losing access to your account and data in the account.
Please note that certain information associated with your account may nonetheless remain on our servers in an aggregated form that does not identify you.
To cancel an authorized user's account, your account administrator can delete or disable the authorized user's account in the administrator's account management portal.
However, irrespective of type of account, data, including personal information, associated with such account that we are required to maintain for legal purposes or for necessary business operations will be retained after account closure until no longer needed.

For Contacts


As described above, for much of the Personal Information we collect and process about Contacts through the EveryAction Materials, we act as a processor on behalf of our Customers.
In such cases, if you are a Contact and want to exercise any data protection rights that may be available to you under applicable law or have questions or concerns about how your Personal Information is handled by EveryAction as a processor on behalf of our individual Customers, you should contact the relevant Customer that is using the EveryAction Materials, and refer to their separate privacy policies.
If you no longer want to be contacted by one of our Customers, please unsubscribe directly from that Customer's newsletter or contact the Customer directly to update or delete your data.
If you contact us directly, we may either forward your request to the relevant Customer or provide you with the identity of the Customer to enable you to contact them directly.

How We Secure Personal Information

We use appropriate security measures to protect the security of your Personal Information both online and offline.
These measures vary based on the sensitivity of the Personal Information we collect, process and store and the current state of technology.
We also take measures to ensure service providers that process Personal Information on our behalf also have appropriate security controls in place.
Please note that no service is completely secure.
While we strive to protect your data, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or a data breach will never occur.
To protect the confidentiality of your account and protect from unauthorized use of your account, we recommend enabling two-factor authentication for your account.
Additionally, you must keep your account password confidential and not disclose them publicly or to unauthorized individuals â this includes accidentally distributing them in a binary or checking them into source control.
Please let your account administrator and EveryAction know right away if you think your password was compromised or misused.
Similarly, if you provision an API Key, you should secure your access credentials to the API Key as well.

Transfers of Personal Information Out of the EEA and Switzerland



We operate in the United States.


Our servers and offices are in the United States, so your Personal Information may be transferred to, stored, or processed in the United States.
While the data protection, privacy, and other laws of the United States might not be as comprehensive as those in your country, we take many steps to protect your privacy, including the measures detailed in our Terms of Service.
Customers located in Switzerland, United Kingdom, and the EEA are subject to our Data Processing Agreement available here.


Data Transfers from Switzerland, United Kingdom, and the EEA to the United States.


EveryAction participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework.
We are committed to subjecting all Personal Information received from EEA member countries, United Kingdom, and Switzerland, respectively, in reliance on each Privacy Shield Framework, to each Framework's applicable Principles.
To learn more about the Privacy Shield Frameworks, and to view our certification, visit the U.S.
Department of Commerce's Privacy Shield website available here.
EveryAction is responsible for the processing of Personal Information we receive under each Privacy Shield Framework and subsequently transfer to a third party acting as an agent on our behalf.
We comply with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of Personal Information from the EEA, United Kingdom, and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.
With respect to Personal Information received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, we are subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S.
Federal Trade Commission.
In certain situations, we may be required to disclose Personal Information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third-party dispute resolution provider (free of charge to you) at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.

In certain circumstances, we may rely on the European Union Model Clauses, also known as Standard Contractual Clauses, involving transfers of Personal Information from Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and EEA to the United States.

Retention of Your Personal Information

Details regarding how long your Personal Information may be stored on our systems will depend on whether you are a Customer, Visitor, or Contact.
Generally, we will only retain your Personal Information for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected or placed into our systems.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, here is an overview of how long we hold on to Personal Information in a form that can be used to identify you:


Customers.
 As an EveryAction Customer, we will retain these records for as long you instruct.
In some cases, use of extended storage may cost more.
If you later instruct us to delete those records, we will do so.
Please note that it may take 30 days or longer for the data to be completely removed from all systems.


Visitors.
 Generally, we retain your Personal Information for only as long as needed to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected.
however, certain Visitors to our Customer's donation or giving webpages may have their Personal Information stored through the use of a cookie up to 10 years to allow prepopulating of web forms on the same or other Customer donation or giving webpages.


Contacts.
 If the EveryAction Materials enable a Customer to store records of your Personal Information contained within its data, and that Customer chooses to do so, then we will retain this data for as long our Customer instructs, subject to applicable law.
You should direct requests seeking further information relating to retention of your Personal Information to the relevant Customer to address.


Deletion Request.
 If you are a Customer or Visitor and you ask EveryAction to delete specific Personal Information about you, we will honor this request in accordance with applicable law.
If you are a Contact or an end user of a Non-EveryAction Application, you should direct requests to the relevant Customer or application provider.
We may retain your Personal Information for a longer period as necessary to carry out necessary business functions (e.g.,billing for our products and service) or for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, or reporting requirements, such as in the event of a complaint or if we believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.
However, after expiry of the applicable retention periods, we will delete your Personal Information.
If there is any data that we are unable, for technical reasons, to delete entirely from our systems, we will put in place appropriate measures to prevent any further use of such data.

Information from Children

We do not knowingly permit children (under the age of 13 in the US or 16 if you live in the EEA) to sign up for the EveryAction Materials.
If we discover someone who is underage has signed up for access to the EveryAction Materials, we will take reasonable steps to promptly remove that person's Personal Information from our records.
If you believe a person who is underage has signed up for access to the EveryAction Materials or has been included as a Contact, please contact us at privacy@everyaction.com.

Do-Not-Track Signals

Do Not Track ("
DNT
") is a privacy preference that you can set in most web browsers.
Certain state laws require us to indicate whether we honor DNT settings in your browser.
EveryAction currently supports DNT.
however, there is no accepted standard on how to respond to web browsers' DNT signals and even when you have DNT enabled, we may still use information collected for analytics and measurement purposes or to otherwise provide the EveryAction Materials but we will not load any third-party trackers.
You can learn more about Do Not Track here, and you can learn more about the cookies our websites set here.

Changes to Our Privacy Notice

We may change our Policy from time to time.
If we make changes, we'll revise the "Last Modified" date at the top of this Policy, and we may provide additional notice such as on the EveryAction website homepage, account portal sign-in page, or via the email address we have on file for you.
We will comply with applicable law with respect to any changes we make to this notice and seek your consent to any material changes if this is required by applicable law.
