We encourage you to read the Privacy Statement to better understand how you can manage your data and cookie preferences.



You must accept these Terms. To use the Service you must accept the Terms, including both the Service Specific Terms and the General Terms of Service.
Where the Service Specific Terms differ or conflict with the general Terms of Service, the Service Specific Terms apply.
By accepting the Terms, you enter into an agreement for an indefinite duration.
You must follow these Terms which stipulate all rights and obligations between you and Opera in connection with the Service.

If you do not accept the modifications, then you may, prior to the entry into force of the modification, unilaterally terminate the Service Specific Terms by deleting your Account.

Our Termination Rights. We may restrict, suspend or terminate the contract offered by these Terms and your access to all or any part of the Service Property and/or Publisher Property at any time without prior notice or liability if:
a.
you commit a breach of your obligations or any other term under these Terms or violate the rights of any third party intellectual property owner;
b.
if you are an individual, you become bankrupt;
c.
if you are another legal entity, you become insolvent (including being unable to pay your debts as they fall due and/or the value of your assets is less than the amount of your liabilities, taking into account contingent and prospective liabilities), propose an individual, company or partnership voluntary arrangement, have a receiver, administrator or manager or trustee in bankruptcy appointed over the whole or any part of your business or assets.

Effect of Termination. If your contract with us offered by these Terms discontinues for any reason then it will cease immediately to have effect (apart from any sections that are necessary for our enforcement of any legal rights and remedies against you).
This means that you will no longer have access to the Service Property and Publisher Property.



Force Majeure. Neither party shall be liable for any failure to fulfil its obligations under these Terms as a result of force majeure and in such circumstances the time for performance shall be extended by a period equivalent to the period during which performance of the obligation has been delayed or failed to be performed.
If either party is prevented or delayed in the performance of its obligations under these Terms by reason of force majeure, that party shall, as soon as reasonably possible, serve notice in writing on the other party specifying the nature and extent of the circumstances giving rise to force majeure.
In this section 10 (Force Majeure), âForce Majeureâ means any cause preventing a party from performing any or all of its obligations that arises from or is attributable to acts, events, omissions or accidents beyond the reasonable control of the party so prevented including strikes, lock-outs or other industrial disputes (other than any such dispute involving the workforce of the party so prevented), nuclear accident or acts of God, war or terrorist activity, riot, civil commotion, malicious damage (excluding malicious damage involving the employees of the affected party or its subcontractors), industrial action by employees of any providers of electrical power, failure of technical facilities, fire, flood, or storm or default of suppliers or subcontractors.



Ceasing to provide the Service Property or Publisher Property. If we decide to cease to provide the Service Property, then you will be notified as soon as reasonably possible.
If for any reason Publisher Property that you have validly licensed is taken down from the Service Platforms, we encourage Publishers to notify you and ensure that the relevant Publisher Property will remain available to valid existing Users for a period of 30 days (but subject to our ultimate discretion and legal obligations as to whether they can be made available in this way or not).
Following that period, the Publisher Property (and/or if appropriate the relevant Service Property) will no longer be available unless we notify you otherwise.



Opera may suspend the Service. Opera may temporarily suspend the Service for technical reasons or to perform routine maintenance.
