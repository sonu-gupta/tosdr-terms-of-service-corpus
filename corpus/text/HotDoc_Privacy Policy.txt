(c) we will only use your Personal Information for secondary purposes if you have provided your consent for us to do so, or if you might reasonably expect us to do so (for example, to investigate or respond to a complaint that you have raised with us, or to verify your identity if you have forgotten your user details for the Platform);
(d) we maintain all Personal Information (especially health information) in strict confidence, and will only disclose it to third parties where:
(e) it is reasonably necessary to enable us to provide you with your use of the Platform, or to enable your medical practitioners to keep up to date records and communicate with you.
or
(i) we are otherwise authorised or required to do so under relevant laws, such as if the disclosure is reasonably necessary due to law enforcement activities, or to lessen a serious threat to the life, health or safety of any individual.

(ii) our service providers who support and enable us to provide our services and run our business, such as:
A.
our information technology, network, software and cloud storage providers;
B.
any practice management software providers which your medical practitioner uses.
and
C.
our external professional advisers (such as legal advisors).
and
(g) if we do share or disclose your Personal Information as described above, we will always first consider whether we can reasonably de-identify or anonymise that information.

 


3.3 If you are a Clinic Representative:
(a) we will use your Personal Information (including your financial information) for the primary purposes of providing you with our services or enabling your use of the Platform to communicate with your patients, such as to:

C.
our own marketing and promotions.
or
D.

(ii) investigating any issues or complaints about, or made by, you or another individual, or if we have reason to suspect that you or another individual are in breach of any of our terms and conditions or have been otherwise engaged in any unlawful activity.
or
(iii) any other purposes which are required or authorised by any laws (including the Privacy Act);
(c) we will only disclose your Personal Information to third parties where this is reasonably necessary to enable us to operate our business or provide you with our services and the use of the Platform, or as is otherwise required or authorised by any laws (including the Privacy Act);

(i) your patients or potential patients;
(ii) any individuals or entities who access your details which are published via the Platform;

3.4 If you are a contractor or supplier, potential employee, or another individual we deal with in the course of running our business, we will only use or disclose any Personal Information that we collect for the purpose for which it was collected, or for any secondary purposes which you might reasonably expect and which are related to the primary purpose.
The primary purpose of our collection can generally be determined by the circumstances in which the information was collected or submitted.
For example, if you are a potential employee and provide us with your CV, we will use it for the purposes of assessing your application for employment.

 


3.5 The types of disclosures described in this section might also involve your Personal Information being sent to some overseas recipients (for example, to any of our service providers who are located overseas).
This might currently include third parties which are located in the United States of America, though this may change from time to time. 4.
