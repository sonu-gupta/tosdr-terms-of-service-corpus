         Browser permissions

The following are the browserâs policy settings and permissions that Proctorio has to use to operate effectively.
However, Proctorio does not use all of their settings or permissions to run most of the exams.
These permissions are also determined by the settings enabled by the instructor.
 Browser Permission
What and why? Read and change all your data on the websites you visit
This only occurs during an exam and is a method to ensure that test-takers aren't able to infringe academic integrity with the use of third party sites.
Display notifications
We may display a popup notification while you are in the exam in the case that you navigate away from the exam.
Modify data you copy and paste
We don't read/collect the contents in the user's clipboard.
Instead, during the exam, we replace the clipboard text with our own to prevent exam content distribution.
Capture content of your screen
This recording setting only runs during the exam and is only visible to exam administrators to review once the exam is submitted.
This is used to make sure that no unauthorized online based resources were used during the exam.
Manage your downloads
Downloads will only be prevented during the exam.
Identify and eject storage devices
Storage devices are detected and identified during the exam.
But we do not eject storage devices.
Manage your apps, extensions, and themes
We do not manage the themes of your device.
But we do manage extensions and applications that may hinder Proctorio from operating properly.
Change your privacy-related settings
We use it to temporarily block the browser's "password" fill option during the exam.
