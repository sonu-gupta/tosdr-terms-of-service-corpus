ChessKid.com is a safe place for people to come and enjoy chess. We use strict privacy management tools on the site to make sure that all interactions are 100% safe.
Members cannot send messages or custom text to each other unless they have both blind-friended each other.
Blind-friending means that both members must independently add the other member as a friend, and members are not notified that another member has added them as a friend.
This means that your child will only become friends with those on the site that he or she specifies.
Also, as a parent you can review your child's friends, or prevent them from adding friends.
Only friends are able to chat, send messages, and communicate.
No Cheating or Computer Help Members can NEVER use chess programs (Chessmaster, Fritz, etc) to analyze any current, ongoing games.
Only One AccountMembers may only have ONE ChessKid.com account.
Members who create more than one account may have all accounts closed.

ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.Fair PlayChessKid.com takes playing fairly seriously &amp.
the rules are the same as on our parent site Chess.com.
Parents, please talk to your child about sportsmanship and fair play! Dishonest play ruins the experience for others.
We want to keep the play experience fun and honest and we truly care about the integrity of chess.

Note: we have closed accounts in the past.
We have closed accounts during live events.
Again, we take fair play seriously and we will take actions up to and including a permanent ban from ChessKid.com.The Rules

No chess programs or engines (e.g.
Chessmaster, Fritz, Komodo, Houdini, Stockfish, Chessbase with any active UCI engine, etc.) can be used to analyze positions in ongoing games at any time.
In Daily Chess (turn-based games with several days per move), you may consult any resource which is not engine-based.
This includes books, opening databases (including the ChessKid.com Explorer) for [ChessKid.com/openings|opening moves], and thematic games (though not their engine analyses).
Tablebases are NOT allowed.
You may not consult an engine, or another human, to provide an opinion on the opening database, tablebases, self-preparation or analysis that would relate to a particular game-in-progress on ChessKid.com.
In Live Chess, no outside assistance OF ANY KIND is permitted.

Fixing game results by arranging games, playing with multiple accounts or losing intentionally is also against the rules.


Do not let anyone else play on your account! This is strictly against the rules!

Reporting Unfair Play
If you have reason to believe someone is referencing the illegal assistance of engine analysis, please see how to report it here.
Our Foul Play Detection Staff will conduct a thorough investigation, gathering statistics and reports on said user, keeping all findings confidential, taking appropriate action against the reported user if/when a concrete assessment has been made.

Please do not discuss your suspicions in the forums!
Any of the above described public accusations / actions against a member may lead to your own account being restricted, regardless of what is found against the accused.
Detecting Foul Play
Part of our analysis involves comparing human moves to computer moves and looking at the statistical significance of said moves.
To remain effective, other aspects of our detection methods are confidential.
Catching Fair Play Abusers
We work hard to keep ChessKid.com a safe and positive community for chess players around the world, and are sad whenever any account is closed.
That said, the process of investigating the fair play of our members is a never ending one!

ChessKid.com employs nine full time salary employees dedicated to the research, prevention, and ultimately, the closure of accounts found to have accessed illegal assistance during their chess games.
Our team is constantly going through the games of our top players, submitting those games into our 'Fair Play Detection System', and evaluating clean play vs non-clean play.
ChessKid.com continues to close accounts on a daily basis for Fair Play violations.
Players found to have violated the rules of Fair Play
Their accounts may be closed or suspended.
Account closures may be permanent.
If we happen to find violations of Fair Play in real-time, we may abort the game in progress, award their opponent with a win and close their account immediately.
all games in progress are awarded to their opponents.
In many 'first time abuser' cases, we offer a chance for admission and apology.
If this is given, we will sometimes allow the opening of a new account.
however, never is a user convicted of Fair Play abuse allowed to open the same account again.
Accounts not closed after reporting abuse
We appreciate you reporting your suspicions, but ultimately ChessKid.com will decide and bear all responsibilities of our members and their play on our site.
If we have not closed their account then the evidence is not conclusive.

You closed the account of someone I know - I'm sure they were innocent of abuse!
An account is closed only when we are absolutely certain of our findings and have gathered enough statistics that we would stand by under public scrutiny and a court of law.

No accounts are ever closed 'on suspicion'.

Can someone appeal if their account is closed?
We are happy to listen to your appeal! Reply to your closure notice and support will work with you to file an appeal.
However, we ask you to remember that ChessKid.com is a private company, it maintains the right to close the accounts of anyone we deem to have broken site rules, acted unfairly to other members or behaved in a way that hurt the site experience for other members.
Further, it should be clear by all logical, reasonable accounts (as well as by all smart business practices) that we would never have any reason to close the account of a user if we were not SURE, beyond all reasonable doubt, that they had broken rules.

What does ChessKid.com think about Fair Play abuse
Using unfair advantages against someone who thinks you are playing fairly is a dishonest act.
Our policies are clear &amp.
strict.
they are also faithfully enforced.
We feel we are extremely effective in identifying and dealing with all Fair Play abusers.
