Here are the most important things we do to keep your privacy and security:


No cookies, to minimize traces in web browser
No hard drives on our web servers, to protect against hard drive leakage and to protect against persistant backdoor/trojans
Anonymous email header, no personal IP-addresses inside the header
No IP-logging, our server does not log IP-addresses
We only use strong open source algorithms
Personal data or individual account data is never shared or sold
Email data (body &amp.
attachments) are always stored in encrypted form
We do not collect any data from our users, the only time we store some data is the first 14 days of your payment date, after 14 days, we remove most sensitive information and only store the data that is needed for the accounting, such as the product you bought, the amount, the payment method, the date and the country.
So after 14 days:no Name, no Address, no State, no Phone, no Card numbers and no Secondary email




Please read our Terms of Use here: https://countermail.com/?p=terms
You must read and agree to our Terms of Use later anyway, when you register the email account.


Trusted applications
We only use certified protocols and applications.
OpenPGP is one of the most secure encryption protocols in the world.
