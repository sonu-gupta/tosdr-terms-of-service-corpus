There may be other controllers as well (e.g., advertisers), and we encourage you to consult their privacy policies to learn more about their privacy practices.

What is Personalized Content &amp.
Advertising?


Analytics

We may use third-party web analytics services on our Services, such as those of Google Analytics. These service providers use the sort of technology previously described in the âCookies and other electronic technologiesâ section to help us analyze how users use the Services, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive, and provide certain features to you.
For example, the Google Trusted Store badge displayed on some of the Services is served to you through the use of cookies.
The information (including your IP address) collected by the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Services. We also use Google Analytics for certain purposes related to advertising, as described in the following section.
To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by clicking here.
If you receive email from us, we may use certain tools, such as clear GIFs to capture data such as when you open our message or click on any links or banners our email contains. This data allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our communications and marketing campaigns.
Tailored Advertising
We may personalize the content and advertising that you see when using the Services through the use of third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on the Services, as well as other websites you visit and other applications you use.
The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you provide such as your age and gender, your searches, demographic data, user-generated content, and other information we collect from you.
These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests.
In connection with the foregoing, we may work with DigiTrust to set a first-party cookie in your browser to enable us and DigiTrust Partners to collect web viewing data that includes visits to the Services and non-affiliated websites over time.
This data may be used to infer whether you share interests with other users, and deliver advertising relevant to those inferences.
Also, third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised via the Services may place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about your use of the Services in order to (i) inform, optimize, and serve ads based on past visits to our websites and other sites and (ii) report how our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our websites and use of our Services.
We also allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics, DoubleClick and others) to serve tailored ads to you on the Services, other sites, and in other applications, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services.
We also may share with third-party advertisers a hashed version of your email address, solely in non-human readable form and content that you share publicly when using the services (e.g., user-generated content) for purposes of delivering tailored advertising.
We neither have access to, nor does this Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated third parties.
Those parties that use these technologies, including DigiTrust, may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting as described below.
You may receive tailored advertising on your computer through a web browser.
If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiativeâs Consumer Opt-Out link, the Digital Advertising Allianceâs Consumer Opt-Out link , the opt-out page of the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance, or TrustArcâs Preference Manager to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs.
You may also use the links available in advertisements that appear in the Services and learn more about our advertising practices through the About Our Ads link available through the Services.
To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, you can visit the Google Ads Settings page.
Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Services, you may still receive advertisements even if you opt-out of tailored advertising.
In that case, the ads will just not be tailored.
When using a mobile application you may also receive tailored in-application advertisements.
Each operating system, iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices and Windows for Microsoft devices provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements.
You may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems to opt-out of tailored in-app advertisements.
For any other devices and/or operating systems, please visit the privacy settings for the applicable device or contact the applicable platform operator.
We do not control how the applicable platform operator allows you to control receiving personalized in-application advertisements.
thus, you should contact the platform provider for further details on opting out of tailored in-application advertisements.
We also may use third-party service providers to deliver advertisements on mobile applications or for mobile application analytics. You can opt-out from third-party interest-based advertising on some Android devices and Google apps by visiting Google Settings, Ads and then click on âDisable ads based on interests.â You can also opt out of some interest-based advertising on your mobile device by downloading the TrustArc Privacy App available at: https://www.trustarc.com/consumer-resources/privacy-app/.
Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Services, you may still receive advertisements even if you opt-out.
n that case, the advertising will not be tailored to your interests.
Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs.&nbsp.
We are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.
Do Not Track (âDNTâ) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.
DNT is a way for users to inform online services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or services.
We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on the Services for third party purposes, and that is why we provide links to the Network Advertising Initiative and the Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out pages, as well as choices provided by Google Ads, Google Analytics, and TrustArc.
However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.
To learn more about Do Not Track, you can do so here

Many of the rights described here are subject to significant limitations and exceptions under applicable law (e.g., objections to the processing of personal data, and withdrawals of consent, typically will not have retroactive effect).

Will We Disclose Your Information?

We may disclose and/or share your information between members of KC Online Media, LLC, and to or with any non-affiliated third parties under the following circumstances:


Consent. We may disclose your information to any third parties based on your consent to do so.

Business Transfers. As we continue to develop our business, we may buy, merge or partner with other companies.
In such transactions, (including in contemplation of such transactions, e.g., due diligence) user information may be among the transferred assets.
If a portion or all of our assets are sold or transferred to a third-party, customer information (including your email address) would likely be one of the transferred business assets.

Public Forums. Our Services offer publicly accessible blogs and community forums.
You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.
Please also remember that if you choose to provide information on public features of the Services, individuals reading such information may use or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge, and search engines may index that information.
We therefore urge you to think carefully about what you choose to disclose publicly and make sure itâs information you want to share with the public.

The laws in some jurisdictions require companies to tell you about the legal ground they rely on to use or disclose your personal data.
To the extent those laws apply, our legal grounds for processing your personal data are as follows:


To Honor Our Contractual Commitments to You. Much of our processing of personal data is to meet our contractual obligations to our customers, or to take steps at customersâ request in anticipation of entering into a contract with them.

Legitimate Interests. In many cases, we handle personal data on the ground that it furthers our legitimate interests in commercial activities such as the following in ways that are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the affected individuals:


Customer service
Marketing
Protecting our customers, personnel and property
Analyzing and improving our business
Managing legal issues

We may also process personal data for the same legitimate interests of our customers and business partners.


Legal Compliance. We need to use and disclose personal data in certain ways to comply with our legal obligations.

Consent. Where required by law, and in some other cases, we handle personal data on the basis of consent.
Where we handle your personal data on the basis of consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent.


Where is my data?

The Services are operated in the United States and are governed by United States law.
If you are a resident of the European Union or other location outside the United States, please be advised that any information you provide through the Services will be transferred to the United States or other designated locations outside of the EEA, which may not have a similar standard for data protection as the laws of your jurisdiction for processing, hosting, and storage by us or our service providers.
Where you are accessing Services from an EEA member state, we will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your information is treated securely in accordance with this privacy policy always and at least to the standards required by Applicable Law in the jurisdiction of access.

Do we retain your data?

We will keep your information only for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purpose that it has been processed, taking into account any legal requirements under Applicable Law.
For the avoidance of doubt, we will retain your information to continue offering the Services to you.

We will also retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
Information may persist in copies made for backup and business continuity purposes for additional time.

How do we protect your information?

We have implemented administrative, technical, and physical security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and/or alteration of your information.
These safeguards vary based on the sensitivity of the information that we collect and store.
All information you provide to us is stored on secure servers.
Any payment transactions will be encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology.
Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our website or our service, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.
We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure, and although we will do our best to protect your information, we cannot and do not guarantee that the measures we take will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use, or disclose your information since despite our efforts, as no Internet and/or other electronic transmissions can be completely secure and any transmission is at your own risk.
It is important for you to protect against unauthorised access to your password and to your computer so we advise that you sign off when you have finished using a shared computer strongly recommend and that you do not use the browserâs password memory function as that would permit other people using your device to access your information.
We recommend that you change your password periodically.
You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account username and password.
You may not provide these account credentials to any third party.
If you believe that your account username and/or password have been stolen or been made known to others, you must contact us immediately as described below and change your password immediately.
We are not responsible if someone else accesses your account through information that they have obtained from you.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all liability and responsibility for any damages you may suffer due to any loss, unauthorised access, misuse or alterations of any information you submit to the Service.
