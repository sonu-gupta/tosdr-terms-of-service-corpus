Ghostery Lite Browser Extension Privacy Policy


Effective Date: December 1, 2020


I.
Introduction:

The Ghostery Lite Browser Extension (âGLBEâ) is owned by Cliqz International GmbH (âCliqzâ), which is headquartered at Arabellastrasse 23, 81925 Munich, Germany, (âCompanyâ).
The Company, as the responsible body under the German Data Protection Law, takes the protection of your personal data very seriously and will always offer you the GLBE and its functionality with your privacy in mind.
We also recognize that the GLBE is popular because people want to be informed and empowered.
We share the belief that privacy, when done right, is empowering, and that is why privacy is central to the GLBE and new functionality that we may add.
Therefore, we only collect data to build our products for the benefit of our users and we believe that we as a company should never have any personal data (âPersonal Data) about our users unless they affirmatively provide it to us.
The core functionality of the GLBE is to inform users what third-party tracking technologies (âTrackersâ) are tracking them on any given website so individuals can exercise personal control over that activity by blocking them for a cleaner, faster, safer browsing experience.

II.
Basis to Collect and Use Personal Data

There is no obligation on your part to provide your Personal Data.
However, if you do, we have a legitimate interest to collect and use it, namely so we can provide products or services, or complete a transaction with you.

III.
Notion of Personal Data

Personal Data means any information concerning the personal or material circumstances of an identified or identifiable individual such as name and age.
Non-personal data are all data that cannot be used to identify an individual, such as statistics about usage of a website.

IV.
What Personal Data are collected


User Account: Currently we do not offer User Accounts, but might be doing so in the future.
Then the GLBE User Account will â most certainly â have the ability to receive product information and also take advantage of new GLBE functionality.
You are not required to open a user account in order to use the GLBE.
If and when the functionality is added, you choose to open a user account by either downloading the GLBE, or any other time through the GLBE settings.
If you choose to create a user account, we will collect the following Personal Data: name, email address.
At any time you can deactivate your user account, at which time you will no longer have access to the services that a user account offers.

IP-Address: We do not differentiate between static or dynamic IP addresses â that is driven at the user level â but please see the Security section below to learn more about the security measures we take to protect data â including your IP-address â that the GLBE collects.

V.
How Personal Data are used

The use of the GLBE Personal Data that we collect when you open an account is used for: (i) syncing your GLBE settings across browsers and devices, (ii) serving as your login credentials, and (iii) communicating directly to you through your email address in order to give you information about our products, services, updates and upgrades (in certain cases for a fee).
IP-addresses are solely collected for geolocation purposes but only on Zip Code level or above (for example city, county, continent) to improve the GLBE.
We never store IP addresses.

VI.
Collection of Non-Personal Data

When you download the GLBE, it collects on an ongoing basis the following data: web browser, operating systems, when an installation, upgrade, or uninstallation occurs, and whether the GLBE is active or engaged by you.
The use of the aforementioned non-personal data is limited to: (i) communicating through the CMP (see VIII.) â since we donât have your name or email address â in order to share product information or updates and Company news, (ii) for internal analytical purposes such as accurately counting the number of browser extension downloads, or (iii) surveying our users from time to time.

VII.
The Consumer Messaging Platform (âCMPâ)

The CMP is used from time to time as a way for us to effectively and generically communicate to our users, while still honoring their privacy.
At the moment, GLBE does not have this feature included, but will probably in the future.
If we add this feature in the future it will work, according to the CMP in the Ghostery Browser Extension:
The CMP is automatically turned on, but you can easily turn it off by going to the GLBE options page and following the instructions provided.
If you turn off the CMP, you can still use the GLBE, but you wonât receive any generic communications from us.

VIII.
Data Processing Abroad

Although the Company is located in Germany, it partly operates out of the United States.
The data we collect, personal or otherwise, are located on servers based in the United States.
If you are accessing or using GLBE from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S.
law, please note that you may be allowing the collection or transferring of your personal data in or to the U.S.
However, we have a strong data privacy framework in place to ensure an adequate level of protection for your Personal Data.

IX.
Data Retention

If you deactivate your user account, the Company retains the collected Personal Data if and for as long as it may be required by law (for example to fulfil retention periods prescribed by law) or judicial order.
The Company will use this personal data only for those purposes and retains it only as long as prescribed by law.
After that the Personal Data will be deleted.

X.
Data Portability &amp.
Erasure

In compliance with the GDPR, Ghostery provides features available in the product menu that allow users to easily download and delete the Personal Data associated with their user accounts.&nbsp.
If users choose to download their information, it will be downloaded as a machine-readable CSV file and will include their name, email address, and Ghostery account settings and preferences.&nbsp.
If users choose to delete their account, all Personal Data associated with the account will be completely and permanently deleted from the Ghostery servers.

XI.
Security

The Company has reasonable and appropriate technical, physical and administrative safeguards in place for a company of our size and complexity to protect the data that is collected.
Some of the specific security measures we take include instantly hashing the origination IP addresses using very strong encryption technology to protect your privacy, whereupon the collected IP addresses and user agent information is destroyed.
In addition, to further preserve your security, the GLBE does not collect any information on URLs beyond the path query string.

XII.
Contacting the Company 

At any time the user has the right to object any use of his personal data and can do so by writing to the Company at the physical address provided in the beginning of the document or by emailing the Company at privacy@ghostery.com If you object will be necessary to prove that you are the owner of the account.
The Company has the right to answer your inquiry electronically.
Please contact for this and all other inquiries, comments or concerns about these practices by email at privacy@ghostery.com.

XIII.
Changes to Privacy Policy

We may occasionally change this Privacy Policy and when we do, we will also revise the âEffective Dateâ at the top of the Privacy Policy.
If we make any material changes to our Privacy Policy, we will try to inform you via the CMP and, if you opened an account and gave us your email address, then we will also try to contact you through the email address you provided about those material changes.
Ultimately, however, it is your responsibility to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about our data practices and any changes to them.
Your continued use of the GLBE constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any changes to it.
