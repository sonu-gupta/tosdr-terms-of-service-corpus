Our refund policy is simple: if you are not satisfied, reach out to us and we'll find a solution.Full refund
If you were just charged for your next month or year of service but you meant to cancel, weâre happy to refund that extra charge.
If you tried one of our products for a month and you just werenât happy with them, you can have your money back.
Although it is not required, we would appreciate your feedback to be able to improve our services in the future.

Partial refund

If you used our services for more than one month on an annual plan, weâll figure out a partial refund based on how many months you used it.
If we had extended downtime (multiple hours in a day, or multiple days in a month), weâd issue a partial credit to your account.
