Terms of Use Date of Last Revision: September 2019
 
These Terms of Use (the "Terms") describe the terms under which you may access and use the mobile and web-based messaging and telecommunication services (the "Services") provided by Rave Wireless, Inc.
dba Rave Mobile Safety ("Rave") and, if applicable, the client of Rave who has licensed certain applications from Rave and through which you were granted access to the services (the âClientâ).
The Services are a set of applications accessed through the web or mobile devices, the features of  which vary based on which applications are licensed and to which you are granted access to and for which you register.
These Terms may be modified by Rave at any time without prior notice.
Changes to the Terms will be posted on this page, and this page will indicate at the top the date these Terms were last revised.
You agree to be bound by any such modifications once they are posted on this web site (the "Site"), and your continued registration to use, or use of, the Services following any such posting constitutes your acceptance of such modifications.
 

PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY AS THEY CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, REMEDIES AND OBLIGATIONS.

 

Messaging


At any time you may stop SMS messages from being sent to your phone by simply 
texting STOP to 226787 or 67283 or 78015 
or 77295
 or 81437 from your 
registered mobile phone. You will no longer receive text messages from Rave if you utilize this service. Text INFO or HELP to 226787 or 67283 or 78015 or 77295 or 81437
from your registered mobile phone and you will be sent a text message with simple instructions.

By registering for this service you will periodically receive text messages.
The frequency of these messages will depend on how you use this service, and how frequently the client sends messages through this service.
Message and data rates may apply.
This service is compatible with the products and services provided by AT&T, Sprint, Verizon Wireless, T-Mobile, and most other mobile phone carriers.
A complete list of supported carriers is displayed during phone registration.
Alerts sent via SMS may not be delivered to you if your phone is not in range of a transmission site, or if sufficient network capacity is not available at a particular time.
Even within a coverage area, factors beyond Verizon's control may interfere with message delivery, including the customer's equipment, terrain, proximity to buildings, foliage, and weather.
You acknowledge that urgent alerts may not be timely received and that Verizon does not guarantee that alerts will be delivered.
T-Mobile and its affiliated brands are not responsible for delayed or undelivered messages.
