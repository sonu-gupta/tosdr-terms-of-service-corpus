If you are a EEA resident requesting the porting or an export of your information, you may reach out to us at privacy@freshbooks.com and we will proceed with the steps necessary.

Account Deletion

FreshBooks is a complex business network that connects millions of users.
FreshBooks manages a business eco system that brings together contractors, companies and customers.
This network relies on the exchange and sharing of information that is important to others in your network.
Tracked hours, sent invoices, paid invoices, contractor invoices are all vital to other people that work with you.
These are the official history of work done and moneys paid.
The complexity and connected nature of the system requires that this history exists in perpetuity to accommodate proper function and accounting for the other systems that you have connected to via contracting hours, invoices, estimates.
FreshBooks will reasonably assure that information will be deleted in a compliant manner.
When a customer chooses to close an account we will remove your information from our marketing and billing systems.
This will ensure that there are not further mailings or billings directed towards the canceled user.
As we continue to refine FreshBooks we will establish a method for the complete removal of all user information from the system without breaking accepted accounting principles for other connected FreshBooks accounts.
This document will evolve as these new methods are defined and tested for permanent account deletion.
Users wishing to be notified when this development is complete can indicate their wishes via help@freshbooks.com or 1.866.303.6061.

Data Retention

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.
Our goal is to retain your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
this retention period may extend past the point at which you close your account.
The criteria that will be for determining periods of retention will be based on the type of data.
For example, data relevant to accounting information will be retained for at least 7 years, whereas temporary cookie data of a web visitor may not be retained at all.

International Transfer of Personal Information

We do not share your personal information with third parties, unless it is necessary to carry out your request, for our professional or legitimate business needs, or as required or permitted by law.
Where we do transfer your personal information to third parties or service providers, appropriate arrangements will be made in order to ensure correct and secure data processing in compliance with applicable data protection law.
We store personal information about Website Visitors and Subscribers within the Canada, United States and in other countries and territories.
To facilitate our global operations, we may transfer and access such personal information from around the world, including from other countries in which FreshBooks has operations.
Therefore, your personal information may be processed outside of the EEA and in countries which are not subject to an adequacy decision by the European Commission and which may not provide for the same level of data protection as the EEA.
In this event, we will ensure that the recipient of your personal information offers an adequate level of protection, for instance by entering into standard contractual clauses for the transfer of data as approved by the European Commission (Art.
46 GDPR), or we will ask you for your prior consent to such international data transfers.
We have implemented safeguards to ensure an adequate level of data protection where your personal information is transferred to countries outside the EEA.
For further details on the transfer of your personal information, including a list of the organizations with whom said information may be shared, please reach out to our team at privacy@freshbooks.com.
