Share Facebook Twitter Linkedin Google Plus Email 
The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you about the types of Personal Information the Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada, or its agents, (as follows, "CPA Canada", "we" or "us") collects about you in the process of conducting the principal activities of CPA Canada and to provide you with general membership benefits as well as providing you with specific products and services you have contracted from us.
It explains how we use and disclose that information, the choices you have regarding such use and disclosure, and how you may correct that information.
The majority of the collection, use and disclosure of personal information by CPA Canada is for the purposes of membership, and therefore for non-commercial purposes.
This Privacy Policy sets out a summary of the principles and procedures that CPA Canada follows in meeting its privacy commitments and, as applicable in light of the foregoing, complying with the requirements of the laws and regulations under applicable privacy laws in Canada, including the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act.
From time to time, we may make changes to this Privacy Policy.
The Privacy Policy is current as of the "last revised" date which appears at the bottom of this page.
We will treat Personal Information in a manner consistent with the Privacy Policy under which it was collected unless we have your consent to treat it differently.
This Privacy Policy applies to any information we collect or receive about you, from any source.
Principle #1 â CPA Canada is accountable for your personal information in its possession or control.
CPA Canada is accountable for all personal information in its possession or control.
This includes any personal information that CPA Canada has collected about members, students, candidates, customers, and past members (each, a âCPA Canada Stakeholderâ), as either collected directly from such CPA Canada Stakeholder.
from provincial CPA bodies.
national and provincial CA, CMA, and CGA bodies which participated in unification.

or other organizations (e.g., corporations, government entities, not-for-profit organizations, academic institutions).
However, from time to time CPA Canada may collect, use and disclose personal information as the agent of provincial CPA bodies, national and provincial CA, CMA, and CGA bodies which participated in unification, and other organizations, in which case, without limiting the obligations of CPA Canada to comply with applicable privacy laws, such other principal entities shall be accountable for such personal information.
CPA Canada has:

established and put into effect policies and procedures aimed at properly protecting personal information;
educated its staff and volunteers regarding such policies and procedures and their roles and responsibilities in protecting personal information.
and
appointed a Chief Privacy Officer to oversee privacy issues at CPA Canada

Principle #2 â CPA Canada identifies the purposes for which it collects personal information from you before it is collected.
We generally identify the purposes for which we use your Personal Information at the time we collect such information from you and obtain your consent, in any case, prior to such use.
Some of the primary purposes for which we collect and use your Personal Information include:

to provide services to you in your capacity as a CPA Canada Stakeholder;
to regulate international students/candidates;
to complete a transaction with you when you purchase or use a product or service offered by us;
to advise you of CPA Canada products or services that may be of interest to you;
to send you electronic CPA Canada newsletters that may be of interest to you or to which you have subscribed, and to better understand which articles are of interest to you;
to conduct research and analytics for purposes that include but are not limited to better understanding CPA Canada Stakeholders, allowing CPA Canada Stakeholders to provide feedback on products and services, and producing data analytics and statistical reports;
to present non- CPA Canada content and advertising that is customized to your interests;
to respond to inquiries you submit;

We will always collect your Personal Information by fair and lawful means (for example, when you complete an application form or purchase a product or service from us).
We may collect Personal Information about you from third parties, such as provincial CPA bodies, national and provincial CA, CMA and CGA bodies, which participated in unification, CPA Canada Website(s), and other institutions and organizations.
We also collect your Personal Information where we have obtained your consent to do so or as otherwise permitted or required by law.
Where is it reasonable to do so, or permitted by law, we may rely on implied consent.

Except as required to process a transaction, to maintain records of CPA Canada or as required or permitted by applicable law, providing us with your personal information is voluntary.
You may withdraw or modify your consent at any time, subject to legal and contractual restrictions, provided that reasonable notice is given to us.
If you withdraw your consent to receive information regarding certain products, publications, services or events being offered by us, you may not be made aware of same.

If you do not wish to receive such mailings, you may request to be removed from this electronic mailing list at any time by contacting our Chief Privacy Officer (see contact information under Principle #8).
You should understand, however, that if you are removed from the mailing list you may not be made aware of the status or availability of certain CPA Canada Website services.

Personal Information is any information that is identifiable to you.
This information may include, but is not limited to, your name, mailing address, phone numbers, email address, identification numbers, credit card numbers, banking information, and creditor information.
Personal Information, however, generally does not include information that CPA Canada collects, uses or discloses solely for the purpose of communicating or facilitating communication with an individual in relation to their employment, business or profession such as the individualâs name, position name or title, work address, work telephone number, work fax number or work electronic address.

Principle #4 â CPA Canada discloses your personal information only for purposes for which it has consent, or as permitted or required by law.
CPA Canada retains personal information only as long as necessary to fulfil those purposes.
We identify to whom, and for what purposes, we disclose your Personal Information, at the time of or prior to collecting such information from you and obtain your consent to such disclosure.

transfer/disclose your Personal Information, in the case of CPA Canada Stakeholders, to provincial CPA bodies, national and provincial CA, CMA and CGA bodies which participated in unification for the purposes of providing services to such CPA Canada Stakeholders;
transfer your Personal Information to our volunteers, for the purposes of the volunteers performing volunteer functions;
