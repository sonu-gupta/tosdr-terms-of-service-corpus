There may be weeks where due to life circumstances, travel, or timezone differences the newsletter is sent a day earlier or a day later but this is the exception not the rule.
Rates can change based on supply, demand, and subscribers.
Rates should not change more than once a quarter or four times a year.Ad FormatYour ad will be featured natively in e-mails to all subscribers and on devopsish.com.
The native ad format guards against content blockers while maintaining the quality experience subscribers expect.
It also eliminates a lot of headaches with regards to formatting.
Ads include a headline, additional copy, links as specified, and are followed by the italicized word, SPONSORED.
Total ad copy length excluding headline, call to action, and SPONSORED tag should not exceed 280 characters.
ð¡Think of ads in DevOpsâish as a tweet with a bolded headline on top and a call to action.
