Cookies are small files that contain letters and numbers which may be placed on your device when you visit a website or use an app.
We use cookies to enhance your experience on our Platform by remembering your preferences.
For instance, on many ecommerce websites, if you add an item to an online shopping cart without completing the checkout process, the next time you visit the same website, you can still see the same item in the shopping cart.
This is an example of how cookies are used to remember your preferences.
Without using cookies your experience on our Platform will be less user-friendly.

On the basis of this user device information we create a certain device fingerprint.
The device related information and fingerprint we obtain is not unique and is rather a set of information indicating particular information about the device that is being used to access our Services at a certain moment.
We are not able to identify a user on the sole basis of the collected device information.
This device related information enables us to associate user accounts with a respective fraud score based on a partly automated process, using algorithms in combination with human review and moderation.
If the fraud score indicates that a certain user account is very likely to be fraudulent, we will ban the respective user and the account.
The information we obtain in this process is used solely for the purposes of customer safety and security and fraud prevention and is subject to highly restrictive access rights for selected customer safety and security specialists at OLX.
