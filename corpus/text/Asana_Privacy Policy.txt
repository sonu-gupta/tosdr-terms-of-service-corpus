Overview

Section II of this Policy applies only to Subscribers.
If you are a Subscriber, the âCustomer Agreementâ governs the collection and processing of information collected from you through the Customerâs instance of the Service (e.g.

In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Policy and the Customer Agreement, the Customer Agreement governs.
Because the Customer controls the Workspace used by Subscribers, if you have any questions about the Customerâs specific Workspace settings and privacy practices, please contact the Customer whose Workspace you use.
If you are a Subscriber located in the European Union, please note that the Customer is the data controller with respect to the processing of your Workspace Content pursuant to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (âGDPRâ).

The Websites may contain links to third-party websites and functionalities.
If you choose to use these third party services, you may disclose your information not just to those third-parties, but also to their users and the public more generally depending on how their services function.
Because these third-party websites and services are not operated by Asana, Asana is not responsible for the content or practices of those websites or services.

Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States, respectively.
Asana has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability.

European Union or Swiss citizens with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact Asana at: privacy@asana.com.
Asana has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU Privacy Shield, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus.
If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed by Asana, please visit the BBB EU Privacy Shield web site at https://www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/ for more information and to file a complaint.
Please note that if your complaint is not resolved through these channels, under limited circumstances, a binding arbitration option may be available before a Privacy Shield Panel.

We may transfer information that we collect about you to third party processors across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.
If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S.
law, please note that you are transferring information to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction.
Asana will take reasonable and appropriate steps necessary to ensure that any third party who is acting as a âdata processorâ under EU and Swiss terminology is processing the personal data we entrust to them in a manner that is consistent with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles.
Asana is potentially liable in cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU and Swiss individuals received pursuant to the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield, respectively.

Changes To Our Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to amend this Policy at any time to reflect changes in the law, our data collection and use practices, the features of our Service or Websites, or advances in technology.
We will make the revised Policy accessible through the Service and Websites, so you should review the Policy periodically.
If we make a material change to the Policy, we will comply with applicable legal requirements regarding providing you with notice and/or consent.

C.
How We Protect Your Information

Asana takes technical and organizational measures to protect your information against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access.
However, no method of transmission over the Internet, and no means of electronic or physical storage, is absolutely secure, and thus we cannot ensure or warrant the security of that information.

D.

If you receive email from us, we may use certain analytics tools, such as clear GIFs, to capture data such as when you open our message or click on any links or banners our email contains.
This data allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our communications and marketing campaigns.
You may instruct us not to use your contact information to contact you by email, postal mail, or phone regarding products, services, promotions and special events that might appeal to your interests by contacting us at the âAsana Contact Infoâ section below.
