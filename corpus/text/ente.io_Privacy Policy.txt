now for the long version...Introduction

This Policy governs our processing of your "personal data" (as defined in the European Unionâs General Data Protection Regulation EU2016/679 (âGDPRâ)) and the way in which we deal with other data that is not personal information.
The term âprocessingâ is used as defined in the GDPR.
It includes collection, storage, and all of the ways we use, and allow you to use, personal information, when we provide our services.
You are the data controller under the GDPR of the personal information you provide to us as part of your Account Data (see below).
Drizzle Technologies Private Limited (CIN U72900KA2020PTC133651) ("ente", "we", "us" or "our") of Flat 301, Purvi Pride Apartments, Varthur, Bangalore, Karnataka, India, 560087 is the data controller under the GDPR of all other personal information.


This Policy is divided into five sections to make it easier for you to see which provisions apply to different types of data.
Words and phrases which are defined in our Terms of Service (âToSâ) have the same meanings when they are used in this Policy.


The sections of this Policy are:


3.1 This Introduction section.
3.2 The âYour Filesâ section.
This covers the actual encrypted files that you upload, access and share using our services.
3.3 The âAccount Dataâ section.
This covers the metadata that is collected and generated by our systems when you use our services, and the information that you provide to us when you register and communicate with us.
3.4 The âWebsite Usage Dataâ section.
This covers the data that is collected and generated by our systems when anyone browses our website.
3.5 The âGeneral Termsâ section, which applies to all our services and all types of data.

The GDPR provides rights to European users, but, as a leading privacy company, we make the GDPR protections and rights available to all our users globally in respect of their personal data wherever you may live.

We also generate and store encrypted previews of images, videos and certain other types of file.
5.2 All Your Files remain encrypted at all times while they are on our system.
They are never received, stored or otherwise dealt with by us in unencrypted form because any decryption takes place only on your device or that of another user to whom you have provided the file/album/folder/collection keys or links that are created when you give them access.
5.3 We collect Your Files because that is necessary for us to provide our end-to-end encrypted cloud storage and collaboration services that you contract for when you agree to our ToS.
