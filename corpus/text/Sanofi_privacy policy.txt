your prior consent:  where you have clearly expressed your approval of SANOFIâs processing of your Personal Data.
In practice, this will generally mean that SANOFI will ask you to sign a document, or to fill-in an online âopt-inâ form or to follow any relevant procedure to allow you to be fully informed and then either clearly accept or refuse the data processing envisaged.


a contractual relationship between you and SANOFI: in such case, the processing of your Personal Data is generally necessary to the execution or the performance of the contract.
this means that if you do not wish SANOFI to process your Personal Data in that context, SANOFI may or will be obliged to refuse to enter into such contract with you or will not be able to provide the products or services covered in this contract.

legal obligations applicable to SANOFIâs activities.
for instance, SANOFI is required to implement pharmacovigilance procedures to monitor adverse effects of marketed products, which generally involves the collection and retention of Personal Data.


the âlegitimate interestâ of SANOFI in the sense of applicable data protection law.
In such a case, SANOFI shall consider your fundamental rights and interests in determining whether the processing is legitimate and lawful.


SANOFI may, on a case-by-case basis, rely on other legal grounds, such as the protection of your vital interests, in accordance with applicable data protection law, as set forth in the applicable Privacy Notice.
Where does the Personal Data come from? SANOFI will always collect Personal Data from trusted sources SANOFI may collect your Personal Data from different sources:


Data that you communicate to us through various media, through registrations, applications surveys or direct and indirect interactions with SANOFI.

Data that we collect automatically, for instance when following your interactions with our websites, platforms, applications and services through certain technologies, such as cookies.

Data that we collect in accordance with applicable law from public sources available, including data that is published by you in all supports.


Data that we obtain legally from third parties, for example, when we may need to confirm contact or financial information or to verify licensure of healthcare professionals.
In such case, we generally receive such Personal Data from third-parties that are authorized to do so in the framework of their own privacy and data protection policies or in accordance with the law.
