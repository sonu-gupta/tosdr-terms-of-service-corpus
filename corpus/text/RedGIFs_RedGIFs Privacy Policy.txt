We receive information about you from various sources, including: (i) if you register for an account on the Services, through your user account (your âAccountâ).
(ii) your use of the Services generally.
and (iii) from third party websites and services.
When you use the Services, you are consenting to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.
What Does This Privacy Policy Cover? This Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personally identifiable information (âPersonal Dataâ) gathered when you are using or accessing the Services.
This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any Personal Data that our business partners share with us or that we share with our business partners.

 This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including but not limited to any third party websites, services and applications (each a âThird Party Serviceâ) that you elect to access through the Service or to individuals that we do not manage or employ.
While we attempt to facilitate access only to those Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services.
We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access.
What Information Do We Collect About You? We collect Personal Data about you when you provide such information directly to us, when third parties such as our business partners or service providers provide us with Personal Data about you, or when Personal Data about you is automatically collected in connection with your use of our Services.
The information we gather enables us to improve, understand, and continue to operate the Services.
In connection with certain aspects of the Services, we may request, collect and/or display some of your Personal Data.
Below explains in greater detail the types of information that we collect about our users.
Information You Provide to Us
Account Information:

 If you create an Account, register for a brand or artist channel, or register for a verified user profile, you will provide information that could be Personal Data, such as your email address, username, contact name, password, display name (for artist channel) and art preferences (for Electric Objects).
You may also choose to provide additional Personal Data, including an avatar/profile picture, information about yourself, basic demographic information, a description of your channel, a brand parent company (brand or artist channel), location (brand or artist channel), your RedGIFs Channel URL (for verified user profile), attachments to your application (for verified user profile) and links to your website or social media profiles.

 Additionally, if you register for or access the Services using a Third Party Service (such as your social media account login credentials), we may receive Personal Data that you have made available to share through such Third Party Service, which may include, without limitation, your name.
You may also choose to include your email address.
You acknowledge that this information may be personal to you, and by creating an Account and providing Personal Data to us, you allow others, including us, to identify you and therefore may not be anonymous.
We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services.


User Content:

 Some features of the Services allow you to provide content to the Services, and related Personal Data if you so choose.
User content includes, but are not limited to, GIFs, written comments, links, and pictures.
All content submitted by you to the Services and related data (e.g., technical specifications of a GIF) may be retained by us indefinitely, even after you terminate your Account or your access to the Services is terminated.
We may continue to disclose such content to third parties in a manner that does not reveal Personal Data, as described in this Privacy Policy.
Information From Others As mentioned above, you may be able to register for or access the Services using a Third Party Service, such as your social media account (e.g.
Facebook, Twitter, etc.).
Occasionally, you can also use your Account on our Services to interact with your accounts on these other Third Party Services.
For example, you may be able to access posting and sharing tools on the Services that allow you to post information to your social networks outside of the Services (âShareâ).
By using these tools or Third Party Services, you acknowledge that some information (such as your IP address, language preferences, timestamp and identifiers related to your request) may be transmitted to us, and that such information and content is covered by this Privacy Policy.
Furthermore, if a tool, such as the Share tool, is operated by a Third Party Service, the Third Party Service that operates the tool may collect information about your browser or online activity, which would be subject to the Third Party Serviceâs privacy policy and your account settings selected through that Third Party Service.
When you use these tools, some of your information from the Services may be shared with the Third Party Service and others, including selected GIF.
Therefore, we encourage you to read the privacy policies and other policies of any Third Party Services, including without limitation any applicable social networks, that you use in connection with the Services.
Information Collected Automatically We automatically receive and record information from your web browser or device when you interact with the Services, including when you search for, select, view or receive a GIF, such as your IP address, device ID, user query information and cookie information.
This information is used to enable us to deliver GIFs to you, for fighting spam/malware, to improve the service and also to facilitate collection of data concerning your interaction with the Services (e.g., what links you have clicked on).

 Generally, the Services automatically collect usage information, such as the number and frequency of visitors to the Site and the Services.
We may use this data in aggregate form, for example, as a statistical measure or in other anonymous forms, but not in a manner that would identify you personally.
This type of aggregate data enables us and third parties authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use parts of the Services so that we can analyze and improve them.
Information Collected Using Cookies
 Cookies are pieces of text that may be provided to your computer or device through your web browser when you access a website.
Your browser stores cookies in a manner associated with each website you visit.
We may use cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you visit the Site and otherwise use the Services.

 Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain Personal Data.
However, we may match cookies with your Personal Data to identify you, and we may use cookies to identify that your web browser has accessed aspects of the Services and may associate that information with your Account if you have one.

 We may allow third party web analytics service providers to use cookies or similar technologies to collect information about your use of the Services.
We use Google Analytics, a service provided by Google, Inc.
(âGoogleâ) to help us understand how users use the Services and to enhance your experience when you use the Services.

 Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways.
We strongly recommend that you leave cookies active, because they enable you to take advantage of the most attractive features of the Services.

 This Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties.
We do not control when or how third parties place cookies on your computer or device.
For example, third party websites to which a link points may set cookies on your computer or device.

Aggregate Information We collect statistical information about how both unregistered and registered users, collectively, use the Services (âAggregate Informationâ).
Some of this information is derived from Personal Data.
This statistical information is not Personal Data and cannot be tied back to you, your Account, or your web browser.
How, and With Whom, Is My Information Shared? The Services are designed to help you share information with others.
As a result, some of the information generated through the Services is shared publicly or with Third Party Services.
What information is shared publicly depends on your privacy settings.
Below further describes the ways in which we may share your information.
We do not sell your Personal Data.
Public Information About You and Your Activity on the Services User profile and channel information that you choose to provide, including your username, contact name, GIFs you upload, information about yourself, your avatar/profile picture, a description of your channel, and links to your website or social media profiles, may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Services.
This information will be displayed to other users depending on your privacy settings.
We will not directly reveal user email addresses to other users.

 Some of your activity on and through the Services is public by default.
This may include, but is not limited to, content you have posted publicly on the Site or otherwise through the Services.
For registered users, all content you post publicly (or privately) will be associated with your account.
Unregistered users will not have this association, but information concerning their use of the Services (such as what pages they have visited) may be tracked through the use of cookies and stored by us.

 Please remember that if you choose to provide Personal Data using certain public features of the Services, then that information is governed by the privacy settings of those particular features and may be publicly available.
Individuals reading such information may use or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge, and search engines may index that information.
We therefore urge you to think carefully about including any specific information you may deem private in content that you create or information that you submit through the Services.
Information Shared Through Third Party Services You may access other Third Party Services through the Services, for example by clicking on links to those Third Party Services from within our Services.
We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices of these Third Party Services, and you are responsible for reading and understanding those Third Party Servicesâ privacy policies.
This Privacy Policy only governs information collected on the Services.
Information Shared In Connection with Related Services While we collect and store IP address and device ID information, that information is not made public.
We do at times, however, share this information with our service providers and as otherwise specified in this Privacy Policy.

 We also share Aggregate Information with our partners, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct business.
We share this type of statistical data so that our partners can understand how and how often people use our Services and their services or websites, which facilitates improving both their services and how our Services interface with them.
In addition, these third parties may share with us non-private, aggregated or otherwise non Personal Information about you that they have independently developed or acquired.
Information Shared with Our Service Providers We employ and contract with people and other entities that perform certain tasks on our behalf and who are under our control (our âservice providersâ).
We may need to share Personal Data with our service providers in order to provide products or services to you.
Unless we tell you differently, our service providers do not have any right to use Personal Data or other information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.
You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Data with our service providers.
Information Disclosed Pursuant to a Change in Control or Sale In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets.
In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets.
Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.
You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Data as set forth in this policy.
 Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others  We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect our rights, property or safety, our users and the public.
This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and spam/malware prevention.
