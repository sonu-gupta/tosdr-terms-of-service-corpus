Last updated: February 12, 2020


We value your business and we know privacy is important to you.
Itâs important to us, too.


This Privacy Notice which describes how we collect and use your personal information, what we do with
the information collected, and how you can exercise your privacy rights.


Certain countries and states, such as the European Union and the state of California, have enacted
specific data protection and privacy rules for their residents.
Some of these rules overlap, but some
donât.
In order to make this privacy notice as understandable as possible, we have split our information
into a common notice (where we provide you with information which is generally required), and separate
notices specific to certain jurisdictions.


Please also review our Terms of Service and Data Processing Addendum which describe what we can expect from each
other when you use our products and services.


 Who we are and what we do Backblaze, Inc.
(âBackblazeâ) is a US-headquartered data storage provider that offers two
different services:


Computer Backup, which provides unlimited cloud
backup for individuals and organizations using Macs or PCs (laptops and desktops).
and


B2 Cloud Storage, which provides low-cost cloud
storage for individuals and organizations.



You can contact us as described in the How to contact us paragraph.


Under EU data protection legislation, commonly known as the GDPR, Backblaze is the
controller of processing of personal information described below.
With regard to the
processing of files uploaded to our platform by our users when using our Computer Backup and
B2 Cloud Storage services, however, Backblaze is the processor and the person or
organization owning the Backblaze account is the controller.
We explain more about the
distinction between a controller and a processor under EU data protection legislation here.


 The personal information we collect When you use our services, you upload your files to store with us.
We call this content
your files.


We also collect certain information about you in the course of providing our products.
We
call this your personal information.


Personal information you provide to us
When requesting to use Backblaze's services we may ask you to provide personal information
to us.
For example, when you create a Backblaze account, we will ask you for your email
address and a password.
We may also ask for your phone number for purposes such as
two-factor verification or for sending you service alerts.
If you choose to sign up for one
of Backblaze's services, we will ask you for billing information.
To order a physical item
from us, such as a Restore by Mail, we will ask for shipping details.
At times we may ask

During your interaction with Backblaze, you may choose to provide us with personal
information when you email us, chat with us, answer a survey, comment on our blog, or
communicate with us through social media services like Twitter or Facebook.


If you refer a friend to Backblaze, we will ask you for their email address.
Backblaze will
then contact your referred friend to determine whether your friend consents to us contacting
them.


Personal information that we collect automatically
Our Computer Backup service automatically backs up your files to Backblaze.
B2 Cloud Storage
allows you to upload your files to our service.
While the content of your files may include
personally identifiable information, both in the content of a file and in metadata, this
Privacy Notice, as stated at the outset, only applies to the information collected in
respect of your account and not to the content that you store on our system.

such as the names of external drives, file types transferred, and number, name and size of
files transferred.

provide customer support more effectively, inform you about operating systems we no longer
support as well as ensure the continuous functionality of our products.


Personal information that we collect from third parties We may collect additional information about you from third parties primarily to assist us in
