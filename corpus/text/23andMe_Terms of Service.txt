Although we will make every reasonable effort to ensure your sample kit and
the results are delivered within the estimated timescales, unfortunately we
cannot guarantee that they will not be affected by unforeseen issues affecting
the Services or our delivery partner.
For example, the laboratory may not be
able to process your sample if your saliva does not contain a sufficient
volume of DNA.


Your order will be completed when we make your results available to you.


If you have trouble finding out the status of your order or tracking its
progress, please review our UK customer care area or our EU customer care area.

 Description of the Services 



The Services include access to the 23andMe public Website and personal
genotyping services, including the collection and analysis of your saliva sample.


You acknowledge and agree that the Services are provided using the current
state of the art genetic research and technology available at the time of
providing the Services.


As research progresses and scientific knowledge and technology evolve, 23andMe
is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible experience for
its users.
You therefore acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of
the Services which 23andMe provides may change from time to time.


As part of this continuing innovation, you acknowledge and agree that 23andMe
may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing some Services (or any features
within the Services) to you or to users generally at 23andMe's sole discretion.


You may stop using the Services at any time.
You do not need to specifically
inform 23andMe when you stop using the Services unless you are requesting
closure of your account.


23andMe assumes no responsibility for the use of Services outside the terms
of this TOS or other applicable terms.


In order to use the Services, you must obtain Internet access, either directly
or through devices that access web-based content, and pay any service fees
associated with such access.
You are solely responsible for paying such fees.


You must provide all equipment necessary to make such Internet connection,
including a computer and modem or other access device.
You are solely responsible
for providing such equipment.
You acknowledge and agree that while 23andMe
may not currently have set a fixed upper limit on the number of transmissions
you may send or receive through the Services or on the amount of storage
space used for the provision of any Service, such fixed upper limits may be
set by 23andMe at any time, at 23andMe's discretion.

 Important Issues Regarding 23andMe Services 



Once you obtain your Genetic Information, the knowledge is permanent.
 You should not assume that any information we may be able to provide
to you, whether now or as genetic research advances, will be welcome or positive.
You should also understand that as research advances, in order for you to
assess the meaning of your DNA in the context of such advances, you may need
to obtain further services from 23andMe or from your physician or other health
care provider.


You may learn information about yourself that you do not anticipate.
 This information may evoke strong emotions and has the potential to
alter your life and worldview.
You may discover things about yourself that
trouble you and that you may not have the ability to control or change (e.g.,
your father is not genetically your father, surprising facts related to your
ancestry, or that someone with your genotype may have a higher than average
chance of developing a specific condition or disease).
These outcomes could
have social, legal or economic implications.


The laboratory may not be able to process your sample, and the
laboratory process may result in errors. The laboratory may not be
able to process your sample if your saliva does not contain a sufficient volume
of DNA, you do not provide enough saliva, or the results from processing do
not meet our standards for accuracy.
If the initial processing fails for any
of these reasons, 23andMe will reprocess the same sample at no charge to you.&nbsp.
If the second attempt to process the same sample fails, 23andMe will offer to
send another kit to you to collect a second sample at no charge.
If you send another sample and 23andMe's attempts to process the
second sample are unsuccessful, 23andMe will not send additional sample
collection kits and you or the person who paid for the Service (if that is
not you) will be entitled to a complete refund of the amount paid to 23andMe.


In this event, you will not resubmit another sample through a future purchase
of the service.
If you breach these TOS and resubmit another sample through
a future purchase of the service and processing is not successful, 23andMe
will not offer to reprocess the sample or provide you or the person who paid
for the Service (if that is not you) a refund.


Even for processing that meets our high standards, a small, unknown fraction
of the data generated during the laboratory process may be un-interpretable
or incorrect (referred to as "Errors").&nbsp.
As this possibility is known in advance,
users are not entitled to refunds or entitled to make any other claims where
these Errors occur.


The above sets out our sole responsibility to you in the event that we are
unable to process your sample.


You should not change your health behaviors solely on the basis of
information from 23andMe. Make sure to discuss your Genetic
Information with a physician or other health care provider before you act
upon the Genetic Information resulting from 23andMe Services.
For most common
diseases, the genes we know about are only responsible for a small fraction
of the risk.
There may be unknown genes, environmental factors, or lifestyle
choices that are far more important predictors.


If your data indicates that you are not at elevated genetic risk for a
particular disease or condition, you should not feel that you are protected.
The opposite is also true.
if your data indicates you are at an elevated genetic
risk for a particular disease or condition, it does not mean you will definitively
develop the disease or condition.
In either case, if you have concerns or
questions about what you learn through 23andMe, you should contact your
physician or other health care provider.


Genetic research is not comprehensive. While we measure many
hundreds of thousands of data points from your DNA, only a small percentage
of them are known to be related to human traits or health conditions.
The
research community is rapidly learning more about genetics, and an important
mission of 23andMe is to conduct and contribute to this research.


Please note that many ethnic groups are not included in genetic studies.
Because interpretations provided in the Services rely on these published
studies, some interpretations may not apply to you.


Please further note that future scientific research may change the interpretation
of your DNA and the scientific community may show previous research to be
incomplete or inaccurate.


Genetic Information you share with others could be used against your
interests. You should be careful about sharing your Genetic
Information with others.
Currently, very few businesses or insurance companies
request genetic information, but this could change in the future.


You may want to consult a lawyer to understand the extent of legal protection
of your Genetic Information before you share it with anybody.


Furthermore, Genetic Information that you choose to share with your physician
or other health care provider may become part of your medical record and
through that route be accessible to other health care providers and/or
insurance companies in the future.


You acknowledge that Genetic Information that you share with family, friends
or employers may be used against your interests.
Even if you share Genetic
Information that has no or limited meaning today, that information could have
greater meaning in the future as technology improves and new discoveries are made.


You should be aware that, if you are asked by an insurance company whether
you have learned Genetic Information about health conditions and you do not
disclose this to them, this may be considered to be fraud or a breach of the
policy that you subsequently purchase.


23andMe Services are for research, informational, and educational
use only. We do not provide medical advice.


The Genetic Information provided by 23andMe is for research,
informational, and educational use only. This means two things.
First, many of the genetic discoveries that we report have not been clinically
validated, and the technology we use, which is the same technology used by the
research community, to date has not been widely used for clinical testing.
Second, in order to expand and accelerate the understanding and practical
application of genetic knowledge in health care, we invite all genotyped users
to participate in 23andWe Research.
Participation in such research is voluntary
and based upon an IRB-approved consent document.


As a result of the current state of genetic knowledge and understanding, our
Services are for research, informational, and educational purposes only.
The
Services are not intended to be used by you for any diagnostic purpose and are
not a substitute for professional medical advice.
You should always seek the
advice of your physician or other health care provider with any questions you
may have regarding diagnosis, cure, treatment, mitigation, or prevention of
any disease or other medical condition or impairment or the status of your health.


23andMe does not endorse, promise or guarantee the effectiveness of any
specific course of action, resources, tests, physician or other health care
providers, drugs, biologics, medical devices or other products, procedures,
opinions or other information that may be mentioned on our Website or available
through our Service.


If we provide to you through our Service any information that identify for you,
based on your Genetic and Self-Reported Information and scientific literature
or research, concerns about your health, this information is intended for
informational purposes only and for discussion with your physician or other
healthcare provider.


We believe that:


genetics is only part of the picture of any individual's state of being.


the state of the understanding of Genetic Information is rapidly
evolving and at any given time we only comprehend part of the picture
of the role of genetics.
and


only a trained physician or other health care provider can assess
your current state of health or disease, taking into account many
factors, including in some cases your genetics as well as your current
symptoms, if any.




You should not take any decisions about your health or life based on the
information you receive through the Service and, if you do, you do so entirely
at your own risk.


We are licensed in California as a clinical laboratory and do not require a
license to provide our Services in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Denmark,
Finland, the Netherlands, and Sweden.

 Your Promises 


By accessing 23andMe Services, you agree to, acknowledge, and promise as
follows:


You understand that information you learn from 23andMe is not designed
to diagnose, prevent, or treat any condition or disease or to ascertain
the state of your health in the absence of medical and clinical information.


You understand that the 23andMe Services are intended for research,
informational, and educational purposes only, and that while 23andMe
information may identify possible diagnosis or treatments, you should
not take any decisions about your health based on the information you
receive through the Service and you are strongly advised to seek the
advice of your doctor or other health care provider if you have questions
or concerns arising from your Genetic Information.


You give permission to 23andMe, its contractors, successors and
assignees to perform genotyping services on the DNA extracted from
your saliva sample and you specifically request 23andMe to disclose
the results of analyses performed on your DNA to you and to others
you specifically authorize.


You promise that you are at least eighteen (18) years of age if you
are providing a saliva sample or accessing your Genetic Information.


You are promising that any sample you provide is your saliva.
if you
are agreeing to these TOS on behalf of a person for whom you have
legal responsibility, you are confirming that the sample provided will
be the sample of that person.


You agree that any saliva sample you provide and all resulting data
may be transferred and/or processed outside the country in which you
reside.


You are promising that you are not an insurance company or an employer
attempting to obtain information about an insured person or an employee.


You are aware that some of the information you receive may provoke
strong emotion.


You take responsibility for all possible consequences resulting from
your sharing with others access to your Genetic Information and your
Self-Reported Information.


You understand that all your Personal Information will be stored in 23andMe databases
and will be processed in accordance with the 23andMe
Privacy Statement.




You understand that by providing any sample, having your Genetic Information
processed, accessing your Genetic Information, or providing Self-Reported
Information, you acquire no rights in any research or commercial products that
may be developed by 23andMe or its collaborating partners.
You specifically
understand that you will not receive compensation for any research or commercial
products that include or result from your Genetic Information or Self-Reported
Information.


You agree that you have the authority, under the laws of the country
in which you reside, to provide these promises.
In case of breach of any
one of these promises 23andMe may suspend or terminate your account and
refuse any and all current or future use of the Services (or any portion thereof)
and you will reimburse 23andMe and its affiliates against any liability, costs,
or damages suffered by 23andMe and its affiliates arising out of the breach of
the promises.

 Account Creation, Customer Account, Password and Security Obligations 


You agree to:


provide true, accurate, current, and complete Registration Information
about yourself as prompted by the Service.
and


maintain and promptly update the Registration Information to keep it
true, accurate, current, and complete.




If you provide any Registration Information that is untrue, inaccurate, not
current, or incomplete, or if 23andMe has a reasonable ground to suspect that
such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, 23andMe
may suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future
use of the Service (or any portion of it).


After you have purchased our Service, you will need to create a password and
account designation to access the Service.


You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password and
account, and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your
password or account.
If you allow third parties to access the Service through
your username and password, you will reimburse 23andMe and its affiliates
against any liability, costs, or damages, including attorney fees, arising
out of claims or suits by such third parties based upon or relating to such
access and use.


You agree to:


immediately notify 23andMe of any unauthorized use of your password
or account or any other breach of security.
and


ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session.




23andMe cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from
your failure to comply with this Section.
