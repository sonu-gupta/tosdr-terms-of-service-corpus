Privacy Statement Our Privacy Statement describes our use and protection of nonpublic personal information ("customer information") and will help you understand how we treat the customer information that we obtain from you or other sources in the course of providing you with products and services.
We urge you to read our Privacy Statement. Secure Areas.
Passwords Some portions of Mercury Sites are restricted and require authorization for access.
Unauthorized use of or access to these areas is prohibited.
Actual or attempted unauthorized use of or access to such areas may result in criminal and/or civil prosecution.
Attempts to access such areas without authorization may be viewed, monitored and recorded and any information obtained may be given to law enforcement organizations in connection with any investigation or prosecution of possible criminal activity on this system.
If you are not an authorized user of such areas or do not consent to continued monitoring, you should not attempt to access such areas.
If you are an authorized user of any restricted area, you are responsible to maintain the security/confidentiality of your password.
DO NOT SHARE YOUR PASSWORD WITH ANYONE.
Mercury is entitled to act on instructions received under your password.
Mercury will not ask you for your password.
If you know or suspect that your password has been compromised, change your password immediately.
If you suspect any unauthorized activity related to your account, you should contact Mercury.
Mercury will not be responsible or liable for any unauthorized access to your personal information that is not the direct result of intentional conduct on the part of Mercury, or if you do not properly secure your password, or if you choose to share your password with anyone else.
Mercury may block access to secure areas without prior notice if Mercury believes your password is being used by someone other than you or if any unauthorized access to your personal information has occurred, or may occur, or for other reasons. Electronic Signatures When you have accessed a secure area of the Site or other Mercury Sites, you may be able to make changes to your account or authorize Mercury to take certain actions regarding your account.
For example, you may make a payment online, or make changes to your policy on the Customer Portal after authenticating your identity with your username and password.
Authorizing such transactions will require you to click or select "I agree", "yes" or other clear affirmation of your agreement.
By authorizing a transaction in this manner, you agree that your selection is your electronic signature, and the electronic record of this authorization is a signed writing, the legal equivalent of your signature on paper. Quotations/Coverage At this time, on-line quotes may not be available for all states or provinces, products, services or coverage selections.
For additional information about products, services or coverage selections otherwise offered by Mercury, please contact a Mercury agent.
All quotes generated by this Site or other Mercury Sites are estimates based upon the information provided by you, and are not a contract, binder, or agreement to extend insurance coverage, unless clearly identified as such after submission of a complete application for insurance and payment of the required premium.
Mercury reserves the right to issue a quote based upon the information you enter.
You may not qualify for every Mercury company.
The rate quoted to you may vary from Mercury's lowest rate depending upon the company for which you do qualify, and upon other factors.
Each quote shall identify the Mercury company from which the quote was generated.
Any coverage descriptions provided on Mercury Sites are general descriptions of available coverages and are not a statement of contract until a binder has been issued by Mercury.
To obtain coverage you must submit an application to Mercury.
All applications are subject to underwriting approval.
Coverages and availability may vary by state, and additional minimum coverage limits may be available in your state.
For additional information, please contact a Mercury agent or your insurance broker. Electronic Document Delivery You may elect to receive electronic delivery of documents from Mercury rather than receiving paper copies by regular mail.
This option may not be available in all states and for all lines of business.
If available, you may select electronic or âpaperlessâ delivery when you apply for a new policy, or on the Customer Portal at any time.
You may also contact your agent, or contact Mercury at (800) 900-6729.
If you do elect electronic delivery, you agree to the following:

You must maintain a valid email address for delivery purposes and notify us promptly of any changes.
You may update or change your email address on the Customer Portal or by contacting your agent.
You are responsible for removing spam blockers and otherwise adjusting your settings to ensure delivery of our emails.
you should check your junk folder periodically to make sure you are receiving them.
Mercury will send you an email notification when a document is available for viewing.
You may then view the document on the Customer Portal by using your password.
To view the document you will need Adobe ReaderÂ® software, which is available for free download if you do not already have it on your computer.
Once we make a document accessible to you on the Customer Portal, and notify you by email that it is available, the document will be deemed delivered to you.
Depending on the paperless option selected by you, we will use electronic delivery for any documents that need to be provided to you, including legal notices, policy documents, billing statements and notices, and general correspondence.
Due to legal requirements in some states, we may send certain documents to you by U.S.
Mail, such as notices of cancellation or non-renewal.
We may also send documents by U.S.
Mail if we are unable to deliver them electronically for technical reasons.
If we become aware that your email address is no longer valid, we may send all documents by regular U.S.
Mail until you have provided us with a current and valid email address.
Some of the documents delivered to you may state the âdate mailed.â For paperless delivery, the âdate mailedâ means the date that we notified you by email that the document was available for viewing on the Customer Portal.
The electronic document delivery option is voluntary.
You may terminate electronic delivery at any time on the Customer Portal, by contacting your agent, or by calling Mercury at (800) 900-6729.
(Please allow up to 24 hours to process your requested change.) You may also request a paper copy of any policy document by contacting your agent.
