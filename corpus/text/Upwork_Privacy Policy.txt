Upwork provides such information solely for the convenience of Users.You acknowledge and agree that User feedback benefits the marketplace, all Users, and the efficiency of the Site and you specifically request that Upwork post composite or compiled feedback about Users, including yourself, on User Profiles and elsewhere on the Site.
You acknowledge and agree that feedback results for you, including your Job Success Score, wherever referenced, and other User Content highlighted by Upwork on the Site or otherwise (âComposite Informationâ), if any, may include User comments, User ratings, indicators of User satisfaction, and other feedback left exclusively by other Users.

CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CLIENT AND FREELANCER
Section 3 discusses the relationship you may decide to enter into with another User, including Service Contracts between Users, as detailed below.
3.1 SERVICE CONTRACTSIf a Client and Freelancer decide to enter into a Service Contract, the Service Contract is a contractual relationship directly between the Client and Freelancer.
Client and Freelancer have complete discretion both with regard to whether to enter into a Service Contract with each other and with regard to the terms of any Service Contract.
You acknowledge, agree, and understand that Upwork is not a party to any Service Contract, that the formation of a Service Contract between Users will not, under any circumstance, create an employment or other service relationship between Upwork and any User or a partnership or joint venture between Upwork and any User.With respect to any Service Contract, Clients and Freelancers may enter into any written agreements that they deem appropriate (e.g., confidentiality agreements, invention assignment agreements, assignment of rights, etc.) provided that any such agreements do not conflict with, narrow, or expand Upworkâs rights and obligations under the Terms of Service, including this Agreement and the applicable Escrow Instructions.
The parties to a Service Contract can, if the parties prefer, agree to the Optional Service Contract Terms in whole or in part, in addition to or instead of other such agreements.
Only to the extent that they have not entered into another agreement or terms with respect to a Service Contract, the parties to a Service Contract agree that the Optional Service Contract Terms apply to their Service Contract.The Optional Service Contract Terms are provided as a sample only and may not be appropriate for all jurisdictions or all contracts.
Users are responsible for complying with any local requirements, including applicable laws, rules, and regulations.
Upwork does not assume any responsibility for any consequence of using the Optional Service Contract Terms.
The Optional Service Contract Terms are not intended to and do not (a) constitute legal advice, (b) create an attorney-client relationship, or (c) constitute advertising or a solicitation of any type.
Each situation is highly fact-specific and requirements vary by situation and jurisdiction and therefore any party should seek legal advice from a licensed attorney in the relevant jurisdictions.
Upwork expressly disclaims any and all liability with respect to actions or omissions based on the Optional Service Contract Terms.Please refer to the Upwork Payroll Agreement for Service Contracts using Upwork Payroll.3.2 DISPUTES AMONG USERSFor disputes arising between Clients and Freelancers, you agree to abide by the dispute process that is explained in the Escrow Instructions that apply to your particular Service Contract.
If the dispute process does not resolve your dispute, you may pursue your dispute independently, but you acknowledge and agree that Upwork will not and is not obligated to provide any dispute assistance beyond what is provided in the Escrow Instructions.If Freelancer or Client intends to obtain an order from any arbitrator or any court that might direct Upwork, Upwork Escrow, or our Affiliates to take or refrain from taking any action with respect to an Escrow Account, that party will (a) give us at least five business daysâ prior notice of the hearing.
(b) include in any such order a provision that, as a precondition to obligation affecting Upwork or Upwork Escrow, we be paid in full for any amounts to which we would otherwise be entitled.
and (c) be paid for the reasonable value of the services to be rendered pursuant to such order.3.3 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATIONUsers may agree to any terms they deem appropriate with respect to confidentiality, including those set forth in the Optional Service Contract Terms.
If and to the extent that the Users do not articulate any different agreement with regard to confidentiality, then they agree that this Section 3.3 (Confidential Information) applies.To the extent a User provides Confidential Information to the other, the recipient will protect the secrecy of the discloserâs Confidential Information with the same degree of care as it uses to protect its own Confidential Information, but in no event with less than due care.
On a Userâs written request, the party that received Confidential Information will promptly destroy or return the disclosing partyâs Confidential Information and any copies thereof contained in or on its premises, systems, or any other equipment otherwise under its control.4.
WORKER CLASSIFICATION AND UPWORK PAYROLL


Section 4 discusses what you agree to concerning whether a Freelancer is an employee or independent contractor and when you agree to use Upwork Payroll, as detailed below.

Client is solely responsible for and assumes all liability for determining whether Freelancers should be engaged as independent contractors or employees of Client and engaging them accordingly.
Client warrants its decisions regarding classification are correct and its manner of engaging Freelancers complies with applicable laws, regulations, and rules.
Upwork will have no input into, or involvement in, worker classification as between Client and Freelancer and Users agree that Upwork has no involvement in and will have no liability arising from or relating to the classification of a Freelancer generally or with regard to a particular Project.4.2 UPWORK PAYROLL SERVICESClient agrees to enroll in Upwork Payroll if it will receive services from a Freelancer under terms and conditions that would give rise to an employment relationship (unless Client elects instead to pay the Conversion Fee (see Section 7)).
When the Client enrolls in Upwork Payroll, Client will engage Upworkâs third-party staffing vendor (the âStaffing Providerâ), which is an Agency on Upwork, through the Site.
The Staffing Provider will hire Freelancer at the request of Client and Freelancer according to the terms described on the Site and otherwise agreed to by the Staffing Provider and Client and/or Freelancer, and subject to the Upwork Payroll Agreement.
For all purposes with Upwork Payroll, the employer of Freelancer will be the Staffing Provider and not Upwork under any circumstances.Freelancer, acknowledges, understands, and agrees that Upwork will have no control over, or involvement in determining or influencing, the terms and conditions of any employment relationship that may arise between Freelancer and Staffing Provider or Client, including the selection of an employee, pay rate, work hours, employment dates and working conditions.
Freelancer will not have any contract on the Site or contact with Upwork regarding such employment terms.

UPWORK FEES
Section 5 describes what fees you agree to pay to Upwork in exchange for Upwork providing the Site and Site Services to you and what taxes Upwork may collect, as detailed below.
5.1 FEES FOR FREELANCERS
Service Fees. Freelancers will pay Upwork a service fee for the use of the Site Services as set forth in the Fee and ACH Authorization Agreement and the Direct Contract Terms, for using the Site Services, including the communication, invoicing, reporting, dispute resolution and payment services, including facilitating arbitration services and Hourly Payment Protection, as described in the applicable Escrow Instructions (the âService Feesâ).
The Service Fees (to use the Site Services) are paid solely by Freelancer.
When a Client pays a Freelancer for a Project or when funds related to a Project are otherwise released to a Freelancer as required by the applicable Escrow Instructions (See Section 6.1), Upwork Escrow will credit the Freelancer Escrow Account for the full amount paid or released by the Client, and then subtract and disburse to Upwork the Service Fee.
Freelancer hereby irrevocably authorizes and instructs Upwork Escrow to deduct the Service Fee from the Freelancer Escrow Account and pay Upwork on Freelancerâs behalf.
In the event the Freelancer chooses to withdraw funds in a currency other than U.S.
dollars, there may also be a foreign currency conversion charge imposed by Upwork Escrow or an affiliate and the rate may differ from rates that are in effect on the date of the payment and you may be able to obtain a better rate from your bank or financial institution.
Membership Fees and Connects.
Freelancers may subscribe to different levels of participation and privileges on the Site to access additional features and Site Service, by payment of subscription membership fees and by purchasing "Connects" as described in and subject to the terms of the Freelancer Membership Agreement.Disbursement Fees.
Freelancers will pay Upwork a disbursement fee for remitting payments to their preferred payment method (âDisbursement Feeâ).
The Disbursement Fee is paid to Upwork in consideration of costs incurred and administration of disbursements via the disbursement method requested by Freelancer and varies by disbursement method.
The Disbursement Fee for each disbursement method is listed under Fees and Schedules on the Site as revised from time to time.In addition to fees charged by Upwork, your disbursement method may also charge activation, maintenance, or other account fees.5.2 CLIENT FEESClients pay Upwork a fee for payment processing and administration related to the Freelancer Fees they pay to Freelancers they engage through the Site, as described in the Fee and ACH Authorization Agreement.
Clients may also choose to pay for a premium membership plan to access additional features and Site Services, as described in the Fee and ACH Authorization Agreement.
Clients do not pay fees if they use the Site solely for Direct Contracts.5.3 VAT AND OTHER TAXESUpwork may be required by applicable law to collect taxes or levies including, without limitation, withholding income tax or VAT (while some countries may refer to VAT using other terms, e.g.
GST, weâll just refer to VAT, GST and any local sales taxes collectively as âVATâ) in the jurisdiction of the Freelancer (the "Taxes").
In such instances, any amounts Upwork is required to collect or withhold for the payment of any such Taxes shall be collected in addition to the fees owed to Upwork under the Terms of Service.5.4 NO FEE FOR INTRODUCING OR FOR FINDING PROJECTS

Upwork does not introduce Clients to Freelancers and does not help Freelancers secure Projects.
Upwork merely makes the Site and Site Services available to enable Freelancers to do so themselves and may from time to time highlight Projects that may be of interest.
Therefore, Upwork does not charge a fee when a Freelancer finds a suitable Client or finds a Project.
In addition, Upwork does not charge any fee or dues for posting public feedback and composite or compiled feedback, including Composite Information.6.

We will be under no duty to inquire about or investigate any agreement or communication between Client and Freelancer, even if posted to the Site.
We have the right to rely upon, and will not be liable for acting or refraining from acting upon, any written notice, instruction, or request furnished to us by Client or Freelancer in accordance with this Agreement or the applicable Escrow Instructions, if we reasonably believe that such notice, instruction, or request is genuine and that it is signed or presented by the proper party or parties.

Hourly Contracts.
 Freelancer will invoice Client for Freelancer Fees on a weekly basis through Upwork, and Client will pay invoices consistent with the Hourly Escrow Instructions.

6.3 DISBURSEMENTS TO FREELANCERS ON SERVICE CONTRACTSUnder the relevant Escrow Instructions, Upwork Escrow disburses funds that are available in the applicable Freelancer Escrow Account and payable to a Freelancer upon Freelancerâs request.
A Freelancer can request disbursement of available funds any time on a one-time basis or by setting up an automatic disbursement schedule.
If Freelancer does not request a disbursement, Upwork will automatically disburse available funds no more than 90 days after the Freelancer Fees are released to the Freelancer Escrow Account, unless the amount in the Escrow Account is less than the Minimum Threshold.
For purposes of the Terms of Service, a âMinimum Thresholdâ is either (a) $100 for Freelancers within the United States, or (b) $1,000 for Freelancers outside the United States.
When the funds in the Freelancer Escrow Account are below the Minimum Threshold, the automatic disbursement schedule is paused and the available and payable funds are released on the earlier of: (i) Freelancerâs request.
(ii) on the first scheduled automatic disbursement occurring after the amount exceeds the Minimum Threshold.
or (iii) 180 days after the funds are available in the Freelancer Escrow Account.Hourly Contracts. Freelancer Fees become available to Freelancers following the expiration of the dispute period and the five-day security period.
Fixed-Price Contracts. Freelancer Fees become available to Freelancers following the expiration of the five-day security period after the funds are released as provided in the applicable Escrow Instructions.
The security period begins after Client accepts and approves work submitted by Freelancer.Notwithstanding any other provision of the Terms of Service or the Escrow Instructions, Upwork Escrow, in its sole discretion and except as prohibited by applicable law, may refuse to process, may hold the disbursement of the Freelancer Fees or any other amounts and offset amounts owed to us, or take such other actions with respect to the Escrow Account as we deem appropriate in our sole discretion if: (a) we require additional information, such as Freelancerâs tax information, government-issued identification or other proof of identity, address, or date of birth.
(b) we have reason to believe the Freelancer Fees may be subject to dispute or chargeback.
(c) we suspect a User has committed or attempted to commit fraud or other illicit acts on or through the Site.
(d) we believe there are reasonable grounds for insecurity with respect to the performance of obligations under this Agreement or other Terms of Service.
or (e) we deem it necessary in connection with any investigation or required by applicable law.
If, after investigation, we determine that the hold on the disbursement of the Freelancer Fees is no longer necessary, Upwork Escrow will release such hold as soon as practicable.In addition, notwithstanding any other provision of the Terms of Service or the Escrow Instructions and to the extent permitted by applicable law, we reserve the right to seek reimbursement from you, and you will reimburse us, if we: (i) suspect fraud or criminal activity associated with your payment, withdrawal, or Project.
(ii) discover erroneous or duplicate transactions.
or (iii) have supplied our services in accordance with this Agreement yet we receive any chargeback from the Payment Method used by you, or used by your Client if you are a Freelancer, despite our provision of the Site Services in accordance with this Agreement.

If we are unable to obtain such reimbursement, we may, in addition to any other remedies available under applicable law, temporarily or permanently revoke your access to the Site and Site Services and close your Account.6.4 NON-PAYMENTIf Client is in âdefaultâ, meaning the Client fails to pay the Freelancer Fees or any other amounts when due under the Terms of Service, or a written agreement for payment terms incorporating the Terms of Service (signed by an authorized representative of Upwork), Upwork will be entitled to the remedies described in this Section 6.4 in addition to such other remedies that may be available under applicable law or in such written agreement.
For the avoidance of doubt, Client will be deemed to be in default on the earliest occurrence of any of the following: (a) Client fails to pay the Freelancer Fees when due.
(b) Client fails to pay a balance that is due or to bring, within a reasonable period of time but no more than 30 days after accrual of the charge, an account current after a credit or debit card is declined or expires.

For the avoidance of doubt, if you, or the business you represent, did not identify and were not identified by another person through the Site, such as if you and another User worked together before meeting on the Site, then the Non-Circumvention Period does not apply.
If you use the Site as an employee, agent, or representative of another business, then the Non-Circumvention Period applies to you and other employees, agents, or representatives of the business or its successor when acting in that capacity with respect to the other User.By way of illustration and not in limitation of the foregoing, you agree not to:â¢ Offer or solicit or accept any offer or solicitation from parties identified through the Site to contract, hire, invoice, pay, or receive payment in any manner other than through the Site.â¢ Invoice or report on the Site or in a Conversion Fee request an invoice or payment amount lower than that actually agreed, made, or received between Users.â¢ Refer a User you identified on the Site to a third-party who is not a User of the Site for purposes of making or receiving payments other than through the Site.You agree to notify Upwork immediately if a person suggests to you making or receiving payments other than through the Site in violation of this Section 7 or if you receive unsolicited contact outside of the Site.

For the avoidance of doubt, information is a Means of Direct Contact if it would enable another user to identify any of the information above through other sources, such as going to a website that included an email address or identifying you on social media, such as through Facebook or LinkedIn.You acknowledge and agree that a violation of any provision of this Section 7.2 is a material breach of the Terms of Service.
Your Account may be permanently suspended if you violate this Section 7.2.7.3 OPTING OUT You may opt out of the obligations in Section 7.1 with respect to each Upwork Relationship only if the Client or Freelancer pays Upwork a Conversion Fee which is a minimum of $1,000 USD and up to $50,000 USD for each Upwork Relationship.You agree that the Conversion Fee is 12% of the estimated earnings over a twelve (12) month period, which is calculated by taking the Hourly Rate (defined below) and multiplying it by 2,080.

AGREEMENT TERM AND TERMINATION
Section 13 discusses your and Upworkâs agreement about when and how long this Agreement will last, when and how either you or Upwork can end this Agreement, and what happens if either of us ends the Agreement, as detailed below.
13.1 TERMINATION

Unless both you and Upwork expressly agree otherwise in writing, either of us may terminate this Agreement in our sole discretion, at any time, without explanation, upon written notice to the other, which will result in the termination of the other Terms of Service as well, except as otherwise provided herein.
You may provide written notice to legalnotices@upwork.com.
In the event you properly terminate this Agreement, your right to use the Site and Site Services is automatically revoked, and your Account will be closed.
Upwork is not a party to any Service Contract between Users.
Consequently, User understands and acknowledges that termination of this Agreement (or attempt to terminate this Agreement) does not terminate or otherwise impact any Service Contract or Project entered into between Users.
If you attempt to terminate this Agreement while having one or more open Projects, you agree (a) you hereby instruct Upwork to close any open contracts.
(b) you will continue to be bound by this Agreement and the other Terms of Service until all such Projects have closed on the Site.
(c) Upwork will continue to perform those Site Services necessary to complete any open Project or related transaction between you and another User.
and (d) you will continue to be obligated to pay any amounts accrued but unpaid as of the date of termination or as of the closure of any open Service Contracts, whichever is later, to Upwork for any Site Services or such other amounts owed under the Terms of Service and to any Freelancers for any Freelancer Services.Without limiting Upworkâs other rights or remedies, we may, but are not obligated to, temporarily or indefinitely revoke or limit access to the Site or Site Services, deny your registration, or permanently revoke your access to the Site and refuse to provide any or all Site Services to you if: (i) you breach the letter or spirit of any terms and conditions of this Agreement or any other provisions of the Terms of Service.
(ii) we suspect or become aware that you have provided false or misleading information to us.
or (iii) we believe, in our sole discretion, that your actions may cause legal liability for you, our Users, or Upwork or our Affiliates.
may be contrary to the interests of the Site or the User community.
or may involve illicit or illegal activity.
If your Account is temporarily or permanently closed, you may not use the Site under the same Account or a different Account or reregister under a new Account without Upworkâs prior written consent.
If you attempt to use the Site under a different Account, we reserve the right to reclaim available funds in that Account and/or use an available Payment Method to pay for any amounts owed by you to the extent permitted by applicable law.You acknowledge and agree that the value, reputation, and goodwill of the Site depend on transparency of Userâs Account status to all Users, including both yourself and other Users who have entered into Service Contracts with you.
You therefore agree as follows: IF UPWORK DECIDES TO TEMPORARILY OR PERMANENTLY CLOSE YOUR ACCOUNT, UPWORK HAS THE RIGHT WHERE ALLOWED BY LAW BUT NOT THE OBLIGATION TO: (A) NOTIFY OTHER USERS THAT HAVE ENTERED INTO SERVICE CONTRACTS WITH YOU TO INFORM THEM OF YOUR CLOSED ACCOUNT STATUS, (B) PROVIDE THOSE USERS WITH A SUMMARY OF THE REASONS FOR YOUR ACCOUNT CLOSURE.
YOU AGREE THAT UPWORK WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO ANY NOTICE THAT IT MAY PROVIDE TO ANY USER REGARDING CLOSED ACCOUNT STATUS OR THE REASON(S) FOR THE CLOSURE.
13.2 ACCOUNT DATA ON CLOSUREExcept as otherwise required by law, if your Account is closed for any reason, you will no longer have access to data, messages, files, or other material you keep on the Site and any closure of your Account may involve deletion of any content stored in your Account for which Upwork will have no liability whatsoever.
Upwork, in its sole discretion and as permitted or required by law, may retain some or all of your Account information.13.3 SURVIVALAfter this Agreement terminates, the terms of this Agreement and the other Terms of Service that expressly or by their nature contemplate performance after this Agreement terminates or expires will survive and continue in full force and effect.
For example, the provisions requiring arbitration, permitting audits, protecting intellectual property, requiring non-circumvention, indemnification, payment of fees, reimbursement and setting forth limitations of liability each, by their nature, contemplate performance or observance after this Agreement terminates.
Without limiting any other provisions of the Terms of Service, the termination of this Agreement for any reason will not release you or Upwork from any obligations incurred prior to termination of this Agreement or that thereafter may accrue in respect of any act or omission prior to such termination.14.
DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND UPWORK
Section 14 discusses your agreement with Upwork and our agreement with you about how we will resolve any disputes, including that we will both first try to resolve any dispute informally and, if you are in the United States, that we both agree to use arbitration instead of going to court or using a jury if we canât resolve the dispute informally, as detailed below.
14.1 DISPUTE PROCESS, ARBITRATION, AND SCOPEIf a dispute arises between you and Upwork or our Affiliates, our goal is to resolve the dispute quickly and cost-effectively.
Accordingly, unless you opt out as provided in Section 14.4.4 below, you, Upwork, and our Affiliates agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy that arises out of or relates to this Agreement, the other Terms of Service, your relationship with Upwork (including without limitation any claimed employment with Upwork or one of our Affiliates or successors), the termination of your relationship with Upwork, or the Site Services (each, a âClaimâ) in accordance with this Section 14 (sometimes referred to as the âArbitration Provisionâ).Claims covered by this Arbitration Provision include, but are not limited to, all claims, disputes, or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Site, Site Services, the Terms of Service, any Service Contract, escrow payments or agreements, any payments or monies you claim are due to you from Upwork or our Affiliates or successors, trade secrets, unfair competition, false advertising, consumer protection, privacy, compensation, classification, minimum wage, seating, expense reimbursement, overtime, breaks and rest periods, termination, discrimination, retaliation or harassment and claims arising under the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, Civil Rights Act of 1964, Rehabilitation Act, Civil Rights Acts of 1866 and 1871, Civil Rights Act of 1991, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, Americans With Disabilities Act, Age Discrimination in Employment Act, Family Medical Leave Act, Fair Labor Standards Act, Employee Retirement Income Security Act (except for claims for employee benefits under any benefit plan sponsored by the Company and (a) covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or (b) funded by insurance), Affordable Care Act, Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act, Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, Older Workers Benefits Protection Act of 1990, Occupational Safety and Health Act, Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, False Claims Act, state statutes or regulations addressing the same or similar subject matters, and all other federal or state legal claims arising out of or relating to your relationship with Upwork or the termination of that relationship.Disputes between the parties that may not be subject to predispute arbitration agreement as provided by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Public Law 111-203) or as provided by an Act of Congress or lawful, enforceable Executive Order, are excluded from the coverage of this Agreement.14.2 CHOICE OF LAWThe Site Terms of Use, the other Terms of Service, and any Claim will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of law provisions and excluding the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG).

However, notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, this Arbitration Provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C.

Both you and Upwork will have 60 days from the date of the receipt of the Notice to informally resolve the other partyâs Claim, which, if successful, will avoid the need for further action.14.4 BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER (DOES NOT APPLY TO USERS LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND ITS TERRITORIES)This Arbitration Provision applies to all Users except Users located outside of the United States and its territories.In the unlikely event the parties are unable to resolve a Claim within 60 days of the receipt of the applicable Notice, you, Upwork, and our Affiliates agree to resolve the Claim by final and binding arbitration before an arbitrator from JAMS, instead of a court or jury.

The arbitrator must follow applicable law and may award only those remedies that would have applied had the matter been heard in court.
Judgment may be entered on the arbitratorâs decision in any court having jurisdiction.This Arbitration Provision does not apply to litigation between Upwork and you that is or was already pending in a state or federal court or arbitration before the expiration of the opt-out period set forth in Section 14.4.4, below.

Upwork will not retaliate against you for filing a claim with an administrative agency or for exercising rights (individually or in concert with others) under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act.14.4.2.
INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISIONThis Arbitration Provision is the full and complete agreement relating to the formal resolution of Claims.
Except as otherwise provided in this Arbitration Provision, this Arbitration Provision covers, and the arbitrator shall have exclusive jurisdiction to decide, all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, enforcement, or application of this Arbitration Provision, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Provision or any portion of the Arbitration Provision.
All such matters shall be decided by an arbitrator and not by a court.
The parties expressly agree that the arbitrator and not a court will decide any question of whether the parties agreed to arbitrate, including but not limited to any claim that all or part of this Arbitration Provision, this Agreement, or any other part of the Terms of Service is void or voidable.In the event any portion of this Arbitration Provision is deemed unenforceable, the remainder of this Arbitration Provision will be enforceable.

However, this Arbitration Provision affects your ability to participate in class or collective actions.
Both you and Upwork agree to bring any dispute in arbitration on an individual basis only, and not on a class or collective basis on behalf of others.
There will be no right or authority for any dispute to be brought, heard or arbitrated as a class or collective action, or as a member in any such class or collective proceeding (âClass Action Waiverâ).
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the JAMS rules, disputes regarding the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity or breach of the Class Action Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.
In any case in which (1) the dispute is filed as a class or collective action and (2) there is a final judicial determination that all or part of the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, the class or collective action to that extent must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the portion of the Class Action Waiver that is enforceable shall be enforced in arbitration.
You and Upwork agree that you will not be retaliated against, disciplined or threatened with discipline as a result of your filing or participating in a class or collective action in any forum.
However, Upwork may lawfully seek enforcement of this Arbitration Provision and the Class Action Waiver under the Federal Arbitration Act and seek dismissal of such class or collective actions or claims.

MAKING OR RECEIVING AN HOURLY PAYMENT
2.1 WEEKLY HOURLY INVOICESFor Hourly Contracts, the weekly billing cycle starts Monday at 00:00 midnight UTC and ends Sunday at 23:59 UTC.
Invoices for hours recorded on Upwork in the Work Diary are generated each Monday following the week in which the hours were billed (the "Hourly Invoice Deadline").
Freelancer irrevocably authorizes and instructs Upwork, as its agent, to (i) create an invoice on behalf of Freelancer for payment due based upon the hours that the freelancer recorded in the Work Diary before the Hourly Invoice Deadline (such invoice, the "Hourly Invoice").
and (ii) submit the Hourly Invoice on behalf of Freelancer to Freelancer's Client for payment.
For the avoidance of doubt, the âWork Diaryâ is the section Upwork where hours can be recorded on an Hourly Contract.By recording time in the Work Diary and allowing an Hourly Invoice to be created based on the time recorded, Freelancer represents and warrants that (y) Freelancer has completed the applicable Freelancer Services fully and satisfactorily.
and (z) the hours Freelancer reports are true, accurate, and complete.
2.2 HOURLY INVOICE REVIEWClient must review and approve or dispute the Hourly Invoice by 11:59 PM UTC of the Friday following submission of the Hourly Invoice.
Payments will be held in escrow during the Dispute Period (defined below), providing four additional days to review and dispute the invoice before funds are released.
During the Dispute Period, Client may initiate a Dispute as to some or all of the time invoiced on the Hourly Invoice.On the Friday of the week following submission of the Hourly Invoice, Client will be deemed to have approved all undisputed amounts on the Hourly Invoice, and irrevocably instructed Upworkâs Affiliate, Upwork Escrow Inc.
(âUpwork Escrowâ), to release escrow funds as described in this Agreement.Notwithstanding the foregoing, all hours recorded and submitted by Payroll Employee on the Upwork website will be deemed approved by Client automatically, and Client authorizes and irrevocably instructs Upwork Escrow to release payments for those hours to be paid to the Staffing Provider by Client's account each Monday following the week in which the hours were worked.
Client may not reject time or file a Dispute for Payroll Employee time worked.3.
MAKING OR RECEIVING A BONUS OR EXPENSE PAYMENTClient may also make a bonus, tip, expense, or other miscellaneous payment to Freelancer using the Site.
To make such a payment to a Freelancer, Client must follow the instructions and links on the Site and provide the information requested.
If Client clicks to pay such a payment to Freelancer, Client irrevocably instructs Upwork Escrow to and Upwork Escrow will release escrow funds as described in this Agreement.4.
INSTRUCTIONS TO PAY IRREVOCABLEClientâs instruction to Upwork Escrow and its wholly owned subsidiaries to pay a Freelancer is irrevocable.
Such instruction is Clientâs authorization to transfer funds to Freelancer from the Client Escrow Account or authorization to charge Clientâs Payment Method.
Such instruction is also Clientâs representation that Client has received, inspected, and accepted the subject work or expense.
Client acknowledges and agrees that upon receipt of Clientâs instruction to pay Freelancer, Upwork Escrow will transfer funds to the Freelancer and that Upwork, Upwork Escrow, and other Affiliates have no responsibility to and may not be able to recover such funds.
Therefore, and in consideration of services described in this Agreement, Client agrees that once Upwork Escrow or its subsidiary has charged Clientâs Payment Method, the charge is non-refundable.5.
RELEASE AND DELIVERY OF AMOUNTS IN ESCROWIn addition, Upwork Escrow is authorized to and will release applicable portions of the Client Escrow Account (each portion, a âReleaseâ) to the Freelancer Escrow Account, upon the occurrence of and in accordance with one or more Release Conditions provided below or as otherwise required by applicable law or the Terms of Service.
The amount of the Release will be delivered to the Freelancer Escrow Account, in accordance with Freelancerâs and Clientâs instructions, as applicable, these Escrow Instructions, and the other Terms of Service.5.1 RELEASE CONDITIONSAs used in these Escrow Instructions, âRelease Conditionâ means any of the following:
Client and Freelancer have submitted joint written instructions for a Release.
Client has approved all or a portion of the Freelancer's Hourly Invoice.
This Release Condition will only apply to amounts invoiced by the Freelancer that Client has approved.
Clientâs failure to dispute an Hourly Invoice, or a portion of an Hourly Invoice, within the Dispute Period pursuant to this Agreement, or as otherwise provided in the Escrow Instructions, constitutes approval by the Client for purposes of this Release Condition.
Freelancer is a Payroll Employee and has submitted an Hourly Invoice under a Services Contract that involves the use of Upwork Payroll.
Upwork reviews Client's dispute of amounts invoiced on Freelancer's Hourly Invoice for an Hourly Contract with Work Diaries pursuant to this Agreement and determines that the time is related to the Hourly Contract requirements or Client's instructions.
Client initiates a Dispute with respect to Freelancer's Hourly Invoice for an Hourly Contract without Work Diaries pursuant to this Agreement and Client and Freelancer resolve the dispute without the assistance of Upwork.
Issuance of a final order of a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction from which appeal is not taken, in which case the funds will be released in accordance with such order.
We believe, in our sole discretion, that fraud, an illegal act, or a violation of Upwork's Terms of Service has been committed or is being committed or attempted, in which case Client and Freelancer hereby irrevocably authorize and instruct Upwork Escrow to take such actions as we deem appropriate in our sole discretion and in accordance with applicable law, in order to prevent or remedy such acts, including without limitation to return the funds associated with such acts to their source of payment.

6.
PAYMENT PROTECTIONUpwork provides limited payment protection to Users as detailed in this Section 6 ("Hourly Payment Protection").6.1 FOR FREELANCERSIn the rare event that a Freelancerâs Client does not make payment for legitimate services performed by a Freelancer, Upwork will provide Hourly Payment Protection to the Freelancer as detailed in this Section 6.1 as a membership benefit to foster fairness, reward loyalty, and encourage the Freelancer to continue to use the Site Services for their business needs.

7.1 DISPUTES INITIATED VIA THE PLATFORM
For Hourly Contracts, Client may dispute Freelancerâs hours invoiced on the Hourly Invoice for the prior week (Sunday 12:00 a.m.
midnight UTC to Sunday 11:59 p.m.
UTC) during the five days following the close of the weekly invoice period (Monday 12:00 a.m.
midnight UTC to Friday 11:59 p.m.
UTC) (the âDispute Periodâ).
It is Clientâs responsibility to review the Hourly Invoice of every Hourly Contract on a weekly basis and to file any disputes during the Dispute Period.
Once the Dispute Period expires, Client will be deemed to have accepted the Freelancer Services and Freelancer Fees and can no longer dispute them.
Disputes handled by Upwork can only address the hours billed, not the quality of the Freelancer Services or the Work Product provided under Hourly Contracts.
If Client disputes Freelancerâs hours invoiced in the Hourly Invoice under an Hourly Contract during the Dispute Period, Client and Freelancer are encouraged to resolve the dispute between themselves.
If Client and Freelancer fail to come to a resolution, Upwork will promptly investigate the Hourly Invoice and determine, in our sole discretion, whether an adjustment is appropriate consistent with Clientâs and Freelancerâs instructions in these Escrow Instructions.
Upwork's determination of such dispute shall be final.If Clientâs payment is unsuccessful, Upwork will review the Weekly Invoice to determine if it qualifies for Hourly Payment Protection.
If Upwork, in its sole discretion, determines that the Weekly Invoice qualifies for Hourly Payment Protection, it will make payment to the Freelancer to cover the Hourly Invoice on behalf of the Client.
In the event that Upwork makes payment on behalf of the Client, Freelancer hereby irrevocably assigns any right, title or interest in any payment from Client to Upwork for the amount paid by Upwork.
Client may choose to approve Freelancerâs Weekly Invoice prior to the end of the Dispute Period thereby releasing payment for the Weekly Invoice.
If Client releases payment to Freelancer prior to the end of the Dispute Period, Client certifies that it approves the Weekly Invoice, accepts the work, and waives any further right to dispute the work or Weekly Invoice through Upwork's Dispute Assistance (defined below).You acknowledge and agree that Upwork Escrow or its Affiliates may, at its sole discretion, withhold or delay payment in the event of dispute between a Client and a Freelancer.
You further acknowledge and agree that Upwork and Affiliates are not and will not be a party to any dispute between a Client and Freelancer over an Hourly Invoice or Hourly Contract.
Clients may not dispute hours worked with respect to any worker engaged as an employee through Upwork Payroll.
The Dispute Period does not apply and payments are released immediately upon completion of the Hourly Invoice for the prior week for Hourly Contracts where the Client has one or more Service Contracts using Upwork Payroll.7.2 UPWORK DISPUTE ASSISTANCENon-binding dispute assistance (âDispute Assistanceâ) is available within 30 days of the date of the last release of funds from Client to Freelancer.
If Client or Freelancer contacts Upwork via support ticket within 30 days of the date of the last payment from Client to Freelancer and requests non-binding dispute assistance for any dispute among them (a âDisputeâ), Upwork will attempt to assist Client and Freelancer by reviewing the Dispute and proposing a mutual, non-binding resolution.
Upwork will only review the 30 days of work performed prior to the date a User requests Dispute Assistance.
The Upwork Disputes team will notify Client and Freelancer via ticket by providing a notice of dispute along with a request for information and supporting documentation.
If both Client and Freelancer respond to the notice and request for information, then the Disputes team will review the documentation submitted and any information available on the Site that pertains to the Dispute.
After review, the Disputes team will propose a mutual, non-binding resolution based on the results of the review.
The proposed resolution is non-binding.
Client and Freelancer can choose whether or not to agree to it.
If Client and Freelancer agree in writing to the proposed resolution, Client and Freelancer agree that Upwork Escrow is authorized and irrevocably instructed to immediately release Escrow funds in accordance with the proposed resolution.
If Client or Freelancer rejects Upworkâs proposed, non-binding resolution then Client and/or Freelancer must pursue the Dispute independently.
Upwork reserves the right to review the Freelancerâs work for 30 days prior to the date of the request for Dispute Assistance for compliance with Hourly Payment Protection requirements, and in its sole discretion, to make adjustments to invoices, and to direct Upwork Escrow to make appropriate releases to Client if it finds work that clearly does not relate Hourly Contract requirements or Client instructions in the Work Diaries or violations of the Terms of Service during its review of the work.
Dispute Assistance does not apply to Freelancer Services using Upwork Payroll.8.
NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR SERVICES OR PAYMENTSUpwork and Affiliates merely provide a platform for Internet payment services.
Upwork and Affiliates do not have any responsibility or control over the Freelancer Services that Client purchases.
Nothing in this Agreement deems or will be interpreted to deem Upwork or any Affiliate as Clientâs or Freelancerâs agent with respect to any Freelancer Services, or expand or modify any warranty, liability or indemnity stated in the Terms of Service.
For example, Upwork does not guarantee the performance, functionality, quality, or timeliness of Freelancer Services or that a Client can or will make payments.

RULES AND FEES FOR ARBITRATIONS CONDUCTED BY THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION
This Appendix A summarizes certain pertinent contractual terms that American Arbitration Association (the "AAA") has agreed to in providing arbitration services to Clients and Freelancers who choose the AAA as their arbitrator under the Fixed-Price Escrow Instructions.
The AAA is solely a third-party arbitration service provider.
Upwork and our affiliates have no direct or indirect affiliate, partnership, joint venture, ownership or control relationship with or interest in the AAA.
Upwork and our Affiliates assume no responsibility or liability for the services of the AAA.
Appointment of the Arbitrator
All Arbitrations by the AAA are conducted by a single arbitrator.The AAA will provide the parties the opportunity to participate in arbitrator selection through a strike-and-rank process of pre-qualified arbitrators.
Each party will be provided with an identical list of five potential arbitrators and may have up to three calendar days to strike two potential arbitrators and rank the remaining in order of preference.
If any party does not return the list within five calendar days, all persons named therein will be deemed acceptable.
From among the arbitrators approved on both lists and in accordance with the designated order of mutual preference, the AAA will invite the arbitrator to serve.
If for any reason the appointment cannot be made according to this procedure, the AAA will have the power to make the appointment without submission of additional lists.
Any arbitrator will be impartial and independent and will perform his or her duties with diligence and in good faith, and will be subject to disqualification for any grounds provided by applicable law.
Neither Upwork nor any party or party representative will communicate ex parte with an arbitrator or candidate for arbitrator concerning the Arbitration.
Notwithstanding the above, Upwork and an arbitrator may communicate ex parte solely for the purpose of enabling the arbitrator to access and use the Site, and the Contract Room, and the information contained therein, associated with the Fixed-Price Contract in Dispute.

Rules of the Proceedings


The amount at issue in any claims or counterclaims relating to a Fixed-Price Contract will be limited to the sum still held in Escrow and the sum previously released from Escrow for the Fixed-Price Contract.

The language of the Arbitration will be English.
At the arbitratorâs sole discretion, the arbitrator may permit or require the submission of additional written statements from the parties (âAdditional Argumentsâ).

INSTRUCTIONS IRREVOCABLEOn the occurrence of a Release Condition, Client and Freelancer are deemed to and hereby agree that the instruction to Upwork Escrow and its wholly owned subsidiaries to release funds is irrevocable.
Without limiting the foregoing, Clientâs instruction to Upwork Escrow and its wholly owned subsidiaries to pay a Freelancer is irrevocable.
Such instruction is Clientâs authorization to transfer funds to Freelancer from the Client Escrow Account or authorization to charge Clientâs Payment Method.
Such instruction is also Clientâs representation that Client has received, inspected and accepted the subject work or expense.
Client acknowledges and agrees that upon receipt of Clientâs instruction to pay Freelancer, Upwork Escrow will transfer funds to the Freelancer and that Upwork, Upwork Escrow, and other Affiliates have no responsibility to and may not be able to recover such funds.
Therefore, and in consideration of services described in this Agreement, Client agrees that once Upwork Escrow or its subsidiary has charged Clientâs Payment Method, the charge is non-refundable.5.
DORMANT ENGAGEMENTSTo be fair to Clients and Freelancers, Upwork has a procedure for Direct Contracts that appear Dormant (as defined below).
For purposes of determining Dormant status, âactivityâ means business term or milestone updates or requests, Direct Contract Escrow Funding, Release requests, or requests to close the Contract.A "Dormant Engagement" is a Direct Contract that has a Direct Contract Escrow Account with a balance but has had no activity for 90 consecutive days after the last milestone date contained in the business terms.
Dormant Engagements are subject to the following rules:
Upwork will notify Client when the Direct Contract becomes dormant (âDormant Dateâ).
If no activity other than Release requests has occurred within 7 days after the Dormant Date, Upwork will notify the Freelancer that the Direct Contract is Dormant.
If neither Freelancer nor Client take any action for 7 days after the Dormant Date, Freelancer and Client agree that Upwork Escrow is authorized and irrevocably instructed to immediately release escrow funds to Client.
If Freelancer submits a Release request and client does not take any action for 14 days from the date of the Release request, Freelancer and Client agree that Upwork Escrow is authorized and irrevocably instructed to immediately release to Freelancer the amount related to the milestone with Release request.
All funds released to Freelancer under this Section, Dormant Engagements, will be subject to the applicable Fees as described in the Direct Contract Terms.

6.
REFUNDS AND CANCELLATIONSClient and Freelancer are encouraged to come to a mutual agreement if refunds or cancellations are necessary.

FUNDING ESCROWBy accepting an Hourly Direct Contract, Client agrees to deposit funds totaling the Freelancerâs hourly rate as agreed to by the parties multiplied by the weekly hourly limit agreed to by the parties (âDirect Contract Depositâ).
Client authorizes Upwork Escrow Inc.
(âUpwork Escrowâ) to hold the Direct Contract Deposit in escrow through the term of the Hourly Direct Contract and further authorizes Upwork Escrow to release funds from the Direct Contract Deposit to the Freelancer in any instance(s) where the Freelancer invoices hours of work and the invoice is neither disputed or funded for payment by Client in accordance with these Hourly Escrow Instructions.
In any such instance(s), Client agrees that Upwork Escrow may charge to Clientâs Payment Method or Client will otherwise deposit additional funds into the Client Escrow Account to replenish the Direct Contract Deposit.
Freelancer and Client agree and authorize Upwork Escrow to hold an amount equal to the Direct Contract Deposit in escrow through the termination of the Direct Contract, at which point the parties agree the Direct Contract Deposit will be released to Client if all payments due under the Hourly Direct Contract have been paid to Freelancer.
In addition to the Direct Contract Deposit, Client agrees to fund through Client Escrow Account payments to Freelancer on a weekly basis for the amount of Freelancerâs applicable weekly invoices (âDirect Contract Weekly Fundsâ).
If Client approves the submitted invoices in accordance with the below provisions, Upwork Escrow will release the Direct Contract Weekly Funds to Freelancer.
2.1 WEEKLY HOURLY INVOICESFor Hourly Direct Contracts, the weekly billing cycle starts Monday at 00:00 midnight UTC and ends Sunday at 23:59 UTC.
Invoices for hours recorded by the Freelancer on Upwork within the weekly billing cycle (the "Hourly Invoice Deadline") will be generated each Monday following the week in which the hours were billed (such invoice, the "Hourly Invoice").
Freelancer irrevocably authorizes and instructs Upwork, as its agent, to (i) create an invoice on behalf of Freelancer for payment due based upon the hours that the freelancer recorded before the Hourly Invoice Deadline.
and (ii) submit the Hourly Invoice on behalf of Freelancer to Freelancer's Client for payment.

Such instruction is Clientâs authorization to transfer funds to Freelancer from the Client Escrow Account or authorization to charge Clientâs Payment Method.
Such instruction is also Clientâs representation that Client has received, inspected, and accepted the subject work or expense.
Client acknowledges and agrees that upon receipt of Clientâs instruction to pay Freelancer, Upwork Escrow will release funds to the Freelancer and that Upwork, Upwork Escrow, and other Affiliates have no responsibility to and may not be able to recover such funds.

Where applicable, Upwork Global, Elance Ltd., or Upwork Escrow may also collect taxes (such as value added tax (VAT) in Europe) on Service Fees.Pursuant to the Freelancer Membership Agreement, we charge Freelancers a Membership Fee.
These Membership Fees automatically renew until they are cancelled as described on the Site.Additionally, the use of various Payment Methods offered through the Site and the Site Services may incur added fees or charges.

You hereby authorize us to charge to you and to collect from you (consistent with this Agreement, the User Agreement, or elsewhere in the Terms of Service) any fees, charges, or taxes described in this Section 2.2.1
Tiered PricingWe will charge you a Service Fee based on the total Freelancer Fees collected by you from your Client (less any refunds or reversals) for the duration of your relationship with your Client (the âEngagement Relationshipâ).
Unless different pricing described in Section 2.2, 2.3, or 2.4 applies, the Service Fee rates decrease as the total Freelancer Fees you have collected from your Client for the Engagement Relationship meet certain thresholds as follows (âTiered Pricing â): TOTAL FREELANCER FEES COLLECTED FROM CLIENT

Below are some examples of Tiered Pricing.

The Service Fee will appear as a single amount in your Account, rather than separate amounts as shown in the example above.

If the same Freelancer and Client enter into additional Fixed-Price Contracts for different Service Contracts, the Freelancer Fees for each Service Contract will count toward the total Freelancer Fees collected for purposes of determining the Tiered Pricing that applies to the Service Fees.
If the Freelancer collects $10,000 in Freelancer Fees from the Client, then the Service Fee on any additional Freelancer Fees for the Engagement Relationship with the Client will be 5% of the Freelancer Fees.
For example, if the Freelancer has collected a total of $15,000 in Freelancer Fees during the Engagement Relationship and the Freelancer and Client enter into a new Fixed-Price Contract for $1,000, the Service Fee would be determined as follows:

Connects that you do not use will be rolled over to the next month as described on the Site.
The conditions under which unused Connects will rollover into the next month may vary from time to time and will depend on your membership program.
For the details on Connects, please visit the Upwork Support page.
Upwork reserves the right to change membership fees, change the monthly number of Connects included in each membership program, change the price for Connects or institute new fees at any time, in each case upon reasonable notice posted in advance on the Site.

1.
INFORMATION COLLECTIONUsers of the Service may be Clients, Freelancers, or Agencies (as each is defined in the User Agreement).

Information You Provide to Us

When you use the Service, you may provide us with information about you.
This may include your name and contact information, financial information to make or receive payment for services obtained through the Upwork platform, or information to help us fill out tax forms.
When you use the Service, we may also collect information related to your use of the Service and aggregate this with information about other users.
This helps us improve our Services for you.
You may also provide us with information about your contacts or friends if, for example, youâd like to add those contacts to a message room.
Agencies may also provide us with information about Freelancers associated with the Agency.


Personal Information: In the course of using the Service (whether as a Client or Freelancer or Agency), we may require or otherwise collect information that identifies you as a specific individual and can be used to contact or identify you (âPersonal Informationâ).
Examples of Personal Information include your name, email address, company address, billing address, and phone number.


Payment Information: If you use the Service to make or receive payments, we will also collect certain payment information, such as credit card or other financial account information, and billing address.


Identity Verification: We may collect Personal Information, such as your date of birth or taxpayer identification number, to validate your identity or as may be required by law, such as to complete tax filings.
We may request documents to verify this information, such as a copy of your government-issued identification or photo or a billing statement.


General Audience Service: The Service is general audience and intended for users 18 and older.
We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from anyone younger than age 18.
If we become aware that a child younger than 18 has provided us with Personal Information, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete such information from our files.
If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child younger than age 18 and believe that Upwork has collected Personal Information from your child, please contact us at: legalnotices@upwork.com

.


Non-Identifying Information/Usernames: We also may collect other information, such as zip codes, demographic data, information regarding your use of the Service, and general project-related data (âNon-Identifying Informationâ).
We may aggregate information collected from Upwork registered and non-registered users (âUpwork Usersâ).
In some cases, we may render Personal Information (generally, email address) into a form of Non-Identifying Information referred to in this Privacy Policy as âHashed Information.â This is typically accomplished using a mathematical process (commonly known as a hash function) to convert information into a code.
The code does not identify you directly, but it may be used to connect your activity and interests.

Combination of Personal and Non-Identifying Information: Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers in a way that enables you to be identified (for example, combining information with your name).
But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your viewing preferences).
We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information, but Upwork will treat the combined information as Personal Information.


Collection of Third Party Personal Information: We collect the following personal information from you about your contacts or friends: First name, last name, and email address when you provide it to us for the purpose of adding your contacts to a message room.

You do not have a statutory obligation to provide us with any information, but you may have a contractual obligation to do so, and if we do not receive certain information from you, then we will not be able to provide our Service to you.
If you have any questions regarding whether provision of information is mandatory and the consequences for withholding such information, please contact us using the contact information below.
Information Received from Third Parties



Third parties may also give us information about you.
If we combine that information with information about you collected through the Service, we will still treat that combined information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
We also may receive information about you from third parties.
For example, we may supplement the information we collect with outside records or third parties may provide information in connection with a co-marketing agreement or at your request (such as if you choose to sign in with a third-party service).
If we combine the information we receive from others with information we collect through the Service, we will treat the combined information as described in this Privacy Policy.
Information Collected Automatically

We use these technologies to analyze how people use the Service, to improve how our Site functions, to save your log-in information for future sessions, and to serve you with advertisements that may interest you.We and our third party service providers, including analytics and third party content providers, may automatically collect certain information from you whenever you access or interact with the Service.

We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.
We do this to improve services we offer you, and to improve marketing, analytics, and site functionality.The information we collect also includes the Internet Protocol (âIPâ) address or other unique device identifier (âDevice Identifierâ) for any device (computer, mobile phone, tablet, etc.) used to access the Service.
A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned or connected to the device you use to access the Service, and our servers identify your device by its Device Identifier.

Cookies: Like many websites, we and our marketing partners, affiliates, analytics, and service providers use âcookiesâ to collect information.
A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computerâs hard disk for record-keeping purposes.
We use both persistent cookies that remain on your computer or similar device (such as to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Service and to track your compliance with the Upwork Terms of Service) and session ID cookies, which expire at the end of your browser session (for example, to enable certain features of the Service, to better understand how Upwork Users interact with the Service and to monitor aggregate usage by Upwork Users and web traffic routing on the Service).
You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functionality of the Service.
For further information on cookies and how they are used for the Service, please visit our Cookie Policy at https://www.upwork.com/legal#cookie-policy.


Web Beacons: We and our marketing partners, affiliates, analytics, and service providers may also employ software technology known as âweb beaconsâ and/or âtracking tagsâ to help us keep track of what content on our Service is effective and to serve relevant advertising to you.
Web beacons are small graphics with a unique identifier that may be invisible to you, and which are used to track the online activity of Internet users.
Web beacons are embedded in the web pages you review or email messages you receive.
Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to our Service, to monitor how Upwork Users navigate the Service, to count how many emails that were sent were actually opened, or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.


Embedded Scripts: We and our marketing partners, affiliates, analytics, and service providers may also employ software technology known as an Embedded Script.
An Embedded Script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Service, such as the links you click on.
The code is temporarily downloaded onto your computer or other device and is deactivated or deleted when you disconnect from the Service.

In addition, we and our marketing partners, affiliates, analytics, and service providers may use a variety of other technologies (such as tags) that collect similar information for security and fraud detection purposes and we may use third parties to perform these services on our behalf.
HOW WE RESPOND TO DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS

There is no consensus among industry participants as to what âDo Not Trackâ means in this context.
Like many websites and online services, Upwork does not alter its practices when it receives a âDo Not Trackâ signal from a visitorâs browser.
To find out more about âDo Not Track,â please visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.

Work Diaries and Work View


We collect information about a Freelancerâs work for a Client, including automatically collected information about work on a particular project.
If a Freelancer enables Work Diaries, we will share Work Diaries with the relevant Client and Agency.
We tell Freelancers when we are capturing information for the Work Diary and allow Freelancers to block such data sharing.As part of the Service, when enabled by a Freelancer, we collect information about a Freelancerâs work on a project for a Client.
This feature is known as Work Diary.
Work Diaries include information provided by the Freelancer, such as a memo, as well as automatically gathered information about work on a project, such as number of mouseclicks and keyboard strokes and regularly taken screenshots (which may include a webcam picture of you if you have enabled this feature in your settings).

Identity Verification

We place a premium on trust in our Service, so we may take steps to verify your identity.Before a Freelancer can complete registration on the Service, or at any time thereafter, we may request or re-request identity verification.
Without limiting the manner in which we request identify verification, we may require Freelancers to participate in a video call after submitting their government issued ID to enable us to confirm that the Freelancer is indeed the individual in the ID.
We may record such video calls and take screenshots of the user during the call.
Upwork may use the information obtained from Identity Verification for purposes of verifying your identity, enforcing our Terms of Service and other agreements, and preventing fraud.

the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information.
and the categories of third parties with whom we shared personal information.

You will be required to verify your identity before we fulfill your request.
You can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf.
To do so, you must provide us with written authorization or a power of attorney, signed by you, for the agent to act on your behalf.
You will still need to verify your identity directly with us.Certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law.
For example, we need certain types of information so that we can provide the Service to you.
If you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access or use the Service.The CCPA sets forth certain obligations for businesses that âsellâ personal information.
Based on the definition of âsellâ under the CCPA and under current regulatory guidance, we do not believe we engage in such activity and have not engaged in such activity in the past twelve months. Privacy Center Version 3.1 Effective September 14, 2020 Download Table of Contents 
 The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a data privacy law that gives residents of the European Economic Area (âEEAâ) more clarity and control over how their personal data is used.
Personal data is anything that can directly or indirectly identify a person, such as a photo, name, bank details, medical information, computer IP address, and so on.
This European-wide law replaces the 1995 Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC.The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is a new data privacy law, effective January 1, 2020, that applies to certain businesses and is intended to enhance privacy rights and consumer protection for residents of California.Learn more about how Upwork is complying with the GDPR and the CCPA in our Privacy Policy.
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR YOU AND 
UPWORK?Upworkâs Legal and Information Security and Privacy teams have carefully analyzed applicable privacy laws and regulations and undertaken the necessary steps to ensure that Upwork is in compliance with their requirements.We value our usersâ privacy and their rights to control their personal data.
Regardless of where you call home, you may close your account or request the deletion of all personal information we have about you at any time.
However, we will only be following the requirements outlined by the GDPR and the CCPA for those living in the EEA and in California, respectively.
If you live elsewhere, we will be happy to consider your request to delete your data.
Upwork DATA PROCESSING AGREEMENT (âDPAâ) To streamline GDPR compliance, Upwork has posted a Data Processing Agreement (âDPAâ), governing the relationship between the Customer (as defined in the DPA, acting as a data controller or processor, as applicable) of personal data under European Data Protection Legislation.
and Upwork (acting as a data processor or subprocessor, as applicable).Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by you and Upwork, to the extent Upwork processes any EU personal data for you as a controller (as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679) in your role as a Customer, the Data Processing Agreement applies.

HOW DO I SUBMIT A DATA REQUEST? Depending on where you are located, you may have certain rights with regard to your personal information.
These rights may be limited, for example, if fulfilling a request would reveal personal information about another person, or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep or have compelling legitimate interests in keeping (such as fraud prevention purposes or record retention requirements under applicable laws).
In addition, we typically will not remove information you posted publicly or shared with others through or on the Service, as neither you nor Upwork can delete all copies of information that have been previously shared with others on the Service.
If you would like to request to close your account in our system, you can do so through the Upwork Service (once you have logged in, visit settings / user settings, and then click on the close my account link).
In addition, you can access, correct, or delete your personal information by making updates to that information through your account.

UTG will not retaliate against Freelancer for filing a claim with an administrative agency or for exercising rights (individually or in concert with others) under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act.b.
Interpretation and Enforcement of this Arbitration ProvisionThis Arbitration Provision is the full and complete agreement relating to the formal resolution of Claims and replaces all prior agreements between Freelancer and UTG regarding the arbitration of disputes covered by this Arbitration Provision.
Except as otherwise provided in this Arbitration Provision, this Arbitration Provision covers, and the arbitrator will have exclusive jurisdiction to decide, all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, enforcement, or application of this Arbitration Provision, including, except as otherwise provided in this Arbitration Provision, the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Provision or whether any portion of the Arbitration Provision is void or voidable.
All such matters will be decided by an arbitrator and not by a court.
In the event any portion of this Arbitration Provision is deemed unenforceable, the remainder of this Arbitration Provision will be enforceable.
If any portion of the Class Action Waiver in subsection c, below, of this Arbitration Provision is deemed to be unenforceable, the Parties agree that this Arbitration Provision will be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.
c.
Class and Collective Action Waiver
Private attorney general representative actions under the California Labor Code are not arbitrable, not within the scope of this Arbitration Provision and may be maintained in a court of law.
However, this Arbitration Provision affects the Partiesâ ability to participate in class or collective actions.
The Parties agree to bring any dispute in arbitration on an individual basis only, and not on a class or collective basis on behalf of others.
There will be no right or authority for any dispute to be brought, heard or arbitrated as a class or collective action, or as a member in any such class or collective proceeding (âClass Action Waiverâ).
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the JAMS Rules, disputes regarding the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity or breach of the Class Action Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.
In any case in which (1) the dispute is filed as a class or collective action and (2) there is a final judicial determination that all or part of the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, the class or collective action to that extent must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the portion of the Class Action Waiver that is enforceable shall be enforced in arbitration.
Freelancer will not be retaliated against, disciplined or threatened with discipline as a result of exercising any rights under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, if applicable, by filing or participating in a class or collective action in any forum.
However, any Party may lawfully seek enforcement of this Arbitration Provision and the Class Action Waiver under the Federal Arbitration Act and seek dismissal of such class or collective actions or claims.
