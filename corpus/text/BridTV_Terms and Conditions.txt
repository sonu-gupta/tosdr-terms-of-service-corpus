Subscription Services.


Auto-renewal and Cancellation. If you are purchasing a BRID plan on a subscription basis, you can choose to purchase via PayPal on a monthly or yearly subscription.
and your subscription will renew automatically.
Subscriptions are billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis (as per the option is chosen when you purchased such services).
You also have the option to purchase a recurring monthly subscription via credit card, which will renew automatically as well.
You agree that BRID may process your credit card or PayPal account on each monthly, annual, or other renewal terms (based on the applicable billing cycle), on the calendar day corresponding to the first day you subscribed to a paid subscription.
If your paid subscription to BRID began on a day not contained in a subsequent month (e.g., your service began on January 30, and there is no February 30), BRID will process your payment roughly every 30 days for that month.
All credit card payments will be processed in Serbian currency â dinar (RSD).
The amount your credit card account will be charged for is obtained through the conversion of the price from USD into Serbian dinar according to the current exchange rate of the Serbian National Bank.
When charging your credit card, the same amount is converted into your local currency according to the exchange rate of credit card associations.
As a result of this conversion, there is a possibility of a slight difference from the original price stated on our website.
You may cancel your BRID subscription plan at any time from your account page.
BRID reserves the right to cancel your plan in case of violation of these terms, or in case of some other unexpected reasons.
You must cancel an ongoing subscription before the renewal date.
Cancellations after or on the renewal date will take effect for the next payment period.
BRID does not save any data concerning your credit cards if payment to BRID is made via a supported credit card. 
If you are subscribed to an annual subscription package, all subscription cancellations will come into effect at the end of your current annual period.


Late fees. If any amounts due hereunder are not received by BRID by the due date, then, at BRIDâs discretion, such charges may accrue late interest at the rate of 12% per year or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, from the date such payment was due until the date paid.
In addition, upon 10 daysâ written notice, BRID may suspend your access to the Services if BRID does not receive the amounts invoiced hereunder at the expiration of such period.
