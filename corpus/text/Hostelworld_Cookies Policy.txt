 Hostelworld - HTTP Cookies What is a Cookie?
A cookie, also known as an HTTP cookie, web cookie, or browser cookie, is usually a small piece of data sent from a website and stored in a user's web browser while a user is browsing a website.
When the user browses the same website in the future, the data stored in the cookie can be retrieved by the website to notify the website of the user's previous activity.
Cookies were designed to be a reliable mechanism for websites to remember the state of the website or activity the user had taken in the past.
This can include clicking particular buttons, logging in, or a record of which pages were visited by the user.

Other kinds of cookies perform essential functions in the modern Web.
Perhaps most importantly, authentication cookies are the most common method used by web servers to know whether the user is logged in or not, and which account they are logged in under.
Without such a mechanism, the website would not know whether to send a page containing sensitive information, or require the user to authenticate himself by logging-in.
