Privacy Policy Last revised: July 23 2018  This privacy policy ("Policy") explains how personally identifiable information is collected, used and disclosed by PurseIO, Inc.
("PurseIO", "we", "our" or "us") with respect to your access and use of the PurseIO website located at purse.io (the "Site") and PurseIO's products and services (collectively, the "Service"), so that you can make an informed decision about using the Service.

 We reserve the right to change the provisions of this Policy at any time.
We will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on this Policy the date it was last updated.
We encourage you to review this Policy from time-to-time to make sure that you understand how any personally identifiable information you provide to us or collected about you will be used.
 Geography  PurseIO is a U.S.-based company that offers our Services to domestic and international business customers.
As a result, information that we collect, including personal information, may be transferred to our U.S.
offices: to permit us to comply with our legal and contractual obligations, to provide information and services to prospective and current clients, and to perform related business activities.
In addition, we may provide information to third-party service providers in the U.S.
and in other countries to the extent necessary to support PurseIO's business activities, and we may access personal information collected by our customers to support the Services that we provide to our customers.
Thus, personal information may be transferred to and stored on servers located in the United States and in countries different from the country in which that information was initially collected.
Similarly, information we collect may be accessed by PurseIO and our third-party service providers and business partners from countries other than the ones in which the information is stored.
For more information about how we handle personal information from EU-based individuals, see below.

 If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Statement or about our privacy or data security practices, please contact us at support@PurseIO.com.
 What Is Personally Identifiable Information?  As used in this Policy, the term "personally identifiable information" means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, user name or email address), or information about that individual that is directly linked to information that specifically identifies an individual.
Personally identifiable information does not include "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of the Service or about a group or category of services or users, from which individual identities or other personally identifiable information has been removed.
This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.
 What Information Do We Collect? 
Active Collection: We collect information from you in various ways when you use the Service.
For example, we collect information: (i) that you voluntarily provide to us (such as when you send us an email or create a PurseIO account).
and (ii) to which you provide us access.
Such information may include personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address, social network data, other account data, and financial information.
Personal and demographic information may also be collected if you provide such information in connection with posting data, providing access to your online groups and other activities in connection with the Service.
