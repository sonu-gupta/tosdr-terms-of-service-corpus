 Menu PayPal User Agreement PayPal User Agreement About Your Account This user agreement will be effective for all users as of November 9, 2020.


Welcome to PayPal!
This user agreement is a contract between you and PayPal, Inc.
governing your use of your PayPal account and the PayPal services.
It applies to U.S.
PayPal accounts only.
If you are an individual, you must be a resident of the United States or one of its territories and at least 18 years old, or the age of majority in your state of residence to open a U.S.
PayPal account and use the PayPal services.
If you are a business, the business must be organized in, operating in, or a resident of, the United States or one of its territories to open a U.S.
PayPal account and use the PayPal services.
By opening and using a PayPal account, you agree to comply with all of the terms and conditions in this user agreement.
The terms include an agreement to resolve disputes by arbitration on an individual basis.
You also agree to comply with each of the other agreements on the Legal Agreements page that apply to you and the following additional policies:

Acceptable Use Policy
Electronic Communications Delivery Policy (E-Sign Disclosure and Consent)

Please read carefully all of the terms and conditions of this user agreement, terms of these policies and each of the other agreements that apply to you.
We may revise this agreement and any of the policies listed above from time to time.
The revised version will be effective at the time we post it, unless otherwise noted.
If our changes reduce your rights or increase your responsibilities we will post a notice on the Policy Updates page of our website and provide you at least 21 days advance notice for personal accounts and at least 5 days advance notice for business accounts.
By continuing to use our services after any changes to this user agreement, you agree to abide and be bound by those changes.
If you do not agree with any changes to this user agreement, you may close your account. Opening a PayPal Account We offer two types of PayPal accounts: personal PayPal accounts and business PayPal accounts, both covered by this user agreement.
All PayPal accounts let you do things like:

Send and receive money.
Buy things online, using mobile devices or in stores.
Make payments using your credit card, debit card, bank account, or other payment options, including funds held as balance in a business PayPal account (if we have verified the required identifying information you provide to us) or funds held in a PayPal Cash or a PayPal Cash Plus account linked to a personal PayPal account if you choose to open a PayPal Cash or a PayPal Cash Plus account.
The term âCash Accountâ in this user agreement will be used to refer to either a PayPal Cash or a PayPal Cash Plus account.
More information about Cash Accounts can be found in the PayPal Cash and PayPal Cash Plus Account Terms and Conditions.
Accept credit card, debit card, bank account, Cash Account and other payment methods from others.

You are responsible for maintaining adequate security and control of any and all IDs, passwords, personal identification numbers, or any other codes that you use to access your PayPal account and the PayPal services.
You must keep your mailing address, email address and other contact information current in your PayPal account profile.

 Personal PayPal accounts If you primarily need to make purchases and send money to family and friends, a personal PayPal account is probably right for you.
With a personal PayPal account you can do things like:

Send and request money from friends and family.
Buy goods and services.

You can also use a personal PayPal account to receive money for the sale of goods and services and hold that money in a linked Cash Account or transfer it to a linked bank account or debit card if you do not open a Cash Account, but if you plan to use your personal PayPal account primarily to sell things, you should open a business PayPal account.
You can also convert your personal PayPal account to a business PayPal account should circumstances change.

 Business PayPal accounts We recommend business PayPal accounts for people and organizations that primarily use PayPal to sell goods or services or accept donations, even if your business is not incorporated.
With a business PayPal account, you can do things like:

Use a company or business name as the name on your business PayPal account.
Allow employees access to some of the features of your business PayPal account.
Sign up for PayPal products that meet your business needs.

Business PayPal accounts may be subject to fees that differ from the fees applicable to personal accounts.

By opening up a business PayPal account or converting a personal PayPal account to a business PayPal account, you certify to us that you are using it primarily for a business or commercial purpose.
You also consent to PayPal obtaining your personal and/or business credit report from a credit reporting agency at account opening and whenever we reasonably believe there may be an increased level of risk associated with your business PayPal account.


 Commercial Entity Status If the activity through any type of PayPal account you hold reaches certain thresholds or involves certain business segments or activities, you are required by the card networks to agree to a Commercial Entity Agreement to allow you to continue accepting Visa and MasterCard payments.
In this case, these Commercial Entity Agreements will apply to any payment processed by PayPal on your behalf and will form part of this user agreement.

 Closing Your PayPal Account You may close your PayPal account and terminate your relationship with us at any time without cost, but you will remain liable for all obligations related to your PayPal account even after the PayPal account is closed.
When you close your PayPal account, we will cancel any scheduled or incomplete transactions.
If you have a Cash Account linked to a personal PayPal account, you must withdraw or transfer any funds held in your Cash Account before closing your personal PayPal account, and closing a personal PayPal account will result in PayPal automatically closing any linked Cash Account.
If you have a business PayPal account, you must withdraw or transfer any balance from your business PayPal account before closing it, and if you have not provided the required identifying information to us, or if we are unable to verify the required identifying information you provide, you must transfer any balance in your business PayPal account to a linked bank account or debit card.
You cannot withdraw or transfer digital gift certificates/cards that are purchased through PayPal Digital Gifts and linked to your personal or business PayPal account as payment methods.
However, even without your PayPal account, you can still use the codes you received by email when you purchased the gift certificates/cards to make purchases.
In certain cases, you may not close your PayPal account, including:

To evade an investigation.
If you have a pending transaction or an open dispute or claim.
If your PayPal account has a negative balance.
If your PayPal account is subject to a hold, limitation or reserve.


 Link or Unlink a Payment Method You can link or unlink certain payment methods such as a credit card, debit card, a U.S.
bank account or PayPal Credit to your PayPal account.
You can also link a Cash Account to your personal PayPal account as a payment method and unlink the Cash Account by withdrawing all funds and closing it.
Please keep your payment method information current (e.g.
credit card number and expiration date).
If this information changes, we may update it using information and third party sources available to us without any action on your part.
If you do not want us to update your card information, you may remove your payment method from your PayPal account.
If we update your payment method, we will keep any preference setting attached to such payment method.
You may choose to confirm your card, so that we can verify that the card is valid and that you are the card owner.
To do this, we will charge $1.95 to the card.
After the card is confirmed, we will immediately refund this amount to the card. Receiving Funds, Holding a Balance or Transferring Funds Personal PayPal accounts Money sent to your personal PayPal account cannot be held as a balance in your personal PayPal account.
When you receive money to your personal PayPal account, you can:

transfer the money via a standard transfer to your bank account linked to your personal PayPal account for free;
transfer the money via an Instant Transfer to an eligible debit card or bank account linked to your personal PayPal account, subject to the fees applicable to such transfers that can be found on the Fees for Transferring Funds (for personal PayPal accounts) table and that will be disclosed to you in advance each time you initiate such a withdrawal;
request PayPal to send the money to you by check (subject to a non-refundable fee of $1.50, which will be deducted from the amount of the withdrawal).
If you request a paper check from us, you must cash it within 180 days of the date of issuance, or we will return the funds to your linked Cash Account if you have one or hold the funds on your behalf and retain the non-refundable fee of $1.50.
We will not send a check to a post office box, and we will only send a check to an address once we have confirmed that it belongs to you;
open a Cash Account to hold the money as a balance in your Cash Account for purchases or to transfer funds to friends and family members.
A Cash Account is separate account from your personal PayPal account.
If you open a Cash Account, we will automatically link your Cash Account to your personal PayPal account.
More information about Cash Accounts can be found in the PayPal Cash and PayPal Cash Plus Account Terms and Conditions.

You also cannot transfer money to your personal PayPal account to be held as a balance in your personal PayPal account.
You will need to open a Cash Account to hold the money as a balance in your Cash Account, which can be used for purchases or to transfer funds to friends and family members.
More information about Cash Accounts can be found in the PayPal Cash and PayPal Cash Plus Account Terms and Conditions.
Except as provided below, any balance in your Cash Account and any funds sent to you which have not yet been transferred to a linked bank account or debit card if you do not have a Cash Account represents an unsecured claim against PayPal and is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).
PayPal is not a bank and does not itself take deposits.
You will not receive any interest on the funds held with PayPal.
PayPal combines your PayPal funds with the PayPal funds of other PayPal users and invests those funds in liquid investments in accordance with state money transmitter laws.
PayPal owns the interest or other earnings on these investments.
These pooled amounts are held apart from PayPalâs corporate funds, and PayPal will neither use these funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes nor will it voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy.
If you have a PayPal Cash Card debit card as part of a Cash Account, have enrolled in Direct Deposit, or have established Goals in PayPal, such funds will have pass-through FDIC insurance as further detailed in the PayPal Cash and PayPal Cash Plus Account Terms and Conditions.
  Business PayPal accounts Money sent to a business PayPal account can be held directly as balance in the business PayPal account.
The balance functionality in your business PayPal account will differ depending on whether we have been able to verify the required identifying information that you provide to us.


The required identifying information is:

For sole proprietorships: name, physical address, date of birth and taxpayer identification number.
or
For other types of business legal entities: business name, business address, taxpayer identification number, and proof of business existence.

If we have not verified the required identifying information, a balance in your business PayPal account can only be held in your business PayPal account and transferred to a linked bank account or debit card or you can request PayPal to send you the money by check (subject to a non-refundable fee of $1.50, which will be deducted from the amount of the withdrawal).
Your balance may also be used to fund payments or money owed to PayPal, such as payments on your PayPal Working Capital account or monies owed for refunds or chargebacks.
If we have verified the required identifying information, a balance can be held in your business PayPal account, transferred to a linked bank account or debit card, used to make purchases or send money to others.
If you have a business PayPal account and we have verified the required identifying information that you have provided to us, you may transfer money to the balance of your business PayPal account from any bank account linked to your business PayPal account by requesting an electronic transfer from your bank account.
If we have not verified the required identifying information that you have provided to us, you cannot add funds to your balance in a business PayPal account.
You can withdraw balance from your business PayPal account by:

transferring it via a standard transfer to a bank account linked to your business PayPal account for free,
transferring it via an Instant Transfer to an eligible debit card or bank account linked to your business PayPal account, subject to the fees applicable to such transfers that can be found on the Fees for Transferring Balance (for business PayPal accounts) table and that will be disclosed to you in advance each time you initiate such a withdrawal,
withdrawing it from an ATM (automated teller machine) if you have a PayPal-branded debit card (fees may apply), or
Requesting a check from us (subject to a non-refundable fee of $1.50, which will be deducted from the amount of the withdrawal).
If you request a paper check from us, you must cash it within 180 days of the date of issuance, or we will return the funds to your balance in your business PayPal account and retain the non-refundable fee of $1.50.
We will not send a check to a post office box, and we will only send a check to an address once we have confirmed that it belongs to you.

Any balance you hold in your business account represents an unsecured claim against PayPal and is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).
PayPal is not a bank and does not itself take deposits.
You will not receive any interest on the funds held with PayPal.
PayPal combines your PayPal funds with the PayPal funds of other PayPal users and invests those funds in liquid investments in accordance with state money transmitter laws.
PayPal owns the interest or other earnings on these investments.
However, the claim against PayPal represented by your PayPal funds is not secured by these investments and you do not have any ownership interest (either legal or beneficial) in these investments.
These pooled amounts are held apart from PayPalâs corporate funds, and PayPal will neither use these funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes nor will it voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy.
  Restrictions on transfers or withdrawals from PayPal accounts To protect us and our users from loss, we may delay a withdrawal, in certain situations, including if we need to confirm that you have authorized the withdrawal or if other payments to your PayPal account have been subject to a reversal (for example, as a result of a chargeback, bank reversal or dispute by a buyer).
If we place a limitation on your PayPal account, a payment is subject to a hold, or your account or an associated account has a negative balance in any currency while a withdrawal from your PayPal account is pending, you will have to reinitiate the withdrawal once the limitation or hold has been lifted, or negative balance is fully paid off.
We may set limits on your withdrawals, and you can view any withdrawal limit by logging into your PayPal account.
Completing two out of three of the following steps can help us verify your PayPal account, which may allow us to remove any withdrawal cap:

Verifying your bank account.
Linking and confirming your credit or debit card information.
Providing your social security number.
 Managing Your Money in Multiple Currencies Holding currency other than U.S.
dollars Your balance in your business PayPal account or in your Cash Account, if you have one, may be held in currencies other than U.S.
dollars.
If you hold a balance in your business PayPal account or in your Cash Account:

We may allow you to convert the funds to balance in another currency.
If you convert funds in your account, PayPalâs transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion spread) will be used.
We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of money you can convert or the number of conversions you can perform.
You may only withdraw the funds in U.S.
dollars.
In order to withdraw funds in your account held in another currency you will have to convert the currency to U.S.
dollars, or it will be converted for you at the time of your withdrawal.
PayPalâs currency conversion rate, including our currency conversion spread, will be used.

To receive money in a currency your account is not currently configured to accept, it may be necessary to create a balance in your business PayPal account or in your Cash Account, in that currency or convert the money into another currency.
Certain currencies can only be received by converting the money into another currency that PayPal allows you to hold.
If the money is converted, PayPalâs transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion spread) will be used.
You are responsible for all risks associated with maintaining multiple currencies in a PayPal Cash Account or business PayPal account.
You may not manage or convert multiple currencies for speculative trading purposes, conversion arbitrage, conversion options, or any other activity that PayPal determines is primarily for the purpose of gaining or making money based on currency conversion rates.
PayPal may hold, cancel, or reverse any transaction we determine to violate this policy.
  How we convert currency If PayPal converts currency, it will be completed at the transaction exchange rate we set for the relevant currency exchange.
The transaction exchange rate is adjusted regularly and includes a currency conversion spread applied and retained by us on a base exchange rate to form the rate applicable to your conversion.
The base exchange rate is based on rates within the wholesale currency markets on the conversion day or the prior Business Day.
or, if required by law or regulation, set at the relevant government reference rate(s).
For some uses of your PayPal accounts, PayPal may determine currency conversion is necessary.
The applicable currency conversion spread can be found on our Fees page under the heading Currency conversion.
  Currency conversion choices When your payment is funded by a debit or credit card and PayPal determines a currency conversion is necessary, you consent to and authorize PayPal to convert the currency in place of your debit or credit card issuer.
You may have the right to have your card issuer perform the currency conversion, if applicable for that card issuer and network.
Currency preference selections may be presented to you in various forms, including a choice of which currency is used for the transaction, whether PayPal or your card issuer performs the conversion, or which conversion rate is used for the transaction, and may be made available individually for each card and for each automatic payment agreement.
If your card issuer converts the currency, your card issuer will determine the currency conversion rate and what fees they may charge.
PayPal will always perform the conversion for transactions where your Cash Account balance, business PayPal account balance or linked bank account is the payment method. Account Statements You have the right to receive an account statement showing your PayPal account activity.
You may view your PayPal account statement by logging into your PayPal account.
If you have a Cash Account linked to your personal PayPal account, you will receive two statements: one showing all transactions in your personal PayPal account and an additional statement showing only transactions involving your Cash Account. Sending Money and Buying Sending Money to a Friend or Family Member Sending money You can send money to a friend or family member using the send money feature in your PayPal account (sometimes called âpersonal paymentsâ or âpeer-to-peer/P2P paymentsâ).
You can send money to a friend or family member even if they donât have a PayPal account at the time you send them money, using their email address or mobile number in any currency that PayPal supports, and you can choose which payment method you want to use.
If the person to whom you are sending money does not have a PayPal account, they can claim it by opening a PayPal account.
If they donât claim it, it will be refunded to you.
We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of money you can send, including money you send for purchases.
You can view any sending limit by logging into your PayPal account.
When you send money to a friend or family member who has a PayPal account, one of two things may happen: they may accept or decline the money.
If they decline to accept the money, the money (including any fees you were charged) will be refunded to:

The original payment method you used for the transaction, if you used a credit card, debit card, PayPal Credit, a Cash Account, or balance in a business PayPal account as the payment method, or
The balance in your business PayPal account or the balance in your Cash Account linked to your personal PayPal account if you used a bank account as the payment method and we cannot refund it to your bank account.
If you do not have a Cash Account linked to your personal PayPal account, the money will be waiting for you to claim by using one of the available transfer methods under Receiving Funds, Holding a Balance or Transferring Funds for personal PayPal accounts.


 Fees for Sending Money to Friends and Family The fees applicable to sending money can be found on our Fees for Sending Money to Friends and Family page and will be disclosed to you in advance each time you initiate a transaction to send money to a friend or family member.
If you convert money in your Cash Account balance or in your business PayPal account balance from one currency to another before sending money, PayPalâs transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion spread) will be used.
If you use your credit card as the payment method when sending money, you may also be charged a cash-advance fee by your card issuer.
If you send money to a friend or family member from a third party (non-PayPal) website or by using a third partyâs product or service, then the third party will determine if the sender or recipient pays the fee.
This will be disclosed to you by the third party before the payment is initiated.
You can also use the send money feature in your PayPal account to pay for goods or services.
You will not be charged any transaction fee for sending money to purchase goods or services as long as you choose the âsend money to pay for goods and servicesâ feature in your PayPal account.
In that case, the seller will pay a fee.
You must not use the âsend money to a friend or family memberâ feature in your PayPal account when you are paying for goods or services.

 Buying Something From, or Returning Something to, a Seller Who Accepts PayPal   How to buy something You can buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal, in any currency that the seller accepts and that PayPal supports using any payment method linked to your PayPal account.
This includes, for example:

Buying something at an online retailerâs website and selecting PayPal as your payment method at checkout.
Sending money to a seller for goods or services.
Using your PayPal account to buy something at a sellerâs physical store using an electronic terminal, subject to certain limitations.
Using your PayPal account to buy something at a sellerâs physical store using your own mobile device and a QR code, subject to certain limitations.

If the seller you are buying from sells goods or services and that seller does not already have a PayPal account, they can claim your payment by opening a PayPal account.
If they donât open a PayPal account within 30 days, your purchase will be refunded.
In order to manage risk, PayPal may limit the payment methods available for a transaction when you buy something.
In addition, payment methods may be limited for certain sellers or if you make a PayPal payment through certain third party websites or applications.
When you authorize a payment to a seller who accepts PayPal, some sellers may take up to 30 days to complete the transaction.
In these instances, your payment may appear as a pending order in your PayPal account.
In that case, your authorization of the payment will remain valid until the seller completes the transaction (but no longer than 30 days).
If you used a debit or credit card as the payment method, your debit or credit card issuer also may show a pending authorization for a period of time until they release the hold or receive a completed transaction.
If your payment requires a currency conversion by us, PayPalâs transaction exchange rate (including a currency conversion spread) will be used, and may be the rate at the time the payment is processed.
  Fees When you buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal you donât pay a fee to PayPal.
If PayPal performs a currency conversion for your purchase, PayPalâs transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion spread) will be used.
Your debit or credit card issuer may also charge you a separate fee for non-U.S.
transactions.
In addition you may be required to pay a fee to PayPal if you are making a purchase using PayPal Business Payments and the seller discloses to you that you, as the buyer, must pay the fee.
  Payment review When PayPal identifies a potentially high-risk transaction, we review the transaction more closely before allowing it to proceed.
When this happens, PayPal will place a hold on the transaction and notify the seller to delay shipping of the item.
As a buyer, this may delay your receipt of the item you purchased.
If we clear the transaction, we will notify the seller and direct them to ship the item.
If we donât clear the transaction, we will cancel it and return the funds to you, unless we are legally required to take other action.


  Automatic payments You can agree with a seller who accepts PayPal to use PayPal as the payment method for future purchases with that seller.
This agreement is between you and the seller and allows you to pay the seller on a one-time, recurring or sporadic basis.
Examples of automatic payments that can be arranged by you either with a seller or with PayPal include those that PayPal calls a âbilling agreement,â "subscription," "recurring payment,â âreference transaction,â "preauthorized transfer" or "preapproved payment."
If you have a personal PayPal account, you may cancel a recurring automatic payment up to 3 Business Days before the date of the next scheduled payment from your account settings or by contacting us through the PayPal Help Center, or by calling PayPal at (888) 221-1161.
Once your automatic payment is canceled, all future automatic payments under your agreement with that seller will be stopped.
If you cancel an automatic payment, you may still owe the seller money for the purchase or have additional obligations to the seller for any goods or services that you receive but have not paid for.
If you have given advance authorization, either to a seller or to PayPal, that permits a seller to take or receive payments from your PayPal account on a regularly recurring basis (for example, every month or otherwise on a routine billing cycle), and if such payments will vary in amount, you have the right to advance notice of the amount and date of the transfer from the seller at least 10 days before the transfer is made.
If the seller provides the option, you may choose to receive this advance notice only when the amount of your automatic payment will fall outside a range established between you and the seller.
If you have authorized an automatic payment and PayPal performs currency conversion for an automatic payment transaction, PayPal will use the transaction exchange rate (including PayPalâs currency conversion spread) in effect at the time the automatic payment transaction is processed.
  Refunds When you buy something from a seller online using PayPal and the transaction is ultimately refunded, the money will typically be refunded to the original payment method you used for the transaction if you used a debit card, credit card, PayPal Credit, or a balance in your Cash Account or business PayPal account.
If you used a bank account linked to a personal PayPal account as the payment method for the transaction, we will attempt to refund the money to your bank account.
If we are unable to do so, we will refund the money to your linked Cash Account if you have one.
If you do not have a Cash Account, the money will be waiting for you to claim by using one of the available transfer methods under Receiving Funds, Holding a Balance or Transferring Funds for personal PayPal accounts.
If you used a bank account linked to a business PayPal account as the payment method for the transaction, we will attempt to refund the money to your bank account.
If we are unable to do so, we will refund the money to your balance in your business PayPal account.
For purchases you make in a sellerâs store location that you paid for using your personal PayPal account and the transaction is ultimately refunded, the money will be refunded to your Cash Account if you have one.
If you do not have a Cash Account, the money will be waiting for you to claim by using one of the available transfer methods under Receiving Funds, Holding a Balance or Transferring Funds for personal PayPal accounts.
For purchases you make in a sellerâs store location that you paid for using your business PayPal account and the transaction is ultimately refunded, the money will be refunded to your balance in your business PayPal account.
If you used Pay with Rewards to fund your transaction, your refund will be processed back as a dollar amount: depending on your card agreement with your issuer, your issuer may or may not credit your purchase back to your reward balance.
If PayPal performed currency conversion for your transaction and a refund is issued:

Within 1 day of the date of the original payment, PayPalâs transaction exchange rate (including a currency conversion spread) used at the time of the original payment will apply.
Beyond 1 day of the date of the original payment, PayPalâs transaction exchange rate (including a currency conversion spread) on the date of the refund will apply.

Money will be refunded in the currency you paid.
or if we are unable to refund in the currency you paid, in your primary holding currency.
or we are unable to refund in your primary holding currency, then in U.S.
dollars. Payment Method Used for My Transaction   Selecting a preferred payment method You can choose any of the payment methods in your PayPal account as your preferred payment method.
You can select a preferred payment method in your account preferences on www.paypal.com or in the PayPal app.
There may be times when your preferred payment method cannot be used, for example, if you select a credit card that is expired.
You can set separate preferred payment methods for online transactions, in-store transactions, and each of your automatic payment agreements, as described below.
If you have chosen a preferred payment method, it will be shown as the primary method of payment.
If no preferred payment method, itâs still your choice.
The availability of certain payment methods may be limited based on that particular seller or the third party website you are using to complete the transaction.
If you have not selected a preferred payment method, or your preferred payment method is unavailable, we will show you available payment methods, including the payment method you used most often or most recently, at the time of transaction.
You can also click on the âManageâ link to see all of your available payment methods, or add a new one, and select a payment method during the transaction.
  Backup payment method Certain one-time online transactions may require that a backup funding method be used in the event that your selected or preferred payment method is unavailable.
In those instances, the backup funding method may be displayed to you on your transaction review page, before you complete the transaction.
Note that this only applies for one-time, online transactions, and not for in-store or automatic payments.
If PayPal determines currency conversion is necessary for a transaction that also requires a backup payment method, you may not be able to separately choose whether PayPal or your card issuer performs the currency conversion on your backup payment method.
  Sending money to friends and family When you send money to friends and family within the U.S.
using balance in your Cash Account linked to your personal PayPal account, the balance in your business PayPal account, or your bank account, we waive all fees, so we always show you these payment options first, even if you have a set preferred payment method for your online purchases.
Remember, you always have the choice to select any payment method in your PayPal account by clicking the âChangeâ link on the Send Money page.
If you select a payment method with a fee, we will always show you the fee before you send money.
  Automatic payments Some sellers allow you to store PayPal as the way you pay when making purchases on their site, so you can check out faster.
Often, this entails creating an agreement with the seller that permits them to request that we charge your PayPal account each time you make a purchase.
To help minimize disruptions in your automatic payments, we may update your Payment Method information.
see Link or Unlink a Payment Method.
When you first set up an automatic payment agreement, you may have the option to set up a preferred payment method for such agreement.
You can review, set, or change a preferred payment method for an automatic payment agreement in your account settings on paypal.com.
Your preferred payment method for an automatic payment agreement will be used for transactions with that seller.
If you have available balance in a linked Cash or cash Plus account, that balance may be used before your preferred payment method.
If you have not set a preferred payment method for an automatic payment agreement, or if your preferred payment method for an automatic payment agreement is unavailable (for example, because it is expired or has insufficient funds) the payment method used will be in the following order, if applicable: 1.
Cash Account (if one is linked to your personal PayPal account) or balance in your business PayPal account (if weâve been able to verify the required identifying information you provide to us).
2.
Bank account.
3.
PayPal co-branded debit card.
4.
PayPal co-branded credit card.
5.
Debit card.
6.
Credit card.
and 7.
E-check.
This is also the order of payment methods that will be used if a previously selected payment method to be used in a seller agreement is unavailable.
  Bank account transfers When you use your bank account as a payment method, you are allowing PayPal to initiate a transfer from your bank account to the recipient.
For these transactions, PayPal will make electronic transfers from your bank account in the amount you specify.
You authorize PayPal to try this transfer again if the initial transfer is rejected by your bank for any reason.
If you use your PayPal account to pay for an item and you select your bank account as the funding method for the transaction, remember that your PayPal account is issued to you by PayPal and not your bank.
The terms, benefits, and protections associated with your PayPal account may vary from those that apply to your bank account.
If you use your PayPal account to make a purchase that exceeds the balance in your linked bank account, you could incur overdraft fees, even if you chose not to allow overdrafts with your bank.
Similarly, the liability limits applicable to your PayPal account may differ from those applicable to your bank account.
  E-check E-check is a payment method where you use your bank account as your payment method, and the payment is not received by the recipient until the transaction is processed from the bank.
This process usually takes 3-5 Business Days, but this amount of time will increase if the payment is sent from a bank account located outside the United States.
  Pay with Rewards PayPal may allow you to redeem rewards associated with your eligible card(s) when making a purchase with your PayPal account through PayPalâs Pay with Rewards program.
PayPal may share with and receive information from your issuer about your issuer accounts to complete the redemption of your rewards when using PayPalâs Pay with Rewards program.
The exchange of this information is necessary to complete the purchase when you select the Pay with Rewards redemption option. All Pay with Rewards redemptions are subject to the terms of your card agreement with your card issuer.
Pay with Rewards is only available for eligible purchases with certain merchants, and PayPal or your issuer may limit, suspend, or terminate your ability to redeem rewards at any time in accordance with this user agreement and your card agreement.
Your issuer determines the value of rewards redeemed through PayPal and available redemption methods (e.g., to pay for your purchase or for a statement credit).
There may be a delay between checkout and processing of your payment.
Only rewards available upon processing of your payment will be used.
Because your reward balance and/or transaction balance may change, whenever you request to redeem rewards for a purchase you also authorize PayPal to charge up to the full payment amount to your associated card if that happens.
For more information on redeeming rewards and how it works, please see About Payment Methods.
  Debit card processing PayPal will process your debit or prepaid card funded transactions through either the ATM debit network or the Visa, MasterCard or Discover network.
If we process your debit or prepaid card through an ATM debit network, we may provide you with the opportunity to switch to a Visa, MasterCard or Discover network by changing your preferences for that debit or prepaid card through your PayPal account profile. Loyalty Cards If you use the PayPal application on your mobile phone, you may store loyalty card numbers or bar codes, where applicable, for certain sellers in your PayPal account.
When you store your loyalty card numbers or bar codes in your PayPal account, you will earn any rewards, subject to the sellerâs loyalty card terms and conditions, at the time you make your payment to the merchant by presenting the stored loyalty card number or bar code to the seller at the point of sale.
It is your responsibility to make sure you have entered your loyalty card information correctly and that you update it as necessary.
It is also your responsibility to ensure that you are receiving the rewards to which you are entitled.
PayPal is not responsible for managing your loyalty card account by offering this service and any questions about your loyalty card or associated rewards program should be directed to the seller who offers the card. PayPalâs Purchase Protection Program When you buy something from a seller who accepts PayPal, you may be eligible for a refund under PayPalâs Purchase Protection program.
When applicable, PayPalâs Purchase Protection program entitles you to reimbursement for the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping costs you paid, if any.
PayPal determines, in its sole discretion, whether your claim qualifies for the Purchase Protection program.
PayPalâs original determination is considered final, but you may be able to file an appeal of the decision with PayPal if you have new or compelling information not available at the time of the original determination or you believe there was an error in the decision-making process.
IMPORTANT: You may be required to return the item to the seller or other party we specify as part of the settlement of your claim.
PayPalâs Purchase Protection program does not entitle you to reimbursement for the return shipping costs that you may incur.
PayPalâs Purchase Protection program may apply when you encounter these specific problems with a transaction:

You didnât receive your item from a seller (referred to as an âItem Not Receivedâ claim), or
You received an item, but the item isnât what you ordered (referred to as a âSignificantly Not as Describedâ claim).

If you believe that a transaction made through your PayPal account was not authorized by you, this type of claim is different from the Purchase Protection program, and is described below under Liability for Unauthorized Transactions and Other Errors.
  QR Code Transactions If you buy something from a seller in person by using a PayPal goods and services QR code, your transaction may be eligible for PayPalâs Purchase Protection program.
  Item Not Received claims Your claim 
will not
 qualify for a refund under PayPalâs Purchase Protection program for an Item Not Received claim, if:

You collect the item in person, or arrange for it to be collected on your behalf, including if you use PayPal in a sellerâs physical store, except for in-person PayPal QR code goods and services transactions, or
The seller has provided proof of shipment or proof of delivery.

If the seller presents evidence that they delivered the goods to you, PayPal may find in favor of the seller for an Item Not Received claim even if you claim you did not receive the goods.
  Significantly Not as Described claims An item may be considered Significantly Not as Described if:

The item is materially different from the sellerâs description of it.
You received a completely different item.
The condition of the item was misrepresented.
For example, the item was described as ânewâ but the item was used.
The item was advertised as authentic but is not authentic (i.e.
counterfeit).
The item is missing major parts or features and those facts were not disclosed in the description of the item when you bought it.
You purchased a certain number of items but didnât receive them all.
The item was damaged during shipment.
The item is unusable in its received state and was not disclosed as such.

An item may not be considered Significantly Not as Described if:

The defect in the item was correctly described by the seller in its description of the item.
The item was properly described but you didn't want it after you received it.
The item was properly described but did not meet your expectations.
The item has minor scratches and was described as âused."

Financial products or investments of any kind.
Businesses (when you buy or invest in a business).

  Transaction eligibility for PayPalâs Purchase Protection program To be eligible for PayPal Purchase Protection you must meet all of the following requirements:

Have a PayPal account in good standing.
Pay for the eligible item from your PayPal account.
Attempt to contact the seller to resolve your issue directly before filing a claim through the Resolution Center.
Respond to PayPal's request for documentation and other information within the time requested.
Open a dispute in the Resolution Center within 180 days of the date you sent the payment and follow our online dispute resolution process.
Not have received a recovery or agreed to an alternative resolution related to your purchase from another source.

  Our online dispute resolution process If youâre unable to resolve a transaction related issue directly with a seller, you must follow our online dispute resolution process through the Resolution Center to pursue a claim under our Purchase Protection program.
You may also file a claim (Step 2 below) by calling us and speaking to an agent.
The steps you must follow are described below, and if you do not follow these steps your claim may be denied:


Step 1: Open a dispute within 180 days of the date you made the payment.
This might allow you to start a direct conversation with the seller regarding your issue with the transaction that may help resolve the dispute.
If you are unable to resolve the dispute directly with the seller, proceed to Step 2.
We will place a hold on all funds related to the transaction in the seller's PayPal account until the dispute is resolved or closed.
Step 2: Escalate the dispute to a claim for reimbursement within 20 days after opening the dispute, if you and the seller are unable to come to an agreement, or we will automatically close the dispute.
You can escalate the dispute to a claim for reimbursement through the Resolution Center.
The seller or PayPal may also escalate the dispute to a claim at this point.
PayPal may ask you to wait at least 7 days from the transaction date to escalate the dispute.

Step 3: Respond to PayPalâs requests for documentation or other information, after you, the seller or PayPal escalates your dispute to a claim for reimbursement.
PayPal may require you to provide receipts, third party evaluations, police reports or other documents that PayPal specifies.
You must respond to these requests in a timely manner as requested in our correspondence with you.
Step 4: Comply with PayPalâs shipping requests in a timely manner, if youâre filing a Significantly Not as Described claim.
PayPal may require you, at your expense, to ship the item back to the seller, to PayPal or to a third party (which will be specified by PayPal) and to provide proof of delivery.
Proof of delivery means:

For transactions that total less than $750 U.S.
dollars (or the currency threshold in the table below), confirmation that can be viewed online and includes the delivery address showing at least city/state or zip code, delivery date, and the identity of the shipping company you used.
For transactions that total $750 U.S.
dollar (or the currency threshold in the table below) or more, you must provide signature confirmation of delivery.
If the transaction is in a currency not listed in the table, then signature confirmation is required when the payment exceeds the equivalent of $750 USD at the PayPal exchange rate that applies at the time the transaction is processed.

Step 5: PayPal will make a final decision (including automatically closing any dispute or claim), in its sole discretion, based on the coverage and eligibility requirements set forth above, any additional information provided during the online dispute resolution process or any other information PayPal deems relevant and appropriate under the circumstances.
Note that when you are making Digital Goods Micropayments Purchases, there are special rules that apply and that include pre-determined thresholds where we may, at our discretion, reverse the transaction without requiring you to take further action.
We may limit the number of automatic reversals that you benefit from, but, even if that is the case, you will still be able to follow PayPal's standard dispute resolution processes described above.
  Dispute with us or your card issuer If you used a debit or credit card as the payment method for a transaction through your PayPal account and you are dissatisfied with the transaction, you may be entitled to dispute the transaction with your card issuer.
Applicable card chargeback rights may be broader than those available to you under PayPalâs Purchase Protection program.
For example, if you dispute a transaction with your card issuer, you may be able to recover amounts you paid for unsatisfactory items even if they donât qualify for protection under a Significantly Not as Described claim with us.
You must choose whether to pursue a dispute with PayPal under our Purchase Protection program, or to pursue the dispute with your card issuer.
You canât do both at the same time or seek a double recovery.
If you pursue a dispute/claim with us and you also pursue a dispute for the same transaction with your card issuer, weâll close your dispute/claim with us.
This wonât affect the dispute process with your card issuer.
In addition, if you pursue a dispute with your card issuer, you cannot pursue a dispute/claim with us later.
If you choose to dispute a transaction with PayPal and we decide against you, you can seek to pursue the dispute with your card issuer later.
If PayPal does not make a final decision on your claim until after your card issuer's deadline for filing a dispute, and because of our delay you recover less than the full amount you would have been entitled to recover from the card issuer, we will reimburse you for the remainder of your loss (minus any amount you have already recovered from the seller or your card issuer).
Before contacting your card issuer or filing a dispute with PayPal, you should contact the seller to attempt to resolve your issue in accordance with the sellerâs return policy. Selling and Accepting Payments Accepting Payments From Buyers for Goods and Services   Receiving personal payments If you use your PayPal account to receive payments for the sale of goods or services or accept donations, you must:

Pay any applicable fees for receiving the funds.
Not ask your buyer to send you money using the âsend money to a friend or family member.â If you do so, PayPal may remove your PayPal accountâs ability to accept payments from friends or family members.

By integrating into your online checkout/platform any functionality intended to enable a payer without a PayPal account to send a payment to your PayPal account, you agree to all further terms of use of that functionality which PayPal will make available to you on any page on the PayPal or Braintree website (including any page for developers and our Legal Agreements page) or online platform.
Such further terms include the PayPal Alternative Payment Methods Agreement.

  No surcharges You agree that you will not impose a surcharge or any other fee for accepting PayPal as a payment method.
You may charge a handling fee in connection with the sale of goods or services as long as the handling fee does not operate as a surcharge and is not higher than the handling fee you charge for non-PayPal transactions.
  Presentation of PayPal and Pay with Venmo You must treat PayPal and/or Venmo as payment methods or marks at least on par with any other payment methods offered at your points of sale where PayPal or Venmo branded services are integrated, including your websites or mobile applications.
This includes at least equal or better: logo placement, position within any point of sale, and treatment in terms of payment flow, terms, conditions, restrictions, and fees, in each case as compared to other marks and payment methods at your points of sale.
Further, you must not present any payment method or mark upstream (or at an earlier point in the checkout experience) from the presentment of any of PayPal or Venmo services or marks.

In representations to your customers or in public communications, you must not mischaracterize any PayPal or Venmo services or exhibit a preference for other payment methods over PayPal or Venmo services.
Within all of your points of sale, you agree not to try to dissuade or inhibit your customers from using PayPal or Venmo services or encourage the customer to use an alternate payment method.
If you enable your customers to pay you with PayPal or Venmo, whenever you display or exhibit the payment methods that you accept (either within any point of sale or in your marketing materials, advertising, and other customer communications) you agree to display the PayPal or Venmo services payment marks at least as prominently, and in at least as positive a manner, as you do for all other payment methods.
  Taxes and information reporting Our fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction (collectively, âtaxesâ).
It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the payments you make or receive, and it is solely your responsibility to assess, collect, report and remit the correct taxes to the appropriate authority.
PayPal is not responsible for determining whether any taxes apply to your transaction, or for calculating, collecting, reporting or remitting taxes arising from any transaction.
You acknowledge that we may make certain reports to tax authorities regarding transactions that we process.
For example, PayPal is required to report to the Internal Revenue Service the total amount of payments for goods and services you receive each calendar year into all of your PayPal accounts associated with the same tax identification number if you receive more than $20,000 in payments for good and services and process more than 200 transactions involving goods or services through those PayPal accounts in the same calendar year.
  Your customer service information, refunds and returns policy, and privacy policy You must publish customer service information with clear instructions on how your customers can contact you.
Such instructions must include at least: (1) one active customer service email address or active customer service URL to file tickets for assistance and/or (2) one active customer service telephone number.
Such information must be readily accessible for review by your customers.
You must publish a refunds and returns policy.
You must publish a privacy policy, where required by law.
  Payment review PayPal reviews certain potentially high-risk transactions.
If PayPal determines, in its sole discretion, that a transaction is high-risk, we place a hold on the payment and provide notice to you to delay shipping of the item.
PayPal will conduct a review and either complete or cancel the payment.
If the payment is completed, PayPal will provide notice to you to ship the item.
Otherwise, PayPal will cancel the payment and the funds will be returned to the buyer, unless we are legally required to take other action.
All payments that complete this payment review will be eligible for PayPal's Seller Protection coverage if they meet the PayPal's Seller Protection requirements.
We will notify you about payment reviews by email and/or through your PayPal account.
  In-store payments and QR code transactions If you accept PayPal payments at your physical store, you must communicate the total amount of the transaction to the customer before it takes place.
You may charge your customerâs account only for transactions that they have authorized.
You must also provide customers with a physical receipt if they request one.
You agree that any transaction that you make shall have an accurate and true description of the goods and services being purchased.
If you use a QR code to accept payments in your physical store, you must use a QR code intended for goods and services transactions.
You must also not use QR codes intended for in-person transactions as a method of accepting payment for goods and services transactions occurring online.
For any buyer claims related to QR code transactions, you may be required to provide us with alternative evidence of delivery or such additional documentation or information relating to the transaction.
  Marketplace sellers If youâre a seller on a marketplace or through a third party application where PayPal is offered, you must comply with any rules that apply to the marketplaceâs or the third party applicationâs buyer protection program for sales you make through that forum.
Any such protections may require you to take certain actions and may impact how claims are processed.
  PayPal Giving Fund If you are a charity and hold a PayPal account, you may be eligible to participate in PayPal Giving Fund programs.
PayPal Giving Fund is a Donor Advised Fund (DAF) recognized by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) under Section 501(c)(3) of the Code as a tax-exempt public charity (Federal Tax ID: 45-0931286).
If you meet the eligibility requirements in the Nonprofit Certification Policy and are either a âPublic Charityâ under Section 509(a) of the Code or a "Private Operating Foundation" under IRS regulations, you may be automatically enrolled with PayPal Giving Fund upon acceptance of this user agreement.
You will receive an email from us confirming your enrollment.
Your relationship with PayPal Giving Fund will be governed by the Nonprofit User Agreement, including receiving email communications from PayPal Giving Fund about its current and future partners about its programs.
You can opt out of email communications at any time in your PayPal Giving Fund profile.
If you donât want to be enrolled or receive donations from PayPal Giving Fund, you can opt-out at any time by contacting us.
For more information, please see PayPal Giving Fundâs Policies.
  Card not present transactions Whenever a buyer uses a debit or credit card as the payment method for a transaction using their account to buy something from you as a seller, the transaction will be processed as a âcard not presentâ transaction, even if the buyer is at your store location.
  Accepting preauthorized payments As a seller, you can accept payments from a buyerâs account through preauthorized transfers either on a one-time, regular or sporadic basis.
This type of transaction is sometimes called a âbilling agreement,â "subscription," "recurring payment,â âreference transaction,â "pre-approved payment " or "automatic payment." If you receive preauthorized payments from buyers: You must:
You must not:
Get each buyerâs prior authorization for the amount, frequency, and duration of any such payment.
Restart future payments without the buyerâs written authorization, if a buyer has stopped or canceled a preauthorized payment.
Provide a simple and easily accessible online cancelation procedure, if buyers sign up for preauthorized payments online.
Provide buyers the ability to stop any such payment up to 3 Business Days before the date scheduled for payment.
Notify the buyer at least 10 days in advance of the amount and date of each preauthorized payment if the preauthorized payment will vary from the preauthorized amount or (at the buyerâs option) any payment that is in an amount that falls outside of the pre-determined range. Transaction Fees for Online and In-Store Payments Your PayPal transaction fees depend on:

the country of the buyerâs account or the currency of their card;
whether you are registered as a charitable organization and have active 501(c)(3) status.
Your 501(c)(3) status must be documented with PayPal to receive the rates applicable to charitable organizations, and those rates will apply only after you document your status with us.

  Standard transaction fees The fees you pay when selling goods or services and the buyer pays using their PayPal account (or using another authorized wallet) can be found on the Standard Transaction Fees table, with the fees applicable to charitable organizations founds on the Standard Transaction Fees for Charitable Organizations table for the charitable fees.
Please note that:

We may adjust the fees applicable to future transactions that you process using PayPal.
We will provide you at least 21 daysâ advance notice for personal PayPal accounts and at least 5 daysâ advance notice for business PayPal accounts of any fee increase or the introduction of a new type of fee.
If you refund a transaction to a buyer or a donation to a donor, there are no fees to make the refund, but the fees you originally paid as the seller are not returned.
If you accept payments using a PayPal product (like PayPal Here or PayPal Payments Pro), the fees applicable to those products will apply to your transactions.

  Micropayments fees You may qualify to receive micropayments pricing for the sale of goods and services through your PayPal account, if your transactions typically average less than $10.
In order to qualify, you must have a PayPal account that is in good standing (for example, no limitations or negative balance), you may not be processing payments using PayPal Payments Pro and you must submit an application and have it approved by us.
If your PayPal account is approved to accept micropayments, then the fees found on the Micropayment Fees table will apply to all transactions for the sale of goods or services processed through your PayPal account, instead of Standard Transaction Fees.
If you have multiple PayPal accounts, you must route your micropayments transactions through the appropriate account.
Once a transaction is processed, PayPal will not re-route the transaction through a different account.
  PayPal Payouts and Mass Pay fees PayPalâs Payouts and Mass Pay services let you send multiple payments in one batch to send commissions, rebates, rewards, and general payments.
You may be able to choose to send payments to PayPal accounts, Venmo accounts, or both.
In order to use these services, you must have:

a business PayPal account in good standing and with no withdrawal limits.
and
applied for and received our permission to use these services.

We may remove your ability to use Payouts or Mass Pay at any time if there is a higher than acceptable level of risk associated with your use of those services.
The amount you will pay us for these services differs according to whether you use the Payouts service or Mass Pay service, how you send the payments, and the currency of the payment.
These fees can be found in the PayPal Payouts and Mass Pay Fees table.
You can send money through Payouts or Mass Pay even if your receiver does not have a PayPal or Venmo account, as applicable, using their email address or mobile number.
If the person to whom you are sending money does not have a relevant account, they can claim it by opening one.
If they donât claim it, it will be refunded to you in thirty (30) days.
PayPal is not liable for amounts sent by you in error.
PayPal shall have no responsibility to reverse any payout payment.

  Your responsibility to notify PayPal of pricing or fee errors Once you have access to any account statement(s) or other account activity information made available to you by PayPal with respect to your business account(s), you will have ninety (90) days to notify PayPal in writing of any errors or discrepancies with respect to the pricing or other fees applied by PayPal.
If you do not notify PayPal within such timeframe, you accept such information as accurate, and PayPal shall have no obligation to make any corrections.
For the purposes of this provision, such pricing or fee errors or discrepancies are different than Unauthorized Transactions and other electronic transfer Errors which are each subject to different notification timeframes as set forth herein. Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks   General information If you receive a payment for selling goods or services that is later refunded or invalidated for any reason, you are responsible for the full amount of the payment sent to you plus any fees (including any applicable chargeback fee or Dispute fee).
Whenever a transaction is refunded or otherwise reversed, PayPal will refund or reverse the transaction from your PayPal account.
If a currency conversion is necessary (for example if the balance in your Cash Account or your business PayPal account for a particular currency is insufficient to cover the amount of a refund or reversal, or if the buyer paid in a different currency), PayPal will perform a currency conversion in order to refund or reverse the transaction.
PayPalâs transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion spread) at the time the refund or reversal is processed will be used.
If you refund a payment for goods or services, there are no fees to make the refund, but the fees you originally paid as the seller are not returned to you.
The amount of the refunded payment will be deducted from your PayPal account.
  Payments that are invalidated and reversed Payments to you may be invalidated and reversed by PayPal if:

You lose a PayPal Purchase Protection claim submitted to us by a buyer, including as a result of your failure to respond in a timely manner.
You lose a Venmo Protected Purchase Program claim.
Your buyer pursues a chargeback related to a card-funded transaction and the transaction is not eligible for PayPal's Seller Protection.
The card issuer, not PayPal, determines whether a buyer is successful when they pursue a chargeback related to a card-funded transaction.
You do not fulfill the transaction as promised or you cannot provide proof of shipment or proof of delivery when required.
eBay decides against you under its money back guarantee program (and you havenât opted out).

PayPal sent the payment to you in error.
The payment was unauthorized
You received the payment for activities that violated this user agreement or any other agreement between you and PayPal.

When you receive a payment, you are liable to PayPal for the full amount of the payment sent to you plus any fees if the payment is later invalidated or reversed for any reason.
If the buyer paid in another currency, the full amount of that payment may be calculated in that currency, using the PayPal transaction exchange rate (including our currency conversion spread) that applies at the time the refund or reversal is processed.
If the balance in your Cash Account or business PayPal account doesnât cover the payment amount due plus the fees, we may use any of the payment methods linked to your PayPal account to cover the amount due.
If the payment methods linked to your PayPal account donât cover the amount due, this will result in a negative balance.
A negative balance represents an amount that you owe to us, and, in this situation, you must immediately add funds to your balance to resolve it.
If you donât, PayPal may:

engage in collection efforts to recover the amount due from you;
take any or all action as outlined under Amounts owed to PayPal.
or
place a limitation or take other action on your PayPal account as outlined under Restricted Activities and Holds.

  Dispute fees PayPal will charge a Dispute fee to sellers for facilitating the online dispute resolution process for transactions that are processed either through a buyerâs PayPal account or through a PayPal guest checkout.
The Dispute fee applies when the buyer pursues a claim directly with PayPal, a chargeback with their card issuer, or a reversal with their bank.
The Dispute fee will be charged at either the Standard Dispute fee rate or the High Volume Dispute fee rate.
The Dispute fee will be charged in the currency which you selected for the original transaction listing.
If the transaction was in a currency not listed in the Dispute fee table, then the fee charged will be in your primary holding currency.
The Dispute fee will be deducted from your PayPal account after the claim is decided.
The Dispute fee amount will be determined when the dispute case is created.
The fee is based on the ratio of the total transaction amount of your claims compared to the total amount of your sales for the previous three calendar months.
For example, for a dispute raised in September, your dispute ratio will be calculated by considering your total claims to sales ratio over June, July, and August.
Your total claims include all claims filed directly with and escalated to PayPal, except claims for Unauthorized Transactions.
and all chargebacks from the buyerâs card issuer or reversals from the buyerâs bank.
If your dispute ratio is 1.5% or more and you had more than 100 sales transactions in the previous three full calendar months, you will be charged the High Volume Dispute fee for each dispute.
Otherwise, you will be charged the Standard Dispute fee for each dispute.
You will 
not
 be charged a Standard Dispute fee for disputes that are:

Inquiries in PayPalâs Resolution Center that are not escalated to a claim with PayPal.
Resolved directly between you and the buyer and not escalated to a claim with PayPal.
Filed by the buyer directly with PayPal as an Unauthorized Transaction.
Eligible for PayPalâs Seller Protection program.
Claims with a transaction value that is less than twice the amount of a Standard Dispute fee.

Inquiries in PayPalâs Resolution Center and not escalated to a claim with PayPal.
Resolved directly between you and the buyer and not escalated to a claim with PayPal.
Filed by the buyer directly with PayPal as an Unauthorized Transaction.

Sellers charged High Volume Dispute fees may be required to provide a remediation plan which includes an explanation of the cause of the increased dispute rate, the actions taken to reduce disputes, and the timelines for those actions.
Disputes listed above may be excluded from being charged a Standard Dispute fee or a High Volume Dispute fee, but the claim itself may still be included in the overall calculation of your dispute ratio.
  Chargeback fees For transactions that are not processed either through a buyerâs PayPal account or through a guest checkout, and where the buyer pursues a chargeback for the transaction with their card issuer, then PayPal will charge you a Chargeback fee for facilitating the chargeback process.
This fee with apply regardless of whether the buyer is successful in pursuing the chargeback with the card issuer. The applicable chargeback fee will be deducted from your PayPal account.
The chargeback fee is applied as specified in the Chargeback Fee table and will be charged in the currency which you selected for the original transaction listing.
If the transaction was in a currency not listed in the Chargeback fee table, the fee charged will be in your primary holding currency.
  Impact of various purchase protection processes on sellers You should read and understand PayPalâs Purchase Protection program, Venmoâs Protected Purchase Program, and if you sell goods and services to buyers with PayPal accounts in countries other than your own, you also should be familiar with the purchase protection available to buyers in each of those countries.
Buyersâ rights under these programs may impact you as a seller.
You can find information about PayPalâs protection programs on the Legal Agreements page by selecting your buyerâs location at the top of the page and referring to the corresponding user agreement.
You can find information on Venmoâs Protected Purchase Program in Venmoâs user agreement.
If you lose a claim under PayPalâs Purchase Protection program in any country, or under Venmoâs Protected Purchase Program:

You must forfeit the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping cost.
In some cases you may not receive the item back.
You will not receive a refund of the PayPal fees that you paid in connection with the sale.
If the claim was that the item received was Significantly Not as Described, you may not receive the item back, or you may be required to accept the item back and pay for the return shipping costs.
If the claim was that the item received was Significantly Not as Described and related to an item you sold that is counterfeit, you will be required to provide a full refund to the buyer and you may not receive the item back.

If you accept PayPal payments from buyers for goods or services you sell through eBay, then you need to read and understand the eBay Money Back Guarantee program.
Unless you opt out by calling eBay, PayPal will treat eBayâs decisions in favor of your buyers under that program as a basis for reversing a PayPal payment made to you.
If the balance in your Cash Account or business PayPal account is insufficient to cover the amount, we may:

place a hold on your PayPal account until sufficient funds become available in your PayPal account to cover the amount.
or
create a negative balance in your PayPal account.
 PayPal's Seller Protection Program   Whatâs eligible If you sell something to a buyer and the transaction is later disputed or reversed under Reversals, Claims or Chargebacks, you may be eligible for reimbursement under PayPalâs Seller Protection program.
When it applies, PayPalâs Seller Protection program entitles you to retain the full purchase amount for debit and credit card-funded transactions.
There is no limit on the number of payments for which you can receive coverage.
By accessing the transaction details page in your PayPal account you can determine whether or not your transaction is eligible for protection under this program.
PayPalâs Seller Protection program may apply when a buyer claims that:

They did not authorize, or benefit from, funds sent from their PayPal account (referred to as an âUnauthorized Transactionâ claim), and the Unauthorized Transaction occurs in an environment hosted by Paypal.
or
They didnât receive the item from you (referred to as an âItem Not Receivedâ claim).

PayPalâs Seller Protection program may also apply when a transaction is reversed because of a successful chargeback by a buyer or when a bank funded payment is reversed by the buyerâs bank.
This section describes PayPalâs Seller Protection program as it applies to you, but you should also be familiar with the Impact of various purchase protection processes on sellers.
  Basic requirements To be eligible for PayPalâs Seller Protection, all of the following basic requirements must be met, as well as any applicable additional requirements:

The primary address for your PayPal account must be in the United States.
The item must be a physical, tangible good that can be shipped, except for items subject to the Intangible Goods Additional Requirements.
Transactions involving items that you deliver in person in connection with payment made in your physical store, may also be eligible for Seller Protection so long as the buyer paid for the transaction in person by using a PayPal goods and services QR code.
You must ship the item to the shipping address on the transaction details page in your PayPal account for the transaction.
If you originally ship the item to the recipient's shipping address on the transaction details page but the item is later redirected to a different address, you will not be eligible for PayPal's Seller Protection.
We therefore recommend not using a shipping service that is arranged by the buyer, so that you will be able to provide valid proof of shipping and delivery.

The shipping requirement does not apply to eligible transactions involving items that you deliver in person.
provided, however, that you agree to provide us with alternative evidence of delivery or such additional documentation or information relating to the transaction that we may request.


You must respond to PayPal's requests for documentation and other information in a timely manner as requested in our email correspondence with you or in our correspondence with you through the Resolution Center.
If you do not respond to PayPalâs request for documentation and other information in the time requested, you may not be eligible for Seller Protection.
If the sale involves pre-ordered or made-to-order goods, you must ship within the timeframe you specified in the listing.
Otherwise, it is recommended that you ship all items within 7 days after receipt of payment.
Provide proof of shipment or delivery.
The payment must be marked âeligibleâ or âpartially eligibleâ in the case of Unauthorized Transaction claims, or âeligibleâ in the case of Item Not Received claims, for PayPal's Seller Protection on the Transaction Details page.

PayPal determines, in its sole discretion, whether your claim qualifies for the Seller Protection program.
PayPal will make a decision, in its sole discretion, based on the coverage and eligibility requirements, any information or documentation provided during the resolution process, or any other information PayPal deems relevant and appropriate under the circumstances.
  Item Not Received additional requirements To be eligible for PayPalâs Seller Protection program for a buyerâs Item Not Received claim, you must meet both the basic requirements and the additional requirements listed below:

Where a buyer files a chargeback with the issuer for a card-funded transaction, the payment must be marked âeligibleâ for PayPalâs Seller Protection on the Transaction Details page.
You must provide proof of delivery as described below.

  Intangible Goods additional requirements For the sale of intangible goods and services to be eligible for PayPalâs Seller Protection, the sale must meet the basic requirements and the following additional requirements: 

Integration requirements
Where you have integrated a PayPal checkout product, you must be using the current version of that product if you are accepting payments directly via a website or mobile optimized website.
or
Ensure you are passing session information to PayPal at checkout if you are integrated with PayPal via a third party or if you have a native app integration.
Other integration requirements may apply depending on your business model.
We will let you know those requirements ahead of time, if needed.
Paid Standard Transaction Fees on the sale.
Delivered the item and provide Proof of shipment or delivery for Intangible Goods.
Provide signature confirmation when the full amount of the payment (including shipping and taxes) exceeds the amount listed in the signature confirmation threshold table (based on the currency of the payment).
If the full amount of the payment (including shipping and taxes) is in a currency not listed in the table, then signature confirmation is required when the payment exceeds the equivalent of $750 USD at the PayPal exchange rate that applies at the time the transaction is processed.

  Establishing proof of delivery or proof of shipment 
Physical Goods
 The following is required as proof of shipment or delivery for physical goods: Proof of shipment
Proof of delivery
Online or physical documentation from a shipping company that includes:

Refuse to provide the PayPal services to you in the future;

You acknowledge and agree that $2,500.00 U.S.
dollars per violation of the Acceptable Use Policy is presently a reasonable minimum estimate of PayPal's actual damages considering all currently existing circumstances, including the relationship of the sum to the range of harm to PayPal that reasonably could be anticipated because, due to the nature of the violations of the Acceptable Use Policy, actual damages would be impractical or extremely difficult to calculate.
PayPal may deduct such damages directly from any existing balance in any PayPal account you control.

You are responsible for all reversals, chargebacks, claims, fees, fines, penalties and other liability incurred by PayPal, any PayPal customer, or a third party caused by or arising out of your breach of this agreement, and/or your use of the PayPal services. Holds, Limitations, and Reserves   What are holds, limitations and reserves Under certain circumstances, in order to protect PayPal and the security and integrity of the network of buyers and sellers that use the PayPal services, PayPal may take account-level or transaction-level actions.
Unless otherwise noted, if we take any of the actions described here, weâll provide you with notice of our actions, but we retain the sole discretion to take these actions.
To request information in connection with an account limitation, hold or reserve, you should visit the Resolution Center or follow the instructions in our email notice with respect to the limitation, hold or reserve.
Our decision about holds, limitations and reserves may be based on confidential criteria that are essential to our management of risk and the protection of PayPal, our customers and/or service providers.
We may use proprietary fraud and risk modeling when assessing the risk associated with your PayPal account.
In addition, we may be restricted by regulation or a governmental authority from disclosing certain information to you about such decisions.
We have no obligation to disclose the details of our risk management or security procedures to you.
In order to facilitate PayPalâs actions described above and allow us to assess the level of risk associated with your PayPal account, you agree to cooperate with PayPalâs reasonable requests for financial statements and other documentation or information in a timely fashion.
  Holds A hold is an action that PayPal may take under certain circumstances either at the transaction level or the account level.
When PayPal places a temporary hold on a payment, the money is not available to either the sender or the recipient.
PayPal reviews many factors before placing a hold on a payment, including: account tenure, transaction activity, business type, past customer disputes, and overall customer satisfaction.
Some common situations where PayPal will hold payments include:

New sellers or sellers who have limited selling activity.
Payments for higher-risk categories like electronics or tickets.
Sellers who have performance issues, or a high rate of buyer dissatisfaction or disputes.


Holds based on PayPalâs risk decisions

We may place a hold on payments sent to your PayPal account if, in our sole discretion, we believe that there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your PayPal account, or your transactions or that placing such a hold is necessary to comply with state or federal regulatory requirements.
We make decisions about whether to place a payment hold based on a number of factors, including information available to us from both internal sources and third parties.
When we place a hold on a payment, the funds will appear in your PayPal account with an indication that they are unavailable or pending.
Weâll notify you, either through your PayPal account or directly by phone or email, whenever we place a hold.
Risk-based holds generally remain in place for up to 21 days from the date the payment was received into your PayPal account.
We may release the hold earlier under certain circumstances (for example, if youâve uploaded shipment tracking information related to the transaction), but any earlier release is at our sole discretion.
The hold may last longer than 21 days if the payment is challenged as a payment that should be invalidated and reversed based on a disputed transaction as discussed in the following paragraph below.
In this case, weâll hold the payment in your PayPal account until the matter is resolved (but no longer than 180 days).

Holds related to Marketplace transactions

If youâre a seller on a marketplace or through a third-party application where PayPal is offered, a hold may be placed on a payment sent to you at the instruction of the applicable marketplace or third party.
This is done once you have granted us permission to have your funds held and will be in accordance with your agreement with the third party.
These holds will appear in your PayPal account.
If you have questions about why the applicable marketplace or third party instructed PayPal to put these holds in place, you will need to contact the marketplace or third party directly.

Holds based on disputed transactions

If a payment sent to you as a seller is challenged as a payment that should be invalidated and reversed, we may place a temporary hold on the funds in your PayPal account to cover the amount that could be reversed.
Any of the situations described under Refunds, Reversals and Chargebacks are situations that could result in us placing a hold on a payment.
If we determine the transaction should not be reversed, weâll lift the temporary hold.
If we determine the transaction should be reversed, weâll remove the funds from your PayPal account.
  Account Limitations Limitations are implemented to help protect PayPal, buyers and sellers when we notice restricted activities, an increased financial risk, or activity that appears to us as unusual or suspicious.
Limitations also help us collect information necessary for keeping your PayPal account open.
There are several reasons why your PayPal account could be limited, including:

If we suspect someone could be using your PayPal account without your knowledge, weâll limit it for your protection and look into the fraudulent activity.
If your debit or credit card issuer alerts us that someone has used your card without your permission.
Similarly, if your bank lets us know that there have been unauthorized transfers between your PayPal account and your bank account.
In order to comply with applicable law.
If we reasonably believe you have breached this agreement or violated the Acceptable Use Policy.
Seller performance indicating your PayPal account is high risk.
Examples include: indications of poor selling performance because youâve received an unusually high number of claims and chargebacks, selling an entirely new or high-cost product type, or if your typical sales volume increases rapidly.

You will need to resolve any issues with your account before a limitation can be removed.
Normally, this is done after you provide us with the information we request.
However, if we reasonably believe a risk still exists after you have provided us that information, we may take action to protect PayPal, our users, a third party, or you from reversals, fees, fines, penalties, legal and/or regulatory risks and any other liability.
  Reserves placed on business PayPal accounts We may place a reserve on your business PayPal account at any time if we believe there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your business PayPal account, your business model, or your transactions.
When we place a reserve on your business PayPal account, it means that all or some portion of the money in your business PayPal account is reserved as unavailable for withdrawal in order to protect against the risk of transactions made by you being reversed or invalidated or any other risk related to your business PayPal account or use of the PayPal services.
We make decisions about whether to place a reserve based on a number of factors, including information available to us from both internal sources and from third parties.
PayPal considers a list of non-exclusive factors and whether and how these factors have changed over time, including:

How long you have been in business.
Whether your industry has a higher likelihood of chargebacks.
Your payment processing history with PayPal and other providers.
Your business and/or personal credit history.
Your delivery time frames.
Whether you have higher than average number of returns, chargebacks, claims or disputes.

There are two types of reserves that may be placed on your business PayPal account, and one or both may be applied at the same time:


A Rolling reserve is a reserve where a percentage of each transaction you receive each day is held and then released later on a scheduled basis.
For example, your reserve could be set at 10% and held for a 90-day rolling period â meaning 10% of the money you receive on day 1 is held and then released on day 91, 10% of the money you receive on day 2 is held until day 92, etc.
Rolling reserves are the most common type of reserve.

A Minimum reserve is a specific minimum amount of money that youâre required to keep available in the balance of your business PayPal account at all times.
The minimum reserve is either taken as an upfront amount deposited all at once or is established on a rolling basis from percentages of sales until the minimum reserve is achieved, much like a rolling reserve.


If we place a reserve on funds in your account, the funds will be shown as "pending" and weâll notify you of the terms of the reserve. If we change the terms of the reserve due to a change in our risk assessment, weâll notify you of the new terms.
 Court Orders, Regulatory Requirements or Other Legal Process If we are notified of a court order or other legal process (including garnishment or any equivalent process) affecting you, or if we otherwise believe we are required to do so in order to comply with applicable law or regulatory requirements, we may be required to take certain actions, including holding payments to/from your PayPal account, placing a reserve or limitation on your PayPal account, or releasing your funds.
We will decide, in our sole discretion, which action is required of us.
Unless the court order, applicable law, regulatory requirement or other legal process requires otherwise, we will notify you of these actions.
We do not have an obligation to contest or appeal any court order or legal process involving you or your PayPal account.
When we implement a hold, reserve or limitation as a result of a court order, applicable law, regulatory requirement or other legal process, the hold, reserve or limitation may remain in place longer than 180 days. PayPal User Agreement Liability for Unauthorized Transactions and Other Errors Protection from Unauthorized Transactions To protect yourself from unauthorized activity in your PayPal account, you should regularly log into your PayPal account and review your PayPal account statement.
PayPal will notify you of each transaction by sending an email to your primary email address on file.
You should review these transaction notifications to ensure that each transaction was authorized and accurately completed.
PayPal will protect you from unauthorized activity in your PayPal account.
When this protection applies, PayPal will cover you for the full amount of the unauthorized activity as long as you cooperate with us and follow the procedures described below.

  What is an Unauthorized Transaction An âUnauthorized Transactionâ occurs when money is sent from your PayPal account that you did not authorize and that did not benefit you.
For example, if someone steals your password, uses the password to access your PayPal account, and sends a payment from your PayPal account, an Unauthorized Transaction has occurred.
  What is not considered an Unauthorized Transaction The following are NOT considered Unauthorized Transactions:

If you give someone access to your PayPal account (by giving them your login information) and they use your PayPal account without your knowledge or permission.
You are responsible for transactions made in this situation.

Also, if your PayPal account statement shows transfers that you did not make, including those made with your PayPal login information or by other means, tell us at once.
If you do not tell us within 60 days after we provided the statement to you, you may not get back any money you lost after the 60 days if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the money if you had told us in time.
If a good reason (such as a long trip or a hospital stay) kept you from telling us, we may extend the time periods. Error Resolution   What is an Error An âErrorâ means the following:

Routine inquiries about the balance in your Cash Account or business PayPal account, or any money waiting to be claimed through your personal PayPal account if you do not have a Cash Account linked to your personal PayPal account.
Requests for duplicate documentation or other information for tax or other recordkeeping purposes.

Box 45950, Omaha, NE 68145-0950.

Notify us as soon as you can, if you think your statement or receipt is wrong or if you need more information about a transfer listed on the statement or receipt.
We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent the FIRST statement on which the problem or error appeared.

If we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing and we do not receive it within 10 Business Days, we may not credit your PayPal account.
For errors involving new PayPal accounts, point-of-sale transactions, or foreign-initiated transactions, we may take up to 90 days to investigate your complaint or question.
For new PayPal accounts, we may take up to 20 Business Days to credit your PayPal account for the amount you think is in error.
We will tell you the results within 3 Business Days after completing our investigation.
If we decide that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation.
You may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation. Processing Errors We will rectify any processing error that we discover.
If the error results in:

You receiving less than the correct amount to which you were entitled, then we will credit your PayPal account for the difference between what you should have received and what you actually received.
You receiving more than the correct amount to which you were entitled, then we will debit your PayPal account for the difference between what you actually received and what you should have received.
Our not completing a transaction on time or in the correct amount, then we will be responsible to you for your losses or damages directly caused by this failure, unless: 
through no fault of ours, you did not have enough available funds to complete the transaction;
our system was not working properly and you knew about the breakdown when you started the transaction.
or
the error was due to extraordinary circumstances outside our control (such as fire, flood or loss of Internet connection), despite our reasonable precautions.



Processing errors are not:

Delays that result from PayPal applying holds, limitations or reserves.
Delays based on a payment review.
Delays described under How to buy something related to the time it may take for a purchase transaction to be completed in some situations.
Your errors in making a transaction (for example, mistyping an amount of money that you are sending).
 Remittance Transfer Errors   What is a Remittance Transfer You may be protected for certain errors when you send money using a PayPal account outside of the U.S.
A âRemittance Transferâ is a transaction that meets the following criteria:

The payment is sent from a personal PayPal account that is used primarily for personal, family or household purposes,
The payment is made for personal, family or household purposes,
The payment is made using the send money feature through your PayPal account,
The payment amount equals or exceeds $15 USD (excluding fees charged to you) or the foreign currency equivalent calculated using exchange rates in effect at the time of the transaction, and
The recipient of the payment has a PayPal account in a country outside the U.S.

Payments that you make at a merchant website or location by selecting PayPal as a payment option are not âRemittance Transfers.â
  What qualifies as a Remittance Transfer Error A âRemittance Transfer Errorâ occurs if:

You paid an incorrect amount to send the Remittance Transfer.
For example, you were charged more than the total shown on the remittance transfer receipt you received (unless the total shown on the receipt was an estimate, and the difference results from application of the actual exchange rate, fees, and taxes).
PayPal made a computational or bookkeeping error, such as a miscalculation of the amount the recipient received.
The amount stated in the remittance transfer receipt was not made available to the recipient, unless: 
we stated in the remittance transfer receipt that we used estimates and the difference in the amount received and the amount stated in the remittance transfer receipt results from application of the actual exchange rate, fees, and taxes, or
the problem was caused by extraordinary circumstances outside our control.


Funds were available to the recipient later than the date of availability that was disclosed to you on the remittance transfer receipt or were not delivered, unless: 
extraordinary circumstances outside our control caused the delay, and we could not reasonably anticipate those circumstances,
delays resulted from fraud screenings, or were caused by requirements of the Office of Foreign Assets Controls or similar requirements, or
you (or someone assisting you) made the transfer with fraudulent intent.


You request documentation or information concerning the Remittance Transfer, such as information required to determine if a Remittance Transfer Error occurred.

  What is not considered a Remittance Transfer Error The following are NOT considered Remittance Transfer Errors:

An inquiry about the status of a Remittance Transfer, except where the funds from the transfer were not made available to a designated recipient by the disclosed date of availability,
A request for information for tax or other recordkeeping purposes,
A change requested by the designated recipient, or
A change in the amount or type of currency received by the designated recipient from the amount or type of currency stated in the disclosure provided you, if we relied on information provided by you in making the disclosure.

  No waiver Our failure to act with respect to a breach of any of your obligations under this user agreement by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.

PayPal does not guarantee continuous, uninterrupted or secure access to any part of the PayPal services, and operation of our websites, software, or systems (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the PayPal services) operated by us or on our behalf may be interfered with by numerous factors outside of our control.
PayPal will make reasonable efforts to ensure that requests for electronic debits and credits involving bank accounts, debit cards, credit cards, and check issuances are processed in a timely manner but PayPal makes no representations or warranties regarding the amount of time needed to complete processing because the PayPal services are dependent upon many factors outside of our control, such as delays in the banking system or the U.S.
or international mail service.
Some states do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties, so the foregoing disclaimers may not apply to you.

Our Agreement


You and PayPal each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and PayPal, including without limitation federal and state statutory claims, common law claims, and those based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.
This Agreement to Arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted.
The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate.


 Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief


You and PayPal agree that each of us may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action or proceeding.
Unless both you and PayPal agree otherwise, the arbitrator(s) may not consolidate or join more than one personâs or partyâs claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a consolidated, representative or class proceeding.
Also, the arbitrator(s) may award relief (including monetary, injunctive and declaratory relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that partyâs individual claim(s).
Any relief awarded cannot affect other PayPal customers.


Arbitration Procedures


Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.
Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator or arbitrators instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited.
However, the arbitrator(s) can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual.
The arbitrator(s) also must follow the terms of this user agreement as a court would.
All issues are for the arbitrator(s) to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate, or the interpretation of the Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief section above, shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide.
The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (referred to as the "AAA") under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate.
The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org.
A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send the other party, by certified mail, a completed Notice of Dispute.
You should send this notice to PayPal at: PayPal, Inc., Attn: Litigation Department, Re: Notice of Dispute, 2211 North First Street, San Jose, CA 95131.
PayPal will send any notice to you to the address we have on file associated with your PayPal account.
it is your responsibility to keep your address up to date.
All information called for in the notice must be provided including a description of the nature and basis of the claims the party is asserting and the relief sought.
If you and PayPal are unable to resolve the claims described in the notice within 30 days after the notice is sent, you or PayPal may initiate arbitration proceedings.
A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's website at www.adr.org.
The arbitration shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location.
If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or PayPal may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and PayPal subject to the discretion of the arbitrator(s) to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant.
In cases where an in-person hearing is held, you and/or PayPal may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator(s) require otherwise.
Any settlement offer made by you or PayPal shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator(s).
The arbitrator(s) will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law.
The arbitrator(s) shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different PayPal customers, but is/are bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same PayPal customer to the extent required by applicable law.
The award of the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.


Costs of Arbitration


Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate.
If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, PayPal will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration.
Any request for payment of fees by PayPal should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and PayPal will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA.
If the value of the relief sought is more than $10,000 and you are able to demonstrate that the costs of accessing arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of accessing a court for purposes of pursuing litigation on an individual basis, PayPal will pay as much of the filing, administration, and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator(s) deem necessary to prevent the cost of accessing the arbitration from being prohibitive.
In the event the arbitrator(s) determine the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse PayPal for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by PayPal on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA's rules.


Severability


With the exception of any of the provisions in the Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief section above, if a court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply.
If a court decides that any of the provisions in the Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief section above is invalid or unenforceable because it would prevent the exercise of a non-waivable right to pursue public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in court.
All other disputes subject to arbitration under the terms of the Agreement to Arbitrate shall be arbitrated under its terms.


Opt-Out Procedure


If you are a new PayPal customer, you can choose to reject this Agreement to Arbitrate by mailing us a written opt-out notice.
The opt-out notice must be postmarked no later than 30 days after the date you accept this user agreement for the first time.
You must mail the opt-out notice to PayPal, Inc., Attn: Litigation Department, 2211 North First Street, San Jose, CA 95131.
For your convenience, we are providing an opt-out notice form you must complete and mail to opt out of this Agreement to Arbitrate.
You must complete this form by providing all the information it calls for, including your name, address, phone number, and the email address(es) used to log in to the PayPal account(s) to which the opt-out applies.
You must sign the opt-out notice for it to be effective.
This procedure is the only way you can opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate.
If you opt out of this Agreement to Arbitrate, all other parts of the user agreement will continue to apply.
Opting out of this Agreement to Arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with us.


Future Amendments to this Agreement to Arbitrate


Notwithstanding any provision in the user agreement to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any amendment to this Agreement to Arbitrate (other than an amendment to any notice address or website link provided herein) in the future, that amendment shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against PayPal prior to the effective date of the amendment.
The amendment shall apply to all other disputes or claims governed by this Agreement to Arbitrate that have arisen or may arise between you and PayPal.
We will notify you of amendments to this Agreement to Arbitrate by posting the amended terms on www.paypal.com at least 30 days before the effective date of the amendments and by providing notice through email.
If you do not agree to these amended terms, you may close your PayPal account within the 30-day period and you will not be bound by the amended terms.

  Consumer fraud warning Weâre always looking for ways to help keep you even more secure.
So stay on the lookout for some of these common scams:

Spoofing: a scammer sends forged or faked electronic documents or emails falsely claiming to be PayPal or coming from PayPal but asks you to send money outside your PayPal account.
Relative in Need: a scammer impersonates a family member (commonly grandchildren) and claims there is an emergency requiring you to send money.
Lottery or Prize: a scammer informs you that youâve won a lottery or prize and must send money in order to claim it.
Debt Collection: a scammer impersonates a debt collector and induces you to send money using threats or intimidation.
Employment Related: a scammer instructs you to send money in connection with a fraudulent offer of employment.

Always use common sense when sending money.
If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
Only send money for yourself and not for others.
Remember that if you donât send the payment through your PayPal account, youâre not covered by PayPal Purchase Protection.
Please let us know immediately if you believe someone is trying to scam or defraud you by contacting us.
  Dormant accounts If you do not log in to your PayPal account for two or more years, PayPal may close your PayPal account and send any funds in the PayPal account, including any balance in a linked Cash Account to your primary address (if we have verified the required identifying information that you have provided to us) or, if required, escheat (send) those funds to your state of residency.
PayPal will determine your state of residency based on the state listed in the primary address for your PayPal account.
If your address is unknown or registered in a foreign country, the funds in your PayPal account, including any balance in a linked Cash Account will be escheated to the State of Delaware.
Where required, PayPal will send you a notice prior to escheating any funds in your PayPal account, including any balance in a linked Cash Account.
If you fail to respond to this notice, the funds in your PayPal account, including any balance in a linked Cash Account will be escheated to the applicable state.

 requiring you to take steps to confirm ownership of your email address or financial instruments;
 ordering a credit report from a credit reporting agency, or verifying your information against third party databases or through other source.
or
 requiring you to provide your driverâs license or other identifying documents.
