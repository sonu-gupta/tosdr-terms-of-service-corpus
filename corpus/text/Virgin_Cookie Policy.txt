Do we use any third-party cookies?

Because the Virgin Group and Richard Branson have a strong presence on various social networks, we try to make it as easy as possible to share content and to see what content is popular on those networks.
We add buttons to allow people to easily share to those networks.
When we include these social 'plugins', it gives those sites the flexibility to use their own cookies.
They can't read any cookies we set from the Website, and we can't read any cookies they set, but it lets them do the same kind of traffic measuring that we do on the rest of the Website (and it also lets them know whether you're logged into their site).

Other sites and services (including, for example, advertising networks, providers of external services like web traffic analysis services and content recommendation engines) may also use cookies, over which we have no control.
These cookies are likely to be analytical and performance cookies or advertising and targeting cookies and we use these to improve your experience on the Website.
