DISPUTE RESOLUTION SECTION



In the unlikely event that we have a legal dispute, here is how the Parties agree to proceed, except where prohibited by applicable law.


Any Subsection in this Dispute Resolution Section that is prohibited by law shall not apply to the users residing in that jurisdiction, including Subsections 15b, 15c, 15d, and 15e, which shall not apply to users residing within the EU, EEA, UK, or Switzerland.
The online dispute settlement platform of the European Commission is available under http://ec.europa.eu/odr.
Hinge does not take part in dispute settlement procedures in front of a consumer arbitration entity for users residing in the EU, EEA, UK, or Switzerland .

15a.
INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS

If you are dissatisfied with our Services for any reason, please contact Hinge Customer Service first so we can try to resolve your concerns without the need of outside assistance.
If you choose to pursue a dispute, claim or controversy against Hinge, these terms will apply.
For purposes of this Dispute Resolution Process and Arbitration Procedures set forth in Section 15, âHingeâ shall include our affiliates, employees, licensors, and service providers.
Hinge values its relationship with you and appreciates the mutual benefit realized from informally resolving Disputes (as defined below).
Before formally pursuing a Dispute in arbitration or small claims court, you agree to first send a detailed notice (âNoticeâ) to Match Group Legal, P.O.
Box 25458, Dallas, Texas 75225, USA.
If Hinge has a Dispute with you, Hinge agrees to first send a Notice to you at your most recent email address on file with us, or if no email address is on file, other contact information associated with your account.
Your Notice must contain all of the following information: (1) your full name.
(2) information that enables Hinge to identify your account, including a picture or screenshot of your profile, your address, mobile phone number, email address, and date of birth you used to register your account if any.
and (3) a detailed description of your Dispute, including the nature and factual basis of your claim(s) and the relief you are seeking with a corresponding calculation of your alleged damages (if any).
You must personally sign this Notice for it to be effective.
Hingeâs Notice must likewise set forth a detailed description of its Dispute, which shall include the nature and factual basis of its claim(s) and the relief it is seeking, with a corresponding calculation of our damages (if any).
You and Hinge agree to then negotiate in good faith in an effort to resolve the Dispute.
As part of these good faith negotiations, if Hinge requests a telephone conference with you to discuss your Dispute, you agree to personally participate, with your attorney if youâre represented by counsel.
Likewise, if you request a telephone conference to discuss Hingeâs Dispute with you, Hinge agrees to have one representative participate.
This informal process should lead to a resolution of the Dispute.
However, if the Dispute is not resolved within 60 days after receipt of a fully completed Notice and the Parties have not otherwise mutually agreed to an extension of this informal dispute resolution time period, you or Hinge may initiate an arbitration (subject to a Partyâs right to elect small claims court as provided below).
Completion of this informal dispute resolution is a condition precedent to filing any demand for arbitration or small claims court action.
Failure to do so is a breach of this Agreement.
The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines will be tolled while you and Hinge engage in this informal dispute resolution process.
Unless prohibited by applicable law, the arbitration provider, National Arbitration and Mediation (âNAMâ), shall not accept or administer any demand for arbitration and shall administratively close any arbitration unless the Party bringing such demand for arbitration can certify in writing that the terms and conditions of this informal dispute resolution process were fully satisfied.
A court of competent jurisdiction shall have authority to enforce this provision and to enjoin any arbitration proceeding or small claims court action.

15b.
INDIVIDUAL RELIEF: CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWABLE BY LAW, YOU AND HINGE EACH WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE DISPUTES IN COURT IN FAVOR OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION (EXCEPT FOR SMALL CLAIMS COURT AS PROVIDED ABOVE).
YOU AND HINGE EACH WAIVE THE RIGHT TO FILE OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST THE OTHER OR OTHERWISE TO SEEK RELIEF ON A CLASS BASIS, INCLUDING ANY CURRENTLY PENDING ACTIONS AGAINST HINGE.
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWABLE BY LAW, THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY CLAIMS TO BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, CONSOLIDATED, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL BASIS.
THE ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD THE SAME RELIEF AVAILABLE IN COURT PROVIDED THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY ONLY AWARD FINAL RELIEF (INCLUDING INJUNCTIVE OR DECLARATORY RELIEF) IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE FINAL RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT INDIVIDUAL PARTYâS CLAIM.
THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT AWARD FINAL RELIEF FOR, AGAINST, OR ON BEHALF OF ANYONE WHO IS NOT A PARTY TO THE ARBITRATION ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL BASIS.
IF A COURT DETERMINES THAT ANY OF THESE PROHIBITIONS IN THIS PARAGRAPH ARE UNENFORCEABLE AS TO A PARTICULAR CLAIM OR REQUEST FOR RELIEF (SUCH AS A REQUEST FOR PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF), AND ALL APPEALS OF THAT DECISION ARE EXHAUSTED OR THE DECISION IS OTHERWISE FINAL, THEN YOU AND HINGE AGREE THAT THAT PARTICULAR CLAIM OR REQUEST FOR RELIEF SHALL PROCEED IN COURT BUT SHALL BE STAYED PENDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION OF THE REMAINING CLAIMS FOR RELIEF THAT YOU HAVE BROUGHT.
IF THIS SPECIFIC PARAGRAPH IS FOUND TO BE UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE ENTIRETY OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION (EXCEPT FOR THE JURY TRIAL WAIVER AND THE INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS) SHALL BE NULL AND VOID.
THIS PARAGRAPH IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.

15c.
DISPUTE RESOLUTION THROUGH ARBITRATION OR SMALL CLAIMS COURT

Any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Hinge (that is not resolved informally by Hinge Customer Service or as provided under subsection 15a above) that arises from or relates in any way to this Agreement (including any alleged breach of this Agreement), the Services, or our relationship with you (collectively, âDisputeâ), shall be exclusively resolved through BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION except as specifically provided otherwise in this Dispute Resolution Section.
âDisputeâ as used in this Agreement shall have the broadest possible meaning and include claims that arose before the existence of this or any prior Agreement and claims that arise during the term of this Agreement or after the termination of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Hinge may elect to have an individual claim heard in small claims court.
If the request to proceed in small claims court is made after an arbitration has been initiated but before an arbitrator has been appointed, such arbitration shall be administratively closed.
Any controversy over the small claims courtâs jurisdiction shall be determined by the small claims court.
All other issues (except as otherwise provided herein) are exclusively for the Arbitrator to decide, including but not limited to scope and enforceability of this Dispute Resolution Section, as well as any request to proceed in small claims court that is made after an arbitrator has been appointed.
If you or Hinge challenges the small claims court election in your Dispute, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the small claims court election is unenforceable, then such election shall be severed from this Agreement as to your Dispute.
However, such court determination shall not be considered or deemed binding with respect to Hingeâs other contracting parties.
Any court proceeding to enforce this Dispute Resolution Section 15, including any proceeding to confirm, modify, or vacate an arbitration award, must be commenced in accordance with Section 17.
In the event Dispute Resolution Section 15 is for any reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against Hinge (except for small claims court actions) may be commenced only in the federal or state courts located in Dallas County, Texas.
You hereby irrevocably consent to those courtsâ exercise of personal jurisdiction over you for such purposes and waive any claim that such courts constitute an inconvenient forum.

15d.
INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND MASS ARBITRATION PROTOCOLS

This subsection 15d applies to Disputes that are submitted to NAM after fully completing the informal Notice and Dispute resolution process described in subsection 15a above and when no small claims court election is made by either Party.
Any arbitration between you and Hinge shall be administered by NAM in accordance with NAMâs operative Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (the âNAM Rulesâ) in effect at the time any demand for arbitration is filed with NAM, as modified by this Dispute Resolution Section 15.
For a copy of the NAM Rules, please visit https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms or contact NAM at NAMâs National Processing Center at 990 Stewart Avenue, 1st Floor, Garden City, NY 11530 and email address commercial@namadr.com.
If NAM is unable or unwilling to perform its duties under this Agreement, the parties shall mutually agree on an alternative administrator that will replace NAM and assume NAMâs role consistent with this Agreement.
If the parties are unable to agree, they will petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint an administrator that will assume NAMâs duties under this Agreement.
The Parties agree that the following procedures will apply to any Arbitrations initiated under this Dispute Resolution Section:


1.
Commencing an Arbitration
 â To initiate an arbitration, you or Hinge shall send to NAM a demand for arbitration (âDemand for Arbitrationâ) that describes the claim(s) and request for relief in detail, consistent with the requirements in this Agreement and NAM Rules.
If you send a Demand for Arbitration, you shall also send it to Hinge at Match Group Legal, P.O.
Box 25458, Dallas, Texas 75225, USA, within 10 days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration to NAM.
If Hinge sends a Demand for Arbitration, we will also send it to your mailing address on file with us within the same 10-day period.
If your mailing address is unavailable, we will send it to your email address on file, or if no email address is on file, other contact information associated with your account.
The arbitration provider shall not accept or administer any demand for arbitration and shall administratively close any such demand for arbitration that fails to certify in writing that the Party meets the requirements of Dispute Resolution Section 15 or if either Party elects small claims court as set forth above.


2.
Fees
â The payment of all fees shall be governed by the NAM Rules, except to the extent that the case is a part of a Mass Filing (as defined below) or the NAM fees and costs (including Arbitrator fees) paid by either Party are reallocated upon order of the Arbitrator following a determination that (a) either Party breached Section 15 of this Agreement, (b) such reallocation is called for under this Agreement, or (c) reallocation is otherwise permitted under applicable law.
Upon a showing to Hinge of your financial hardship we will consider a good faith request made by you to pay your portion of the applicable consumer portion of the filing fee.
Hinge is committed to ensuring that arbitration costs to consumers do not serve as a barrier to the adjudication of disputes.
If Hinge initiates an arbitration against you, we shall pay all fees.


3.
The Arbitrator
 â The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator (the âClaim Arbitratorâ), as assisted by any Process Arbitrator appointed under NAM Rules.
(The term âArbitratorâ applies to both the Claim Arbitrator and the Process Arbitrator).
If a hearing is elected by either Party, the Arbitrator shall be in or close to the location in which you reside.
The Arbitrator is bound by and shall adhere to this Agreement.
In the event NAM Rules conflict with this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control.
If the Arbitrator determines that strict application of any term of Section 15 of this Agreement (except for the small claims election, which shall be determined by the small claims court) would result in a fundamentally unfair arbitration (the âUnfair Termâ), then the Arbitrator shall have authority to modify the Unfair Term to the extent necessary to ensure a fundamentally fair arbitration that is consistent with the Terms of Use (the âModified Termâ).
In determining the substance of a Modified Term, the Arbitrator shall select a term that comes closest to expressing the intention of the Unfair Term.


4.
Dispositive Motions
â The Parties agree that the Claim Arbitrator shall have the authority to consider dispositive motions without an oral evidentiary hearing.
Dispositive motions may be requested under the following circumstances: (a) within 30 days after the Claim Arbitratorâs appointment, a Party may request to file a dispositive motion based upon the pleadings.
and (b) no later than 30 days prior to the evidentiary hearing, a Party may request to file a dispositive motion for summary judgment based upon the Partiesâ pleadings and the evidence submitted.


5.
Discovery
âEach Party may (a) serve up to five requests for relevant, non-privileged documents from the other Party.
and (b) request that the other Party provide verified responses to no more than 5 relevant interrogatories (including subparts).
Unless both Parties agree otherwise, no other forms of discovery (including depositions) may be utilized.
Any such discovery requests must be served on the other Party within 21 days after the Claim Arbitratorâs appointment.
The responding Party shall provide the requesting Party with all responsive, non-privileged documents, responses signed by the Party themselves to the requested interrogatories, and/or any objections to the requests within 30 days after receipt of the requests, or, in the event of an objection to any discovery request, 30 days after the Claim Arbitrator resolves the dispute.
In the event either Party requests that the Claim Arbitrator consider a dispositive motion on the pleadings, such written discovery response deadlines shall be extended until 30 days following the Claim Arbitratorâs final decision on such dispositive motion.
Any disputes about discovery or requests for extensions shall be submitted promptly to the Claim Arbitrator for resolution.
In ruling on any discovery dispute or extension request, the Claim Arbitrator shall take into consideration the nature, amount, and scope of the underlying arbitration claim, the cost and other effort that would be involved in providing the requested discovery, the case schedule, and whether the requested discovery is necessary for the adequate preparation of a claim or defense.


6.
Confidentiality
 â Upon either Partyâs request, the Arbitrator will issue an order requiring that confidential information of either Party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted court filing of confidential information must be done under seal.


7.
Arbitration Hearing
 â You and Hinge are entitled to a fair evidentiary hearing (i.e.
trial) before the Claim Arbitrator.
Arbitration proceedings are usually simpler, less costly, and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings.
The Parties agree to waive all oral hearings and instead submit all disputes to the Claim Arbitrator for an award based on written submissions and other evidence as the Parties may agree, unless a Party requests an oral hearing within 10 days after the Respondent files a response.
If an oral evidentiary hearing is requested, both Parties must be personally present at the hearing, regardless of whether either Party has retained counsel.
Both Parties must personally attend the hearing.
Either Partyâs failure to personally attend the hearing, without a continuance ordered by the Claim Arbitrator for good cause, will result in a default judgment taken against that Party.


8.
Arbitration Award
 â Regardless of the format of the arbitration, the Claim Arbitrator shall provide a reasoned decision, in writing within 30 days after the hearing or, if no hearing is held, within 30 days after any rebuttal or supplemental statements are due.
The decision must clearly specify the relief, if any, awarded and contain a brief statement of the reasons for the award.
The arbitration award is binding only between you and Hinge and will not have any preclusive effect in another arbitration or proceeding that involves a different Party.
The Claim Arbitrator may, however, choose to consider rulings from other arbitrations involving a different Party.
The Arbitrator may award fees and costs as provided by the NAM Rules or to the extent such fees and costs could be awarded in court.
This includes but is not limited to the ability of the Arbitrator to award fees and costs if the Arbitrator determines that a claim or defense is frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose, for the purpose of harassment, or in bad faith.


9.
Offer of Settlement
 â The Respondent may, but is not obligated to, make a written settlement offer to the opposing Party any time before the evidentiary hearing or, if a dispositive motion is permitted, prior to the dispositive motion being granted.
The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the Claim Arbitrator until after the Claim Arbitrator issues an award on the claim.
If the award is issued in the opposing Partyâs favor and is less than the Respondentâs settlement offer or if the award is in the Respondentâs favor, the opposing Party must pay the Respondentâs costs incurred after the offer was made, including any attorneyâs fees.
If any applicable statute or caselaw prohibits the flipping of costs incurred in the arbitration, then the offer in this provision shall serve to cease the accumulation of any costs that claimant may be entitled to for the cause of action under which it is suing.


10.
Mass Filing
 â If, at any time, 25 or more similar demands for arbitration are asserted against Hinge or related parties by the same or coordinated counsel or entities (âMass Filingâ), consistent with the definition and criteria of Mass Filings set forth in the NAMâs Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (âNAMâs Mass Filing Rulesâ, available at https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/), the additional protocols set forth below shall apply.
i.
If you or your counsel file a Demand for Arbitration that fits within the definition of Mass Filing referred to above, then you agree that your Demand for Arbitration shall be subject to the additional protocols set forth in this Mass Filing subsection.
You also acknowledge that the adjudication of your Dispute might be delayed and that any applicable statute of limitations shall be tolled from the time at which the first cases are chosen to proceed until your case is chosen for a bellwether proceeding.
ii.
NAMâs Mass Filing Rules shall apply if your Dispute is deemed by NAM, in its sole discretion pursuant to its Rules and this Dispute Resolution Section, to be part of a Mass Filing.
Such election for NAMâs Mass Filing Rules and related fee schedule must be made by either you or Hinge in writing and submitted to NAM and all Parties.
iii.

Bellwether Proceedings. Bellwether proceedings are encouraged by courts and arbitration administrators when there are multiple disputes involving similar claims against the same or related parties.
Counsel for the Mass Filings claimants (including you) and counsel for Hinge shall each select 15 Demands for Arbitration (30 total), and no more than 30 arbitrations shall be filed, processed, adjudicated, or pending at the same time, with each of the 30 individual arbitrations presided over by a different Claim Arbitrator, in a first set of bellwether proceedings.
During this time, no other Demands for arbitration that are part of the Mass Filings may be filed, processed, adjudicated, or pending.
If the Parties are unable to resolve the remaining Demands for Arbitration after the first set of bellwether proceedings are arbitrated or otherwise resolved, then counsel for the Claimants and counsel for Hinge shall each select an additional 15 Demands for Arbitration (30) total to be filed, processed, and adjudicated as individual arbitrations, with each of the 30 arbitrations presided over by a different Claim Arbitrator, in a second set of bellwether proceedings.
During this time, no other Demands for Arbitration that are part of the Mass Filings may be filed, processed, or adjudicated.
This staged process of bellwether proceedings, with each set including 30 Demands for Arbitration adjudicated on an individual basis, shall continue until each Demand included in the Mass Filings (including your Demand for Arbitration) is adjudicated or otherwise resolved.
Fees associated with a Demand for Arbitration included in the Mass Filings, including fees owed by Hinge and the claimants (including you), shall only be due after your Demand for Arbitration is chosen as part of a set of bellwether proceedings and therefore properly designated for filing, processing, and adjudication.
Any applicable statute of limitations shall be tolled beginning when you initiate the informal dispute resolution process set forth in subsection 15a of the Agreement, and if the first Mass Filingsâ Demands for Arbitration are chosen for the initial set of bellwether proceedings have been filed, your claims will remain tolled until your Demand for Arbitration is decided, withdrawn, or is settled.
A court of competent jurisdiction located in a venue allowed under Section 17 of the Agreement shall have the power to enforce this subsection.

iv.
You and Hinge agree that we each value the integrity and efficiency of the arbitration and small claims court process and wish to employ the process for the fair resolution of genuine and sincere disputes between us.
You and Hinge acknowledge and agree to act in good faith to ensure the fair resolution of genuine and sincere Disputes.
The Parties further agree that application of these Mass Filings procedures have been reasonably designed to result in an efficient and fair adjudication of such cases.

15e.
FUTURE CHANGES AND RETROACTIVE APPLICATION

This Dispute Resolution Section 15 applies to all Disputes between the Parties, including for any claims that accrued against you or Hinge prior to the time of your consent to this Agreement and to any claims that accrue against you or Hinge after your consent to this Agreement.

Also, regardless of whether you opt out of the retroactive application of these changes, the Parties will resolve any claims that accrue against you or Hinge after your consent to this Agreement in accordance with this Dispute Resolution Section.

16.
GOVERNING LAW



Texas law and the Federal Arbitration Act will apply to any Dispute (except where prohibited by law).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Dispute Resolution Process set forth in Section 15 shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.

17.
VENUE/FORUM SELECTION



To the fullest extent allowable by law, any claims that are not arbitrated for any reason must be litigated in Dallas County, Texas (except for claims filed in small claims court, or for users residing in the EU, EEA, UK or Switzerland or another jurisdiction where prohibited by law).

You and Hinge consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of courts in the State of Texas and waive any claim that such courts constitute an inconvenient forum.
