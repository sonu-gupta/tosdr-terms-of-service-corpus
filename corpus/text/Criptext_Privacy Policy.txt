Personal Information We CollectInformation you give us
Personal information that you may provide through the Services or otherwise communicate with us includes:


Registration and profile information. When you register or subscribe to any of the Services, you provide us with information such as your first name, last name, recovery email, username and password.
You may optionally provide us, all in accordance with applicable laws, the email addresses in your mobile address book on a regular basis.
You may also add other information to your account, such as a profile picture.

Email data. When you use our Services to send an email, we process your email address, recipientâs email address, subject and the encrypted content of your messages (including body and attachments).
Once messages are delivered to your device, they are deleted from our servers.
The same holds true for messages which you send.
Your messages are permanently stored on your own device and not on our servers.
If a message cannot be delivered immediately (for example, if you are offline or the device is powered off), we may keep it on our servers for up to 30 days.
After the 30-day period the message is deleted from our server.
We also keep email metadata (subject, date and sender email address) in order to enable certain features of the Services, such as the âunsendâ, âread receiptsâ and âexpirationâ features.

Feedback and correspondence information. You provide us information in your responses to surveys, and when you participate in market research activities, report a problem with the Services, receive customer support or otherwise correspond with us.

Transaction details. When you make purchases through the Services, you provide us with billing and payment information.
We use a third-party payment provider to process payment card transactions.
We collect the transaction details only (e.g., the invoice ID, and the date and amount of purchase).


Information automatically collected



Usage And Log Information. We may also automatically log information about your use of the Services, including the number of messages sent collectively by all users through the Services.
For example, we may log how many emails are sent per day and what kind of file formats are shared in attachments.

Email Data. When a normal, unencrypted email is sent to you by a non-Criptext sender, the email gets encrypted by the server with your public key and can only be decrypted by your device.
The same holds true for attachments that are sent to you from non-Criptext addresses.
This means that your emails are always encrypted, even if the sender is not using Criptext.

Device And Connection Information. We may automatically log information about you and your computer or mobile device when you access our Services.
This includes information like hardware model, operating system information, battery level, signal strength, app version, browser information, and mobile network, connection information including mobile operator or ISP, language and time zone, and IP.
This is to help us identify bugs and deliver better help to users who contacts us with support questions.

Cookies. We use cookies only in our Website.
We may also use cookies to understand which of our FAQs are most popular and to show you relevant content related to our Services.
Additionally, we may use cookies to remember your choices, like your language preferences, to provide a safer experience, and otherwise to customize our Services for you.
Please refer to the Cookies and Similar Technologies section for more details.
