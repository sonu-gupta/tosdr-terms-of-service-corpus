Flat approach to privacy 
1.1	We operate a service which allows you to create, edit, share and collaborate on music scores using our website located at flat.io, the Flat application (available for download on your mobile device), through APIs, and through third parties (the âServiceâ).

1.2	We appreciate your interest in our Service.
Privacy protection is very important to us and we are committed to protecting you and respecting your privacy.
This privacy policy sets out information about how we collect, store, process, transfer, share and use data that identifies or is associated with you when providing our Service (hereinafter âpersonal informationâ).

1.3	You should also be aware that we use cookies to store and access information whilst providing access to our site or our app.
You can find out more about our use of cookies below.

1.4	The Service is operated by Tutteo Limited (âFlatâ, âweâ, âourâ or âusâ) and we act as a data controller in relation to the personal information we hold about you. 2.
Personal information we collect about you and how we use it

any organisation that owns or controls us) and any subsidiaries they own.
These companies will only use your personal information in the same way as we can under this privacy policy.

(c)	Service providers and advisors: third parties who provide a service to us.
For example, third party service providers either provide IT infrastructure or help support it, help us to provide you with support in relation to the Service, process payments from you on our behalf, develop analytical information for us about our products and services and provide professional services such as legal and accountancy services.
These third parties will only be allowed to use your personal information in accordance with our instructions and will be required to keep your information secure.

5.4	International Transfers of your Personal Information: the personal information we collect may be transferred to and stored in countries outside of the jurisdiction you are in where we and our third party service providers have operations.
Some of these countries offer differing levels of protection in respect of personal information and may, in certain instances, be less protective than the country you are typically resident in.
These international transfers of your personal information will be made pursuant to appropriate safeguards, such as the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield framework or standard data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission.
If you wish to enquire further about these safeguards used, please contact us using the details set out at the end of this privacy policy.
We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is treated securely and in accordance with applicable law and this privacy policy. 6.
