Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration: PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.


a.
Agreement to Arbitrate

This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred to in this Terms of Use as the âArbitration Agreement.â You agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Y Combinator, whether arising out of or relating to this Terms of Use (including any alleged breach thereof), the Site, any advertising, any aspect of the relationship or transactions between us, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify.
Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf.
You agree that, by entering into this Terms of Use, you and Y Combinator are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.
Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury.
The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.

b.
Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief



YOU AND Y COMBINATOR AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.
UNLESS BOTH YOU AND Y COMBINATOR AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSONâS OR PARTYâS CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING.
ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTYâS INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).



c.
Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution

Y Combinator is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most user concerns can be resolved quickly and to the userâs satisfaction by emailing us at yclegal@ycombinator.com.
If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (âNoticeâ).
The Notice to Y Combinator should be sent to Y Combinator Management, LLC, 335 Pioneer Way, Mountain View, CA 94041 Attention General Counsel (âNotice Addressâ).
The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought.
If Y Combinator and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Y Combinator may commence an arbitration proceeding.
During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Y Combinator or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Y Combinator is entitled.

d.
Arbitration Procedures

Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Associationâs (âAAAâ) rules and procedures (collectively, the âAAA Rulesâ), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.
For information on the AAA, please visit its website, http://www.adr.org.
If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration.
The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms of Use as a court would.
All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement.
Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under the Terms of Use and applicable law.
Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.
Unless Y Combinator and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances.
If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination shall be made by AAA.
If your claim is for $10,000 or less, Y Combinator agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.
If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.

e.
Costs of Arbitration

Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the âArbitration Feesâ) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement.

f.
Confidentiality

All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.

g.
Severability

If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection (b) titled âProhibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Reliefâ above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified.
If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of subsection (b) above titled âProhibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Reliefâ are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void.
The remainder of the Terms of Use will continue to apply.

h.
Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement

Notwithstanding any provision in this Terms of Use to the contrary, Y Combinator agrees that if it makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a user of the Site, you may reject any such change by sending Y Combinator written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above.
By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted these Terms of Use (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Use).

Y Combinator may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Site, or any part thereof, with or without notice.
You agree that any termination of your access to the Site under any provision of this Terms of Use may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that Y Combinator may (but has obligation to) immediately deactivate or delete your account and all related information and files in your account and/or bar any further access to such files or the Site.

General

The failure of Y Combinator to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

The section titles in these Terms of Use are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
