COLLECTION TECHNOLOGIES
In providing Services to our Customers and operating our Marketing Platforms, we, along with our third party partners, may use certain technologies including cookies, E-Tags, JavaScript, beacons and Local Storage, such as HTML5.
Our third party partners may also use Local Shared Objects (LSOs), such as Flash.


A cookie is a small piece of text that is sent to a browser.
The browser provides this piece of text to the originating server when the visitor returns.
Such cookies may be either âfirst party cookiesâ or âthird party cookiesâ.

âFirst-party cookiesâ are such cookies that contain the same domain on which the cookie is placed (e.g.
AppsFlyer places an appsflyer.com cookie on appsflyer.com).
âThird-party cookiesâ are cookies that contain a domain that is different to the domain on which it is placed (e.g.
a third party ad provider places an abc.ads.com cookie on appsflyer.com).

Most web browsers are initially configured to accept cookies, but you can change this setting so your browser either refuses certain cookies or all cookies, or informs you when a cookie is being sent.
Also, you are free to delete any existing cookies at any time.
Please note that some features of our Marketing Platform or Services may not function properly when cookies are disabled or removed.

E-Tag is a technology that is part of the standard HTTP protocol that allows websites to validate temporary storage (cache) of pages and images.
This ensures that you are viewing the latest version of a website since your last visit.
JavaScript is a dynamic object-oriented computer programming language.
JavaScript is used to understand user actions on our website and, when used by our customers, on our customers websites.
Local Storage (LS), such as HTML5, and Local Shared Objects (LSOs), such as Flash, are used to store content information and preferences.
Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSâs.
Beacons are clear graphic image(s) of 1Ã1 pixel that is delivered through a web browser, usually as part of a webpage request.
Web beacons operate as a tag that records an end userâs visit to a particular webpage.

Capitalized terms herein that are undefined shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Website Privacy Policy or Service Privacy Policy.


USE OF COLLECTION TECHNOLOGIES

On our Marketing Platforms (to which the Website Privacy Policy applies):
Collection Technologies help us provide to users of our Marketing Platforms enhanced functionality and better user experience by remembering user preferences and measuring user actions across the Marketing Platforms.
For example, by understanding what a website visitor has clicked on, or the pages visited, we are able to better
understand what on our website is working and what is not and make appropriate changes to ensure our visitors have the best user experience when learning about and purchasing our Services.
Additionally, we may use certain third-party marketing and advertising networks (âThird Party Network(s)â) to help us market our products on our own website and on third party websites (e.g.
re-marketing ads across the Internet by Google).
In connection with the services provided by such Third Party Networks, we or the Third Party
Network may use first-party cookies and/or third-party cookies. The cookies we use can be categorized into the following categories:

Strictly Necessary Cookies: These cookies are necessary for website functionality.
They are usually only set in response to actions made by you (settings you choose, logging in or filling in forms).
You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the website will then not work.
These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information.
Performance Cookies: These cookies allow us to measure and improve the performance of our Marketing Platforms.
They help us know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the website. 
Functional Cookies: These cookies enable us to provide enhanced functionality and personalization through our Marketing Platforms.
They may be set by us or by third party providers whose services we use.
If you do not allow these cookies, then some or all of these services may not function properly.
Targeted Cookies: These cookies may be set through our website by Third Party Networks.
They may be used by those Third Party Networks to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant advertisements on other websites.
They do not store directly personal information, but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device.
If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.


As part of the Services provided to our Customers (to which the Service Privacy Policy applies):We may use Collection Technologies when our Customers use our Services in order to provide the Services to our Customers.
Such Collection Technologies may be provided, among other ways, through software development kits included in our Customers mobile application, redirect links implemented by our Customers in their advertisements, cookies (first-party or third-party) and JavaScript tags implemented on their websites.
Please visit our Services Privacy Policy for more information.
