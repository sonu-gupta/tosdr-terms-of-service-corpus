In certain situations, Care2 may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us to not sell your personal information at any time (the "right to opt-out").
We do not sell the personal information of consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the "right to opt-in") from either the consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age.
Consumers who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time.
To exercise the right to opt-out, you (or your authorized representative) may submit a request to us by contacting Care2 support and asking to opt-out of personal information sales: Care2 Support Request Form.
Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize personal information sales.
However, you may change your mind and opt back in to personal information sales at any time by contacting Care2 support and asking to opt-in to personal information sales: Care2 Support Request Form.

How do I change or delete my personal information?

Please contact Care2 using the Help Request Form.

Will Care2 use my information for direct e-mailings?

Care2 offers e-mail subscriptions describing action alerts, petition success stories, new site features, and more, including commercial and non-commercial offers.
If you do not want to receive any of our optional mailings, simply opt out of them when registering to become a member or during other subscription opportunities, or click the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of any Care2 email that you receive.
If you sign a petition on ThePetitionSite.com, you will automatically receive emailed news updates about the petition and other important causes.
Regardless of the above, Care2 may send occasional emailed messages, such as critical service announcements or other correspondence, to all registered members.
To stop all such announcements, you must delete your account.
You may do so by following this link.
Care2 also offers optional mailings from our partner nonprofit organizations and from commercial entities.
If you elect to receive any of these newsletters, some personal information, including your name and email address, will be sent to the respective nonprofit or commercial entity delivering the newsletter.
In these cases, Care2 would no longer be able to track and control the user information.
The user would be able to contact the newsletter publishers in order to control subscription preferences.

Does Care2 use Tracking Technologies?

Yes, cookies and other tracking technologies are used on Care2 in several ways.

As is true of most web sites, Care2.com gathers certain information automatically.
This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.
We do link this automatically collected data to other information collected about site visitors.
Care2 and its partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users' movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our website or service.

Does Care2 sell e-mail addresses to advertisers?

We would only provide user email addresses to nonprofit or advertising partners with the user's direct permission.
We respect your privacy and despise spam.
As mentioned above, in some cases you may opt to receive nonprofit partner newsletters or other commercial offers.
When you opt to receive such an offer via Care2, we will send your email address and other necessary contact information to the newsletter publisher.
Depending on the newsletter, this may result in a fee paid to Care2.
Care2 will never offer newsletter subscriptions from, or reveal your address information to, organizations known to be spammers, casinos, or adult-content providers.
Why then do some people receive spam at an email address they have only used on Care2? In many cases, spammers create a "dictionary attack" by combining common names and initials to create a list of email addresses that might or might not work.
In many cases, Care2 members send email from a Care2 account's email address to a friend or family member whose computer gets a virus or whose email account is hacked, resulting in private email addresses being revealed to the spammer.
In other cases, two people have similar addresses, perhaps differing by only 1-2 characters, and one user makes a typographic mistake that results in the other user's address.
The bottom line is that if you receive spam, it did not come from or through Care2.
We despise spam, and we do not associate ourselves with spammers.
With regards to e-mail communication with us, we read every message sent to us and do our best to respond quickly.
We do save messages that might be needed if the sender contacts us again, but we absolutely do not sell, rent, give, or share e-mail addresses to other companies, unless you have specifically opted to receive such communications.

Server access is restricted to qualified Care2 employees, on an as-needed basis to maintain the operation of the website.

What is Care2's data retention policy?

We may retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

What else should I know about my privacy?

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online that information can be collected and used by others.
In short, by posting personal information online that is publicly accessible, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.
Furthermore, while we strive to protect your personal information, Care2 cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us over the Internet, and you do so at your own risk.
You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information.
Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online.

What happens if changes are made to the privacy policy?

Care2 reserves the right to change the privacy policy, but will notify users of such changes through email and/or by posting a notice on the site.
In the event of any material change, this notification will be prior to that change becoming effective.
