 Information We Automatically Collect 
Categories of Information. We and our third-party service providers (including any third-party content, advertising, and analytics providers) automatically collect certain information from your device or web browser when you interact with the Services to help us understand how our users use the Services and to target advertising to you (which we will refer to in this Privacy Notice collectively as âUsage Dataâ).
For example, each time you visit the Services we and our third-party service providers automatically collect your location, IP address, mobile device identifier or other unique identifier, browser and computer type, Internet service provider used, clickstream information, access time, the Web page you came from, the URL you go to next, the Web page(s) that you access during your visit and your interaction with content or advertising on the Services.
We may contract with third parties to collect this information on our behalf for analytics purposes.
These include companies such as Chartbeat, Comscore and Google.

We and our third-party service providers use such Usage Data for a variety of purposes including to diagnose problems with our servers and software, to administer the Services, to gather demographic information and to target advertising to you on the Services and elsewhere online.
Accordingly, our third-party advertising networks and ad servers will also provide us with information, including reports that will tell us how many ads were presented and clicked on the Services in a manner that does not identify personally any specific individual.
The Usage Data we collect is generally non-identifying, but if we associate it with you as a specific and identifiable person, we will treat it as Personal Data.

 Cookies/Tracking Technologies We use tracking technologies, such as cookies, local storage, and pixel tags. Cookies and Local Storage Cookies and local storage may be set and accessed on your computer.
Upon your first visit to the Services, a cookie or local storage will be sent to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser.

however, if you reject cookies, you will not be able to sign in to the Services or take full advantage of our Services.
Additionally, if you clear all cookies on your browser at any point after setting your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent, you will have to again reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent.
Read our Cookie Policy.
Our Services use the following types of cookies for the purposes set out below: Cookies and Local Storage Type of cookie Purpose Analytics and Performance Cookies These cookies are used to collect information about traffic to our Services and how users use our Services.
The information gathered does not identify any individual visitor.
The information is aggregated and therefore anonymous.
It includes the number of visitors to our Services, the websites that referred them to our Services, the pages that they visited on our Services, what time of day they visited our Services, whether they have visited our Services before, and other similar information.
We use this information to help operate our Services more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information and to monitor the level of activity on our Services.
We use Google Analytics for this purpose.
Google Analytics uses its own cookies.
It is only used to improve how our Services works.
You can find out more information about Google Analytics cookies here.
You can find out more about how Google protects your data here.
You can prevent the use of Google Analytics relating to your use of our Services by downloading and installing the browser plugin available here.
Service Cookies These cookies are essential to provide you with services available through our Services and to enable you to use its features.
For example, they allow you to log in to secure areas of our Services and help the content of the pages you request load quickly.
Without these cookies, the services that you have asked for cannot be provided, and we only use these cookies to provide you with those services.
Functionality Cookies These cookies allow our Services to remember choices you make when you use our Services, such as remembering your language preferences, remembering your login details, remembering which polls you have voted in and in some cases, to show you poll results, and remembering the changes you make to other parts of our Services which you can customize.
The purpose of these cookies is to provide you with a more personal experience and to avoid you having to re-enter your preferences every time you visit our Services.
Social Media Cookies These cookies are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or âlikeâ button on our Services or you link your account or engage with our content on or through a social networking website such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or others.
The social network will record that you have done this and collect information from you which may be your Personal Data.
Targeted and advertising cookies These cookies track your browsing habits to enable us to show advertising which is more likely to be of interest to you.
These cookies use information about your browsing history to group you with other users who have similar interests.
Based on that information, and with our permission, third-party advertisers can place cookies to enable them to show ads which we think will be relevant to your interests while you are on third-party websites.
These cookies also store your location, including your latitude, longitude, and GeoIP region ID, which helps us show you locale-specific news and allows our Services to operate more efficiently.
Flash A Flash cookie is a data file placed on a device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that is built into or downloaded by you onto your device.
Flash cookies are used for various purposes, including, without limitation, enabling a Flash feature and remembering your preferences.
For more information about Flash and the privacy choices Adobe offers, visit here.
If you choose to adjust your Flash privacy settings on your device some features of the Services may not function properly. Pixel Tags We also use âpixel tags,â which are small graphic files that allow us and third parties to monitor the use of the Services and collect Usage Data.
A pixel tag can collect information such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the tag appears.
the URL of the page on which the pixel tag appears.
the time (and length of time) the page containing the pixel tag was viewed.
the type of browser that retrieved the pixel tag.
and the identification number of any cookie previously placed by that server on your computer.
We use pixel tags, either provided by us or by our third-party advertisers, service providers and ad networks, to collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the links you click and other actions taken in connection with our sites and Services and use them in combination with our cookies to provide offers and information of interest to you.
Pixel tags also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit the Services or other websites. Log Files A log file is a file that records events that occur in connection with your use of the Service, such as your service use data. Device Fingerprinting Device fingerprinting is the process of analyzing and combining sets of information elements from your deviceâs browser, such as JavaScript objects and installed fonts, in order to create a âfingerprintâ of your device and uniquely identify your device and apps. App Technologies, Customization, and Usage There are a variety of tracking technologies that may be included in our apps that allow us to collect information about your installation, use, and updating of our apps as well as information about your device, including your unique device identifier (âUDIDâ) and other technical identifiers.
More specifically, these tracking technologies allow us to collect data about your device and your use of our apps, the pages, videos, other content, or ads you see or click on during your visit and when and for how long you do so, and items you download.
These tracking technologies are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings.
For example, our apps may include third party SDKs, which is code that sends information about your use to a server, and is in effect the app version of a pixel.
These SDKs allow us to track our conversions and communicate with you across devices, bring you advertising both on and off the Sites, customize the app to your interests and preferences and link such across platforms and devices, and provide you with additional functionality, such as the ability to connect our Site with your social media account. Location-Identifying Technologies GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth, and other location-aware technologies may be used to collect precise location data when you enable location-based services through your device.
Location data may be used for purposes such as verifying your deviceâs location and delivering or restricting relevant content and advertising based on that location.
In addition, we use a variety of other technologies that collect similar information for security and fraud detection purposes essential to the operation of our sites and business.
For more information about the use of cookies and similar technology on our Site, please review Section 13 of this Privacy Notice and our Cookies and Tracking Technologies Policy.
You can also find more information about cookies and how they work, what cookies have been set on your computer or mobile device and how to manage and delete them here and here.

 Social Network and Platform Integration The Services contain integration with social networks and other platforms in which information is shared between us and such platforms.
For example, if you create or log into your account through a third-party social media site, we may have access to certain information from that site, such as your name, email address, account information, photo and friends lists, and other information in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such social media site.
If you donât want a social network to collect the information about you as described above, or you donât want a social network to share it with us, please review the privacy policy, privacy settings and instructions of the applicable social network before you visit and use our Services.

 Our Information Sharing Practice Generally We share Non-Personal Data, including Usage Data, de-identified Personal Data and aggregated user statistics, with third parties in our discretion.
Information collected via the Sites is shared among our affiliates.
For example, we may share your information with our related entities including our parent and sister companies for customer support, marketing, and technical operations.
We share User Information, including Personal Data, as otherwise described in this Policy, and under the following circumstances. Service Providers From time to time, we enter into relationships with third parties who provide services to us (for example, analytics and research companies, advertisers and ad agencies, data management and storage services, credit card processing services, merchandise sales facilitators, sweepstakes or contest prize fulfillment).
We share your information with third parties for the purposes of facilitating your requests (such as when you choose to share information with a social network about your activities on the Sites) and in connection with tailoring advertisements, measuring and improving our Sites and advertising effectiveness, and other enabling enhancements.
We share aggregate information about our visitors with our advertisers, sponsors, and promotional partners, such as how many persons visited a particular page or activity, the average age of our visitors on the Site(s) or page(s), or the likes and dislikes of our visitors, but this information is not specific to any individual visitor.
We obtain geographic information such as zip code clustering from other sources, but this aggregate information will not reveal the precise location of a specific visitor.
We also obtain other demographic information from third parties to improve our products and services, for marketing purposes or to display more relevant advertising.
In those circumstances, we disclose User Information so that such service providers perform those services.
These service providers are only permitted to use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to enable them to provide their services to us.
They are required to follow our express instructions and to comply with appropriate security measures to protect your Personal Data.
And our sites use certain Google analytics and other services, and certain pages use the Google AMP Client ID API, each of which enable collection and sharing of your information (including Personal Data) with Google for further use.
For specific information on Google usage and how to control it, please see How Google uses data when you use our partnersâ sites or apps and Googleâs Privacy Notice. Operational Providers For your convenience, we may provide the opportunity to purchase certain goods, merchandise and services through the Sites (including, without limitation, retail purchases, print and digital magazine subscriptions and special event tickets).
Companies other than Vox Media, Inc., its parents, partners, affiliates or subsidiaries may process these transactions.
We call these companies that conduct our e-commerce operations, order and contest fulfillment and/or contract services âoperational providers.â They are third parties that perform services on our behalf.
If you choose to use these optional services, our operational providers will request your personal information to fulfill your order or request.
The voluntary submission of your personal information to these operational providers, including your order or request, will be governed by the specific providerâs terms of use and privacy policies.
To facilitate an order or request from you, we may share your personal information with the provider.
The operational provider may also share your personal information and information about your purchases with us.
We may store this information in our membership database.
In most instances, we request that our operational providers adhere to the provisions in our Privacy Notice and that such providers only share visitorsâ personal information with us, unless necessary to complete a visitorâs request or order.
Operational providers are only permitted to use any personal information for the purpose of conducting the sale or fulfilling your requested service or order.
However, you must read an operational providerâs privacy policy to determine the extent of use and disclosure of your personal information collected online.
We are not responsible for the collection, use and disclosure practices of operational providers, nor are we responsible or liable for their services. Events Our Events and promotions may be jointly managed, sponsored or offered by third parties.
If you voluntarily choose to enter or attend an Event, we may share your information with third parties as set forth in the official rules that govern the Event as well as for administrative purposes and as required by law (e.g., on a winners list).
By entering a contest or sweepstakes Event, you agree to the official rules that govern that Event, and may, except where prohibited by applicable law, allow the sponsor and/or other parties to use your name, voice and/or likeness in advertising or marketing materials.
Some events may be managed wholly by a third party and will be governed by any rules or terms they provide for that event and it is your responsibility to review and comply with those terms. Third-Party Direct Marketing We may share your information with third parties for our own direct marketing purposes (for example, email blasts, special offers, discounts, etc.).
If you have not opted out of us sharing your information with third parties for marketing purposes, we may also share your information (including Personal Data) with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.
Please note, messages delivered from a third-party will subject you to the third-partyâs privacy policy.
We may also match your email address with third parties and use such match to deliver custom offers or emails to you on the Services and off the Services. Third Party Features We may allow you to connect our Sites to a third party service or offer our Sites through a third party service (âThird Party Featuresâ).
If you use a Third Party Feature, both we and the applicable third party may have access to and use information associated with your use of the Third Party Feature, and you should carefully review the third partyâs privacy policy and terms of use.
Some examples of Third Party Features include the following:

Logging-In. You may choose to log in, create an account or enhance your profile on the Sites through the Facebook Login feature.
By doing this, you are asking Facebook to send us certain information from your Facebook profile, and you authorize us to collect, store, and use in accordance with this Privacy Notice any and all information available to us through the Facebook interface.

Brand Pages. We offer our content on social networks such as a Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.
Any information you provide to us when you engage with our content (such as through our brand page) is treated in accordance with this Privacy Notice.
Also, if you publicly reference our Sites on a third party service (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with us in a tweet or post), we may use your reference on or in connection with our Service. Change of Control In the event we go through a business transition (such as a merger, acquisition by another company, bankruptcy, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, including, without limitation, during the course of any due diligence process), your Personal Data will likely be among the assets transferred.
By providing your Personal Data, you agree that we can transfer such information in those circumstances without your further consent.
Should such a business transition occur, we will make reasonable efforts to request that the new owner or combined entity (as applicable) follow this Privacy Notice with respect to your Personal Data.
If your Personal Data would be used contrary to this Privacy Notice, we will request that you receive prior notice. Other Disclosure Scenarios We reserve the right, and you hereby expressly authorize us, to share User Information: (i) in response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish, protect, or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
(ii) if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, fraud, or situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person or property.
(iii) if we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding significant abuse of the Services infrastructure or the Internet in general (such as voluminous spamming, denial of service attacks, or attempts to compromise the security of information).
(iv) to protect and defend our legal rights or property, our services or their users, or any other party, and to protect the health and safety of our users or the general public.
and (v) to our parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control with us (in which case we will require such entities to honor this Privacy Notice).

 Anonymous Data When we use the term âanonymous data,â we are referring to data and information that does not permit you to be identified or identifiable, either alone or when combined with any other information available to a third-party.
We may create anonymous data from the Personal Data we receive about you and other individuals whose Personal Data we collect.
Anonymous data will include analytics information and information collected by us using cookies.
We make Personal Data into anonymous data by excluding information (such as your name or other personal identifiers) that makes the data personally identifiable to you.
We use this anonymous data to analyze usage patterns in order to make improvements to our Services.

 Public Information If you identify any User Information as public, you are authorizing us to share such information publicly.
For example, you can elect to make certain of your User Submissions (such as your alias, bio, email or photos) publicly available.
Also, there are areas of the Services (for example, message boards, discussion rooms, and other online forums) in which you are able to post information that automatically will be available to all other users of the Services.
By choosing to use these areas, you understand and agree that anyone can access, use, and disclose any information that you post to those areas.

 Users Outside of the United States and Consent to Transfer The Services are operated in the United States.
If you are located in another jurisdiction, please be aware that information you provide to us will be transferred to, stored and processed in the United States.
By using the Services or providing us with any information, you consent to this transfer, processing, and storage of your information in the United States, a jurisdiction in which the privacy laws are not as comprehensive as those in the country where you reside or are a citizen such as the European Union.
You understand that the U.S.
government can obtain access to the Personal Data you submit if necessary for investigative purposes (e.g., terrorism investigation).
We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Notice.
We use appropriate and suitable safeguards for transferring your Personal Data to the U.S.
(e.g., standard contractual clauses issued by the European Commission, which can be accessed here).

We may ask for additional information or documentation if we feel it is necessary to confirm your identity with the necessary degree of certainty.
We may communicate with you through email, a secure message center, or other reasonably necessary and appropriate means.
We do have the right to deny requests under certain circumstances.
In such cases, we will notify you of the reasons for denial.
We will not provide you with specific pieces of personal information if the disclosure creates a substantial, articulable, and unreasonable risk to the security of that personal information, your account with us, or the security of our systems or networks.

Right to Non-Discrimination You have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by us for the exercise of any your rights. Financial Incentives Financial incentives are programs, benefits, or other offerings, including payments to consumers as compensation, for the disclosure, deletion, or sale of personal information about them.

Such programs will have additional terms that require your review and agreement.
Please review those terms for the details of those programs, how to withdraw or cancel, or to assert your rights specific to those programs.
We generally do not treat consumers differently if they exercise a right under California law.
However, in certain circumstances, discounted prices will require you to be on our mailing list or a member of our loyalty program.
In such circumstances, we may offer a price difference because the price is reasonably related to the value of your data.
The value of your data will be explained in the terms of such incentivized programs.
