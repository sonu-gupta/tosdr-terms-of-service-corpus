ONLINE TRACKING AND INTEREST-BASED
ADVERTISING We and the service providers we use to
advertise to you may collect information about your activities on Square.
We
use this information to advertise to you and to tailor our products and
services to your interests.
You may see certain ads on other websites because
we use third-party services to advertise our services to you.
We use these
services to target our ads to you and others based on your demographics,
interests and context.
These third-party ad services track your online
activities over time and across multiple websites by collecting your
information through automated technologies, including third-party cookies, web
server logs and web beacons.
The ad services use this information to show you
Weebly ads that may be tailored to your individual interests.
The information
our ad services may collect on our behalf includes data about your visits to
websites that serve Weebly ads, such as the pages or ads you view and the
actions you take on those websites.
This data collection takes place both on
our online services, and on third-party websites that serve our ads to you.
This process also helps us figure out if our ads to you are effective. To learn about how to opt out of
interest-based advertising in the U.S., see below Certain web browsers allow you to instruct
your browser to respond to Do Not Track (âDNTâ) signals to website you visit,
informing those sites that you do not want your online activities to be
tracked.
At this time, our websites are
not designed to respond to DNT signals or similar mechanisms from browsers.

long as reasonably necessary to provide you the Services or to comply with

copies of information about you and any transactions or Services in which you
may have participated for a period of time that is consistent with applicable
law, applicable statute of limitations or as we believe is reasonably necessary

request, to detect or prevent fraud, to collect fees owed, to resolve disputes,
to address problems with our Services, to assist with investigations, to
enforce our General Terms or other
applicable agreements or policies, or to take any other actions consistent with
applicable law.

Online Behavioral or Interest-Based Advertising Services on Websites (including
Mobile Websites)

Some of the advertising platforms that we use

advertising to you on websites participate in the DAA Self-Regulatory Program

interest-based advertising delivered to each of its member companies.

for Online Behavioral Advertising.
This program offers a mobile application
called the âAppChoices,â which provides a centralized
location where you can make choices about the use of your information for
online behavioral advertising within the mobile environment.
The AppChoices application can be downloaded from your mobile
device at www.aboutads.info/appchoices or from your deviceâs app store.
If you opt

apply to the specific browser or device from which you opt out.
On your mobile device, you may also go to
your device settings and select âLimit Ad Trackingâ (for iOS devices), or âOpt out of Interest-Based Adsâ (for Android devices), which
will allow you to limit our use of information collected from or about your
mobile device (such as precise location data) for the purposes of serving
online behavioral advertising to you.
