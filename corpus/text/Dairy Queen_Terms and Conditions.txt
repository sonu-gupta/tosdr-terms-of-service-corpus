Important Disclaimer


These terms include an arbitration provision that may govern disputes between you and us.

Conditions (the âTermsâ) apply?

Arbitration / Jury and Class Action Waiver


1.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
U.S.
Residents: 
This section affects rights that you may otherwise have.
It provides for resolution of most disputes through arbitration instead of jury trial and class actions.
Arbitration does not use a judge or a jury.
Arbitration is final and binding and subject to only very limited review by a court.
Please review this section carefully.

This provision encompasses disputes or claims arising out of or relating to these Terms, the Privacy Statement, your use of the Sites, and your relationship with us, including any of our subsidiary, parent or affiliate companies.
Disputes will be resolved by binding arbitration, except that either you or us may take claims to small claims court if they qualify for hearing by such a court.

Notwithstanding the above, you may choose to pursue your claim in court if you opt out of this arbitration provision within thirty days from the earliest date you submitted information on the Sites (the âDeadlineâ).

Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law, and not governed by state law.

The arbitration will be conducted in the English language.
The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available in a court, including injunctive or declaratory relief to the extent required to satisfy your claim.
Any arbitration shall be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content, or result of any arbitration except as required by law or for purposes of enforcement of the award.
Judgment on any award may be entered in any court having proper jurisdiction.


Jury and Class Action Waivers
.
You and we agree that any proceeding, whether in court or in arbitration, will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action.

This provision encompasses disputes or claims arising out of or relating to these Terms, the Privacy Statement, your use of the Sites, and your relationship with us, including any of our subsidiary, parent or affiliate companies.
Disputes will be resolved by arbitration using the Canadian Arbitration Association Expedited Arbitration Rules, or in small claims court.
The arbitration shall be held in Toronto and shall proceed in accordance with the provisions of the Canadian Arbitration Association.
Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
In any such presiding, the losing party will pay the legal expenses of the prevailing party.

You or we may take claims to small claims court if they qualify for a hearing by such a court.

Jury and Class Action Waivers

 the arbitration agreement 
will be void as to you.
