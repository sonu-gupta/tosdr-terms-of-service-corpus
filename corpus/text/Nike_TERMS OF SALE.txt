PLACING ORDERS ON THE PLATFORM 
ELIGIBILITY TO ORDER
To place an order on the Platform, you must be of legal age in your country and a consumer - not a reseller.

[See 
China
 terms.]

NO PURCHASE FOR RESALE
The Platform is intended solely for NIKE to sell NIKE products direct to end consumers, and therefore purchase of products for resale is strictly prohibited.
Purchase for resale means the purchase of NIKE product by someone who resells, or intends to resell, the NIKE product to others (consumers, businesses or any third party).&nbsp.
If NIKE believes you are involved in purchase for resale, NIKE reserves the right to take any action against you, including, without limitation, to restrict sales to you, cancel your orders, and/or suspend or close your account.  
HOW TO ORDER
You need an e-mail address to place an order, and you may need to set your browser to accept both (functional) cookies and pop-ups in order to be able to use all the functionalities of the Website, which includes designing customized items, adding items to your shopping bag and submitting your order. 
When you submit an order, we will send you an email acknowledging receipt of your order.&nbsp.
Our acceptance of the order takes place when the Products are shipped to you - we will send you an email confirming that the Products have been shipped (âOrder Confirmationâ).
At this point a contract, containing these Terms of Sale, comes into existence and is binding on you and us (the âContractâ).
We recommend that you print or download a copy of these Terms of Sale and the relevant Order Confirmation for future reference.&nbsp.
If we are unable to supply you with a product, we will inform you of this in writing and will not process the order.

Suspected fraud on the Platform will be investigated and if necessary prosecuted.
