and
To share in the limited and protected ways outlined in the section entitled âHow and When We Share Your Information.â

FERPA
FERPA stands for the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (20
U.S.C.
1232g, 34CFRÂ§99) and is designed to ensure that studentâs personally identifiable
education information is protected.
Packback takes FERPA compliance extremely seriously, and we have
designed our system to provide options to accommodate each schoolâs definition
of Directory Information and/or Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
Packback acknowledges that in the course of Subscriberâs use of the
Services, personally identifiable information about students (âSensitive
Student Dataâ) may be disclosed to Packback through account creation and
usage of the services of the Packback Platform.
Packback acknowledges that it
will be considered a âSchool Officialâ (as outlined in FERPA) and
will comply with the requirements in FERPA concerning the confidentiality and
release of Sensitive Student Data.
Packback agrees that officers, employees,
and agents of Packback who access Sensitive Student Data may use such data only
for the purposes for which such data has been made available to Packback and
ways outlined within this Privacy Policy.
Packbackâs definition of âSensitive Student Dataâ on Packback
includes student name, email address, course title/information, and final
participation grade information.
User Generated Content posted by student Users in the Packback
Questions forumâwhen completely disaggregated from any identifiable information
about the student who posted the contentâwould not be considered Sensitive
Student Data.
Our system gives students the right to control who can view their
subscriber information combined with their student posted content, and we have
a sophisticated authorization and privacy system that prevents any unauthorized
user from connecting student posted data to any subscriber information at the
backend API level.
Subscriber information is not simply âobscuredâ on the website, but
rather actively disaggregated at the server level, and cannot be connected to
User Generated Content unless requested by an authorized School Official (with
proper permissions in the Packback system) or if the User has secondarily opted
in to make their profile public.
Please read the section entitled âHow and When We Share Your Informationâ to learn more about the limited ways in which we share and or use the collected information. COPPA COPPA stands for the Childrenâs Online Privacy Protection Act (15
U.S.C.
6501, 16 CFR Part 312) and is designed to protect the privacy of
children under the age of 13.
Packback takes COPPA compliance extremely seriously, and we have designed our system to ensure that Packback obtains the consent of a Child Userâs Parent prior to collecting personal information online from such Child User.
Packback does not knowingly permit Child Users to register directly for the Packback Platform without the consent of a Parent.
If Packback learns that the personal information of a Child User has been collected on the Packback Platform without parental or guardian consent, then Packback will take appropriate steps to delete such information.&nbsp.
If you are a Parent of a Child User and discover that your child has an account on the Packback Platform without your consent, please alert us at help@packback.co.
We permit the school to create Child User and/or Minor User
accounts, as applicable, when the Packback Platform is used by a school in the
classroom for an educational purpose.
The school is required to obtain the
requisite consent for Packback to collect personal information of a Child User
or Minor User, as applicable, for this purpose.
Schools may create a Child User
or Minor User account, as applicable by adding students to the Packback
Platform through our registration process for schools.
A school may create
logins/passwords for each individual Student User using tools that we provide.

Parents may review their childâs personal information on the Packback Platform, direct us to delete it, and refuse to allow any further collection or use of their childâs information by Packback by revoking their consent.
Parents seeking to revoke their consent, review their childâs information, and request a deletion of their childâs data should contact us at help@packback.co.
If
you are an Educator User and you register an account for a Child User or a
Minor User, you, individually and on behalf of the Educational Institution your
represent, represent and warrant that you have received express consent from
such Child Userâs or Minor Userâs Parent for you to register the Child User or
Minor User for the Packback Platform and for you to provide to Packback the
information you disclose in connection with the registration of such Child User
or Minor User.&nbsp.
Without limiting the
foregoing, you further agree, individually and on behalf of your Educational
Institution, to be bound by these terms on behalf of such Child User or Minor
User, including without limitation being liable for all use of the Packback
Platform by the Child User or Minor User.
