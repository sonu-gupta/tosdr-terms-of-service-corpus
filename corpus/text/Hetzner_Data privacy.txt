We also save and process data that job applicants provide us as part of the job application process.

What categories of data do we collect?  Every time you visit our website, your IP address and other pieces of information are saved in anonymized form.
If you register an account with us, your contact information will be stored.

If you pay using a credit card, we do not collect and store any payment information such as credit card numbers or verification codes.
You disclose this information only to the respective payment service provider.
One exception with credit card payments is what is known as the pseudo card number: in order for you not to have to enter your credit card information for every payment, a pseudo card number is saved for your account.
The pseudo card number only enables payment for products on our website that you order using your customer account.
A pseudo card number is not identical to the credit card number.
We delete all your registration data either: within 24 months, as soon as you delete your user account with us, or once the statutory retention period expires.
