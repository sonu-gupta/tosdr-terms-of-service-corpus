These Terms of Service (âTermsâ) are a contract between you and RadioPublic PBC.
They govern your use of RadioPublicâs mobile apps, sites, services, products, and content (âServicesâ).
By using RadioPublic, you agree to these Terms.
If you donât agree to any of the Terms, you canât use RadioPublic, alas.
We can change these Terms at any time.

If a change is material, weâll endeavor to let you know before they take effect.
By using RadioPublic on or after that effective date, you agree to the new Terms.
If you donât agree to them, you should stop using RadioPublic before they take effect, otherwise your use of the site and content will be subject to the new Terms.

Third party content

RadioPublic displays links and content from third-party podcast feeds, sites, publishers, networks and producers, and downloads and provides online listening to podcast files directly from each podcastâs third-party servers.
These third parties may have their own privacy policies and terms of use, and we have no responsibility or liability for their content or activities.
RadioPublic also contains links to websites, services, content and advertisements that we donât own or control.
We donât necessarily endorse or assume responsibility for those things, either.
We donât pre-screen anyoneâs content.
However, we have the right to review and remove or disable access to any content through RadioPublic for any reason.
We assume no liability for anything that you or anyone else publishes through RadioPublic.
