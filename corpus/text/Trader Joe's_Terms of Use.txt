The arbitration shall be a confidential proceeding, closed to the general public.

Trader Joe's Community Guidelines for "Comments"

By engaging here, you are agreeing to be a steward of the Trader Joe's community, and thus engender the fellowship, courtesy and shared responsibility as outlined in these guidelines:

You must be 13 or older to engage in this conversation, and if you are between the ages of 13-18, your parent or legal guardian must have reviewed our Terms and have agreed to them for you to participate.
Language is a powerful toolâwield it carefully and respectfully.
Offensive, off-color, hurtful, damaging, derogatory, provocative, insulting, abusive, harassing, uglyâ¦ remarks will not be tolerated.
Period.
Just as in our stores, maintaining a welcoming and safe environment is of paramount importance to us.
Trader Joe's reserves the right to not post or remove any comments at any time for any reason.
(Please note: if a portion of a comment is deemed not permissible, the entire comment will not be posted.)
You reserve the right to flag any comment that you deem inappropriate for immediate review and likely removal by Trader Joe's moderators.
Please keep comments on-topicâthe featured Trader Joe's products and your experience with them or thoughts about them are the topic.
To discuss other pressing Trader Joe's topicsâgeneral store experiences or questions, location inquiries, business inquiries, new vendor pitches, employment interests or any other customer service-related matters, please visit our Contact Us page.
If you have questions or concerns pertaining to a specific store, please contact your local Trader Joe's Store for assistance.
