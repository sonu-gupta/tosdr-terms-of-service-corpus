Counter-Notification Process
When a userâs video submission has been removed, the Website will notify the user of this removal, including by providing the contact information of the person or entity sending the takedown request.
Pursuant to the Websiteâs repeat infringer policy, the user then has five (5) days to submit a counter-notification to the Website, explaining why the original takedown notice was sent in error.
The counter-notification may be sent to the Providerâs email address from which the user originally received the forwarded takedown request.
For the Website to consider a userâs counter-notification, it must include the following:

A physical or electronic signature of the user.
and
Identification of the material that has been removed by providing one or more URLs where the material was previously available.

A statement under penalty of perjury that the user has a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.
and
The user's name, address, and telephone number.

and
A statement that the user will accept service of process from the person who sent the notice of alleged infringement or an agent of such person.

Counter-notifications that do not satisfy all of these elements are ineffective and may not be considered by the Website.
Please note that we will send any complete counter-notifications we receive to the person who submitted the original takedown request, including by providing the contact information of the person or entity sending the takedown request (to the extent allowed under the applicable laws).
That person may elect to file a lawsuit against you for copyright infringement.
If we do not receive notice that a lawsuit has been filed within ten (10) business days after we provide notice of your counter-notification, we will restore access to the removed materials.
Until that time, your uploaded material will remain inaccessible.
We will provide a copy of the original takedown request if asked.
Please note that we regularly provide your name, contact information, as well as the contents of your takedown request to the person who posted the content you are reporting in accordance with our privacy policy and applicable laws.

Such fraudulent reporting to avoid payment for goods or services that you or anyone under your authority has made to us when you have an outstanding charge to us shall make you liable to Provider for $25,000 in liquidated damages.
This liability for liquidated damages is in addition to any other liability you may incur for breaches of any other provision of these Terms of Service.
If you believe that you have been erroneously billed, please notify us immediately of such error.
If we do not hear from you within 30 days after such billing error first appears on any account statement, such fee will be deemed acceptable by you for all purposes, including resolution of inquiries made by your credit card issuer.
We do not provide cash refunds.
We do, however, grant credits in the form of free monthly memberships to resolve customer service issues.
The billing system used by Provider or our authorized agents provides extensive credit card fraud protection measures and the Website includes many features to protect users from accidental charges.
