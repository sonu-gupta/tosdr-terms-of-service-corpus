Preamble

Scope of Application


(1) The GTCs apply to all deliverables we offer to users in connection with the services, in particular the free and fee-based services.
The GTCs cover the browser add-ons, the applications, as well as all additional services or software products that we provide in connection with the GPP.
(2) Deviations from these GTCs are considered agreed only if they have been expressly confirmed in writing.
In particular, the mere omission of an objection on our part to other terms and conditions does not result in such terms and conditions being considered as agreed.
(3) Specific rules on the use of a service may additionally apply.
In particular, the corresponding service description and/or license agreement (EULA) applies, which you should read carefully.
These provisions are part of these GTCs between us and yourself.
(4) We are not responsible for the internet services made available by third parties, which you access with the help of our services.
This applies also to social networks on which we present ourselves.
For such third-party internet services, the terms of use of the corresponding website operator or social network provider apply.


Contract Conclusion


(1) To use our services, you have to install the add-ons and/or a desktop or mobile application and, possibly, register if asked to do so or buy one of our products.
(2) Contract language is German.
Even if we provide terms of use or a privacy policy to you in other languages, the German version is solely decisive.
The English versions are provided only for convenience.
(3) Commercial use is generally permitted without our additional consent for all products that we designate as âEnterpriseâ or âProfessionalâ.
GPP products or services that are not clearly designated as âEnterpriseâ or âProfessionalâ products are not intended for commercial purposes and must not be used for commercial purposes without our express, prior, written consent.

(6) We reserve the right to restrict access to our products and services in certain regions and/or states in full or in part.

(1) We offer both services that are free of charge and services that are subject to fees.
For services that are free of charge, your registration is possible.

(4) Moreover, we would like to use the e-mail address you provide to us in order to inform you promptly about changes to GPP or Cliqz or send you information in the scope of what is permitted by law in accordance with Section 7 (3) UWG [Act Against Unfair Competition] (direct advertising) related to our own, similar products.

Control and Blocking of User Accounts


(1) Generally, we DO NOT control what Internet services you retrieve or visit using our products and services.
For this reason, we also do not assume any liability for your use of our products and services.
However, it is possible that we are bound by law to prevent access to certain online content.
We will indicate this to you in an appropriate manner.
(2) If there is a concrete indication that a user is breaching or has breached Sections 5 or 6 of these GTCs, we have the right to respond as follows, in consideration of and weighing the interests of the corresponding users:

We will always take into consideration the severity of the breach and the degree of userâs culpability when choosing a sanction for a breach of the GTCs.
We will warn the user in advance if this is appropriate as the mildest measure in an individual case.
Furthermore, if the suspicion that a user has breached Section 5 or 6 is confirmed, we can block the userâs access completely or partially and for a certain time or even permanently delete it.
A user account is deleted only in case of an intentional breach of these GTCs, committed repeatedly or with the intent of causing damage or for personal enrichment.
If a user is blocked by us or their user account is deleted, this block is aimed at this user as a person and not just at the relevant username, e-mail address or corresponding user account they used.

(3) If statutory requirements are met, we always have the right to extraordinary cancellation of the contract with the user with immediate effect.
Additional and further claims, in particular claims for damages, remain unaffected.


Availability of our Products and Services


(1) The gratuitous use of our products and services is offered to users subject to availability.
We make an effort to ensure that the user is provided gratuitous services without disruptions.
Use may be limited or temporarily interrupted as a result of maintenance work, further development or other disruptions.
If this is the case, it does not give rise to claims for damages against us.
(2) In the case of fee-based offers of our products and services, we fulfill our contract with you in accordance with the concrete product specifications.
We try to ensure the highest possible availability, but our products and services are mainly software services that undergo constant changes.
Use may be limited or temporarily interrupted as a result of maintenance work, further development or other disruptions.
If this is the case, it does not give rise to claims for damages against us.
Statutory warranty claims under German law and in case of an express assumption of a guarantee by us remain unaffected.
In no case are we liable for disruptions of your Internet connection or disruptions on the part of your provider or disruptions due to force majeure.
(3) Furthermore, we have the right to change or discontinue the offered free services and performance at any time at our own discretion without notice.
Fee-based services can be discontinued any time after the expiry of the agreed period of performance.


Our Liability


(1) Our products and services protect your privacy in the scope indicated in the corresponding specifications.
For this purpose, we implement the measures described in the specifications, the privacy policy and these GTCs.
However, we cannot guarantee that third parties are unable to bypass these measures and your information is always absolutely protected from access by third parties.
(2) Under contracts for fee-based services, we are only liable, subject to statutory rules, for damages to the user that have been caused intentionally or with gross negligence, that are the consequence of non-availability of a guaranteed specification of the service, that are the result of a culpable injury to health, body or life, or that are subject to compulsory liability under the law, in particular liability under the German Product Liability Act.
(3) For other damages, the liability in case of a breach of a material contractual obligation (known as a cardinal obligation) is limited to damages that have to be typically and foreseeably expected in the scope of provision of a service such as the contractual service.
(4) Cardinal obligations are contractual obligations whose performance enables the proper implementation of the contract at all and the adherence to which the contractual parties can usually rely on, and the breach of which, on the other hand, jeopardizes the achievement of the contractual aim.
(5) Under contracts for free services, regardless of the provisions of Sections 9 (1) to 9 (3), we are only liable for intent and gross negligence in accordance with the statutory liability scope of Section 521 BGB [German Civil Code].
(6) Apart from that, liability against us as well as against our performing or vicarious agents is excluded regardless of the legal reason for such liability.
(7) If damages to the user result from the loss of data, we are not liable for this if the damages could be prevented through regular, complete back-up of all relevant data by the user, with a frequency appropriate to the value of the data.
In case of liability, we are liable only for the damages that would occur with regular, complete back-up of all relevant data, with a frequency appropriate to the value of the data.


Warranty


Any warranty claims arising based on the nature of the service concerned, applicable statutory rules generally apply.
However, the warranty period is reduced to one year, except in the case of claims for damages due to defects, resulting from non-availability of a guaranteed specification of the service, resulting from a culpable injury to health, body or life, or that are subject to liability under the Product Liability Act.
We do not assume guarantees.


Fee-based Services


The following addition provisions apply to fee-based offers:

11.1.
Contract Conclusion

(1) The contract for the use of our fee-based content or services arises upon registration for the desired and chosen payment system provider, agreement to the GTCs and the corresponding acceptance by us.
(2) By registering for a fee-based service and completing the entry of the corresponding payment information in the system, you are submitting a binding offer to conclude a contract for the provision of the respective service.
Descriptions of services on our internet pages or in our mobile application are only a non-binding invitation to you to submit a corresponding offer.
(3) Acceptance by us takes place at the latest once access to the fee-based functions or parts is open to you.
We accept or reject your offer, in our sole discretion.
We reserve the right to make fee-based offers only accessible in certain regions.
This is based mainly, but not exclusively, on whether we can guarantee the payment of taxes to the respective authorities.
You have no claim to us offering a fee-based service in your region.
(4) You can read in the specifications of the chosen product whether the respective fee-based offer is subject to a one-time payment or is automatically extended if it is not canceled and therefore is subject to a recurrent payment.

11.2.
Right to Withdraw

If you are the consumer and maintain a residence within the EU or the European Economic Area, you have a 14-day right to withdraw.
You can find the withdrawal instructions and the template withdrawal form in Sections 17 and 18 of these GTCs.

11.3.
Costs

(1) The prices of individual performance, services and content that we offer are found in the respective offer.
The indicated prices include the respective applicable statutory value-added tax, if your place of residence or registered office or the place of your permanent residence is within the European Union or the European Economic Area or in another location subject to a law that prescribes the specification of a total price.
(2) If your place of residence or registered office or the place of your permanent residence is in the USA or in another country where the specification of net prices is prescribed or common, then are prices exclude the applicable statutory value-added tax.
(3) The differences in the price presentation are determined by our payment service software using your geographic information based on your IP address.
Therefore, for a correct presentation of the prices, you have to register without using anonymization software (e.g.
VPN connections, TOR browser).
A claim to lower prices or withdrawal due to incorrect price information is therefore excluded if the incorrect prices are shown due to a hardware or software used by you that makes it impossible for us to show you the correct prices.
(4) The prices for any recurrent payments may reduce or increase in the course of the userâs subscription.
Such changes do not affect the ongoing contractual periods.
A price increase that occurs during an ongoing contractual period is effective only once the user agrees to it.
Otherwise, your current contract will expire at the end of the ongoing contractual period without the need for a notice of cancellation by one of the parties.
(5) Reduced prices for testing periods (e.g.
a reduced price during the minimum contractual term) may be taken advantage of only once per person.
(6) The costs for the respective contractual period are payable to us in advance and due immediately after completion of the order and, thereafter, by the start of the next contractual period.
(7) The term cannot be interrupted.
Therefore, a reimbursement of the payments made for such interruptions is not considered either.
(8) Various payment options may be offered (e.g.
credit card, debit or PayPal), but we are not obliged to do so.
Currently, we are using Stripe as a payment service provider, which is completely free of charge for you.
For payment processing via payment system providers (e.g.
PayPal), only the terms and conditions of that payment system provider apply.
in addition, the user may need to have an account with that provider.
The payment process may also be offered, supported and simplified by other service providers that provide what is known as âsingle sign-on solutionsâ.
(9) After a purchase, the user can receive a receipt for the ordered services in electronic format to the e-mail address provided by him.
(10) If the user does not meet his payment obligations or reverses or charges back the amounts paid, we have the right, regardless of other claims, to block the userâs access to our products and services in full or with respect to the fee-based content or services.
If access is blocked due to outstanding payments and the user settles them, access will be restored.
Furthermore, we can limit or block access to free services in full or in part for payers who are in default.

11.4.
Warranty for Fee-based Services

(1) If, contrary to expectations, you would like to complain about our fee-based services due to incomplete or defective performance, you would have to make the complaints according to the terms of use of your chosen payment system provider either to us or to the payment provider immediately after learning about the incomplete or defective performance.
(2) If we are liable due to justified and timely complaints, we will complete performance in case of an incomplete one and improve or replace at our discretion in case of defective performance.
You may request the reduction of fees if we refused improvement attempts or replacement performance, if they are impossible or otherwise definitively failed.
(3) Apart from that, the statutory defect rights according to German law apply.
(4) If you are not a consumer as defined in Section 13 BGB, the warranty is limited to one year, except in the case of a building or a product used for buildings.

11.5.
Cancellation of Fee-based Services

(1) Fee-based services can be cancelled by both parties at the end of each contractual period.
The term is indicated in the individual offers.
(2) Generally, please make all cancellations according to these GTCs using your dashboard, which you will find in the plugin.
If you cannot log in to the dashboard for whichever reason, please send us an e-mail from your e-mail address that you used to register with us.
(3) Our fee-based services usually have a specific minimum contractual term starting on the day of contract conclusion.
The minimum contractual term applicable to the service in question and/or the different minimum contractual terms that may be offered to the user are found in our offer.
Depending on the offer and the chosen payment method, the corresponding contract is then extended automatically for the respective minimum contractual term, subject to other agreements, but for a maximum of one year each time, unless it is canceled at the latest one day before the expiry of the minimum contractual term or the ongoing extension term.
(4) In the case of payment methods that do not allow for an automatic contract extension and regular charges, the contractual term ends automatically upon expiry of the contractual term without the need for a cancellation notice.
(5) If we make it possible for you to switch to another of our services during an existing contract, a new contractual term for the new contract begins overall with the period of the respective minimum term of the new offer.
In turn, Section 11.5.
(3) and (4) applies to the new contractual term.
As a result, the contractual term may be extended without the possibility of a prior regular cancellation in the âoldâ contractual period.
Payments already made will be generally offset against the invoice for the new contractual period.
(6) Both parties may terminate the contract with immediate effect for an important reason.


Technical Requirements


(1) You need a computer or a mobile device with internet access to be able to use our services.
(2) The respective specifications for our products and services contain the corresponding hardware and software requirements that your system must meet in order to be able to use the respective product.
These are the minimal conditions necessary to be able to offer the products and services in a stable manner at all.
However, a limited user experience (e.g.
system slowdown) may be associated with these minimal conditions.
Therefore, we recommend having a system configuration that exceeds our minimum requirements.
(3) You are responsible for checking whether your system meets the technical requirements in order to be able to use our services.
We recommend that you check this before ordering our fee-based services.
We have the right to payment regardless of whether or not your system meets the technical requirements.
(4) To be able to use our products and services, you ultimately need an internet connection.
When downloading and using our products and services, you may incur transmission costs from the internet access provider that you use.
The same applies to the use of our products and services and the associated additional services and content.


Data Privacy


All information about the collection, processing and use of personal data by us is found in our privacy policy.


Cancellation of Free Use


(1) Each party may terminate the free use agreement at any time.
To do this, simply uninstall the program or the app that you use for our products and services.
(2) Termination for an important reason remains reserved for each party.
An important reason is, in particular, if one party continues to breach material provisions of these GTCs despite warning.
(3) Upon entry into effect of the cancellation, access will be blocked.
(4) Each user has the right to terminate the use as a whole or, if technically possible, for individual functions at any time.


Amendment of the GTCs


(1) We reserve the right to amend these GTCs at any time and without providing reasons.
The amended GTCs will be sent to the user in a suitable manner and, if applicable, by e-mail.
(2) The new GTCs will be deemed agreed if the user does not object to them within 6 weeks after receipt of the notification.
The objection must be made in writing, e.g.
by e-mail.
The options to object, the deadline and the consequences of his inaction will be indicated to the user separately in the notification.
Alternatively, the amended GTCs could be presented to the user during the next time he signs in to our products and services.
In this case, the amended GTCs will be agreed with a consumer once the consumer agrees to them during the next time he signs in.
They are considered agreed with the consumer if the consumer does not object their validity within 6 weeks after first presentation.
The objection must be made in writing, e.g.
by e-mail.
We will indicate the options to object, the deadline and the consequences of his inaction to the user separately in the presentation of the amended GTCs.
(3) If the user objects to the validity of the new GTCs, both we and you have the right to cancel the contract.
It then ends immediately or upon expiry of the period agreed for the fee-based service.
In case of such a cancellation, you will receive a reimbursement of the fee paid corresponding to the duration.


Final Provisions


(1) The GTCs including their interpretation are subject exclusively to the law of the Federal Republic of Germany.
Application of German and European conflict of laws principles and the UN Sales Convention is explicitly excluded.
This applies also to offers in other countries.
(2) These GTCs are generally not set out in a separate contract text individually related to the user, which the user can then access later on.
However, the content of the contract with the user arises from these GTCs and, if applicable, additional agreements reached at least in text form, e.g.
specifications and mutual other agreements of the contracting parties.
(3) The contract can only be concluded in German.
Translations are a mere service without claim to the respective language being the contractual language.
The contract is concluded in German regardless of country and region.
(4) If individual provisions of these GTCs including this provision are fully or partially invalid, the validity of the remaining provisions or parts of such provisions will remain unaffected.
The invalid or missing provision will be replaced by the corresponding statutory rules under German law.
(5) Munich is the exclusive place of jurisdiction, unless there is a statutory exclusive place of jurisdiction according to German law, if you are a merchant, legal person under public law or a public special fund or you do not have general jurisdiction in the Federal Republic of Germany.
(6) You have no general jurisdiction in the Federal Republic of Germany if you do not have any residence or permanent residence in the Federal Republic of Germany.
