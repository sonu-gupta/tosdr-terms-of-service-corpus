This project was made as a "spiritual successor" to Riverside Rocks' 1337git which is, unfortunately, hosted on GitHub.
Kinda ironic.
This project does not let you clone GitHub repositories.
I would recommend using a VPN if you have to clone a GitHub repository and want to keep yourself private from them instead.
