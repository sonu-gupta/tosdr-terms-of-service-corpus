DW may use cookies (a small text file placed on your computer to identify your computer and browser) and other third-party tracking technologies such as web beacons (an electronic file placed on a website that monitors usage) to collect general and personally identifiable information about visitors to the Websites.
The information collected is used to improve the experience of the Websites and Services, such as allowing us to recognize you when you revisit the Websites to provide you with customized information and/or to remember your preferences.
We use cookies and other third-party tracking technologies such as web beacons to collect Personal Information.
Most web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies.
If you use our mobile application on a desktop, a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media device, we may collect a Resettable Device Identifier from your device.
Resettable Device Identifiers (also known as mobile advertising identifiers) are similar to cookies and are found on many mobile devices and tablets (for example, the âIdentifier for Advertisersâ (or IDFA) on Apple iOS devices and the âGoogle Advertising IDâ on Android devices), and certain streaming media devices.
For more information on how to manage cookies, please see below (âPreference Managementâ).

Our partners may link the Personal Information we share with them to the cookie stored on your browser or device, and they may collect information such as your IP address, browser or operating system type and version, and demographic or inferred-interest information.
Our partners use this information to recognize you across different channels and platforms over time for advertising, analytics, attribution, and reporting purposes.
For example, our partners may deliver an ad to you in your web browser based on a purchase you made in a physical retail store, or they may send a personalized marketing email to you based on the fact that you visited a particular website.
Our Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that an ad network may collect from you.
Advertisements may be shown on the Websites, the Services or on third-party websites.
To opt out of receiving online advertising, please see below (âPreference Managementâ).
