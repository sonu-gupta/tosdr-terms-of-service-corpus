Restrict or object to
our processing for direct marketing.

Request a review of any automated decision made by technology.


If you want to do any of the above, drop our friendly customer support team a line at support@curve.app or via the Curve app.
We have one month to respond unless your request is complicated, in which case we may need more time.
If thatâs the case, weâll let you know.
This is almost always free but weâre allowed to charge a reasonable fee or refuse your request if itâs clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.
What about marketing? 
You can ask us to stop sending you marketing emails at any time by following the unsubscribe links at the bottom of any Curve marketing message.
Youâll still receive operational emails we need to send you, such as updates to our terms and conditions.
If you would like to stop receiving Curve receipt emails (for each of your payments), you can change your preferences for each of your funding cards on the Curve app.
Do you make automated decisions about me?
Depending on the Curve products or services you use, we may make automated decisions about you.
This means that we may use technology that can evaluate relevant factors about you and your circumstances to predict risks or outcomes.
We do this for the efficient running of our services and to make sure that the decisions we make are fair, consistent and based on the correct information.
Where we make an automated decision about you, you have the right to ask that it is manually reviewed by a human. 
For example, we may make automated decisions about you that relate to:

The approval of credit applications 



Credit and affordability checks to see whether we can accept your credit application.


Setting credit limits.



Opening a Curve&nbsp.
account



Anti-money laundering and sanctions checks.


Identity and address checks.

Monitoring your account to detect fraud and financial crime.


Our legal basis for our use of automated decision making is to enable us to fulfil our contract with you or because we have a legal obligation to do so.
How long do we keep your data? 
The period for which we may retain data about you will depend on the purposes for which the data was collected, whether you have requested deletion of the data, and whether we have any legal or regulatory obligation to retain the data.
We will not retain data about you for longer than is necessary to fulfil the purposes for which the data was collected.
We will typically keep your data for up to 10 years after you last completed onboarding or had an active account or product with us.
We may keep your personal data for a longer period where it is necessary for legal, regulatory or operational purposes.
If a decision has not been made on your onboarding application, we will keep your data for up to 30 days.

International data transfers 

We may transfer and store the data we collect from you to organisations outside the European Economic Area (EEA).
When we do this, we make sure that your data is secure, protected and that:


the European Commission says the country or organisation has adequate data protection laws in place, or


weâve agreed to standard data protection clauses in a written contract with the organisation, approved by the European Commission.


 How can you complain? 
We hope you donât ever need to, but if you do want to complain, you have the right to do so to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) however weâd love to try and sort it out first.
Drop us an email at support@curve.app.
How can you contact us?

We always welcome your comments or suggestions, including thoughts on how we can improve or clarify this privacy policy.
