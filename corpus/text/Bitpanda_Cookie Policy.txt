Privacy Policy), which may amend this Cookie Policy in certain areas.


&nbsp.

Operator:




Who is responsible for cookies and who can you contact?



Bitpanda GmbH, as parent company, is the operator of the platform and acts as a central point of contact for all issues concerning cookies and similar technologies on the platform and in the Mobile App.

If you have any questions in connection with cookies on our website or the processing of your personal data, you can contact our privacy team: privacy@bitpanda.com 
Please note that for certain requests we require further identification data from you (e.g.
Passport, ID card, etc), in order to ensure that your personal data is only shared with you.


&nbsp.

Cookies and similar technologies:


What are cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies?



Generally, cookies are text files (typically made up of letters and numbers) which are downloaded to your computer, tablet, smartphone or other devices (hereinafter referred to as âdeviceâ) when you visit our website.
Such files allow us to record certain pieces of information whenever you interact with our website, services (newsletter) and applications.
We use most of them to optimise the performance of our website as well as to improve our platform, products and services continuously.
Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognise your devices.



There are many specific types of cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies that are used, and their names may change from time to time.
In order to help you better understand cookies and their functions as well as our use of such technologies, we would like to explain this to you hereafter in more detail.



The term cookie or tracking tool describes many different technologies, for example the following: 

session and persistent cookies.


flash and HTML 5 cookies.


JavaScript Snippets.


web beacons or gifs (also called ClearGIFs, tracking pixels or pixel tags, Skript, Page Tags).


other device identifiers.


additional analytic tools without direct cookie settings.



In this Cookie Policy, we will use the term âcookieâ or âsimilar technologiesâ to cover all kinds of such technologies.
We will provide you with necessary details regarding special cookies and how you can change your settings regarding these technologies.


&nbsp.

All about cookies:




Which types of cookies exist and what are the purposes of cookies?






&nbsp.

Types of cookies:




Session cookies: these are temporary cookie files, which are only active for the browser session and are thus erased after you close your browser (âsession cookiesâ).
The next time you visit that website, it will not recognise you.




Persistent cookies: these are files which are stored for a longer period in your browserâs subfolders until you delete them manually or your browser deletes them after a period contained within the persistent cookieâs file (âpersistent cookiesâ).
Usually the storage time for persistent cookies is between 30 days and a maximum 2 year (this does not necessarily apply to third party cookies, please see 11).




First-party cookies: these are cookies stored directly by the website that you are visiting, e.g.
by us or by an assigned third party (âfirst-party cookiesâ).




Third-party cookies: these are cookies that are set by a party other than the website you are visiting, so a third party sets this cookie through this website (âthird-party cookiesâ).


&nbsp.

Cookie ID:



Cookies might contain what is known as a cookie ID.
A cookie ID is a unique identifier for the cookie.
It consists of a string of characters that websites and servers associate with the specific internet browser in which the cookie was stored.
This allows websites to distinguish your own individual browser from other internet browsers that contain other cookies.
A specific internet browser can be recognised and identified via the unique cookie ID.
However, a person cannot be identified via such cookies (there may be exceptions for special tools of third parties, please see 11).
Regardless, there are also cookies without a cookie ID, like most session cookies.
Furthermore, some tools might recognise visitors via device fingerprinting and similar technologies.


&nbsp.

Categories and purposes of cookies:



Cookies have many different purposes and we use them for many important functions on our website.
This is why we would like to explain those categories, as well as the purposes and functions to you.




Essential cookies: such cookies can be session or persistent cookies and they are necessary to provide our services to you.
Such cookies and similar technologies are essential to enable our websites to display the settings you have made and navigate the website correctly.
Furthermore, we use such cookies for security reasons as well as for the general performance of our services and to offer our products (e.g.
Affiliate programme and Tell-a-Friend programme).
They are usually set to adapt to how you use our website before and after the login, equivalent to a client request.
These cookies make it possible to remember your privacy and language settings, if you are logged into your account together with other customisations.
For example, you as the user of a website do not need to enter your login details on each visit to the website, because this is handled by the website and by the cookie stored in your browser.
Regarding security matters, such technologies help us with the identification and examination of potentially defective or suspicious access to our websites, user accounts and our network (e.g.
prevention of identity theft, bot attacks, fraud, etc.).
With such technologies, we can also detect technical issues on our website (e.g.
crash reports).
Essential cookies will be provided by us or by a third party whose services are implemented by us on our website (e.g.
reCHAPTCHA, Sentry, Sift Science).
If you block these cookies via your browser, our services cannot be provided to you.




Performance cookies: these cookies and similar technologies (analytic tools) are used to collect information about the visitors of our website (number, frequency, preferences, etc.) and how visitors use our website, so that we can measure and improve the performance of our website, including our services.
They also help us to know which pages and parts of our platform are the most popular or unpopular and how visitors move around the website.
This helps us improve the way our site works as well as the general user experience.
Also, web analytic tools might use cookies to enhance the performance of the website.
Such cookies can be session or persistent cookies.
All information collected by these cookies is aggregated and therefore kept anonymous for us (this does not necessarily apply to third parties, please see 11).
These cookies will be provided by us or by a third party whose services are implemented on our sites.
Blocking such cookies and tools via your browser or opting-out has no effect on the services provided to you.
However, it makes it harder for us to further improve the user experience that our customers appreciate so much.




Advertisement cookies: mostly, such cookies are persistent cookies from third party tools which are implemented on our website.
Among other uses, such cookies allow us to deliver advertisement more relevant to you and your interests (customised advertising).
We can also track our marketing campaigns with such tools (e.g.
conversion tracking).
Furthermore, they can limit the number of times you see an ad and generally they make advertising more relevant to you.
Such cookies might collect information about you and your browsing habits, like the pages you have visited and the links you have followed.
Advertising networks very often set such cookies with the permission of the website operator, whereby they can be linked directly to the websites of such companies.
Thus, such third parties may be able to track your browser across other websites and create a profile with your interests.
especially if you are logged into your social media accounts while surfing.
This can also affect the content you see on other websites you visit.
Such advertising tools also allow us to deliver ads to people on other websites or in social media who have previously visited our website (also âretargetingâ).
All information collected by these tools is aggregated and therefore kept anonymous for us (this does not necessarily apply to third parties, please see 11).
Blocking these cookies via your browser or the opt-out has no effect on the services offered to you.
However, you will still see ads, but they won't be personalised for you and therefore less relevant for you.




Other tracking technologies: Files or code like, e.g.
pixel, scripts, web beacons, gifs or page tags, might be implemented in emails (e.g.
newsletter), applications or in ads, to record your interaction with us, so that we can better analyse and improve our services and campaigns.
You can generally block such technologies by adjusting either your browser or device settings (please see 9).
As long as you use the browser, these settings should apply to all technologies, whether they are on a website or in an email.
However, in some cases, depending on your email or browser settings, the files might be automatically accepted.
Blocking such cookies and similar technologies does not affect the service offered to you.




Mobile App Tracking: When you use our Mobile App, we might record information that is unique to you and associated with your device (such as operating system, IP-address, browser type, device type, unique device identification number), your activities within the app, and your network location.
This information is used to measure and improve the performance and usability of the Mobile App.



&nbsp.

Personal Data:




Do we process personal data via cookies?



In general, no personal data will be processed via cookies.
However, in some cases the collected data might be considered as personal data and so, we might process personal data via cookies on our website.
If we want to process your personal data, then only to the extent there is a legal basis and purpose for the processing and only in accordance with the applicable data protection laws (e.g.
GDPR and DSG).
For further information in this regard, we refer to our Privacy Policy.


&nbsp.

Hyperlinks:




What about links to other websites and content of third parties?



Our website and this Cookie Policy contain links to other websites and by clicking on the links you will be redirected to a website of a third-party over which we have no control.
Therefore, we do not assume any liability for the content of such websites.
The respective provider of the linked website is solely responsible for the content and correctness of the information provided there, as well as for the tracking and setting of cookies by such websites.


&nbsp.

This can be done in all commonly used internet browsers.
If you use a DNT (âDo Not Trackâ) function, we wonât track you or store any first-party cookies on your devices.
However, please note that this does not apply to Essential Cookies.
Furthermore, tracking tools from third-parties might be still able to track you (for further information see Point 9.4 and 11).
If the setting of cookies is fully disabled in your internet browser, not all functions of our website may be fully usable for you.



You can find a description of appropriate settings for each common browser with the following links: Google Chrome and Chrome Android and Chrome iOS Safari and Safari iOS Mozilla Firefox Internet Explorer

&nbsp.

For further information regarding these tools and the processing of your personal data in this regard as well as the opt-out possibilities, please see the table with links for each provider in point 11.

&nbsp.

Cookie consent:




How do you give your consent to the use of cookies?



The first time you visit our website with one of your devices, a pop-up will appear (âcookie-bannerâ) with the information that our website uses cookies as well as a link to our Cookie Policy and Privacy Policy.
With the cookie-banner we will ask you for your consent to the use of cookies.






&nbsp.

Which cookies are covered by your consent?



We have divided the cookies we use into three categories: âEssentialâ, âPerformanceâ and âAdvertisementâ.
In our cookie-banner, you can tick the boxes and therefore decide if you consent to the categories regarding Performance and/or Advertisement cookies or not.
Essential cookies are necessary for providing our services to you (e.g.
helpdesk, language, login, etc.) as well as for the security of our website and our clients (e.g.
reCAPTCHA, Sift Science) and therefore you cannot opt-out this category.
If you block these essential cookies via your browser, our services cannot be provided to you.



By clicking on the "Accept All" button, you expressly consent to the use of the three categories of cookies or, depending on your selection, only the categories of cookies you have selected.
In addition, you agree to the related data processing and our Cookie Policy.


&nbsp.

How can you revoke your consent?



You can revoke your consent for advertising and performance cookies at any time by deleting the cookies from your device and adjusting your browser settings or the settings in the cookie-banner.
However, such settings may compromise the functionality of the website and the ads you see.
The revocation of your consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.



Please note, that if you unsubscribe from advertising cookies, the ads will not be removed from the websites you visit.
instead, it means that the ads you see might not match your interests.


&nbsp.

Which cookies can we use without your consent?



We do not give you an opt-out possibility regarding the use of essential cookies, but you still have the possibility to block such cookies via your browser settings.
The usage of essential cookies might be necessary for the performance of the contract with you or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract (Art 6 para 1 lit b GDPR) or to maintain our legitimate interests (Art 6 para 1 lit b GDPR).
Therefore, your explicit consent for using essential cookies is not necessary.
Such cookies ensure the functionality and security of our website and services.
We assume that such a use of cookies is also in your interest, this because they help us to prevent crashes or other technical issues on our website and protect the confidentiality of your data.
If you block these cookies via your browser, our services cannot be provided to you.



In most cases Essential Cookies are session cookies and no personal data is processed with them.
With such cookies we might process for example: date and time of your request, IP address, time zone, language, details of the request (specific page), information about your browser (version of the browser), the device and the operating system, network connection (e.g.
Wi-Fi or cellular).
For further information, please see also our Privacy Policy.



Through the use of the following tools we can provide you with, our services analyse the causes of technical malfunctions and avoid the authenticity of your data being impaired.
Therefore, the use of these tools is covered by the mentioned legal bases:

The software provides us also with anonymous statistical data regarding the usage of our customer support (see also point 11).




Sift Science: this tool is only active when you use the log-in or sign-up button.
The software helps us to prevent our website against criminal activities (e.g.
fraud) and to protect your personal data against unlawful or unauthorised access, disclosure or use.

reCAPTCHA: this tool is only active when you use the log-in or sign-up button.
The software helps us to detect abusive traffic and spam.

Tell-a-Friend and Affiliate programme: We use this first party cookie to determine when affiliates or participants of the Tell-a-Friend Programme refer new customers to Bitpanda.
This reference cookie is only set if you have been recruited within such a programme.

You can delete this cookie at any time via the settings of your browser or device.



&nbsp.

Which tools from third parties do we use and how you can opt-out?
