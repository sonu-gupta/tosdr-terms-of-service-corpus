European Union UsersData protection law in Europe requires a âlawful basisâ for collecting and retaining personal information from citizens or residents of the European Economic Area.
Our lawful bases include:

Performing the contract we have with you: In certain circumstances, we need your personal data to comply with our contractual obligation to deliver the Services, enable creators to establish and display their dares, and enable backers to find and make pledges to them.
Legal compliance: Sometimes the law says we need to collect and use your data.
For example, tax laws require us to retain records of pledges and payments made through our Services.

Legitimate interests: This is a technical term in data protection law which essentially means we have a good and fair reason to use your data and we do so in ways which do not hurt your interests and rights.
We sometimes require your data to pursue our legitimate interests n a way that might reasonably be expected as part of running our business and that does not materially impact your rights, freedom or interests.
For example, we use identity, device, and location information to prevent fraud and abuse and to keep the Services secure.
We may also send you promotional communications about our Services, subject to your right to control whether we do so.
We analyze how users interact with our Site so we can understand better what elements of the design are working well and which are not working so well.
This allows us to improve and develop the quality of the online experience we offer all our users.

How This Information Is Shared
 Information thatâs shared publiclyWhen you create an account, we create a basic profile page for you on Dare Drop, containing your username, the date the account was created, and a list of dares you have funded or completed.
Your profile is private.
Your username appears with dares you create or claim on Dare Drop.
Creators are also asked to verify their identities before claiming a dare.
Once this has been done, the creatorâs Verified Name will be publicly displayed on their account profile and on any dares they create or claim.

 Information that isnât shared publiclyThe following data will not be publicly displayed or revealed to other users:

Any payment information you provide;
Your password details;
Your IP address;
Your phone number;
Your date of birth and other identity verification documentation (for creators).
and
Communications you send to us (for example, when you ask for support, send us questions or comments, or report a problem).


Information thatâs shared with trusted third-party servicesWe may share your information with certain trusted third-party services to help us provide, improve, promote, or protect Dare Dropâs Services (like when we partner with payment processors, or use services that help us manage our ads on other sites).
When we share data with third-party services that support our delivery of the Dare Drop Services, we require that they use your information only for the purposes weâve authorized, and that they protect your personal information at least to the same standards we do.
We may also share information thatâs aggregated and anonymized in a way that it doesnât directly identify you.

Information thatâs shared with creators and collaboratorsWhen you back a dare, the dareâs deliverer will know your username, and the amount you have pledged.
Deliverers never receive backersâ credit card details or other payment information.
If a dare you have backed is successfully funded, the creator will receive the email address associated with your Dare Drop account.
They may also send you a survey requesting information needed to provide any reward.
(For instance, they may need your mailing address, or T-shirt size.) Any information you provide in such surveys will be received by the deliverer.
Deliverers are required to keep backer information confidential, except as strictly necessary to communicate with backers directly and fulfill rewards.
Delverers should not ask for personal information that isnât necessary to provide your reward, and should never request sensitive personal information such as your Social Security number or payment information.
Contact us at support@DareDrop.com if you receive a request for information that seems inappropriate or excessive
Collaborators are third parties that deliverers can appoint to help manage their dare.
These collaborators may be able to access the information available to deliverers (including backersâ names, email addresses, pledge amounts, messages, and survey responses), and are required to treat backersâ personal information with the same care and respect as deliverers are.
Deliverers and their collaborators may also receive routine traffic analytics about their dare pages.

Information thatâs shared to protect Dare Drop and comply with the lawWe do reserve the right to disclose personal information when we believe that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with the law or law enforcement, to prevent fraud or abuse, or to protect Dare Dropâs legal rights, property, or the safety of Dare Drop, its employees, users, or others.TOS for Links
