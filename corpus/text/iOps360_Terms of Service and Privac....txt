Privacy Policy



This is our updated Privacy Policy that took effect on February 15, 2018.



Your privacy is critically important to us.
At Brad Goodman Solutions, we have a few fundamental principles:


We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information that we collect about you through the operation of our serviworces.
We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.
We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what information shared and permanently deleted.
We help protect you from overreaching government demands for your personal information.
We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your personal information.

Below is Brad Goodman Solutionsâ privacy policy, which incorporates and clarifies these principles.

Who We Are and What This Policy Covers

We are the folks behind the Emergency Services Scheduler which provides tools to you and your organization to help you do your job quickly and efficiently.
Our mission is to combine all the tools you commonly use into one platform built on your suggestions.
This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use:

Our websites (including bradgoodmansolutions.com and esscheduler.com);
Our mobile applications (including the BGS Messenger for Android).
and
Other products and services that are available on or through our websites (including Google calendar sync platforms).

Throughout this Privacy Policy weâll refer to our website, mobile applications and other products and services collectively as âServices.â
Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that information.
Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any of our products or services that have a separate privacy policy.
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us.

Information We Collect

We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do soâfor example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better.
We collect information in three ways: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our services, and from outside sources.
Letâs go over the information that we collect.


Information You Provide to Us


Itâs probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us.
The amount and type of information depends on the context and how we use the information.
Here are some examples:


Basic Account Information: We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account.
For example, we require individuals who sign up for a Brad Goodman Solutions account to provide your name, a login and email addressâand thatâs it.
You may provide us with more informationâlike your phone number(s) and cell phone numberâbut we donât require that information to create your account.

Public Profile Information: If you have an account with us, we collect the information that you provide for your public profile.
This public profile is only public to your organization and is not accessible to the general public or anyone outside your organization.
Your public profile is just thatâpublicâso please keep that in mind when deciding what information you would like to include.

Content Information: Depending on the Services you use, you may also provide us with information about you in the content for your profile and features.
For example, if you write a note with your leave request or availability that includes biographic information about you, we will have that information, and so will anyone with access to your approval of these items.
This might be obvious to youâ¦but itâs not to everyone!

Credentials: We do not store credentials for other service providers that you provide â for example, when you authorize the Google Calendar sync.
Your credentials as sent to Google which provides us with a token that allows changes to your calendar.

Communications with Us: You may also provide us information when you respond to surveys, communicate with our engineers about a support question, or post a question about your site in our public forums.



Information We Collect Automatically


We also collect some information automatically:


Log Information: Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information.
We collect log information when you use our Servicesâfor example, when you create or make changes to your website on bradgoodmansolutions.com.

Usage Information:We collect information about your usage of our Services.
For example, we collect information about the actions that site administrators and users perform on a siteâin other words, who did what, when and to what thing on a site (e.g., [user name] added availability for  [time/date]).
We also collect information about what happens when you use our Services (e.g., page views, support document searches at bradgoodmansolutions.com, button clicks) along with information about your device (e.g., mobile screen size, name of cellular network, and mobile device manufacturer).
We use this information to, for example, provide our Services to you, as well as get insights on how people use our Services, so we can make our Services better.

Location Information: We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address.
We collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions.

Stored Information: We may access information stored on your mobile device via our mobile app.
We access this stored information through your device operating systemâs permissions.
 For example, if you give us permission to access the Brad Goodman Solutions database storage on your mobile deviceâs database, our Services may access the database stored on your device to make the application operate.

Information from Cookies &amp.
Other Technologies: A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitorâs computer, and that the visitorâs browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns.
Brad Goodman Solutions uses cookies and other technologies to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services, as well as track and understand e-mail campaign effectiveness.



Information We Collect from Other Sources


We may also get information about you from other sources.
For example, if you create or log into your Brad Goodman Solutions account through another service (like Google) we will receive information from that service (such as your username, and basic profile information) via the authorization procedures used by that service.
The information we receive depends on which services you authorize and any options that are available.&nbsp.
Your agency also has the option to link your account to publicly accessible websites to verify your licenses and credentials.&nbsp.
We will make every attempt to link your profile correctly and it is your responsibility to inform your Administrators and/or Brad Goodman Solutions should your imported data be incorrect.
We may also get information from third party services about individuals who are not yet our users (â¦but we hope will be!), which we may use, for example, for marketing and advertising purposes.

How We Use Information

We use information about you as mentioned above and as follows:

To provide our Servicesâfor example, to set up and maintain your account, host your scheduling suite, and backup and restore your scheduling suite;
To further develop our Servicesâfor example by adding new features that we think our users will enjoy or will help them to create and manage their websites more efficiently;
To monitor and analyze trends and better understand how users interact with our Services, which helps us improve our Services and make them easier to use;
To monitor and protect the security of our Services, detect and prevent fraudulent transactions and other illegal activities, fight spam, and protect the rights and property of Brad Goodman Solutions and others;
To communicate with you about offers and promotions offered by Brad Goodman Solutions and others we think will be of interest to you, solicit your feedback, or keep you up to date on Brad Goodman Solutions and our products.
and
To personalize your experience using our Services, provide content recommendations.


Sharing Information



How We Share Information


We do not sell our usersâ private personal information.
We share information about you in the limited circumstances spelled out below and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy:


Subsidiaries, Employees, and Independent Contractors
:We may disclose information about you to our subsidiaries, our employees, and individuals who are our independent contractors that need to know the information in order to help us provide our Services or to process the information on our behalf.
We require our subsidiaries, employees, and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for personal information that we share with them.

Third Party Vendor
s:We may share information about you with third party vendors who need to know information about you in order to provide their services to us.
This group includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you (like Google for calendar sync) and those that help us understand and enhance our Services (like analytics providers).
We require vendors to agree to privacy commitments in order to share information with them.

As Required by Law: We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request.
For more information on how we respond to requests for information about bradgoodmansolutions.com users, please contact Brad Goodman.

To Protect Rights and Property: We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Brad Goodman Solutions, third parties, or the public at large.
For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information related to the emergency without delay.

Business Transfer
s:In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that Brad Goodman Solutions goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.
If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.

With Your Consent:We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction.
For example, we may share your information with third parties with which you authorize us to do so, such as the Google with our Google Calendar Sync feature.

Aggregated and De-Identified Information: We may share information that has been aggregated or reasonably de-identified, so that the information could not reasonably be used to identify you.
For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services.

Published Support Requests
:And if you send us a request (for example, via a support email or one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.



Information Shared Publicly


Information you share is not available outside your organization except for public information indexed by search engines or used by third parties.
Please keep all of this in mind when deciding what you would like to share.

Security

While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so.

Choices

You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:


Limit the Information that You Provide:If you have an account with us, you can choose not to provide the optional account information.
Please keep in mind that if you do not provide this information, certain features of our Servicesâfor example, email and SMS notificationsâmay not be accessible.

Limit Access to Information On Your Mobile Device:Your mobile device operating system should provide you with the ability to discontinue our ability to collect stored information or location information via our mobile apps.
If you do so, you may not be able to use certain.

Opt-Out of Electronic Communications:You may opt out of receiving promotional messages from us.
Just follow the instructions in those messages.
If you opt out of promotional messages, we may still send you other messages, like those about your account and legal notices.

Set Your Browser to Reject Cookies:At this time, Brad Goodman Solutions does not respond to âdo not trackâ signals across all of our Services.
However, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies before using Brad Goodman Solutionsâ websites, with the drawback that certain features of Brad Goodman Solutionsâ websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

User Guidelines



This is our updated User Guidelines that took effect on January 1, 2018.


User Guidelines
BradGoodmanSolutions.com strongly believes in freedom of speech.
We have a vast audience spread across many cultures, countries and backgrounds with varying values and our service is designed to let users freely express any ideas and opinions without us censoring or endorsing them.
That being said, there are a few categories of content and behavior that we donât permit because we consider them harmful to the community.
To be transparent about what is and isnât allowed on your site, weâve put together this set of guidelines.
The following activity/material isnât allowed on BradGoodmanSolutions .com.

Illegal content and conduct.&nbsp.
Self-explanatory.
Intellectual property infringement.
BradGoodmanSolutions.com is a publishing, rather than a file sharing platform, so we recognize that copyrighted materials are often used in fair use context.
We strongly support this and urge copyright holders to take this into consideration before submitting complaints.
If youâre not sure, a good rule of thumb is to always ask the rights holder for permission before republishing their content.
Pornography.
We know that there may be different definitions of this, but generally, we define pornography as visual depictions of sexually explicit acts.
Technologically harmful content.
Please donât upload or link to malware, spyware, adware, or other malicious or destructive code.
Impersonation.&nbsp.
Donât claim to be a person or organization youâre not.
(Parody and satire are ok though!)
Directly threatening material.
Do not post direct and realistic threats of violence.
That is, you cannot post a genuine call for violenceâor deathâagainst an individual person, or groups of persons.
This doesnât mean that weâll remove all hyperbole or offensive language.
Posting private information.&nbsp.
Donât share someoneâs personal information without their consent.
This includes collecting sensitive information in Contact Forms such as account passwords and credit card numbers, to name a couple.
Advertising.&nbsp.
Advertising isnât permitted.
Spam or machine-generated content.&nbsp.
You know what this is, but in general, sites such as those primarily dedicated to drive traffic to third party sites, boost SEO, phish, spoof, or promote affiliate marketing arenât cool.
We donât want you to pollute the web outside of BradGoodmanSolutions.com either, so we ask you to please avoid sending unwanted or unsolicited promotions or emails about your site, even if itâs not on BradGoodmanSolutions.com.com.
Bear in mind that these are just guidelines â interpretations are solely up to us.
These guidelines are not exhaustive and are subject to change.

If you believe a BradGoodmanSolutions.com.com site has violated our Terms of Service or any of these policies, please report the site. We aim to promptly review and investigate all complaints that we receive, but if and how we respond will depend on a variety of factors, such as the information available to us and the type of violation.
We may also contact the site owner to inform him/her of the complaint.
If weâre not in a position to make a determination (for example, whether something is defamatory or not), we defer to the judgment of a court.
