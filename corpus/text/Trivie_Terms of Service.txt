Terms Privacy Payment Policy Dear friends of Trivie,



Over the past few weeks, news of the spread of COVID-19, or coronavirus disease, is affecting all of our families, our businesses, our communities, and our way of life.
During this time, I wanted to reach out and update our customers, friends, and partners on how weâre approaching the situation at Trivie.




At Trivie, as at your companies, weâre focused on the health and safety of our employees, families and communities.
We have asked all of our employees to follow the federal, local, and the Centers for Disease Control guidelines for prevention.
You can learn more about those guidelines here (link).



For our clients, we realize this is a challenging time, business continuity is critical, especially since all in-person meetings and training events have been canceled.
In that regard, we can assist you in a smooth transition in that area via our remote learning technology.



Hereâs how: 




We have pre-populated Trivie with critical COVID-19 information from the CDC, The World Health Organization, and Harvard Medical School, so you can engage employees with this information now and in the weeks ahead.
This content is free to use;
We are offering free onboarding and launch services for Trivie.
and 
We are including free, full-suite analytics to identify where our clients may have knowledge risks on COVID-19 (so they can address in real-time).




All of this is available to any client or future of Trivie today, and we can guarantee a âgo liveâ to any sized remote workforce in a week or less.
Usually inside of one business day.


For all these topics and many others that we didnât cover in this message, please remember that weâre always online to answer any question you may have (you can email our 24-hour contact center at COVID-19@trivie.com).




We hope you, your family, and your loved ones are staying in good health, and if thereâs anything that we can help you with, please just let us know.




Thank you.



Warm regards, 



Lawrence D.
