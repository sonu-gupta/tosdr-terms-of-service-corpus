         FLIPGRID PRIVACY POLICY 
Last Updated: August 5, 2020

Your privacy and that of your students is important to us: 


We do not use personal information to market or advertise to you or students, nor do we permit third parties to do so.
Our Flipgrid website and apps do not show advertising.



We do not sell user personal information.



Flipgrid does use your personal information for certain stated purposes, such as providing and improving the service and communicating with Discussion Owners (but not Students) about new Flipgrid features and events.
Please read the Privacy Policy below, as it describes what information we collect from you, how we use that information, and the legal bases we have to process your information.

This Privacy Policy governs how Flipgrid, Inc., a Microsoft subsidiary, ("Flipgrid," "we," "our," or "us") uses and shares personal information collected by our website at Flipgrid.com, the Flipgrid mobile app, and any associated services (the âServiceâ).

"You" may be a: 


"Discussion Owner" (i.e., an adult over the age of 18, a teacher or other School representative that subscribes to the Service with the administrative right to create, invite, manage, moderate or delete a Flipgrid video that may be set up using the Service ).



a "School" (i.e., an educational institution, organization or other educational business for which one or more Discussion Owners offers the Service to Students).





a "Student" (i.e., an individual who was invited to use the Service at the invitation of a Discussion Owner).
or 


a "User" (i.e., any individual user of the Service, including a Discussion Owner or a Student).




1.
Information Flipgrid Collects

Flipgrid may collect personal information from Users as described below.


1.1Discussion Owner Personal Information (Collected from the Discussion Owner)

When a Discussion Owner creates an account on the Service, we ask you for certain information, such a Discussion Ownerâs first name, last name, email address, password, instruction type, and country.
If you are a teacher or a School, we will also collect your School email address and School name to set up an account.

When a Discussion Owner posts content (text, images, photographs, videos, messages, comments, or any other kind of content) on the Service, the information contained in the posting, including first name, last name, email address, any audio and image included within any video, will be stored in our Service for purposes of providing the Service.

When a Discussion Owner logs into an existing account through their Microsoft or Google account, we may collect first and last name, email address and other information specific to that third party account to authenticate the Discussion Owner.

When a Discussion Owner provides feedback to a Student, such as replying to a video book report, assessing foreign language skills, encouraging group discussion, or prompting the scientific method, we store the feedback in the Service for purposes of providing the Service.

If a Discussion Owner provides us feedback or contacts us via email, we will collect the Discussion Owner's name and email address, as well as any other content included in the email for purposes of replying to the Discussion Owner and improving the Service.


1.2 Student Personal Information

Discussion Owners provide consent for the collection of Student personal information as discussed in Section 6 of this Privacy Policy, below.
When a Student posts content (text, images, photographs, videos, messages, comments, links, or any other kind of content) using the Service, the information contained in the posting, including first name, last name, email address, and any audio and image included within any video will be stored in our Service as per the consent provided by the Discussion Owner.
Depending on the Discussion Ownerâs privacy settings for the Group or Topic, other Users may view and share Student content.

If a Student provides us with feedback or contacts us via email, we will collect the Student's name and email address, as well as any other content included in the email, for purposes of replying to the Student and improving the Service.

For example, device type, the device identifier (UDID), the Open Device Identification Number (ODIN), date/time stamps for each visit, browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, clickstream data, and domain name are all collected for purposes of administering, tracking usage of, and improving the Service.
We may store this information in log files.

These companies use the data they process in accordance with their privacy policies, which may enable these companies to collect and combine information about your activities across websites, apps, or online services.



Each User has a variety of tools to control cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies, including browser controls to block and delete cookies and controls from some third-party analytics service providers to opt out of data collection through web beacons and similar technologies.

Each Group and Topic and the content submitted, will be displayed in the Group or Topic, respectively and will be visible to anyone who joins the Group or Topic as administered and permitted by the Discussion Owner, subject to the Discussion Ownerâs ability to deactivate or moderate submissions.
The Discussion Owner, and not Flipgrid, sets the Group or Topic privacy settings.

Discussion Owners choose whether Users are permitted to link to external sites.
External sites are governed by their respective privacy policies.
Flipgrid leverages Youtube.com's and Vimeo.com's enhanced privacy modes to mark links as 'do not track.

Information Choices and Changes

Users may opt out of providing personal information to the Service at any time by uninstalling the application.
Users may also opt out of providing personal information by emailing support@Flipgrid.com to have their account removed or by asking their Discussion Owner to remove their content.
Flipgrid will stop collecting the Userâs personal information in these cases, but may still retain the Userâs personal information as outlined in the âData Retentionâ (Section 8) of this Policy (below).

Our communication email regarding events, news and other such topics explain how to opt out of receiving such emails.
If a User opts out, we may still send them operational emails that pertain to the User's account and notifications regarding our services.

Users may send requests about their personal information to our contact information in Section 14 below, including to change contact choices, opt out of our sharing with others, and review, update, correct, or delete personal information.
Once the User has been authenticated, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor these requests.
We may retain an archived copy of User records as required by law.
Such opt outs may result in disruption or cancellation of the Service or impairment of certain Service functionality.

Users may also contact the Discussion Owner and request that the video be removed.
If the Discussion Owner is not able to remove the video, Users can contact us at support@Flipgrid.com and request that such videos be removed.
However, we will only be able to remove the video if (a) the User provided their email address when posting the video and (b) the User sends the email request to us using that same email address.
Otherwise, we may not be able to remove a posted video.
Deletion of a video removes it from the Group or Topic.

Discussion Owners have certain options with respect to the privacy settings of their Groups and Topics.
For example, Discussion Owners choose how Users gain access to their Groups and Topic and whether those Groups and Topics are moderated.
Parents and Students should send all requests regarding these privacy settings directly to the Discussion Owner.


6.
COPPA AND STUDENTS


6.1 Notice to Parents and Schools

Under the United States Childrenâs Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"), verifiable parental consent is needed to collect, use, or disclose personal information (e.g., full name and email address) from each User under 13 years old.
In accordance with COPPA, a teacher or Discussion Owner may act as the agent of the parent or legal guardian of a Student and provide consent on behalf of the parent for Flipgridâs collection, use, and disclosure of the Studentâs personal information.
By enrolling a Student under 13 to use the Service, the School provides such consent to us and agrees that the Studentsâ activities while on the Service are subject to our Terms.
Please see Flipgridâs Teacher Toolkit (https://static.Flipgrid.com/docs/Flipgrid_dos_donts.pdf) and Parent Consent Form (http://static.Flipgrid.com/docs/Flipgrid_consent_form.pdf) for guidelines on how teachers and Schools should provide consent on behalf of parents.

This Privacy Policy does not govern any School's collection, use, or disclosure of a Student Userâs personal information through the Service, and we are not responsible for any such collection, use, or disclosure.
Parents should contact the teacher or Discussion Owner directly to understand the Discussion Ownerâs privacy practices or to request to access, change or delete information collected by the Discussion Owner in connection with the Service that cannot otherwise be accessed, changed or deleted as described in this Privacy Policy.

As required under COPPA, parents can make certain choices regarding how their childâs information is used.
(For more information, see âParentâs Choices Regarding Information on Students Under 13,â in Section 6.2 below).
Parents should submit these requests to the teacher or Discussion Owners, and the teacher or Discussion Owners, as the parentâs agent, must pass those requests to us by emailing support@Flipgrid.com.


6.2 Parentâs Choices Regarding Information on Students Under 13

Under COPPA, parents of Students under 13 have certain rights with respect to our collection, use, retention, and disclosure of their Studentâs information.
This includes the right to review, update, or delete Student information, as well as prohibit our sharing Student information with third parties.
Parents can exercise these rights by contacting the Studentâs Discussion Owner, and the Discussion Owner should submit these requests, on the parentâs behalf, to Flipgrid by emailing support@Flipgrid.com.
Notwithstanding any such requests, we may continue to share the Student information for non-Service purposes as described in Section 3, âInformation We Share.â 
A parent should request deletion of the Studentâs information (such as videos submitted) through the Discussion Owner.
Upon receiving such requests, the Discussion Owner can request deletion of the Studentâs information by emailing support@Flipgrid.com.
This will delete the Student information from our live databases.
We will not have any liability whatsoever for any termination of the account or related deletion of the Student information.
When we delete personal information, it will be deleted from our active databases but may remain in our archives for up to 30 days.

Schools and Discussion Owners should always obtain parental consent for a Student under 13 to use the Service.
Please see Flipgridâs Teacher Toolkit (https://static.Flipgrid.com/docs/Flipgrid_dos_donts.pdf) and Parent Consent Form (http://static.Flipgrid.com/docs/Flipgrid_consent_form.pdf) for tips on how to obtain proper consent from parents.
