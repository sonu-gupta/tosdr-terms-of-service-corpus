That's why we make these promises:


We will never share information about you with any other person or company.We will not sell your information.


We will not sell your information.


We will only keep information that is absolutely necessary to serve you.


Like most web servers, ours logs each request and the IP address of the sender.
We only keep this information for a few months, or whenever it is replaced by the server -- it's only looked at by Joe when something might be wrong, and then generally only to find his own IP address to see the results of testing.


If we send you an email, then our email service providers obviously do receive your email address so that they can deliver the message.
As of June 2018, we may send transactional or newsletter emails to you via HostedEmail.com, an OpenSRS.com service&nbsp.
or Amazon Simple Email Service .
Some emails might be sent directly from one of our servers.
Regardless, there may be a record in a log file somewhere, somehow, that indicates that we sent an email to you.



PayPal

KarenWare.com never receives, nor processes, nor stores your banking or card information.

PayPal handles all banking transactions.
All forms asking for your personal information are hosted by and should be obviously secured by PayPal from their own website, including SSL certificates in their name ONLY.
You are not required to have a PayPal account to send a payment to us.
You can complete your transaction as our guest if you do not want to create a PayPal account.

Upon your confirmation, we then direct your browser to load and run PayPal's Button API code to replace our payment button images with the proper images for payment options available in your country.

PayPal is responsible for respecting their own privacy policies.
