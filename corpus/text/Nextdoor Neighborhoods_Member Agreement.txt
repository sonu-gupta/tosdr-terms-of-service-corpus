1.
Eligibility.

Each person is limited to one account per residence, and you may not share your account password with anyone else (even a family member sharing your home) or allow someone else to use your personal account.
Specialized accounts (such as Business Pages) are allowed to authorize more than one representative of their business or organization to utilize their account password for use in their official capacity.
When you register for Nextdoor you must use your real name, not a pseudonym, except in circumstances that, in Nextdoorâs sole judgment, warrant an exception.&nbsp.
Submitting inaccurate registration information, registering if you know you donât meet our eligibility requirements, or otherwise providing false registration information is a violation of this Agreement and could constitute a crime.
You may not use our Services if: (1) you are a resident of the United States and are under 13 years old, or if you are a resident of the EU and are under 16 years old (or do not meet applicable age requirements to use social media services where you live).
(2) you are a registered sex offender or share a household with one.
(3) we previously disabled your account for violations of our terms or policies.
or (4) you are prohibited from receiving our Services or platform under applicable law.&nbsp.
If you are under the age of eighteen (18), you represent that a parent or legal guardian also agrees to this Agreement on your behalf and that you are fully able and competent to enter into this Agreement.
We need your help to enforce these eligibility requirements.
If you believe that a member in your neighborhood does not meet these eligibility requirements, you may report your concerns to us via our Help Center.
Nextdoor reserves the right to refuse registration to any person or household and to suspend, delete or deactivate your account or limit your privileges at any time, without liability to you.
2.
Account types.

Nextdoor offers personal accounts to individual residential members, and special, restricted-functionality accounts to government agencies, such as city offices or police or fire departments, and to businesses, nonprofits, news media, and other organizations.
Special accounts agree to additional terms and are limited in the conversations they can see.
Special accounts canât access private messages that do not include them.
Please note, not all Nextdoor account types and features are available in all locations.

3.
Privacy and preferences.

We donât charge you to use Nextdoor.
instead, businesses and organization pay us to show you ads for their products and services.&nbsp.
By using Nextdoor, you understand that we can show you ads that we think will be relevant to you and your interests and you acknowledge that you have read the Privacy Policy, which explains how we handle membersâ and visitorsâ personal information. 
The Services, including any personalized Services, cannot be provided and the Agreement cannot be performed without Nextdoor processing data about you and other members and visitors.
The provision of personalized content and ads is essential to the provision of our Services and a core part of our agreement with you.
In particular, in order to provide our Services on a continuous and consistent basis under this Agreement, it is necessary for us to provide and personalize advertising based on your use of Nextdoor, including with information regarding your interests and your on-site and off-site actions.
By default, you will receive notifications from Nextdoor about posts from neighbors and from government agencies.
You may also opt in to various topics for which you will then receive notifications.
You can change your preferences about receiving messages from government agencies, businesses, or other organizations here, and customize your default and opt-in neighborhood notification settings here.

4.
Content and feedback.

You retain all ownership rights to the text, photos, video, responses and other content you submit to Nextdoor (collectively, your âContentâ).
You give us permission, in the form of a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, and worldwide license, to use, copy, and publish your Content based on your Nextdoor settings and the selections you make when posting and as otherwise described in our Privacy Policy.&nbsp.
This means, for example, if you post a comment on Nextdoor, you give us permission to store, copy, and share it with others (consistent with your settings), such as with service providers that support our Services.
Do not provide us with any Content that you donât have the right to publish, or that is defamatory, infringing, illegal or otherwise tortious.
We do not proactively moderate Content posted by members.
however, we can remove Content posted by you, suspend, delete or deactivate your account or limit privileges, or otherwise refuse service to you, if you violate this Agreement or our other policies, or infringe intellectual property, or otherwise engage in behavior that we think harms a Nextdoor neighborhood.
You give us permission to use your name and profile picture, and information about actions you have taken on Nextdoor next to or in connection with ads, offers and other sponsored content we display in connection with our Services, with no additional compensation to you.&nbsp.
For example, we may use your name and profile picture to show your nearby neighbors that you have liked, commented on or recommended a business or brand that has paid us to display its ads, offers or other sponsored content on Nextdoor.&nbsp.
We may also post and re-post these likes, comments, recommendations and other interactions, along with your name and profile picture, in different areas of the Services from time to time.&nbsp.
For example, if you recommend a business, that recommendation will appear in your feed, may later be re-posted from time to time in connection with that businessâs other ads on Nextdoor, and may also appear in lists of Nextdoor member recommendations featured on the businessâs Business Pages.
For the avoidance of doubt, this permission is not intended to constitute a consent under EU data protection law. 
We welcome you to share any feedback, suggestions, or ideas you have about Nextdoor with us, so long as you understand we may have already had the same idea, and you agree that we are free to use any feedback you voluntarily provide with no restriction or obligation (payment or otherwise) to you.

Be a good neighbor.

At Nextdoor, we believe that neighborly behavior is the foundation of healthy communities.
This Agreement includes our Community Guidelines on appropriate use of Nextdoor.

5.2.
Transactions with other members.

In using Nextdoor and its member-to-member transactional features (such as For Sale &amp.
Free), you, and not Nextdoor, are responsible for your own decisions and actions.
In addition, your use of Business Pages or any similar feature does not make us an employer, placement agency, representative, or agent of or for you or any other neighbor or service provider.

Nextdoor is not a party to transactions or disputes between members.
If you write a recommendation or other comment about a transaction with a neighbor or their business (for example, a recommendation of a tutor), be truthful, fair and neighborly in your comments, and do not post any of their personal information (e.g., address, mobile number, or photos) without their permission.

5.3.
Disputes between members.
waiver of claims against Nextdoor.

In the real world and online, neighbors sometimes disagree.
If you have a dispute with another Nextdoor member, we hope that you will be able to work it out amicably.
However, if you cannot, please understand that Nextdoor is not responsible for the actions of its members.
each member is responsible for their own actions and behavior, whether using Nextdoor or chatting over the back fence.
Accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you release us (and our officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures and employees) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.
If you are a California resident, you hereby waive California Civil Code Â§1542, which says: âA general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or releasing party.â

Neighborhood Leads.

Some members, known as Leads, are provided with additional account features to use to support their neighborhood.
they are not Nextdoor employees, representatives, or agents.

Nextdoor does not charge for sending text messages, but your carrier may charge you.
Alerts sent via SMS may not be delivered if your phone is not in range of a transmission site, or if sufficient network capacity is not available at a particular time.
furthermore, within a coverage area, factors beyond the control of the userâs wireless carrier may interfere with message delivery, including equipment, terrain, proximity to buildings, foliage, and weather.

Governing law.

This Agreement is governed by California law, without giving effect to any conflict of law principles, except as may be otherwise provided in the Arbitration Agreement section of this Agreement.&nbsp.
However, the governing law provision regarding the interpretation of this Agreement is not intended to create any other substantive right to non-Californians to assert claims under California law whether that be by statute, common law, or otherwise.&nbsp.
This section is only intended to specify the use of California law to interpret this Agreement. 

18.1.2.
Arbitration agreement.

Applicability.

You agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to your access or use of the Nextdoorâs website, mobile apps, and service, or to any aspect of your relationship with Nextdoor, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify.

18.1.2.2.
Arbitration rules and forum.
 

The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.&nbsp.
To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to Nextdoor, Inc., 875 Stevenson Street, Suite 700, San Francisco, CA 94103, attn: Legal Department.&nbsp.
The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider.&nbsp.
Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneysâ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMSâs most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/.
all other claims shall be subject to JAMSâs most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/.&nbsp.

If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.&nbsp.
If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMSâs filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, Nextdoor will pay them for you.&nbsp.
In addition, Nextdoor will reimburse all such JAMSâs filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.&nbsp.
You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person or at another mutually agreed location.&nbsp.
Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

18.1.2.3.
Authority of arbitrator.
 

The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (i) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement and (ii) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.&nbsp.
The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Nextdoor.&nbsp.
The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim.
The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forumâs rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement).
The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.&nbsp.
The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.&nbsp.
The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. 

18.1.2.4.
Waiver of jury trial.
 

YOU AND NEXTDOOR HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.&nbsp.

Waiver of class or other non-individualized relief.
 

ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.&nbsp.
If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this subsectionâs limitations as to a given claim for relief, then the claim must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the federal or state court located in San Francisco, California.&nbsp.
All other claims shall be arbitrated. 

18.1.2.6.
30-day right to opt out. 

You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Agreement that mandate arbitration by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: legal@nextdoor.com, within 30 days after first becoming subject to a version of this Agreement containing an arbitration provision.&nbsp.
Your notice must include your name and address, your Nextdoor username (if any), the email address you used to set up your Nextdoor account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement.&nbsp.
If you opt out of arbitration, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you.&nbsp.
Opting out of arbitration has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.

18.1.2.7.
Survival of agreement. 

This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Nextdoor.

18.1.2.8.
