Cookies on our services

When you use our services, you may receive cookies or other similar technologies, such as pixel tags from us and the third parties, to collect information on our Services.
A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer when you visit a website.
Tracking pixels (sometimes referred to as web beacons or clear GIFs) are tiny electronic tags with a unique identifier that are sometimes embedded in websites, online ads and/or email, and that are designed to provide usage information like ad impressions (how many times an ad is viewed) or clicks, to measure popularity of the Services and associated advertising, and to access information from user cookies.
Cookies can be set by either us on the site that you visit (âfirst-party cookiesâ) or a third party involved in providing content, functionality, or services such as analytics or advertising for the site that you visit (âthird-party cookiesâ). 
We use cookies to determine that we give you a high-quality experience on our Services.
We also use cookies to show you advertising that is relevant to you.

There are four types of cookies used on our services:

1. Essential cookies â These cookies enable you to use our Services.
These cookies are essential to enable you to browse our Services and use certain features.
Disabling them may prevent you from using certain parts of the Services.
Without these cookies, services such as shopping activity and paying activity cannot be provided.
These cookies also help keep our Services safe and secure.
2. Preference cookies â These cookies store information such as your preferred country and language selection, login data and website preferences.
Without these cookies, our Services may not be able to remember certain choices you've previously made (such as a saved country / language preference) or personalize your browsing experience by providing you with relevant information.
These cookies can also be used to recognize your device so that you do not have to provide the same information more than once.
3. Performance cookies â These cookies collect information about how you use our Services such as which pages you visit regularly.
These cookies are used to provide you with a high-quality experience by doing things such as tracking page load, site response times, and error messages.
4. Content / advertising cookies â These cookies gather information about your use of our Services so we may improve your experience and provide you with more relevant content and advertising.
They are also used to gather feedback on customer satisfaction through surveys.
They remember that you've visited our Services and help us understand usage of our Services.
Some of these cookies are from third parties that collect information about users of our Services (as described below under "Information collected by third parties on our Services") in order to provide advertising (on our Services and elsewhere) based on usersâ online activities (so-called "interest-based advertising") on our Services and elsewhere online.
The third parties involved in interest-based advertising collect internet browsing information (e.g., websites visited, time of visit) across different websites and over time, and they may use the information they collect on our Services to provide you ads (from us and other companies) across the internet.
However, if you prefer, you can change your cookie settings.
Some browsers have options that allow the visitor to control whether the browser will accept cookies, reject cookies, or notify the visitor each time a cookie is sent.
You may elect to reject cookies by adjusting your settings, but doing so may limit the range of features available to you on our Services and other major websites that use cookies.
Please note that your opt-out choice is often stored in a cookie.
Blocking cookies may prevent our Services from operating as expected and may also prevent your consent choices from being stored.
That may mean that if you opt-out, then block cookies, we may not know about, or be able to honor, your opt-out.
You should also be aware that blocking cookies on your computer will not affect your consent choices on a different device, such as a mobile device.
Our Services also occasionally use "local shared objects" (also known as "Flash cookies").
Like browser cookies, Flash cookies may be used for coordinating content delivery, website functionality, maintaining preferences, advertising, or analytics.
Unlike browser cookies, "Flash cookies" are not stored in the browser.
You may be able to manage these Flash cookies by visiting the Adobe website.Browser NameInstructionsSourceGoogle Chrome

To opt out of interest-based advertising across browsers and devices, please opt out through the Digital Advertising Alliance or National Advertising Institute websites, and you also opt out through the settings within the mobile app or your mobile device.
Your opt-out choice may apply only to the browser or device you are using when you opt out, so you should opt out on each of your browsers and devices if you want to disable all cross-device linking for interest-based advertising.
If you opt out, you will still receive ads but they may not be as relevant to you and your interests.

When you use a dedicated app on an Internet-connected device, the provider of the app may use an advertising ID or other methods provided by the device or platform to identify you.
In some cases youâll be able to opt-out of personalized advertising for all applications on a device.
In other cases, you may have the option to opt your platform account out of personalized advertising across multiple devices.
You may also have the option to reset your advertising ID, which is a non-persistent identifier used specifically for advertising that can be reset by the user.
Here are some of your options on a number of platforms and devices: Device or PlatformInformational LinkApple Devices
