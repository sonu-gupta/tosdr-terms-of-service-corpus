IMPORTANT:
PlayStation Network is not for children younger than 7.
If you are 7 to 17 years old, your parent or legal guardian (âResponsible Adultâ) must read and accept these Terms for you.
You can read them too.
Ask your Responsible Adult to explain anything you do not understand.
You can also read the PSN Rules at https://www.playstation.com/legal/psn-rules/.
The Rules are shorter than these Terms.
They help you understand the most important bits.
AS A CONSUMER YOU MAY HAVE RIGHTS UNDER APPLICABLE LOCAL LAWS THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED, LIMITED OR CHANGED.
THOSE RIGHTS TAKE PRIORITY OVER ANYTHING IN THESE TERMS. View table of contents
