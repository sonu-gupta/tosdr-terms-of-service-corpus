We collect information that you enter on our digital properties or give us in other ways (e.g.
when you contact Guest Relations, order on Target.com, purchase a product in a Target store or create a gift registry).



Automated Information Collection

We may connect information collected automatically with information we already have about you in order to identify you as a Target Guest.
If we are able to identify you as a Target Guest we may, for example, link your activity on our website to your activity in a Target store or on one of our mobile applications.
This allows us to provide you with a personalized experience regardless of how you interact with us â online, in store, mobile, etc.

In order to provide the best Guest experience possible, we also use automated information collection technologies for reporting and analysis purposes.
We examine metrics such as how you are shopping on our website, in our stores, and on our mobile applications, the performance of our marketing efforts, and your response to those marketing efforts.


Third-party automated collection

We and our service providers use anonymous identifiers such as cookies and other technologies to collect and store certain types of information (e.g.
click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over, hardware/software information, cookie and session ID) whenever you interact with us or third-parties that use our services.

We also allow third-party companies (e.g., Google) to place tags on our digital properties once approved through our tagging process.
The tags may collect information from your interactions on Target.com.
Our Privacy Policy does not cover these third party companies.
Please contact these third party companies (e.g., Google) directly for more information about their privacy policy and your choices regarding the tags and the information collected by the tags.

For example, precise geo-location can be used to help you find nearby Target stores.

To manage how you share your deviceâs location settings, go to the Choices section of this privacy policy.



Cameras

We use cameras in and around our stores for operational purposes such as measuring traffic patterns and tracking in-stock levels.
Cameras may also be used for fraud detection, theft prevention and security.
When enabled, we may also use your deviceâs camera (e.g.
Appleâs TrueDepth camera) so you can use services such as product visualization (e.g., scan room to see item in your space) or virtual fitting (e.g., scan facial data to try on accessories/beauty products).
Information collected from the TrueDepth camera is used in real time - we do not store this information on our servers or share it with third parties.
