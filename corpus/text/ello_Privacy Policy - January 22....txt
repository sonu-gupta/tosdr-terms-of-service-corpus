Your Privacy is Very Important To Us

Ello takes data privacy seriously.
As a network that does not serve advertisements and that does not sell information about its users or use of the Site (defined below) to third parties, Ello has also taken unique steps that help you control how much information about you is shared when you use the Site.
Please read this document in its entirety and take it seriously.
It explains Ello's privacy practices, and what kind of information we collect when you use our web site located at ello.co and related mobile apps (collectively, the âSiteâ).
and also how you can opt-out of sharing some of this information. Information Ello Collects When you visit The Site, we may collect and store general, non-identifiable information about what pages you access, your general geographic location (e.g., a city, but not a street address), the device you are using, an anonymized version of your IP address, and the address of websites that refer you to the Site.
We also store your email address and UserID that you choose when you register for an account.
We may use this information to protect Ello and its users from spam, viruses, identity theft, illegal or harmful activities, as well as to understand how people use the Site, which features work and which don't, and to help us develop and improve the Site's features and services.
For example, if we create a feature that everybody is using, we want to know about that, so we collect data about how much different features are used.
Additionally, if we have a lot of visitors from The Netherlands (which we do) then we might translate our Help section into Dutch (which we are considering, except none of us speak Dutch).
We may create anonymous records by excluding personally identifiable information (such as your name) from records.
We also collect any information you provide us if you choose to contact us directly or post on our web site or on your page, including any personally identifiable information.
We use this information for the purpose you provided it â for instance, to provide support or answer questions â and to provide you the Site.
Ello uses tools and third party services to gather and aggregate general information about anonymous user behavior.
These tools and services may use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the site, compiling reports on site activity for us and providing other services relating to site activity and internet usage.
These tools and services may also transfer this information to parties where required to do so by law, or where such additional parties process the information on the tool or third party serviceâs behalf.
To the best of our knowledge, the tools or third party services used to gather information on Elloâs behalf collect information in such a way that neither Ello, nor the tools and services, can easily trace saved information back to any individual user.
Ello is unique in that we offer our users the option to opt-out of anonymous information gathering through third party services on the user settings page.
We also respect âDo Not Trackâ browser settings.
On your Ello settings page, you can choose to turn off anonymous information gathering through third party services completely when you visit the Site.
If you choose either of these options, we make best efforts not to send any data about your user behavior, anonymized or otherwise, to any third party service providers.
Please be aware that there may be other services that you are using and that are not controlled by Ello (including Google, Google Chrome Web Browser, Android Operating System, and YouTube) that may continue to send information to third party service providers when you use the Site, even if you have asked us not to send information through our services.
If you want to invite a friend to the Site, you will need to provide us their email address. Email Communications From time to time we may email you information about Ello that we think is necessary and important.
By opening or maintaining an account with Ello, you agree to receive administrative emails as part of your basic service.
You can always opt-out of non-administrative emails.
If anyone ever contacts you and asks for your Ello password, they are probably trying to scam you.
Ello will never do this.
Please don't give your Ello password to anyone, and let us know about it so we can hunt them down and execute suitable punishment.
We may share your information, including personal information, with third parties under several circumstances, including (1) if you tell us it is OK to do so (2) if we believe that we need to do so to comply with applicable law or legal obligations (3) if we contract with a third party service provider to offer services for you â for example, with a credit card processing company if you decide to buy something through the Site.
Ello does not have any affiliated companies right now.
But if we do in the future, we may share information with them, too.
