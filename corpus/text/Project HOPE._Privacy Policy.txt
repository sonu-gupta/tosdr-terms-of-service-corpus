Normal Web Browsing
The information we gather during normal browsing comes from two sources: standard server logs collect information such as the IP (Internet Protocol) address, domain name, browser type, operating system.
and information such as the site that referred you to us, the files you downloaded, the pages you visited, and the dates/times of those visits.
We may use this information to improve our outreach and communications about our work.
Additionally, if you have come into the site from one of our newsletters or from a site that has requested a link to us, we will ask your browser to accept a cookie that carries a general marketing source code with you as you browse through the site, in order to help us match referring site to donations made.
This cookie does not capture or hold any personally identifying information about you, and is deleted when you end your session by leaving our site or closing your browser.

Cookies and Other Technologies

When you visit our website, we might store some information on your computer in the form of a âcookieâ (i.e.
a small piece of text that stores information on your browser in your computerâs hard drive) or similar file.
We use conversion tracking cookies as part of campaigns in order to analyze trends, gather broad demographic information, and monitor site traffic patterns that can help us further develop and improve the design and functionality of our site.
Similarly, we also use cookies for âretargetingâ in our internet advertising campaigns so that third party vendors, including Google, can show you advertising about Project HOPE as you browse the internet.
Retargeting is a marketing tool that identifies you as a previous visitor to the Project HOPE website and targets you for specific outreach messages, encouraging you to revisit our website or consider donating.
The cookies will only be used to obtain non-personal information (you will be anonymous).
