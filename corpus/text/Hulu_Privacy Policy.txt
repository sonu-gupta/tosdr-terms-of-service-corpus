Introduction  Hulu, LLC (âHulu,â âweâ or âusâ) respects your privacy.
This Privacy Policy explains the collection, use, and sharing of information from or about you, including personal information, in connection with your use of the Hulu Services.
The term âHulu Servicesâ refers to our video service, including the selection of television shows, clips, movies, and other content we offer (collectively, the âContentâ) and our player for viewing the Content (the âVideo Playerâ), as well as any other products, features, tools, materials, or other services offered from time to time by Hulu through a variety of Access Points.
The term âAccess Pointsâ refers to, collectively, the hulu.com website (the âHulu Siteâ), applications, and other places through which the Hulu Services may be accessed, including websites and applications of Huluâs third-party distribution partners and other websites where users or website operators are permitted to embed or have otherwise licensed the Video Player.
The information practices of third-party Access Points are governed by their own privacy policies and are not governed by this Privacy Policy.
accordingly, we recommend you review the privacy policies of these third parties.
Please also note that the Hulu Services may contain links to other sites owned or operated by other companies, including our advertisers, and Hulu does not notify you when you have chosen to click through to another website or property when using the Hulu Services.
We recommend that you review the privacy policies of such other websites or properties.

 By viewing any Content or otherwise using the Hulu Services, whether you are a subscriber, other registered user, or a visitor who has not subscribed to or registered for the Hulu Services, you consent to the collection and use of information from or about you as explained in this Privacy Policy.
If you do not consent to the collection and use of information from or about you in accordance with this Privacy Policy, then you may not use the Hulu Services.

 Please note that the website addresses (i.e., URLs) included within this Privacy Policy may not function as hyperlinks on all the Access Points.
To view this Privacy Policy with clickable hyperlinks, please visit the Hulu Site on your computer.

Information We Collect Hulu may collect the following information from or about you, including personal information, from the following sources:
 Information You Provide to Us.
We collect information you provide to us.
For instance, when you register to use the Hulu Services, we may collect identifiers and personal information including your name, email address, credit card or other payment method information, address, ZIP code, characteristics such as your age (birth date) and gender, and other information.
In addition, Hulu may collect similar information you provide to us when you respond to surveys or interactive ad units, contact Hulu through customer service or communicate with us by other means, or participate in promotions or events.
We may also collect information you provide as part of selecting your preferences, including within your account settings, and commercial information, such as the Hulu plan(s) you purchase.
Hulu allows multiple profiles to be set up under one account, so we may collect information you provide to us if you create a profile.

 Usage, Technical and Log Data.
We collect information when you use the Hulu Services or interact with Hulu, including when you view Hulu advertising outside of the Hulu Services.
We may collect information from and about the browser or device youâre using and information about your internet or other electronic network activity, including through analytics tools and the technologies described below (âData Collected Through Cookies and Similar Technologiesâ).
This information may include your IP address, device type, browser and software characteristics (such as type and operating system), geolocation data (which may include precise location data), referral URLs, network state, device identifiers or other unique identifiers such as advertising identifiers (e.g., âad-IDâ or âIDFAâ) and identifiers associated with browser cookies (see our description of âCookies and Local Storageâ below), and carrier information.
We also collect information about your activity on the Hulu Services including information about the content you view on Hulu such as series titles and episode names (âViewing Informationâ), page views, and ads you have viewed on Hulu.

 Data Collected Through Cookies and Similar Technologies.
Like many online services, we use various technologies to collect usage data and store preferences.
These technologies are discussed below.




Cookies and Local Storage. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computerâs hard disk.
We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with the Hulu Services or Hulu advertising published outside of the Hulu Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Hulu Services, and to customize Content and advertising.
These uses allow us to improve the Hulu Services.
We may create a unique device or user ID for you and store it in a cookie so we can customize your experience based on your preferences.

 We may collect information through other kinds of local storage (also referred to as âFlash cookiesâ) and HTML5 local storage, including in connection with features such as volume/mute settings for the Video Player.
Because these technologies are similar to browser cookies, they are sometimes called âbrowser cookies,â even though they may be stored in different parts of your computer.

 You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.
For information about disabling cookies or deleting information contained in Flash cookies, please click here.
Please note that disabling cookies or deleting information contained in cookies or Flash cookies may interfere with the performance and features of the Hulu Services, including not being able to store your preferences or login information.




Web Beacons, Pixels and mobile SDKs. In addition to cookies, we may use other technologies such as web beacons or pixel tags, which can be embedded in web pages, videos, or emails, to collect certain types of information from your browser or device, check whether you have viewed a particular web page, ad, or email message, and determine, among other things, the time and date on which you viewed the Content, the IP address of your computer, and the URL of the web page from which the Content was viewed.
We may also use or work with third parties including our business partners and service providers who use mobile Software Development Kits (âSDKsâ) to collect information, such as advertising identifiers (e.g., âad-IDâ or âIDFAâ) and information related to how mobile devices interact with the Hulu Services.
