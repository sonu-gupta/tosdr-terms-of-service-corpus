How We Disclose Information.


General Disclosure of Your Information.
We
will share your personally identifiable information with third parties only in
the ways that are described in this privacy policy.
We may disclose Your Information:

To any person who, in our reasonable judgment, is authorized to receive Your Information as your agent, including as a result of your business dealings with that person (for example, your attorney);
To our third-party vendors so that they may provide support for our internal and business operations, including for the handling of data processing, data verification, data storage, surveys, research, internal marketing, delivery of promotional, marketing and transaction materials, and our Services' maintenance and security.
These companies are authorized to Use Your Information only as necessary to provide these services to us and are contractually obligated to keep Your Information confidential;
To third parties when you use our Services to request a quote, services, or information from one or more of those third parties (e.g.
an insurance provider in connection with your completion of an insurance quote form, or a real estate agent when you request a house value) ("Requested Service Providers"), such as by clicking "get your quotes", "get value" or other similar buttons at the end of a form, and we may be compensated for such disclosure.
When we disclose Your Information to these third parties, which are listed here, Your Information will become subject to the information use and sharing practices of the third party, and the third party will not be restricted by this Privacy Policy with respect to its use and further sharing of Your Information;
To third parties when you engage in certain activities through our Services that are sponsored by them, such as purchasing products or services offered by a third party, electing to receive information or communications from a third party, or electing to participate in contests, sweepstakes, games or other programs sponsored, in whole or in part, by a third party.

To third parties that are interested in contacting you or providing offers to you that may be related to our Services or about products or services you may find of interest, and we may be compensated for such disclosure;
As required by law or ordered by a court, regulatory, or administrative agency;
As we deem necessary, in our sole discretion, if we believe that you are violating any applicable law, rule or regulation, or are otherwise interfering with another's rights or property, including, without limitation, our rights or property;
If requested by authorities in the event of any act of terrorism or instance of local, regional or national emergency;
To enforce our Terms of Use, this Privacy Policy, and any other applicable agreements and policies;

If you do not want Your Information shared as
described above, then you should not provide us with Your Information.


Requests for Quotes and Services from Requested
Service Providers.
As noted above, we may share Your Information
with Requested Service Providers when you use our Services to request a quote,
services or information from one or more third parties (a
"Request").Â IF YOU SUBMIT A REQUEST, REQUESTED SERVICE
PROVIDERS MAY CONTACT YOU DIRECTLY WITH QUOTES VIA MAIL, TELEPHONE, TEXT
MESSAGE, FAX, EMAIL AND OTHER MEANS OF COMMUNICATION.
YOU MAY RECEIVE
TELEMARKETING CALLS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF SUBMITTING A REQUEST THROUGH OUR
SERVICES, EVEN IF YOU ARE ON THE NATIONAL DO NOT CALL REGISTRY OR ANY OTHER DO
NOT CALL REGISTRY.

If you are matched with Requested Service Providers, you
expressly consent to the Requested Service Providers conducting any research
necessary to provide you with quotes for your Request.
Requested Service
Providers may need to share Your Information to conduct such research.
As an
example, if you request insurance quotes, consumer reports may be ordered in
connection with your insurance application.
Such reports may provide
information that may assist in determining eligibility for insurance and the
price you may be charged for insurance.
Consumer reports may also be used for
updates, renewal or extensions of this insurance.
In addition, insurance
companies may use third parties in connection with the development of an
"insurance score" for you.Â If you do not want Requested
Service Providers to conduct necessary research to provide you with a quote for
your Request, then you should not submit a Request.


Please note that if you submit a Request
through our Services and we share Your Information as described above in connection
with your Request, you will not have the opportunity to opt out of the
disclosure of Your Information in connection with that Request.


Aggregation and De-Personalization.
We
may take Your Information and de-identify it either by combining it with information
about other individuals (aggregating Your Information with information about
other individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that
make the information personally identifiable to you (de-identifying Your
Information).
We reserve the right to share, loan, rent, sell, or otherwise
disclose such information to third parties at any time, for any lawful purpose,
without notice or compensation to you.

share, loan, rent, sell or otherwise disclose the information that you submit

method of transmission or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, and we
cannot guarantee absolute security.

limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose Your Information to the government

of Use or any other applicable agreement or policy, you use our Services at
your own risk and we do not promise or guarantee, and you should not expect,

responsible for any damages directly or indirectly caused by an unauthorized
third party's ability to view, use or disseminate Your information.

consolidation, reorganization, spin-off, bankruptcy or other corporate change
involving us and/or our affiliates, even if the Business Transfer is only being
contemplated and regardless of whether the Business Transfer relates to a part
or a whole of our business.
Nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to
interfere with our ability to transfer all or part of our business, equity,
and/or assets (including our Services) to an affiliate or independent third
party at any time, for any lawful purpose, without compensation to you.
