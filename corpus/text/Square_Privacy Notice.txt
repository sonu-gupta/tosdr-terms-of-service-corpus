Privacy laws that apply in certain places, like California, treat âbusinessesâ and âservice providersâ differently.
Under those laws, a business is the company that decides why and how to process personal information.
A service provider processes personal information on behalf of a business in order to provide services.
When Square processes Your Customersâ Data, we generally act as your service provider.
In select cases, however, we may act as a business when we process Your Customersâ Data.
For example, we act as a business when we use Your Customersâ Data to send Your Customers digital receipts directly from Square, or when we allow you to use Customer Directory or Square Marketing to contact your buyer using a masked email address (for example, j*****@gmail.com) that gets routed to them via Square.
Your Customers can visit the Privacy Notice for Square Buyer Features for more information on how Square processes their data when it is acting as a business, and the Privacy Notice for non-account holders for more information on how Square processes their data as your service provider.

A âcookieâ is a text file that websites send to a visitorâs computer or other internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitorâs browser or to store information or settings in the browser.
A âweb beacon,â also known as an internet tag, pixel tag, or clear GIF, is a tiny graphic image that may be used in our websites or emails.

We use these services to target our ads to you and others based on your demographics, interests, and context.
These third party ad services track your online activities over time and across multiple websites by collecting your information through automated technologies, including third-party cookies, web server logs, and web beacons.
The ad services use this information to show you Square ads that may be tailored to your individual interests.
The information our ad services may collect on our behalf includes data about your visits to websites that serve Square ads, such as the pages or ads you view and the actions you take on those websites.

This program offers a mobile application called the âAppChoices,â which provides a centralized location where you can make choices about the use of your information for online behavioral advertising within the mobile environment.
The AppChoices application can be downloaded from your mobile device at www.aboutads.info/appchoices or from your deviceâs app store.

RIGHTS OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS 
Even though you use our services while acting as an employee, owner, director, officer, or contractor of a company, partnership, sole proprietor of a business, nonprofit, or government agency, if you live in California, California law gives you the right to ask if we disclose your personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes (we do not disclose your personal information for othersâ direct marketing purposes).
It also gives you the right to ask if we sell your personal information to third parties (we do not sell your personal information and have not done so in the past), and if we did (which we donât), youâd have the right to opt out of such sales.

We take reasonable measures, including administrative, technical, and physical safeguards, to protect your information from loss, theft, and misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
