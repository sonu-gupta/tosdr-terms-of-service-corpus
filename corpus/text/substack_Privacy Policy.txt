In case of electronic direct marketing you can opt out by following the instructions in the communication.


In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties, but only as described in this Privacy Policy.



How will Substack share the Personal Information it receives?

We may share your Personal Information with third parties as described below:



Affiliates: We may disclose your Personal Information to our subsidiaries and/or corporate affiliates for the purposes as described above.



Publishers: when you subscribe to a Publisherâs newsletter, we provide them the information necessary (including your name and email address) to provide you their newsletter(s). Please note that Publishers control their own newsletters.
accordingly, when you interact with a Publisherâs newsletter in a way that requires your personal information, including when commenting on a newsletter that you have not subscribed to, that personal information is provided directly to the Publisher.



Our Service Providers: We share your Personal Information with third party service providers that provide services on our behalf.
for example, we use Stripe (a third party payment provider) to receive and process your credit card transactions for us.
Such third parties further include, but are not limited to, providers of: website hosting.

email services.
security services.
content delivery networks.
customer support operations and software services.
traffic and usage analytics services.
and cloud storage and computing services.



Other users: If your user profile allows it, you may choose to populate certain user profile information, including, without limitation, your name, subscriptions, publications, location, and any image content.
Any user profile information uploaded may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the services (including when you post comments or upload images or videos through the services).
Your account privacy settings may allow you to limit the other users who can see the Personal Information in your user profile and/or what information in your user profile is visible to others.
Your username may also be displayed to other users if and when and other users can contact you through comments.



Prospective sellers or buyers: We may share and/or transfer customer information in connection with the sale or merger of our business or assets (subject to local laws).
Also, if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control. 



Government authorities and/or law enforcement officials: If required for the purposes as described in this Privacy Policy, if mandated by law or if required for the legal protection of our legitimate interests in compliance with applicable laws we may share Personal Information with competent regulatory, prosecuting, tax or governmental authorities, courts or other tribunals in any jurisdiction or markets, domestic or foreign. 


In certain cases, we may anonymize your Personal Information in such a way that you can no longer be identified as an individual, and we reserve the right to use and share such anonymized information to trusted partners not specified here.
However, we never disclose aggregated or de-identified information in a manner that could identify you as an individual.

Where will we send your Personal Information? 

Substack is established in the US and uses service providers established both in the US and in other countries to process Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.
As such, your Personal Information may be shared internationally.

Is Personal Information about you secure?

Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security.
You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.
We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but unfortunately, we cannot guarantee complete security.
Unauthorized entry or use, failure of the services, or other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time.

What are your rights?

Depending on applicable local laws, you may be entitled to ask Substack for a copy of your Personal Information, to correct it, erase or restrict its processing, or to ask us to transfer some of this information to other organizations.
You may also have rights to object to some processing activities or to request restriction of some processing activities.
Where we have asked for your consent to process your Personal Information, you may also have the right to withdraw this consent.
These rights may be limited in some situations or in accordance with applicable law â for example, we cannot delete your Personal Information when we can demonstrate that we have a legal obligation to retain it.
In some instances, this may mean that we are able to retain data even if you withdraw your consent or you delete your account. 
Where we require Personal Information to comply with legal or contractual obligations, then provision of such information is mandatory: if such information is not provided, then we will not be able to manage our contractual relationship, or to meet obligations placed on us.
In all other cases, provision of requested personal data is optional.
Please note we will always inform you where the provision of your Personal Information is mandatory or optional.
We hope that we can satisfy any queries you may have about the way we process your Personal Information.
If you have any concerns about how we process your Personal Information, or would like to opt out of marketing, you can get in touch at privacy@substackinc.com. 
If you are a California consumer, please see the section further below titled âAdditional Notices for California Residentsâ for more notices regarding your Personal Information.
