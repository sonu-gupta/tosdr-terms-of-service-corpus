15.9.7 ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY - IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT. This section 15.9.7 applies to Sophos, residents of the United States, and those who attempt to commence litigation within the United States.  (i) Federal Arbitration Act.
Licensee and Sophos agree that this License Agreement affects interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions.
This Clause 15.9.7 is intended to be interpreted broadly and governs any and all disputes between Licensee and Sophos including but not limited to claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory.
claims that arose before this License Agreement or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims related to advertising).
and claims that may arise after the termination of this License Agreement.
The only disputes excluded from this broad prohibition are the litigation of certain intellectual property and small court claims, as provided below. (ii) Initial Dispute Resolution.
Most disputes can be resolved without resort to arbitration.
Licensee and Sophos agree to use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation with each other, and good faith negotiations shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.
To commence this procedure, Licensee agrees to contact Sophosâ support department via our support portal at https://secure2.sophos.com/en-us/support/contact-support.aspx or The Legal Department, Sophos Limited, The Pentagon, Abingdon Science Park, Abingdon, OX14 3YP, United Kingdom with a copy to legalnotices@sophos.com, and provide a brief, written description of the dispute and Licenseeâs contact information (including information that could be used to identify Licenseeâs registered account if Licenseeâs dispute relates to an account).
Alternatively, Sophos may contact Licensee using the last available information it has for Licensee. (iii) Binding Arbitration.
If the Licensee and Sophos do not reach an agreed-upon solution within a period of sixty (60) days from the time informal dispute resolution is initiated under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision above, then either You or Sophos may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims (except as provided in (v) below) subject to the terms set forth below.
Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to this License Agreement (including, but not limited to, its formation, performance, and breach), the partiesâ relationship with each other, and/or Licenseeâs download of, access to, or use of the Licensed Products shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by JAMS in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Procedure Rules for claims that do not exceed $250,000 and the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures for claims exceeding $250,000, in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.  The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this License Agreement, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this License Agreement is void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, or the question of waiver by litigation conduct.
The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.
The arbitrator's award shall be written, and binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.  To start an arbitration, Licensee must do the following: (A) Write a Demand for Arbitration that includes a description of the claim and the amount of damages you seek to recover.
Licensee may find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com.
(B) Send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee, to JAMS, One Beacon Street Suite 2210 Boston, MA 02108-3106 USA.
and (C) Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to us at The Legal Department, Sophos Limited, The Pentagon, Abingdon Science Park, Abingdon, OX14 3YP, United Kingdom with a copy to legalnotices@sophos.com. To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, Sophos will pay the additional cost.
If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, Sophos will pay all of the actual filing and arbitrator fees for the arbitration.
Licensee is responsible for Licenseeâs own attorneys' fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise. The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.
They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court. If Licensee is a resident of the United States or commences litigation within the United States, arbitration may take place at any reasonable location within the United States convenient for you.
Residents of the United States, those who commence litigation within the United States, and Sophos further agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, U.S.A., in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. (iv) Class Action Waiver.
The parties further agree that the resolution of any disputes between the parties shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND SOPHOS AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provisions set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes. (v) Exception: Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims.
Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through initial dispute resolution or binding arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court or in the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office to protect its intellectual property rights (âintellectual property rightsâ means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights).
Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction.
For such disputes, Licensee and Sophos agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in the federal and state courts located in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, U.S.A.
Licensee further agrees to accept service of process by mail, and hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available.  (vi) 30-Day Right to Opt Out.
Licensee has the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to legalnotices@sophos.com with the subject line, âARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT.â The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of your first download of, access to, or use of the Product, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those paragraphs.
If you opt out of these arbitration provisions, Sophos also will not be bound by them. (vii) Changes to this Section.
Sophos will provide sixty (60) days' notice of any changes to this section.
Changes will become effective on the sixtieth (60th) day, and will apply prospectively only to any claims arising after the sixtieth (60th) day.
