Introduction

The Rothschild Foundation is a registered charity and a company limited by guarantee.
The work of the Foundation has two distinct remits: as an operating charity responsible for the care and management of Waddesdon Manor on behalf of the National Trust and undertaking more general philanthropic activity in support of the  arts and heritage, the environment, education and social welfare by awarding grants and convening, fostering dialogue and debate.
This privacy policy explains how we use any personal information we collect about you when you use this website, apply for grants, sign up for newsletters, apply for a job, or contact us by phone or email.
Please note that Waddesdon (including management of Waddesdon Manor, associated retail businesses, events and the Five Arrows Hotel) has a separate privacy for their website and system(s), which can be viewed on the Waddesdon website.

The UK General Data Protection Regulations (UK GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018

Rothschild Foundation and its subsidiary companies makes every effort to comply with the principles of the UK General Data Protection Regulations and the Data Protection Act 2018.

What information do we collect about you?

We collect information about you when you register with us, contact us or apply for a grant.
We also collect information when you voluntarily sign up for our newsletter, complete customer surveys, provide feedback, participate in competitions or apply for a job or volunteer role with us.
Website information is collected using cookies.

How will we use the information about you?

We collect information about you to process your application(s), manage your account, process your application(s) and, if you agree, to email you about other grants or services we think may be of interest to you.
We use the information collected from the website to improve the way we deliver information online.
The use of your information may involve sharing the information with employees, contractors, agents and professional advisors of Rothschild Foundation, fraud prevention agencies, and other carefully selected organisations.
Written agreement exists between Rothschild Foundation and such parties that there must be no further disclosure of such personal data or usage for direct marketing by those organisations unless you consent.

Personal data supplied by Grant applicants, and current or former grant recipients

We will only ask for as much information as we need to effectively consider a grant application, to manage an awarded grant if you are successful and to monitor its progress.
By submitting an application, you are agreeing to us processing your data for these purposes and in the ways outlined in this section.
To collect information, The Rothschild Foundation uses email and set grants forms (via an online portal, web form(s) or in Microsoft Word or PDF format) to capture and process personal data in line with our review and approval policies.&nbsp.
Grant applications are saved within our grants database (Blackbaud Grantmaking), which is compliant with UK GDPR.
The Blackbaud privacy policy can be viewed on the Blackbaud website.
You may also choose to sign up to our Email newsletter which is sent via MailChimp and is solely administered by Rothschild Foundation staff.
The MailChimp privacy policy can be found on the MailChimp website.
We will keep a record of applications to enable us to maintain records of your application history should you apply again, including assessment notes.
In addition to application data, we will retain all personal data related to the administration or operation of the grant, including (not limited to): applicant name, email address and phone number.
We may use third party or external assessors, advisors, consultants, judges or working group members to assist us with the grant application and management process, including evaluation and research activities.
Before data is shared with any party, we ensure a data processing agreement (Data Protection Impact Assessment or DPIA) is completed which confirms the standard of UK GDPR is in place.

Data about what we fund

The Rothschild Foundation publishes limited information (that contains no personal data) in its annual accounts which are submitted to Companies House and the Charity Commission.
We also publish grants data on the 360Giving website under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
To view a copy of this license, please visit the Creative Commons website.&nbsp.
Published information will include: the title and description of the funding, name of the recipient, date of the award, its duration and the amount awarded.
We will not publish address details of individuals who are awarded funding except where these are also the registered addresses of organisations we fund.
We may also include information on funding awarded in presentations about our work or as case studies (with permission) on our website.
There may be times we share information with a third party organisation, such as a charity or other funder who may contact us for a reference.
Most information will be organisational and not personal, but at times personal data (for example the names of senior staff) may be included.
This is a legitimate interest as it will improve funding to the sectors we offer grants too.
