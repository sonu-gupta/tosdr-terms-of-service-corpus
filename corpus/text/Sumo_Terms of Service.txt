Subscription, Free Trials, Billing and Cancellation
Subscription

Ongoing Subscription. Your Sumo subscription, which may start with a free trial, will continue month-to-month or year-to-year unless and until you cancel your subscription or we terminate it.
You must have Internet access and provide us with a current, valid, accepted method of payment (as such may be updated from time to time, "Payment Method") to use the Sumo subscription services.
We will bill the monthly or annnual subscription fee to your Payment Method.
You must cancel your subscription before it renews each month in order to avoid billing of the next month's subscription fees to your Payment Method.  
Differing Subscriptions. We may offer a number of subscription plans, including special promotional plans with differing conditions and limitations.
Any materially different terms from those described in these Terms of Use will be disclosed at your sign-up or in other communications made available to you.
You can find specific details regarding your subscription with Sumo by visiting your website and accessing Sumo Store within your Sumo install and clicking on the Billing tab.
We reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans.  

Free Trials

Your Sumo subscription may start with a free trial.
The free trial period of your membership lasts for 14 days, or as otherwise specified during sign-up.
For combinations with other offers, restrictions may apply.
Sumo reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to determine your free trial eligibility.  
We will begin billing your Payment Method for monthly subscription fees at the end of the free trial period of your subscription unless you cancel prior to the end of the free trial period.
To view the specific details of your subscription, including monthly subscription price and end date of your free trial period, visit your website and access Sumo Store within your Sumo install and click on the Billing tab.
We may authorize your Payment Method through various methods, including authorizing it up to approximately one month or year of service as soon as you register.  
You will not receive a notice from us that your free trial period has ended or that the paying portion of your subscription has begun.
CLICK THE "BILLING" TAB WITHIN SUMO STORE ON YOUR WEBSITE WHERE SUMO IS INSTALLED TO CANCEL ANY SUBSCRIPTIONS.
If you are unable to find them, contact us immediately at https://help.sumome.com/. We will continue to bill your Payment Method on a monthly or yearly basis for your subscription fee until you cancel  

Billing

Recurring Billing.
By starting your Sumo subscription and providing or designating a Payment Method, you authorize us to charge you a monthly or yearly subscription fee at the then current rate, and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the Sumo subscription service to your Payment Method.
You acknowledge that the amount billed each month or year may vary from month to month or year to year for reasons that may include differing amounts due to promotional offers, including VIP Code redemption and promotional code redemption, and/or changing or adding a plan, and you authorize us to charge your Payment Method for such varying amounts, which may be billed monthly or yearly in one or more charges.  
Price Changes. We reserve the right to adjust pricing for our service or any components thereof in any manner and at any time as we may determine in our sole and absolute discretion.
Except as otherwise expressly provided for in these Terms of Service, any price changes to your service will take effect following email notice to you.  
Billing Cycle. The subscription fee for our service will be billed at the beginning of the paying portion of your subscription and each month thereafter unless and until you cancel your subscription.
We automatically bill your Payment Method each month or year on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your paying subscription.
Subscription fees are fully earned upon payment.
We reserve the right to change the timing of our billing, in particular, as indicated below, if your Payment Method has not successfully settled.
In the event your paying subscription began on a day not contained in a given month, we may bill your Payment Method on a day in the applicable month or such other day as we deem appropriate.
For example, if you started your Sumo subscription or began paying on January 31st, your next payment date is likely to be February 28th, and your Payment Method would be billed on that date.
Your renewal date may change due to changes in your Subscription.
Visit your website and access Sumo Store within your Sumo install and click on the Billing tab to see the commencement date for your next renewal period.
We may authorize your Payment Method in anticipation of membership or service-related charges.
As used in these Terms of Service, "billing" shall indicate a charge, debit or other payment clearance, as applicable, against your Payment Method.
Unless otherwise stated differently, month, monthly, yearly, and annually refers to your billing cycle.  
30-day Money Back Guarantee Refunds will be provided up to 30 days after the original purchase if Sumo does not meet expectations.
Clients who purchase via Shopify will be subject to Shopifyâs refund policies and will be reimbursed with Shopify store credits.
More information can be found on Shopifyâs Terms of Service page.
Following any cancellation, however, you will continue to have access to the service through the end of your current billing period.
At any time, and for any reason, we may provide a refund, discount, or other consideration to some or all of our members.
The amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole and absolute discretion.  
Payment Methods. You may edit your Payment Method information by visiting your website and accessing Sumo Store within your Sumo install and clicking on the Payments tab.
If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not edit your Payment Method information or cancel your account (see, "Cancellation" below), you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts and authorize us to continue billing the Payment Method, as it may be updated.
This may result in a change to your payment billing dates.
For certain Payment Methods, the issuer of your Payment Method may charge you a foreign transaction fee or other charges.
Check with your Payment Method service provider for details.  
Cancellation. You may cancel your Sumo membership at any time, and you will continue to have access to the Sumo subscription service through the end of your monthly or yearly billing period.
WE DO NOT PROVIDE REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR ANY PARTIAL-MONTH MEMBERSHIP PERIODS.
To cancel, visit your website and access Sumo Store within your Sumo install and click on the Billing tab.
