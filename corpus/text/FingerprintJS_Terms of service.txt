These Terms of Service, as amended from time to time (âTermsâ), are entered into by and between FingerprintJS, Inc., a Delaware corporation (âFingerprintJSâ), and the customer identified during Onboarding (âCustomerâ).

Customer grants FingerprintJS a non-exclusive, non-transferable (except in compliance with Section 13.i) right and license to: (i) use, copy, store, transmit, display, modify and create derivative works of Visitor Data as necessary to provide the Service to Customer under this Agreement and as otherwise described in the Privacy policy.

Data Processing.
To the extent FingerprintJS processes any Personal Information contained in the Visitor Data, FingerprintJS will process such Personal Information solely under the instruction of and on behalf of Customer.
If Customer is established in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland, or if any Personal Information contained in the Visitor Data otherwise falls within the scope of the European Data Privacy Legislation, FingerprintJS will process any such Personal Information in accordance with FingerprintJSâs GDPR data processing addendum, which will be incorporated by reference into this Agreement and can be accessed at https://dev.fingerprintjs.com/docs/dpa-gdpr (as modified from time to time).
If Customer is subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act and its implementing regulations (âCCPAâ) and the Personal Information includes Personal Information of California residents, FingerprintJS will process any such Personal Information in accordance with FingerprintJSâs CCPA data processing addendum, which will be incorporated by reference into this Agreement and can be accessed at https://dev.fingerprintjs.com/docs/dpa-ccpa (as modified from time to time).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the parties agree in writing to use a different data processing addendum, such data processing addendum will apply in lieu of either of the foregoing data processing addenda.


Usage Data.
FingerprintJS may collect Usage Data and use it to operate, improve and support the Service and for other lawful business practices, such as analytics, benchmarking and reports.
However, FingerprintJS will not disclose Usage Data to third parties, including in benchmarks or reports, unless it has been (a) de-identified so that it does not individually identify Customer, its Users or any other person and (b) aggregated with usage data across other FingerprintJS customers.
Security.
FingerprintJS uses reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to protect the Service and Visitor Data.




Customer Obligations.
Customer (a) is solely responsible for its Visitor Data (including its content) and compliance with all Applicable Laws in its use of the Service and (b) represents and warrants that it has made all necessary disclosures and obtained all necessary consents required for its submission of data and granting of rights to FingerprintJS under this Agreement without violating or infringing any third-party intellectual property or privacy rights or Customer or third-party terms of service or privacy policies.

Commercial Terms.

Types of Plans.
As described on the FingerprintJS pricing page (located at https://fingerprintjs.com/pricing/) (the âPricing Pageâ), two tiers of the Service are made available by FingerprintJS: (a) a free tier (âFree Planâ) and (b) a paid tier (âPaid Planâ).
Except as otherwise expressly noted, both the Free Plan and Paid Plan are subject to the terms of this Agreement.
Fees and Taxes.
Fees are as described on the Pricing Page.
All fees and expenses are non-refundable except as set out in Section 10.i (FingerprintJS Indemnity).
Customer is responsible for any sales, use, GST, value-added, withholding or similar taxes or levies that apply to any amounts payable by Customer hereunder, whether domestic or foreign (âTaxesâ), other than FingerprintJSâs income tax.
Fees and expenses are exclusive of Taxes.

Payment.
Billing.
Customer must provide FingerprintJS with a current, valid accepted method of payment (as it may be updated from time to time, âPayment Methodâ) in order to purchase and use a Paid Plan.
FingerprintJS uses a third party payment processor (currently Stripe, Inc.
(âStripeâ)) to process payments using the provided Payment Method.
By starting a Paid Plan and providing or designating a Payment Method, Customer agrees to be bound by Stripeâs Services Agreement available at https://stripe.com/us/legal and further authorizes FingerprintJS to charge Customer any applicable fees at the then current rate, and any other charges Customer may incur in connection with Customerâs use of the Service, to Customerâs Payment Method.
Customer acknowledges that the amount billed each period may vary for reasons that may include the particular number of Unique Browser Instances during such period, different plan options or services, promotional offers, and/or changing a plan, and Customer authorizes FingerprintJS to charge Customerâs Payment Method for such varying amounts, which may be billed in one or more charges.
Fees for the Service may be billed at the beginning of the applicable billing cycle or at a later period, depending on the specific details of the Customerâs Paid Plan (as described on the Pricing Page).
After Customerâs initial billing cycle, and again after any subsequent billing cycle, Customerâs subscription will automatically commence on the first day following the end of such period (each a âRenewal Commencement Dateâ) and continue for an additional equivalent period, at FingerprintJSâs then-current price for such subscription.
Customer agrees that its Payment Method will be subject to this automatic renewal feature unless Customer cancels its subscription at least thirty (30) days prior to the Renewal Commencement Date.
By subscribing, Customer authorizes FingerprintJS to charge Customerâs Payment Method for the initial billing cycle and any subsequent billing cycle.
Customer reserves the right to change the timing of its billing as indicated in this Section 5.iii.
FingerprintJS may authorize your Payment Method in anticipation of subscription or other charges.
Fee Changes.
FingerprintJS, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the fees for the Service.
Any fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current billing cycle.
FingerprintJS will provide Customer with reasonable prior notice of any change in fees.
Customerâs continued use of Service after a fee change comes into effect constitutes Customerâs agreement to pay the modified fee amount.
Suspension of Service.
FingerprintJS may suspend Customerâs access to the Service if (a) Customer breaches Section 1.ii (Restrictions) or Section 4 (Customer Obligations), (b) if Customerâs account is 30 days or more overdue or (c) if Customerâs actions risk harm to other customers or the security, availability or integrity of the Service.
Where practicable, FingerprintJS will use reasonable efforts to provide Customer with prior notice of the suspension.
Once Customer resolves the issue requiring suspension, FingerprintJS will promptly restore Customerâs access to the Service in accordance with this Agreement.

Indemnification.

FingerprintJS Indemnity.
FingerprintJS will defend Customer from and against any third-party claim to the extent alleging that the Service, when used as authorized by Customer, infringes a third-partyâs U.S.
patent, copyright or trademark, and will indemnify Customer against any damages or costs awarded against Customer (including reasonable attorneysâ fees) or agreed in settlement by FingerprintJS resulting from the claim.
In response to an actual or potential infringement claim, if required by settlement or injunction or as FingerprintJS determines necessary to avoid material liability, FingerprintJS may at its option: (a) procure rights for Customerâs continued use of the Service, (b) replace or modify the alleged infringing portion of the Service to avoid infringement without reducing the Serviceâs overall functionality or (c) terminate Customerâs access to the infringing portion of the Service and refund to Customer any pre-paid, unused fees for the terminated portion of the applicable Subscription Term.
FingerprintJSâs obligations in this Section 10 do not apply (i) to infringement resulting from Customerâs modification of the Agent or use of the Service in combination with items not provided by FingerprintJS, (ii) to infringement resulting from use of a non-supported version of the Agent, (iii) to unauthorized use of the Service, or (iv) if Customer settles or makes any admissions about a claim without FingerprintJSâs prior written consent.

Customer Indemnity.
At FingerprintJSâs request, Customer will defend FingerprintJS and its affiliates from and against any third-party claim based upon or arising from Visitor Data or FingerprintJSâs collection, storage, or processing thereof in compliance with this Agreement, and, regardless of whether FingerprintJS requests Customer to defend against such a claim, will indemnify FingerprintJS and its affiliates against any damages or costs awarded against FingerprintJS or its affiliates (including reasonable attorneysâ fees) or agreed in settlement by Customer resulting from the claim.
Indemnity Procedures.
The party seeking defense and indemnification hereunder (the âIndemnified Partyâ) must provide the party from whom indemnification is sought (the âIndemnifying Partyâ): (a) prompt written notice of any claim for which indemnification is sought (provided that a failure to provide such notice will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Section 10 except to the extent material prejudice results from such failure).
(b) all reasonable cooperation, at the Indemnifying Partyâs request and expense, in the defense and settlement of the claim.
and (c) sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim (provided that (i) where Customer is the Indemnifying Party, such control only accrues to the extent FingerprintJS requests Customerâs defense of the claim and (ii) the Indemnifying Party may not agree to any settlement that places any obligation on the Indemnified Party without the Indemnified Partyâs written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed).
