Arbitration Requirement and Waiver of Class Actions. You and Travel Agent agree that any and all Claims, which are not resolved through Travel Agentâs Customer Service Department, shall be exclusively resolved through binding arbitration, except as otherwise expressly provided below.
Arbitration shall be resolved by one arbitrator.

The arbitrator's award on the Claim(s) shall be final and binding.
however, a court of competent jurisdiction may enter judgment on the arbitratorâs award.
You and Travel Agent agree to conduct the arbitration before the American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ) under its rules, which can be found at www.adr.org.
Arbitration shall be commenced by submitting a Demand for Arbitration to the AAA.
The arbitration may be conducted by telephone, videoconference, written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another location mutually agreeable to the parties.
AAA rules shall determine payment of arbitration fees, provided that if the value of the relief you seek through your Claim(s) is collectively less than $7,500, Travel Agent will pay the initial arbitration filing fees above $250 associated with the arbitration at your written request.
Any request for payment of fees must be submitted by mail to the AAA with the Demand for Arbitration.
If the arbitrator, in its sole reasonable discretion, determines that any Claim you asserted was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, you shall reimburse Travel Agent within 7 days for any and all fees paid for you by Travel Agent.

THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PARTY'S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT PRESIDE OVER ANY CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION.
THE ARBITRATOR SHALL ONLY AWARD RELIEF IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF REQUIRED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS.
THIS WAIVER IS A MATERIAL PROVISION OF THIS CONTRACT.
IF THIS WAIVER IS LIMITED OR VOIDED, THE CONTRACT TO ARBITRATE SHALL BE NULL AND VOID, SUBJECT TO THE RIGHT TO APPEAL THE LIMITATION OF THE WAIVER.
Nothing in this arbitration provision will limit either partyâs ability to seek injunctive relief in aid of arbitration in a court of competent jurisdiction or to seek to compel arbitration.

Small Claims Actions. As the limited exception to the above arbitration requirement, you may assert a Claim(s) against Travel Agent in small claims court, but only on an individual basis if the Claim(s) collectively seek $7,500 or less.

If you are making a booking from outside of the United States on a United States credit or debit card, your bank may convert the payment amount, both for the room and the membership fee charged by Travel Agent, to your local currency and charge you a conversion fee.
This means that the amount listed on your credit or bank card statement may be in your local currency and therefore may be a different figure than the figure shown on the billing summary page for the reservation booked through Travel Agent.
In addition, a foreign transaction fee may be assessed if the bank that issued your credit or debit card is located outside of the United States.
Booking international travel may be considered to be an international transaction by the bank or card company, since we may pass on your payment to an international travel supplier.
If you have any questions about these fees or the exchange rate applied to your booking, please contact your bank.
If there are signs of fraud, abuse, or suspicious activity, Travel Agent may cancel any bookings associated with your name and retain any Service Fees.
