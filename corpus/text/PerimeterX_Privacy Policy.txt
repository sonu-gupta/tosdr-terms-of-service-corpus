Information from Other Sources. We may receive information about you from other sources, including through Third-Party services and organizations.
For example, through use of the Service, entities that access and use the Services (each a âCustomerâ) enable us to collect from their websites, applications or other digital properties that use our Service (each a âCustomer Propertyâ) information of the users of a Customer Property (each an âEnd Userâ), including the End Userâs Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, the web page that an End User was visiting before accessing the Customer Property, the pages or features of the Customer Property to which an End User browsed and the access date and time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on the Customer Property that an End User clicked on, other user engagement and interaction metrics and other statistics, and information about an End Userâs mobile device, operating system, browser and device identifier (âEnd User Dataâ).

Please note that we do not respond to or honor DNT signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers.
6.6 Cookies and Interest-Based Advertising
As noted above, you may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or remove them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences.
Please note that cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on mobile applications.
However, on many mobile devices, application users may opt-out of certain mobile ads via their device settings.
The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt-out of receiving targeted ads from our data partners and our other advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs.

Please include your full name, email address associated with your account, and a detailed description of your data request.
Such requests will be processed in line with local laws.
Although PerimeterX makes good faith efforts to provide Individuals with access to their Personal Information, there may be circumstances in which PerimeterX is unable to provide access, including but not limited to: where the information contains legal privilege, would compromise othersâ privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the Individualâs privacy in the case in question or where it is commercially proprietary.
If PerimeterX determines that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further inquiries.
To protect your privacy, PerimeterX will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your Personal Information.
