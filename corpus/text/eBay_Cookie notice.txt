Information regarding the technologies we use When you use our Services, we and authorized third-party providers make use of cookies and similar technologies.
We make use of cookies and similar technologies which will not be saved on your device or which will only be saved on your device for as long as your browser is active (e.g.
session cookies).
Furthermore, we make use of cookies and similar technologies which will be saved on your device for a longer period (e.g.

 Learn more 1.1 What are cookies, web beacons and similar technologies 
1.1.1 Cookies

Cookies are small text files (typically made up of letters and numbers) which are placed in the memory of your browser or device when you make use of our Services, in particular when you visit our website or when you open a message.
Cookies allow for a recognition of a specific device or browser.
There are different types of cookies:

Session cookies (also called session based cookies) expire at the end of your session (e.g.
when closing your browser window) and enable the entity using them to track your activities during this one session
Persistent cookies remain stored on your device between sessions and enable us, for example, to track your settings or activities on several websites
First-party cookies are set by the provider whose online service you are using (e.g.
the operator of the website you are visiting)
Third-party cookies are set by a provider other than the provider whose online service you are using (e.g.
the operator of a website other than the one you are visiting)


1.1.2 Web beacons

Web beacons (also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs) are small graphic images that are used in connection with the provision of our services and which typically work in conjunction with cookies to track the use of an online service by its users.
For example, when we send you emails, web beacons allow us to track if you opened the emails and clicked links to measure campaign performance and improve features.

1.1.3 Similar technologies

Similar technologies are technologies which enable the entity using it to track your user behavior.
This can be done by local shared objects or local storage, such as flash cookies, HTML 5 cookies and other web application software methods, all of which store information in your browser or device.
Additionally, there are other technologies that function without local storage in your end device and instead make use of, inter alia, browser functions.
In this context, a "fingerprint" of your system is created that serves as a unique identifier.
These technologies may function across all your browsers and in some cases are not fully managed by your browser, but may need to be managed directly from your installed applications or your device.
We sometimes use the terms cookies and similar technologies interchangeably. 1.2 Why do we use these technologies Some of our Services can only be offered using cookies, web beacons and similar technologies.
In general, these technologies enable us to track your user behavior and identify you - even across devices.
You can find more information about the personal data that we collect using cookies and similar technologies in our User Privacy Notice.
The cookies, web beacons and similar technologies used in connection with our Services serve the following functions:

1.2.1 Technologies which are operationally necessary

We use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies that are necessary for the operation of our Services.
This includes technologies that allow you access to our sites, services, applications and tools, which are required to monitor the functioning of the site, prevent fraudulent activity and improve security, or that allow you to make use of our functions such as shopping carts, saved search, or similar functions.

1.2.2 Technologies which are performance-related

We use cookies, web beacons or other similar technologies to assess the performance of our Services.
This happens, inter alia, to analyze how visitors use our services, how users use our messaging tools, if and how items and links are viewed or how to improve our services.

1.2.3 Technologies which are functionality-related

We use cookies, web beacons or other similar technologies that allow us to offer you enhanced functionality when accessing or using our Services.
These technologies may, inter alia, identify you when you sign in to our Services or they may store your settings or the items viewed, so that we can enhance the presentation of content within our Services and facilitate it (e.g.
by means of the 'stay logged in function').

1.2.4 Technologies which are advertising- or targeting-related

We use cookies, web beacons or other similar technologies to deliver content tailored to your interests, including advertisements, in connection with the provision of our Services or within third-party online services (retargeting, remarketing).
This includes using technologies to determine how relevant the advertisements and contents are for you, which ads have already been shown to you, how often they have been shown, when and where they have been shown and if you have reacted by carrying out an activity â such as clicking on an ad or purchasing an item.
For this purpose, data will be combined with data already collected regarding your interests.
Inter alia, we collect data regarding your device (e.g.
the operating system and its version) to provide a uniform service on all your devices.
You can find further information on personal data that we collect by the means of cookies and similar technologies in our User Privacy Notice. 1.3 Which service providers do we cooperate with? In regard to the usage of cookies, web beacons and similar technologies, we cooperate with authorized service providers.
This includes, inter alia, ad networks and ad exchanges, which enable us to show you advertisements.
Authorized service providers are entitled to place web beacons and similar technologies within our online services and to place cookies on your device, as far as this is permissible according to applicable law.
In this context, data for the identification of your device will be tracked, for example the IP address, the device ID or the advertising ID (IDFA - ID for Advertising or Google Advertising ID).
This enables the service providers to help us deliver content and more relevant advertisements, and to produce anonymous metrics and analytics, including conversion statistics.
The processing of personal data by external service providers is subject to data protection and confidentiality agreements with us and applicable data protection laws.
With regard to data processing by service providers, please check the privacy notices of the respective third-party providers.
Service providers that we cooperate with include Facebook and Google:


Facebook: Provision of advertising services via Facebook's advertising and marketing platforms, e.g.
Website Custom Audiences (Facebook's Data Policy - opens in new window or tab)

Google: Provision of advertising services via Google's advertising and marketing platforms, e.g.
Google Ads, Google Marketing Platform, Google Ad Manager (Google's Privacy Policy - opens in new window or tab)

With the exception of the use of such technologies by our service providers or other authorized third parties, we do not permit any third-party content on sites (such as item listings, communication between users, classified listings, comments, reviews, etc.) to include or utilize any cookies, web beacons, local storage, or similar technologies for tracking purposes or to collect your personal data for the own purposes of such third parties.
If you suspect that an offer or third-party content within our Services collects personal data or may use tracking technologies, please report this to spam@ebay.com.
Users in the European Economic Area (EEA) can find information on other service providers and their privacy notices within the advertising preferences - opens in new window or tab. 1.4 Google Analytics We use Google Analytics, an analysis tool of Google LLC and Google Ireland Ltd.
("Google") to continuously improve our Services.
The use includes the Universal Analytics operating mode.
This makes it possible to assign data, sessions and interactions across multiple devices to a pseudonymous user ID and thus analyze a user's activities across multiple devices.
Google Analytics uses cookies that are stored on your device and that enable us to analyze your use of our Services.
The data collected by the cookies regarding the use of our Services (including your IP address) are usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there (see additional information for users in the European Economic Area below in this section).
On our behalf, Google processes this data to evaluate the use of our Services, to compile reports on usage activities and to provide us with further services associated with the use of our Services.
Your IP address transmitted in the context of Google Analytics will not be combined with other data from Google.
The data collected via Google Analytics is automatically deleted after 14 months.
Data whose retention period has been reached is automatically deleted once a month.
You can prevent the collection of data through the Google Analytics cookie by adjusting your browser settings accordingly.
If you deactivate cookies, you may not be able to use all functions of our Services to their full extent, however.
In addition, you can prevent the collection of data related to your use of the Services (including your IP address) via the Google Analytics cookie and the processing of this data by Google by installing the following browser plugin - opens in new window or tab.
Further information about Google Analytics can be found in the terms of use - opens in new window or tab and in the privacy policy - opens in new window or tab of Google.

Additional information for users in the European Economic Area (EEA):

We would like to point out that on our website Google Analytics has been extended by the code "gat._anonymizeIp();" in order to guarantee an anonymized collection of IP addresses (so-called IP masking).
This means that, before your IP address is transmitted to Google's servers in the USA, it is sent to a Google server in the EU (or in another member state of the EEA), where it is shortened so that it cannot be traced to a specific person.
Only after the IP address has been made anonymous is the shortened IP address sent to a Google server in the USA and stored there.
If personal data is transferred to the USA, this happens on the basis of the adequacy decision of the European Commission under the EU-US Privacy Shield.
You can download the certificate here - opens in new window or tab. 1.5 Google Signals We also use Google Signals in connection with the provision of our Services.
This is an extension function of Google Analytics that enables cross-device tracking.
This means that if your Internet-enabled devices are linked to your Google Account, Google can generate reports on usage patterns (especially cross-device traffic) even if you switch devices.
If you have activated the setting "personalized ads" in your Google account, Google will process data for this purpose.
We do not process personal data in this respect, we only receive statistics based on Google Signals.
You can deactivate the use of Google Signals at any time by downloading and installing the browser plugin in order to opt-out of Google Analytics (see above under Google Analytics).
This will prevent the collection of data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the Services (including your IP address) and the processing of this data by Google.
In addition, you can disable the "personalized advertising" setting in your Google Account.
Details can be found here - opens in new window or tab.

Users in the European Economic Area (EEA):

You can determine via the advertising preferences - opens in new window or tab ("Google Advertising") whether you consent to the use of Google Signals.
We only use Google Signals with your consent. 1.6 Google reCAPTCHA: Prevention of automated access We make use of Google reCAPTCHA ("reCAPTCHA") within the provision of our Services.
reCAPTCHA is used to check and prevent interactions through automated access, for example through so-called bots (computer programs that perform tasks automatically and independently).
reCAPTCHA is used in particular to check whether data input in connection with our Services (e.g.
in a contact form) is carried out by a human or by an automated program.
For this purpose, reCAPTCHA analyzes the behavior of the user on the basis of various characteristics.
This analysis automatically begins as soon as the user connects with the online service, e.g.
visits the website.
For the purposes of this analysis, reCAPTCHA evaluates various pieces of information (e.g.
IP address, duration of the user's visit to the online service or the user's mouse movements).
The data collected during the analysis is forwarded to Google.
The analyses by reCAPTCHA are carried out entirely in the background.
Please find details regarding Google reCAPTCHA here - opens in new window or tab and in Google's Privacy Notice - opens in new window or tab. 1.7 Which security measures do we take to protect your data? We protect our cookies and similar technologies to ensure that only we or authorized service providers can evaluate them.
For this purpose, we assign a unique identifier (ID) to them that is designed so that only we can process them. 2.
