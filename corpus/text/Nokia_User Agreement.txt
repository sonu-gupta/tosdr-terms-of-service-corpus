Be kind â everyone has a right to give an opinion and should feel free to express it.
Treat each other with respect.

No spam. We consider any irrelevant or advertising-related post as spam.

Use meaningful headlines. Give your topic meaningful headlines so that other members can understand what it is about.



Give the search bar a try. Before opening a new discussion on a topic, use the search bar to see if it has already been covered.
This will help avoid having multiple threads for the same topic and keeps the community clean and tidy.



Do not post in all uppercase letters. It will be considered as shouting and rude and will therefor get deleted.



Post your topic in the right section. For example, questions concerning Nokia 6 should go to the Nokia 6 section and not in the Nokia 5 section.
