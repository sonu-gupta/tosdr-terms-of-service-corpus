 Processing Personal Data 
Relationship of the Parties.
With respect to the Personal Data Processed under the Agreement, Customer is the âControllerâ and Osano is the âProcessorâ, as such terms are defined under the General Data Protection Regulation((EU) 2016/679)(âGDPRâ) and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 (âUK GDPRâ), and any replacements, additions, successors, implementing requirements or legislation or amendments thereto.
In some circumstances, Customer may be a Processor, in which case Customer appoints Osano as Customerâs Subprocessor, which shall not change the obligations of either party under this DPA.
Customerâs Processing of Personal Data.
âPersonal Dataâ and âProcessingâ will have the same meaning as set forth in the GDPR.
Customer shall, in the use of the Services (which are defined in the Agreement), Process Personal Data in accordance with the requirements of all applicable data protection laws.
To the extent Customer acquires Personal Data, Customer shall have sole responsibility for the legality of Personal Data and the means by which Customer acquired Personal Data.
Osanoâs Processing of Personal Data.
As Customerâs Processor, Osano shall Process any Personal Data in accordance with applicable data protection laws for the following purposes:

Processing in accordance with the Agreement;
Processing initiated by Authorized Users in their use of the Services according to the Agreement; 
Processing to comply with other reasonable instructions provided by Customer;

Osano will promptly notify the Customer in writing if, in its opinion, the Customer's instructions do not comply with all applicable data protection laws.
Osano will ensure that all of its employees:

are informed of the confidential nature of the Personal Data and are bound by confidentiality obligations and use restrictions in respect of the Personal Data;
have undertaken training on applicable data protection laws relating to handling Personal Data and how it applies to their particular duties.
and
are aware both of Osanoâs duties and their personal duties and obligations under applicable data protection laws and this DPA.

 Subprocessing 
Customer acknowledges and agrees that Osano may retain certain Subprocessors to Process Personal Data on Osanoâs behalf in order to provide Services under the Agreement.&nbsp.
Osanoâs Subprocessors are identified in Osano's GDPR statement.
Prior to a Subprocessorâs Processing of Personal Data, Osano will require contractual obligations of the Subprocessor that are substantially the same as those imposed on Osano under this DPA, including in relation to appropriate technical and organizational data security measures. 
Osano remains liable for its Subprocessorsâ performance under this DPA to the same extent Osano is liable for its own performance. 
Other than those Subprocessors listed above, Osano may only authorize any additional Subprocessors to Process Personal Data on its behalf after notifying Customer in advance in writing of its intention to utilize such Subprocessor.
Customer may object to Osanoâs use of a new Subprocessor by notifying Osano promptly in writing within 14 days of receipt of written notice.
After receiving an objection to the use of a new Subprocessor, Osano will work with Customer to determine the appropriate course of action.
Should Osano not be able to provide a viable solution to alleviate Customerâs concerns within 14 days, Customer may terminate the Agreement without further liability and will be refunded any pre-paid unused fees.
 Security 
Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of Processing, as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, Osano shall in relation to Personal Data implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including, as appropriate, the measures referred to in Article 32(1) of the GDPR, including as appropriate:

the pseudonymisation and encryption of Personal Data;
the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services;
the ability to restore the availability and access to Personal Data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident.
and
a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of the security measures.

In assessing the appropriate level of security, Osano shall consider the risks that are presented by Processing, in particular from a Personal Data Breach.
âPersonal Data Breachâ will have the same meaning as set forth in the GDPR.
Osano shall notify Customer without undue delay, but in no event longer than 72 hours, upon becoming aware of:

the loss, unintended destruction or damage, corruption, or unusability of part or all of the Personal Data.
any accidental, unauthorised or unlawful processing of the Personal Data.
or
a Personal Data Breach or suspected Personal Data Breach affecting Customer Personal Data.

Where Osano becomes aware of Clause 3 (a), Clause 3 (b) and/or Clause 3 (c) above, it shall, without undue delay, also provide the Customer with the following information:

description of the nature of Clause 3 (a), Clause 3 (b) and/or Clause 3 (c), including the categories of in-scope Personal Data and approximate number of both Data Subjects and the Personal Data records concerned;
the likely consequences.
and
a description of the measures taken or proposed to be taken to address Clause 3 (a), Clause 3 (b) and/or Clause 3 (c), including measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects.

Immediately following any accidental, unauthorised or unlawful Personal Data processing or Personal Data Breach, Osano will investigate the matter.
Further, Osano will reasonably co-operate with the Customer including but not limited to:

assisting with any investigation;
making available all relevant records, logs, files, data reporting and other materials required to comply with all data protection legislation or as otherwise reasonably requested by the Customer;
restoring such Personal Data at its own expense as soon as possible.
and
taking reasonable and prompt steps to mitigate the effects and to minimize any damage resulting from the Personal Data Breach or accidental, unauthorised or unlawful Personal Data processing.

Osano will not inform any third party of any accidental, unauthorised or unlawful processing of all or part of the Personal Data and/or a Personal Data Breach without first obtaining the Customer's prior written consent, except when required to do so by law.
Osano agrees that the Customer has the sole right to determine whether to provide notice of the accidental, unauthorised or unlawful processing and/or the Personal Data Breach to any Data Subjects, the relevant Supervisory Authority, other in-scope regulators, law enforcement agencies or others, as required by law or regulation or in the Customer's discretion, including the contents and delivery method of the notice.
âSupervisory Authorityâ will have the same meaning as set forth in the GDPR.
 Rights of Data Subjects 
âData Subjectâ will have the same meaning as set forth in the GDPR.
Taking into account the nature of the Processing, Osano shall assist Customer by implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as possible, for the fulfillment of Customerâs obligations, to enable Customer to respond to requests to exercise Data Subject rights under applicable data protection laws, including subject access rights, the rights to rectify, port and erase personal data, object to the processing and automated processing of personal data, and restrict the processing of personal data and to comply with information or assessment notices served on the Customer by the relevant Supervisory Authority under data protection legislation. 
Osano shall:

Promptly notify Customer if it receives a request from a Data Subject under any applicable data protection laws in respect of Customer Personal Data and/or any complaint, notice or communication that relates directly or indirectly to the processing of the Personal Data or to either party's compliance with data protection legislation.
and
Ensure that it does not respond to any request from a Data Subject except on documented instructions of Customer or as required by applicable data protection laws to which Osano is subject, in which case, Osano shall, to the extent permitted by applicable data protection laws, inform Customer of that legal requirement before responding to the request.


 Retention and Deletion of Customer Personal Data 
Osano retains the minimum amount of Personal Data in order to provide its Services.  
Personal Data collected through Customerâs use of Osanoâs Consent Management feature is de-identified encrypted and stored in order to allow the Customer to have a record of the consent choices made by individuals.&nbsp.
Personal Data collected through the Data Subject Access Request feature is also encrypted and assigned a unique identifier to record the processing of the request.  
The retention period of Personal Data depends on which Osano feature was used in the processing activity.&nbsp.
For Osanoâs Consent Management and Data Subject Access Request features, the information is stored for the length of the Agreement as compliance records and for Osanoâs Data Discovery feature, the information is retained for seven (7) calendar days and then automatically deleted (the Customer may also manually delete the data within the Service at any time).  
Upon termination of the Services for which Osano is Processing Personal Data, Osano shall, upon Customerâs written request and subject to the limitations in the Agreement and unless prevented by applicable data protection laws, securely destroy any Customer Personal Data that has not already been deleted.
If any law, regulation, or government or regulatory body requires Osano to retain any documents or materials or Personal Data that Osano would otherwise be required to return or destroy, it will notify the Customer in writing of that retention requirement, giving details of the documents, materials or Personal Data that it must retain, the legal basis for retention, and establishing a specific timeline for deletion or destruction once the retention requirement ends. 
 Data Protection Impact Assessment 
Upon Customerâs reasonable request, Osano shall provide Customer with commercially reasonable cooperation and assistance needed to fulfil Customerâs obligation under the GDPR to carry out a data protection impact assessment related to Customerâs use of the Services, to the extent Customer does not otherwise have access to the relevant information, and to the extent such information is available to Osano. 
Osano shall provide commercially reasonable assistance to Customer in the cooperation or prior consultation with the Supervisory Authority to the extent required under the GDPR or other applicable data protection laws.
 Audit Rights 
Osano will permit the Customer or a representative to audit Osanoâs compliance with this DPA, on at least seven days' prior written notice.
Osano will give the Customer all necessary assistance to conduct such audits.
If such an audit occurs, Customer shall bare all of its own costs of conducting the audit or those of its representative.
The assistance may include, but is not limited to:

remote electronic access to, and copies of the records and any other information held on systems storing the Personal Data; 
access to and meetings with any of Osanoâs personnel reasonably necessary to provide all explanations and perform the audit effectively.
and
inspection of all records and the infrastructure, electronic data or systems, facilities, equipment or application software used to store, process the Personal Data.


The notice requirements in Section 1 above will not apply if (i) the Customer reasonably believes that a Personal Data Breach occurred, (ii) Osano is in breach of any of its obligations under this DPA or any applicable data protection laws or (iii) if such audit is mandated by the relevant Supervisory Authority.
If a Personal Data Breach occurs or is occurring or Osano becomes aware of a breach of any of its obligations under this DPA or any applicable data protection laws, Osano will:

Notify Customer promptly as detailed above;
promptly conduct its own audit to determine the cause;
remedy any deficiencies identified by the audit within thirty days.


 Records 
Osano will keep detailed, accurate and up-to-date written records regarding any processing of the Personal Data, including but not limited to, the access, control and security of the Personal Data, approved Subprocessors, the processing purposes, categories of processing, any transfers of personal data to a third country and related safeguards, and a general description of the technical and organisational security measures referred to in Clause 3.1 (âRecordsâ).
Osano will ensure that the Records are sufficient to enable the Customer to verify Osanoâs compliance with its obligations under this DPA and Osano will provide the Customer with copies of the Records upon request.
Osano must review the information listed in the Exhibits to this DPA at least once a year to confirm its current accuracy and suggest updates to it when required to reflect current practices.
 Data Transfers 
Osano (and any Subprocessor) will only transfer or otherwise process the Personal Data outside the European Economic Area (âEEAâ) or the United Kingdom subject to the Standard Contractual Clauses attached to this DPA.

Osano is processing the Personal Data in a territory that is subject to adequacy regulations under applicable data protection laws whereby the territory provides adequate protection for the privacy rights of individuals.
Osano must identify in Exhibit 1 the territory that is subject to such adequacy regulations.
or
Osano participates in a valid cross-border transfer mechanism under applicable data protection laws, so that Osano (and, where appropriate, the Customer) can ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to ensure an adequate level of protection with respect to the privacy rights of individuals as required by Article 46 of the GDPR.
Osano must identify in Exhibit 1 the transfer mechanism that enables the parties to comply with these cross-border data transfer provisions and Osano must immediately inform the Customer of any change to that status or Osano may only process, or permit the processing, of the Personal Data outside the EEA if the transfer otherwise complies with applicable data protection laws for the reasons set out in Exhibit 1.


If any Personal Data transfer between the Customer and Osano requires the execution of Standard Contractual Clauses (âSCCâ) in order to comply with applicable data protection laws (where the Customer is the entity exporting Personal Data to Osano outside the EEA or the United Kingdom), the parties will complete all relevant details in and execute, the SCC contained in Exhibit 2, and take all other actions required to legitimize the transfer including, but not limited to, entering into any required transfer agreement required by the United Kingdomâs ICO.


If the Customer consents to the appointment by Osano of a Subprocessor located outside the EEA or the United Kingdom in compliance with the provisions of Clause 2, then the Customer authorizes Osano to enter into the SCC referenced in Exhibit 2 with the Subprocessor in Osanoâs name and on its behalf.
Osano will make the executed Subprocessor agreement with SCC available to the Customer upon request.
If and to the extent that any processing of Personal Data subject to the UK GDPR by Osano takes place in any country outside the UK whose laws do not provide an adequate level of data protection (and an independently valid transfer mechanism does not exist), or either party relies on a statutory mechanism to normalize international data transfers that is subsequently modified, revoked, or held in a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, then:&nbsp.

the parties will (i) utilize any duly approved successor mechanism.
or (ii) cooperate in good faith to terminate the transfer or pursue a suitable alternate mechanism that can lawfully support the transfer.
and
the terms of the International Data Transfer Addendum to the EU SCCs issued by the UK Information Commissionerâs Office pursuant to S119A(1) of the UK Data Protection Act 2018 (âIDTAâ) (available at: https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/4019483/international-data-transfer-addendum.pdf) will apply in respect of that processing:

for purposes of Part I of the IDTA, the terms of this DPA, including the roles of the parties set forth in Annex I and the technical and organizational measures set out in Annex II, shall apply;
both parties shall be allowed to end subscription to the IDTA as set out in Section 19 of the IDTA.
and  
for purposes of Part 2 of the IDTA, the EU SCCs shall apply.

The acceding entity shall have no rights or obligations arising under these Clauses from the period prior to becoming a Party.
 Section II - Obligations of the Parties Clause 8 - Data Protection Safeguards
The data exporter warrants that it has used reasonable efforts to determine that the data importer is able, through the implementation of appropriate technical and organisational measures, to satisfy its obligations under these Clauses.
8.1 Instructions

The data importer shall process the personal data only on documented instructions from the data exporter.
The data exporter may give such instructions throughout the duration of the contract.
The data importer shall immediately inform the data exporter if it is unable to follow those instructions.

8.2 Purpose Limitation
The data importer shall process the personal data only for the specific purpose(s) of the transfer, as set out in Annex I.B, unless on further instructions from the data exporter.
8.3 Transparency
On request, the data exporter shall make a copy of these Clauses, including the Appendix as completed by the Parties, available to the data subject free of charge.
To the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential information, including the measures described in Annex II and personal data, the data exporter may redact part of the text of the Appendix to these Clauses prior to sharing a copy, but shall provide a meaningful summary where the data subject would otherwise not be able to understand the its content or exercise his/her rights.
On request, the Parties shall provide the data subject with the reasons for the redactions, to the extent possible without revealing the redacted information.
This Clause is without prejudice to the obligations of the data exporter under Articles 13 and 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
8.4 Accuracy
If the data importer becomes aware that the personal data it has received is inaccurate, or has become outdated, it shall inform the data exporter without undue delay.
In this case, the data importer shall cooperate with the data exporter to erase or rectify the data.
8.5 Duration of processing and erasure or return of data
Processing by the data importer shall only take place for the duration specified in Annex I.B.
After the end of the provision of the processing services, the data importer shall, at the choice of the data exporter, delete all personal data processed on behalf of the data exporter and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, or return to the data exporter all personal data processed on its behalf and delete existing copies.
Until the data is deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses.
In case of local laws applicable to the data importer that prohibit return or deletion of the personal data, the data importer warrants that it will continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses and will only process it to the extent and for as long as required under that local law.
This is without prejudice to Clause 14, in particular the requirement for the data importer under Clause 14(e) to notify the data exporter throughout the duration of the contract if it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under Clause 14(a).
8.6 Security of processing

The data importer and, during transmission, also the data exporter shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of the data, including protection against a breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access to that data (hereinafter âpersonal data breachâ).
In assessing the appropriate level of security, the Parties shall take due account of the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context and purpose(s) of processing and the risks involved in the processing for the data subjects.
The Parties shall in particular consider having recourse to encryption or pseudonymisation, including during transmission, where the purpose of processing can be fulfilled in that manner.
In case of pseudonymisation, the additional information for attributing the personal data to a specific data subject shall, where possible, remain under the exclusive control of the data exporter.
In complying with its obligations under this paragraph, the data importer shall at least implement the technical and organisational measures specified in Annex II.

Such notification shall contain the details of a contact point where more information can be obtained, a description of the nature of the breach (including, where possible, categories and approximate number of data subjects and personal data records concerned), its likely consequences and the measures taken or proposed to address the breach including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects.
Where, and in so far as, it is not possible to provide all information at the same time, the initial notification shall contain the information then available and further information shall, as it becomes available, subsequently be provided without undue delay.
The data importer shall cooperate with and assist the data exporter to enable the data exporter to comply with its obligations under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in particular to notify the competent supervisory authority and the affected data subjects, taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the data importer.

8.7 Sensitive Data
Where the transfer involves personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or a personâs sex life or sexual orientation, or data relating to criminal convictions and offences (hereinafter âsensitive dataâ), the data importer shall apply the specific restrictions and/or additional safeguards described in Annex I.B.
8.8 Onward Transfers
The data importer shall only disclose the personal data to a third party on documented instructions from the data exporter.
In addition, the data may only be disclosed to a third party located outside the European Union () (in the same country as the data importer or in another third country, hereinafter âonward transferâ) if the third party is or agrees to be bound by these Clauses, under the appropriate Module, or if:

the onward transfer is to a country benefitting from an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the onward transfer;
the third party otherwise ensures appropriate safeguards pursuant to Articles 46 or 47 Regulation of (EU) 2016/679 with respect to the processing in question;
the onward transfer is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims in the context of specific administrative, regulatory or judicial proceedings.
or
the onward transfer is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person.

Any onward transfer is subject to compliance by the data importer with all the other safeguards under these Clauses, in particular purpose limitation.
8.9 Documentation and Compliance

The data importer shall promptly and adequately deal with enquiries from the data exporter that relate to the processing under these Clauses.
The Parties shall be able to demonstrate compliance with these Clauses.
In particular, the data importer shall keep appropriate documentation on the processing activities carried out on behalf of the data exporter.
The data importer shall make available to the data exporter all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations set out in these Clauses and at the data exporterâs request, allow for and contribute to audits of the processing activities covered by these Clauses, at reasonable intervals or if there are indications of non-compliance.
In deciding on a review or audit, the data exporter may take into account relevant certifications held by the data importer.
The data exporter may choose to conduct the audit by itself or mandate an independent auditor.
Audits may include inspections at the premises or physical facilities of the data importer and shall, where appropriate, be carried out with reasonable notice.
The Parties shall make the information referred to in paragraphs (b) and (c), including the results of any audits, available to the competent supervisory authority on request.

Clause 9 - Use of Sub-processors

GENERAL WRITTEN AUTHORISATION The data importer has the data exporterâs general authorisation for the engagement of sub-processor(s) from an agreed list.
The data importer shall specifically inform the data exporter in writing of any intended changes to that list through the addition or replacement of sub-processors at least 14 days in advance, thereby giving the data exporter sufficient time to be able to object to such changes prior to the engagement of the sub-processor(s).
The data importer shall provide the data exporter with the information necessary to enable the data exporter to exercise its right to object.
Where the data importer engages a sub-processor to carry out specific processing activities (on behalf of the data exporter), it shall do so by way of a written contract that provides for, in substance, the same data protection obligations as those binding the data importer under these Clauses, including in terms of third-party beneficiary rights for data subjects.
() The Parties agree that, by complying with this Clause, the data importer fulfils its obligations under Clause 8.8.

The Parties warrant that they have no reason to believe that the laws and practices in the third country of destination applicable to the processing of the personal data by the data importer, including any requirements to disclose personal data or measures authorising access by public authorities, prevent the data importer from fulfilling its obligations under these Clauses.
This is based on the understanding that laws and practices that respect the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and do not exceed what is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard one of the objectives listed in Article 23(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, are not in contradiction with these Clauses.
The Parties declare that in providing the warranty in paragraph (a), they have taken due account in particular of the following elements:

the specific circumstances of the transfer, including the length of the processing chain, the number of actors involved and the transmission channels used.
intended onward transfers.
the type of recipient.
the purpose of processing.
the categories and format of the transferred personal data.
the economic sector in which the transfer occurs.
the storage location of the data transferred;
the laws and practices of the third country of destinationâ including those requiring the disclosure of data to public authorities or authorising access by such authorities â relevant in light of the specific circumstances of the transfer, and the applicable limitations and safeguards ();
any relevant contractual, technical or organisational safeguards put in place to supplement the safeguards under these Clauses, including measures applied during transmission and to the processing of the personal data in the country of destination.


The data importer warrants that, in carrying out the assessment under paragraph (b), it has made its best efforts to provide the data exporter with relevant information and agrees that it will continue to cooperate with the data exporter in ensuring compliance with these Clauses.
The Parties agree to document the assessment under paragraph (b) and make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.
The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter promptly if, after having agreed to these Clauses and for the duration of the contract, it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under paragraph (a), including following a change in the laws of the third country or a measure (such as a disclosure request) indicating an application of such laws in practice that is not in line with the requirements in paragraph (a).
Following a notification pursuant to paragraph (e), or if the data exporter otherwise has reason to believe that the data importer can no longer fulfil its obligations under these Clauses, the data exporter shall promptly identify appropriate measures (e.g.
technical or organisational measures to ensure security and confidentiality) to be adopted by the data exporter and/or data importer to address the situation.
The data exporter shall suspend the data transfer if it considers that no appropriate safeguards for such transfer can be ensured, or if instructed by the competent supervisory authority to do so.
In this case, the data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses.
If the contract involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise.
Where the contract is terminated pursuant to this Clause, Clause 16(d) and (e) shall apply.

Clause 15 - Obligations of the data importer in case of access by public authorities
15.1 Notification

The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter and, where possible, the data subject promptly (if necessary with the help of the data exporter) if it:

receives a legally binding request from a public authority, including judicial authorities, under the laws of the country of destination for the disclosure of personal data transferred pursuant to these Clauses.
such notification shall include information about the personal data requested, the requesting authority, the legal basis for the request and the response provided.
or

such notification shall include all information available to the importer.


If the data importer is prohibited from notifying the data exporter and/or the data subject under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to use its best efforts to obtain a waiver of the prohibition, with a view to communicating as much information as possible, as soon as possible.
The data importer agrees to document its best efforts in order to be able to demonstrate them on request of the data exporter.
Where permissible under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to provide the data exporter, at regular intervals for the duration of the contract, with as much relevant information as possible on the requests received (in particular, number of requests, type of data requested, requesting authority/ies, whether requests have been challenged and the outcome of such challenges, etc.).
The data importer agrees to preserve the information pursuant to paragraphs (a) to (c) for the duration of the contract and make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.

15.2 Review of legality and data minimisation

The data importer agrees to review the legality of the request for disclosure, in particular whether it remains within the powers granted to the requesting public authority, and to challenge the request if, after careful assessment, it concludes that there are reasonable grounds to consider that the request is unlawful under the laws of the country of destination, applicable obligations under international law and principles of international comity.
The data importer shall, under the same conditions, pursue possibilities of appeal.
When challenging a request, the data importer shall seek interim measures with a view to suspending the effects of the request until the competent judicial authority has decided on its merits.

 Section IV - Final Provisions Clause 16 - Non-compliance with the Clauses and termination

The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter if it is unable to comply with these Clauses, for whatever reason.
In the event that the data importer is in breach of these Clauses or unable to comply with these Clauses, the data exporter shall suspend the transfer of personal data to the data importer until compliance is again ensured or the contract is terminated.
This is without prejudice to Clause 14(f).
The data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses, where:

the data exporter has suspended the transfer of personal data to the data importer pursuant to paragraph (b) and compliance with these Clauses is not restored within a reasonable time and in any event within one month of suspension;
the data importer is in substantial or persistent breach of these Clauses.
or
the data importer fails to comply with a binding decision of a competent court or supervisory authority regarding its obligations under these Clauses.

Personal data that has been transferred prior to the termination of the contract pursuant to paragraph (c) shall at the choice of the data exporter immediately be returned to the data exporter or deleted in its entirety.
The same shall apply to any copies of the data.
The data importer shall certify the deletion of the data to the data exporter.
Until the data is deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses.
In case of local laws applicable to the data importer that prohibit the return or deletion of the transferred personal data, the data importer warrants that it will continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses and will only process the data to the extent and for as long as required under that local law.
Either Party may revoke its agreement to be bound by these Clauses where (i) the European Commission adopts a decision pursuant to Article 45(3) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the transfer of personal data to which these Clauses apply.
or (ii) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 becomes part of the legal framework of the country to which the personal data is transferred.
This is without prejudice to other obligations applying to the processing in question under Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
