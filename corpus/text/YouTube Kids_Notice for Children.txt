What information do we collect?

We collect information that a parent may give us, like your name, age and month of birth, and we collect information as you use YouTube Kids.
This may include things like your search and watch history and information about your device.

How do we use the information?

We use this information to do things like make YouTube Kids more secure and more relevant to you.
For example, we may suggest videos we think you might like based on your activity, like what youâve searched for or videos that youâve watched in the app.
 We may also use information to help show ads based on the video that you are watching and to limit how frequently you see ads in the app.
YouTube Kids does not allow you to share personal information with others or to make it publicly available.

What information may we share?

We take your privacy seriously.
There are just a few reasons we need to share your information outside of Google.
We share some info with your parent.
We give it to other companies and people who provide services for us, and we make sure they protect it.
We may also share it if your parent tells us itâs okay, or when we need to for legal reasons.

What control does a parent have?

Your parent has some settings and controls they can use to help manage your YouTube Kids experience.
 For example, they can do things like see the list of videos you have recently watched in the app, pause and clear the history of videos youâve searched for and videos youâve watched in the app, turn search on or off, and block certain videos from appearing in the app.
