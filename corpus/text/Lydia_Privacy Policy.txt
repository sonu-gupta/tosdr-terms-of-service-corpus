Introduction

The Service is a health management software tool from Get Real Health that lets you gather, edit, store and share health data online.
The Service is intended for you to store your personal health-related information.
You may also be able to access information about other people (such as your family) with their consent and invitation.
Service accounts are not for use by healthcare providers or for any other commercial or non-personal purpose.
The Service is capable of providing personalized health guidance for you and your family.
The Service is hosted by Us using Microsoft Azure.
You should review Microsoft Azureâs terms and conditions of use and privacy policy, which are available on Microsoft Azureâs website.
The Service may assist you in assembling health information in a usable format.
It is important for you to understand how the information that you submit, review and edit in the Service is used by Us.

The contents of the Service, such as text, graphics, images, personal health information, and other material contained in the Service and all information and data produced by the Service (âContentâ) are for informational purposes only.
 The Content is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
The information in your account may not always be accurate or up-to-date and should be viewed by any health care provider as informational only.
The Service does not hold records for healthcare providers or other medical or case management purposes.
For example, Service records may not be designated record sets as defined under U.S.
regulations.
If a healthcare provider decides to include any data made available from the Service in its records, it should store a copy in its own system.
If there is a co-custodian of a record in your account (because one of you invited the other), you acknowledge that the co-custodian has full control over that record and may cancel your access to the record, manage the record is used.
The health information and guidance you will receive is automatically generated by the Service, based on information that you enter into or make available to the Service through your Service account.
This information is not reviewed by a physician, nurse, or other health care provider for your treatment purposes.
 Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition.
 You agree that the Service and the information and guidance provided by the Service do not constitute the practice of medicine or any medical, nursing, or other professional health care advice, diagnosis, or treatment.  Never disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of something you have read when using the Service.


Signing in to Lydia and Creating an Account

To sign in to the Service, the Service uses a Microsoft authentication service.
If you close your Service account or lose your account credentials, you may not be able to access your data.
Before using the Microsoft authentication service, we recommend you review the security and privacy commitments offered by Microsoft.
To create a new Service account, you must provide personal data such as name, date of birth, e-mail address, postal code, and country/region.
Depending on which features you use, you may be asked for additional information.
A Service account allows you to manage one or more health records, such as the ones you create for yourself and your family members.
You can add or remove data to a health record you manage at any time.

Sharing Health Data

A key value of the Service is the ability you have to share your health data with people and services that can help you meet your health-related goals.
By default, you are the custodian of any records you create.
Custodians have the highest level of access to a health record.
As a custodian, you can share data in a health record with another person by sending an e-mail invitation through the Service.
You can specify what type of access they have (including custodian access), how long they have access, and whether they can modify the data in the record.
When you grant someone access, that person can grant the same level of access to someone else (for example, someone with view-only access can grant another user view-only access).
Because inappropriate granting of access could allow someone to violate your privacy or even revoke your access to your own records, you should be cautious about granting access to your records.

You can choose to share specific data (or all of the data) in a health record with other services, including participating third party services that you authorize (where available).
No service has access to your data through the Service unless an authorized user grants it access through the Service.
The Service allows you to control access by accepting or denying requests.
For each service granted access, you choose what health information in a specific health record to share and what actions each service may perform on the health information.
A third party service that you authorize for a record will get the full name associated with your Service account, the nickname of the authorized record(s), and your relationship to that record.
The third party service will continue to have access through the Service until you revoke the permission.
Get Real Health can revoke a third party serviceâs access to the Service if it does not meet its privacy commitments to Get Real Health.
However, except for applying the access permissions you have granted to third-party services, We do not control or monitor third-party services, and their privacy practices will vary.

Access and controls

You can review, edit, or delete your Service account data, or close your Service account at any time.
Only custodians can permanently delete an item.
When you delete a heath record, it is also deleted for all users who had access to it.
When you close your Service account, we delete all records for which you are the sole custodian.
If you share custodian access for a record, you can decide whether to delete the record.
Get Real Health will wait a limited amount of time before permanently deleting your data in order to help avoid accidental or malicious removal of your health data.
The Service maintains a full history of each access, change or deletion by users and services, which includes the date, action, and name of the person or service.
Custodians of records can examine the history of those records.

Email communications

We will use the email address you provide to share invitations you send through the Service, and to send you service notifications, such as email notifications that information is available to add to your Service records.

Collection of Personal and Usage Information

Any data that you enter into the Service (âPersonal Health Informationâ or âPersonal Informationâ) is stored in a secure hosted environment.
 The secure hosted environment is located in The Netherlands.
The Service does not permanently store any of your data.
The Service uses the information that you authorize for access from your Service account to provide you with personalized health information.
 You can review and edit information contained in your Service account using the Patient Portal.

The Service uses personal information collected from You and from CHBaseâ¢, a proprietary data repository owned and operated by Us, including Personal Health Information, to provide the Service as described in this policy.
Get Real Health does not access the Personal Health Information that is stored in the secure hosted environment without your prior permission (for example, for maintenance or support purposes) and is not accessible by third parties without your secret login password information.
