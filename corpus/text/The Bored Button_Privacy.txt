         Bored Buttonâ¢ Privacy Policy Bored Button does not collect any personal information.
Bored Button does, however, use cookies in the following ways.
1.
Most importantly, we use a cookie to ensure that each time you click the Bored Button you see a random website that you have not already seen.
2.
We use a cookie to record whether youâre eligible for and/or have accepted our cookie policy and therefore whether or not to show you our cookie message.
3.
We run ads supplied by Google Adsense.
In the European Economic Area (EEA), AdSense uses a cookie to ensure that it does not show you personalized ads.
Outside the EEA, Google Adsense uses cookies to show you personalized ads.
4.
We also run ads supplied by BuySellAds, but only when your browser window is at least 1180 pixels wide.
We set a cookie when this is the case so that we donât needlessly call the ad server when itâs not the case.
5.
Finally, we run Google Analytics.
This enables us to monitor and analyze web traffic so that we can improve the website and user experience.
Google Analytics collects anonymous user data and stores it for a limited time per their privacy policy.
If youâre uncomfortable with Google Analytics, you might consider a Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on.
