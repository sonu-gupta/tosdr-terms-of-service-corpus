We may, at any time and in our sole discretion, and without any notice to you, suspend, restrict or disable access to or remove your Account, your sites or Your Ecommerce Activities, without any liability to you or to any End Users, including without limitation for any loss of profits, revenue, data, goodwill or other intangible losses (except where prohibited by applicable law).
For example, we may suspend Your Ecommerce Activities if you are violating this Agreement.
To accept payments from your End Users in connection with Your Ecommerce Activities, you must create and connect your Stripe account to Webflow.
Your relationship with Stripe (the âEcommerce Payment Processorâ) is governed by the Ecommerce Payment Processorâs terms and policies.
By registering with Stripe, you are confirming that you will not accept payments via Stripe in connection with any prohibited businesses, business activities or business practices, which may vary from country to country.
We do not control and are not liable for any Ecommerce Payment Processor, or for any transaction you may enter into with or through the Ecommerce Payment Processor.
The Ecommerce Payment Processors is a third party service, as described in Section 2 of this Agreement.
The Ecommerce Payment Processor may provide invoices for any transaction fees associated with Your Ecommerce Activities transactions. Basically...
We offer tools to help you build ecommerce websites.
How you conduct Your Ecommerce Activities is your responsibility, and weâre not liable for it.
If youâre using Webflow Ecommerce, you must follow our ecommerce rules at all times, or we may terminate the service and/or your access to it.
Your use of a third party to process ecommerce payments means that your relationship is with them, not us. 11.

Amendments, notification procedures, and changes to the Agreement We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify, update, or change the Terms of Service ("Updated Terms") from time to time, so you should review this page periodically.
When we change the Agreement in a material manner, we will update the âlast modifiedâ date at the top of this page.
Your continued use of the Service after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Service.
If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future Terms of Service, do not use or access (or continue to access) the Service.
Webflow is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us.
Unless we make a change for legal or administrative reasons, we will provide reasonable advance notice before the Updated Terms become effective.
Webflow may provide such notifications, whether the notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business-related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by Webflow in our sole discretion.
Webflow reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification by contacting us at contact@webflow.com.
You agree that we may notify you of the Updated Terms by posting them on the Service, and that your use of the Service after the effective date of the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the Updated Terms.
Therefore, you should review these Terms of Service and any Updated Terms before using the Service.
The Updated Terms will be effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the Updated Terms, and will apply to your use of the Service from that point forward.
The Terms of Service will govern any disputes arising before the effective date of the Updated Terms. Basically...
We may change our terms of service from time to time.
If these terms of use change, we'll notify you, and give you a chance to opt out.
We wonât change the terms retroactively.
16.
Dispute resolution
INFORMAL NEGOTIATIONS.
To expedite resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim related to this Agreement (âDisputeâ), you and Webflow agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding.
Such informal negotiations will commence upon written notice.
Your address for such notices is your billing address, with an email copy to the email address you have provided to Webflow.
Webflowâs address for such notices is Webflow, Inc., 398 11th St., Floor 2, San Francisco, CA 94103.
BINDING ARBITRATION.
If you and Webflow are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, all claims arising from use of the Service (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.
Any election to arbitrate by one party will be final and binding on the other.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IF EITHER PARTY ELECTS TO ARBITRATE, NEITHER PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL.
The arbitration will be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the âAAA Rulesâ) of the American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ) and, where appropriate, the AAAâs Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (âAAA Consumer Rulesâ), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org.
Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be governed by the AAA Rules (and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules).
If your claim for damages does not exceed $10,000, Webflow will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online.
The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party.
The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.
Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you and Webflow may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
EXCEPTIONS TO ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION.
Each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court or to seek injunctive or other equitable relief on an individual basis in a federal or state court located within the Central District of California with respect to any dispute related to the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a partyâs intellectual property or proprietary rights.
WAIVER OF RIGHT TO BE A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
You and Webflow agree that any arbitration will be limited to the Dispute between Webflow and you individually.
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND Webflow ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
Further, unless both you and Webflow otherwise agree, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one personâs claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.
If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this âDispute Resolutionâ Section will be deemed null and void.
LOCATION OF ARBITRATION.
Arbitration will take place in San Francisco, California.
You and Webflow agree that for any Dispute not subject to arbitration (other than claims proceeding in any small claims court), or where no election to arbitrate has been made, the California state and Federal courts located in San Francisco, California have exclusive jurisdiction and you and Webflow agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts. Basically...
We donât want to fight.
If something goes wrong, contact us and we'll negotiate the problem.
If that doesnât work, we will figure it out in arbitration in San Francisco.
 17.

Attorneysâ and accountantsâ fees, remedies In any action to enforce the Terms of Service, the prevailing party shall be entitled to attorneysâ and accountantsâ fees and costs.
You agree that Webflow's remedy at law for any actual or threatened breach of this Agreement would be inadequate and that Webflow shall be entitled to specific performance or injunctive relief, or both, in addition to any damages that Webflow may be legally entitled to recover, together with reasonable expenses of any form of dispute resolution, including, without limitation, attorneys' fees.
No right or remedy of Webflow shall be exclusive of any other, whether at law or in equity, including without limitation damages injunctive relief, attorneys' fees, and expenses.
No instance of waiver by Webflow of its rights or remedies under these terms and conditions shall imply any obligation to grant any similar, future, or other waiver. Basically...
