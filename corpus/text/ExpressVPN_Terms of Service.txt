If you do not agree with any part of the Terms, you may not use our Services.
By creating an account for using our Services, you represent that you are at least eighteen (18) years of age or that you are a valid legal entity, and that the registration information you have provided is accurate and complete.2.

Privacy PolicyExpressVPN is committed to your privacy and does not collect or log browsing history, traffic destination, data content, or DNS queries from Subscribers connected to our VPN.
During your registration, we may collect some sensitive personal information, such as your email address and payment information.
We only collect information that are necessary for the proper delivery of the Site and Services.
For the sake of clarity and transparency, we have placed all information related to data collection in a separate document known as the Privacy Policy, which is available on the Site.
Please review the Privacy Policy in its entirety to get a clear understanding of how we handle your sensitive data.4.
SubscriptionsExpressVPN Services are available to you upon registration on the Site.
By subscribing to the Services, you agree to become a subscriber (âSubscriberâ) for the period you have elected.
A full list of subscription plans and pricing is available on the Site.
ExpressVPN reserves the right to amend subscription fees or institute new fees at any time upon reasonable advance notice posted on the Site or sent via email.
Any changes to the pricing will not affect the Subscriberâs current subscription period and will become effective upon subscription renewal.
Subscription purchases and refunds are handled via multiple third-party payment companies.
When supported by your payment method, plans renew automatically by default at the completion of the billing term.
By default, the renewal term is for the same duration as the billing term for the original subscription.
The subscription fee will be charged automatically to the payment method you last selected.
If you would like to discontinue automatic renewal, you may sign in to the Site and turn off auto-renewal.
By default, auto-renewal is turned on when you use a payment method that supports auto-renewal (such as a credit card or Paypal), and turned off when you use a payment method that does not support auto-renewal (such as Bitcoin).
Each paid subscription grants you one (1) license to use on five (5) different devices at any given time.
If you want to use the Services on more than five devices at a time, then you can either (i) use ExpressVPN on your router, (ii) purchase additional subscription plans, or (iii) purchase additional licenses through the âvolume licensingâ option.
For more information on âvolume licensingâ program, please contact Support.5.
Refund PolicyYou may cancel your account with a full refund within 30 days of your initial purchase (âMoney Back Guaranteeâ).
Refunds beyond the 30-day purchase window will be considered, at the sole discretion of ExpressVPN, if a Subscriber can demonstrate that the Service was not available or usable during the subscription period and that reasonable attempts were made to contact ExpressVPN to resolve the issue.
In this case, ExpressVPN may provide the Subscriber with a pro-rata refund of service fees paid during the period when the Service was not available or usable.
Refunds are generally processed within seven (7) days, and are made to the original form of payment used for purchase.
All refunds are sent in USD and therefore the refund amount could differ from the amount originally paid in local currency or Bitcoin.
Any change to the original purchase, such as upgrading to an extended billing term or purchasing of additional licenses under the same account, shall constitute a waiver of the Money Back Guarantee option.
To request a refund under the Money Back Guarantee, send an email with your request to the following email address: support@expressvpn.com

Users whose subscriptions are billed as an in-app purchase through the Apple App Store (iTunes) do not have access to the ExpressVPN 30-day money-back guarantee.
Instead, users can request refunds through the App Store, which are issued solely at the discretion of Apple Support.6.
