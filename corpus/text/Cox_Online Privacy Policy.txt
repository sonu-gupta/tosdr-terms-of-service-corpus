INFORMATION WE COLLECT.  


A.
&nbsp.

Information about You that You Provide.
Cox, and/or its Service Providers (defined below), may collect information you provide directly to Cox and/or its Service Providers via the Online Service.
For example, Cox collects information when you use or register for the Online Service, subscribe to notifications, post on the Online Service, participate in promotional activities, or communicate, use or transact through the Online Service.
In addition, when you interact with Third-Party Services (defined below), you may be able to provide information to those third parties.
For more information on Third-Party Servicesâ data collection and practices see 
Section 6
.
For more information on Service Provider data collection and practices see 
Section 3
.
 
Information Cox, its Service Providers and/or Third-Party Services may collect may include: (1) personally identifiable information, which is information that identifies you personally, such as your first and last name, e-mail address, phone number, address, telephone number, social security number, Cox account number, user id and password, PIN, and full payment account number ("Personally Identifiable Information" or "PII").
and (2) demographic information, such as your gender, age, zip code, interests, and recent and upcoming purchases ("Demographic Information").
Except to the extent required by applicable law, Demographic Information is "non-Personally Identifiable Information" or "non-PII" (i.e., data that is not Personally Identifiable Information under this Online Privacy Policy).
In addition, PII, including, without limitation, Cox-Collected Online PII (defined below), once "De-identified" (i.e., the removal or modification of the personally identifiable elements, or the rendering of personally identifiable elements into non-personally identifiable elements through anonymization, pseudonymization, and/or hashing) is also non-PII and may be used and shared without obligation to you, except as prohibited by applicable law.
However, we do not make assurances that De-identified data is not capable of re-identification.
To the extent any non-PII, or PII collected outside of the Online Service, is combined by or on behalf of Cox with PII Cox itself collects directly from you on the Online Service ("Cox-Collected Online PII"), Cox will treat the combined data as Cox-Collected Online PII under this Online Privacy Policy.
The definition of "personal information" under certain California laws differs from the definition of PII used in this Online Privacy Policy.

Web Beacons ("Tracking Pixels")

Web beacons are small graphic images, also known as "Internet tags" or "clear gifs," embedded in web pages and e-mail messages.
Web beacons may be used, without limitation, to count the number of visitors to the Online Service, to monitor how users navigate the Online Service, and to count content views.



Embedded Scripts

An embedded script is programming code designed to collect information about your interactions with the Online Service.
It is temporarily downloaded onto your computer from Coxâs web server, or from a third party with which Cox works and is active only while you are connected to the Online Service and deleted or deactivated thereafter.



Location-identifying Technologies

GPS (global positioning systems) software, geo-filtering, geo-targeting, geo-fencing, and other location-aware technologies locate you (sometimes precisely), or make assumptions about your location, for purposes such as verifying your location and delivering or restricting content based on your location.
If you have enabled GPS or use other location-based features on the Online Service, your device location may be tracked by us and third parties.
Our store finder feature may access and use information about your device location (such as based on IP address or GPS, as applicable), or your account information, to suggest appropriate store locations.

Device Recognition Technologies

Technologies, including application of statistical probability to data sets, as well as linking a common unique identifier to different device use (e.g., Facebook ID), which attempt to recognize or make assumptions about users and devices (e.g., that a user of multiple devices is the same user or household) ("Cross-device Data").



In-App Tracking Methods

There are a variety of Tracking Technologies that may be included in mobile applications, and these are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings.
Some use device identifier, or other identifiers such as "Ad IDs" to associate app user activity to a particular app and to track user activity across apps and/or devices.



Device and Activity Monitoring

Technologies that monitor, and may record, certain of your interactions with the Online Service, including without limitation, keystrokes, and/or collect and analyze information from your device, such as, without limitation, your operating system, plug-ins, system fonts, and other data, for purposes such as identification, security, fraud prevention, troubleshooting, tracking and/or improving the Online Services and customizing or optimizing your experience on the Online Services.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, we and third parties may convert your PII, including Cox-Collected Online PII, to non-PII, including without limitation through hashing it or substituting a unique identifier for the PII and we and third parties may use and share that data as permitted by applicable law, including to match data attributes to and from other sources.
Any such third-party activities are subject to their privacy policies and practices.
Coxâs sharing of Cox-Collected Online PII is, however, subject to the following:  



Marketing: Subject to your communications choices explained in 
Section 11.D
, and the rights of California residents explained in 
Section 12

Such third-party data receipt and collection is subject to the privacy and business practices of that third party, not Cox.

Coxâs agents, vendors, consultants, and other service providers (collectively "Service Providers") may receive, or be given access to, your information, including, without limitation, PII, Demographic Information, and Usage Information, in connection with their work on Coxâs behalf, provided however, Cox does not authorize its Service Providers to use Cox-Collected Online PII provided by Cox to the Service Providers to send you direct marketing messages other than related to Cox and Cox Affiliates absent your consent.

CHOICES: TRACKING AND COMMUNICATIONS OPTIONS.


A.
&nbsp.

Tracking Technologies Generally.
 Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some instances blocked in the future by selecting certain settings.
Browsers offer different functionalities and options, so you may need to set them separately.
Also, tools from commercial browsers may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies (also known as locally shared objects), HTML5 cookies, or other Tracking Technologies.
For information on disabling Flash cookies, go to Adobeâs website 
http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-third-party-local-shared.html
.
Please be aware that if you disable or remove these technologies, some parts of the Online Service may not work and that when you revisit the Online Service your ability to limit browser-based Tracking Technologies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.
 
Some App-related Tracking Technologies in connection with non-browser usage (e.g., most functionality of a mobile app) can only be disabled by uninstalling the app.
To uninstall an app, follow the instructions from your operating system or handset manufacturer.
Apple and Google mobile device settings have settings to limit ad tracking, and other tracking, but these may not be completely effective.
 
Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a "Do Not Track" signal to online services you visit.
Note, however, there is no consensus among industry participants as to what "Do Not Track" means in this context.
Like many online services, Cox currently does not alter Coxâs practices when Cox receives a "Do Not Track" signal from a visitorâs browser.
To find out more about "Do Not Track," you can visit 
http://www.allaboutdnt.com
, but Cox is not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of this third party information.
Some third parties, however, may offer you choices regarding their Tracking Technologies.
One way to potentially identify cookies on a web site is to add the free Ghostery plug-in to your browser (
www.ghostery.com
), which according to Ghostery will display for you traditional, browser-based cookies associated with the web sites (but not mobile apps) you visit and privacy and opt-out policies and options of the parties operating those cookies.
Cox is not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of this tool or third-party choice notices or mechanisms.
For specific information on some of the choice options offered by third party analytics and advertising providers, see the next section.
We may offer tools in connection with the Online Service that allow you to exercise certain preferences regarding cookies and other Tracking Technologies associated with the Online Service.

http://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html
 under the section labeled "Tell our customers not to measure your use of their web sites or tailor their online ads for you."
 
For Online Services, you may choose whether to receive some Online Interest-based Advertising by submitting opt-outs.
Some of the advertisers and Service Providers that perform advertising-related services for us related to our Online Service and third parties may participate in the Digital Advertising Allianceâs ("DAA") Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising.

Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of Online Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads.
Opting out only means that those selected members should no longer deliver certain Online Interest-based Advertising to you but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks).
Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit these opt-out webpages, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different device or web browser or use a non-browser-based method of access (e.g., mobile app), your NAI / DAA browser-based opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective.
Cox supports the ad industryâs 
Self-regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising
 and expects that ad networks Cox directly engages to serve you Online Interest-based Advertising will do so as well, though Cox cannot guaranty their compliance.
Cox is not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-partiesâ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.
Addressable Advertising preferences in connection with Subscription Services such as video service are governed by the Cox account holder Subscription Services preferences, and you can exercise choices regarding your preferences regarding Subscription Services viewership information within the relevant account settings.

YOUR CONNECTICUT PRIVACY RIGHTS.

Connecticut law requires any person or entity that collects Social Security numbers from Connecticut residents in the course of business to create a privacy protection policy and to publish or display it publicly.
It is our policy to protect the confidentiality of Social Security numbers in our possession from misuse and improper disclosure by maintaining and enforcing policies and physical and electronic safeguards against misuse and improper disclosure.
Unlawful disclosure of Social Security numbers is prohibited, and access to them is limited to personnel who need access to such information in order to perform their job functions.

However, we will not treat your previously collected Cox-Collected Online PII, to the extent it is not collected under the new privacy policy, in a manner materially different than represented at the time it was collected without your consent.
