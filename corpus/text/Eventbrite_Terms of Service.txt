Eventbrite's Services and Role
2.1 What We Do.
Eventbrite's Services provide a simple and quick means for Organizers to create speaker profiles, organizer profiles, and other webpages related to their events, promote those pages and events to visitors or browsers on the Services or elsewhere online, manage online or onsite ticketing and registration, solicit donations, and sell or reserve merchandise or accommodations related to those events to Consumers or other Users.
Descriptions of other and more specific services can generally be found on the Site of each of the Eventbrite Properties.
2.2 How We Fit In.
Eventbrite is not the creator, organizer or owner of the events listed on the Services.
Rather, Eventbrite provides its Services, which allow Organizers to manage ticketing and registration and promote their events.
The Organizer is solely responsible for ensuring that any page displaying an event on the Services (and the event itself) meet all applicable local, state, provincial, national and other laws, rules and regulations, and that the goods and services described on the event page are delivered as described and in an accurate satisfactory manner.
The Organizer of a paid event selects the payment processing method for its event as more fully described in the Merchant Agreement.
Consumers must use whatever payment processing method the Organizer selects.
If the Organizer selects a payment processing method that uses a third party to process the payment, then neither Eventbrite nor any of its payment processing partners processes the transaction but we transmit the Consumer's payment details to the Organizer's designated payment provider.
If an Organizer uses Eventbrite Payment Processing (as defined in the Merchant Agreement), Eventbrite also acts as the Organizer's limited agent solely for the purpose of using our third party payment service providers to collect payments made by Consumers on the Services and passing such payments to the Organizer.
3-4 3.
Privacy and Consumer Information
3.1 We know your personal information is important to you and it is important to Eventbrite too.
Information provided to Eventbrite by Users or collected by Eventbrite through Eventbrite Properties, is governed by our Privacy Policy.
3.2 If you are an Organizer, you represent, warrant and agree that (a) you will at all times comply with all applicable local, state, provincial, national and other laws, rules and regulations with respect to information you collect from (or receive about) consumers, and (b) you will at all times comply with any applicable policies posted on the Services with respect to information you collect from (or receive about) consumers.
4.
Term.
Termination
4.1 These Terms apply to you as soon as you access the Services by any means and continue in effect until they are terminated.
There may come a time where either you or Eventbrite decides it's best to part ways as described in Sections 4.2 or 4.3 below.
When that happens, these Terms will generally no longer apply.
However, as described in Section 4.4, certain provisions will always remain applicable to both you and Eventbrite.
4.2 Eventbrite may terminate your right to use the Services at any time (a) if you violate or breach these Terms.
(b) if you misuse or abuse the Services, or use the Services in a way not intended or permitted by Eventbrite.
or (c) if allowing you to access and use the Services would violate any applicable local, state, provincial, national and other laws, rules and regulations or would expose Eventbrite to legal liability.
Eventbrite may choose to stop offering the Services, or any particular portion of the Service, or modify or replace any aspect of the Service, at any time.
We will use reasonable efforts to provide you with notice of our termination of your access to the Services, where, in Eventbrite's sole discretion, failure to do so would materially prejudice you.
You agree that Eventbrite will not be liable to you or any third-party as a result of its termination of your right to use or otherwise access the Services.
4.3 Except to the extent you have agreed otherwise in a separate written agreement between you and Eventbrite, you may terminate your access to the Services and the general applicability of Terms by deleting your account.
If you are a Consumer using the Services without a registered account, your only option for these Terms to no longer apply is to stop accessing the Services indefinitely.
So long as you continue to access the Services, even without an account, these Terms remain in effect.
If there is a separate agreement between you and Eventbrite governing your use of the Services and that agreement terminates or expires, these Terms (as unmodified by such agreement) will govern your use of the Services after such termination or expiration.
4.4 All provisions of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination of these Terms will survive (including, without limitation, all limitations on liability, releases, indemnification obligations, disclaimers of warranties, agreements to arbitrate, choices of law and judicial forum and intellectual property protections and licenses). 5-6 5.
Export Controls and Restricted Countries As a global company based in the US with operations in other countries, Eventbrite complies with certain export controls and economic sanctions laws.
All Users, regardless of your or the event's location should familiarize yourself with these restrictions.
In accepting these Terms you represent and warrant that: (a) you are not located in, and you are not a national or resident of, any country to which the United States, United Kingdom, European Union, Australia or Canada has embargoed goods and/or services of the same type as the Services, including without limitation, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria or the Crimea region of Ukraine.
and (b) you are not a person or entity, or owned by, under the control of, or affiliated with, a person or entity (i) that appears on the U.S.
Office of Foreign Assets Control's Specially Designated Nationals List, Foreign Sanctions Evaders List or Palestinian Legislative Council List.

(ii) that is subject to sanctions in any other country.

6.
Release and Indemnification This is where you agree to cover Eventbrite if you use the Service in a way that causes Eventbrite to be the subject of a legal matter, or to face other claims or expenses, or as otherwise set forth herein, to the extent permitted by applicable laws.
6.1 Release.
You hereby agree to release Eventbrite from all damages (whether direct, indirect, incidental, consequential or otherwise), losses, liabilities, costs and expenses of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of a dispute between you and a third party (including other Users) in connection with the Services or any event listed on the Services.
In addition, you waive any applicable law or statute, which says, in substance: "A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE RELEASED PARTY."
6.2 Indemnification.
You agree to defend, indemnify and hold Eventbrite and each of its and their respective officers, directors, agents, co-branders, licensors, payment processing partners, other partners and employees, harmless from any and all damage (whether direct, indirect, incidental, consequential or otherwise), loss, liability, cost and expense (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' and accounting fees) resulting from any claim, demand, suit, proceeding (whether before an arbitrator, court, mediator or otherwise) or investigation made by any third party (each a "Claim") relating to or arising out of: (a) your breach of these Terms (including any terms or agreements or policies incorporated into these Terms).
(b) your use of the Services in violation of these Terms or other policies we post or make available.
(c) your breach of any applicable local, state, provincial, national or other law, rule or regulation or the rights of any third party.
(d) Eventbriteâs collection and remission of taxes.
and (e) if you are an Organizer, your events (including where Eventbrite has provided Services with respect to those events), provided that in the case of (e) this indemnification will not apply to the extent that the Claim arises out of Eventbrite's gross negligence or willful misconduct.
Eventbrite will provide notice to you of any such Claim, provided that the failure or delay by Eventbrite in providing such notice will not limit your obligations hereunder except to the extent you are materially prejudiced by such failure.
Also, in certain circumstances, Eventbrite may choose to handle the Claim ourselves, in which case you agree to cooperate with Eventbrite in any way we request. 7-8 7.
Disclaimer of Warranties and Assumption of Risks by You
We strive to provide Services in the way you need them, but there are some things it is important for you to understand that we cannot promise.
To the extent permitted by applicable laws, the Services are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis.
Eventbrite expressly disclaims all warranties of any kind, express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, title, non-infringement and fitness for a particular purpose.
For example, Eventbrite makes no warranty that (a) the Services (or any portion of the Services) will meet your requirements or expectations.
(b) the Services will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free.
or (c) the results that may be obtained from the use of the Services will be accurate or reliable.
You acknowledge that Eventbrite has no control over and does not guarantee the quality, safety, accuracy or legality of any event or Content associated with an event, the truth or accuracy of any information provided by Users (including the Consumer's personal information shared with Organizers in connection with events) or the ability of any User to perform or actually complete a transaction.
Eventbrite has no responsibility to you for, and hereby disclaims all liability arising from, the acts or omissions of any third parties that Eventbrite requires to provide the Services, that an Organizer chooses to assist with an event, or that you choose to contract with when using the Services.
You understand and agree that some events may carry inherent risk, and by participating in those events, you choose to assume those risks voluntarily.
For example, some events may carry risk of illness, bodily injury, disability, or death, and you freely and willfully assume those risks by choosing to participate in those events.
The foregoing disclaimers apply to the maximum extent permitted by law.
You may have other statutory rights.
However, the duration of statutorily required warranties, if any, will be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.
8.
Limitation of Liability
8.1 To the extent permitted by applicable laws, or as otherwise set forth herein, Eventbrite and any person or entity associated with Eventbrite's provision of the Services (e.g., an affiliate, vendor, strategic partner or employee) ("Associated Parties"), will not be liable to you or any third party, for: (a) any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, opportunity costs, intangible losses, or the cost of substitute services (even if Eventbrite has been advised of the possibility of such damages).
or (b) Your Content.
In addition, other than the obligation of Eventbrite to pay out Event Registration Fees in certain circumstances to certain organizers under the Merchant Agreement, and only in accordance with the terms therein, the maximum aggregate liability of Eventbrite or Associated Parties is limited to the following:
(i) for Organizers of events with paid tickets, and subject to the terms of the Merchant Agreement, the fees (net of Eventbrite Payment Processing Fees) that you paid us in the three (3) month period immediately preceding the circumstances giving rise to your claim.
and(ii) for Organizers of events with free tickets only, Consumers or other Users, (1) the total amount of all tickets or registrations that you purchased or made through the Services in the three (3) month period immediately preceding the circumstances giving rise to your claim.
or (2) if you made no such purchases, one hundred U.S.
dollars (US $100).
8.2 Nothing in these Terms is intended to exclude or limit any condition, warranty, right or liability which may not be lawfully excluded or limited.
Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or conditions or the limitation or exclusion of liability for loss or damage caused by willful acts, negligence, breach of contract or breach of implied terms, or incidental or consequential damages.
Accordingly, only those liability and other limitations which are lawful in your jurisdiction (if any) will apply to you and our liability is limited to the maximum extent permitted by law. 9-10 9.
IMPORTANT: BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER PROVISIONS.
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.
ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM UNDER THESE TERMS OR WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES WILL BE SETTLED BY BINDING ARBITRATION OR IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT (TO THE EXTENT THE CLAIM QUALIFIES) AND WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS ONLY.
YOU AGREE THAT CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ARBITRATIONS AND CIVIL ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED AND ANY RIGHTS TO BRING SUCH ACTIONS ARE WAIVED BY EACH PARTY.
The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.
They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.
(a) Contact Us First.If you have a question or concern about the Services, please contact us first.
Our customer support team will try to answer your question or resolve your concern.
(b) Agreement to Arbitrate.In the unlikely event that our customer support team is unable to resolve your concerns, the parties (you and we) each hereby agree to resolve any and all disputes or claims under these Terms, with respect to the Services, or related to our relationship through binding arbitration or in small claims court (to the extent the claim qualifies) instead of in courts of general jurisdiction, and only on an individual basis.
In no event may either we or you seek to resolve a dispute with the other as part of any purported class, consolidated or representative proceeding.
Binding arbitration is subject to very limited review.
Only the arbitrator appointed pursuant to this Section, and not any federal, state or local court will have the authority to resolve any dispute or claim relating to this Section including, without limitation, regarding the scope, enforceability and arbitrability of these Terms.
This arbitration provision will survive termination of these Terms.
These Terms evidence a transaction in interstate commerce and the interpretation and enforcement of this Section 9 is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, notwithstanding the choice of law set forth in Section 9(h) below.
(c) Scope of Agreement.This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted as to legal disputes between you and us.
It includes, but is not limited to: (i) all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory.
(ii) all claims that arose before this or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising).
and (iii) all claims that may arise after termination of these Terms and/or your use of the Services.
(d) Exceptions.Notwithstanding this Agreement to arbitrate, either party may (i) bring an action on an individual basis in small claims court (to the extent the applicable claim qualifies).
or (ii) bring enforcement actions, validity determinations or claims arising from or relating to theft, piracy or unauthorized use of intellectual property in state or federal court in the U.S.
Patent or Trademark Office to protect its Intellectual Property Rights ("Intellectual Property Rights" means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights).
In addition, the portion of any dispute or complaint relating to our participation in the US-EU or US-Swiss Privacy Shield Frameworks is subject to the Dispute Resolution section of our Privacy Policy before being subject to this Section.
(e) No Class Actions.YOU AND EVENTBRITE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS, MAY NOT PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING AND MAY ONLY PROVIDE RELIEF IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM.
(f) Notice of Dispute.A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice").
The Notice to Eventbrite must be addressed to the following address ("Notice Address") and must be sent by certified mail: Eventbrite, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 155 5th Street Floor 7, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA.
Notice to you will be addressed to a mailing, home or payment address currently on record with Eventbrite and must be sent by certified mail.
If Eventbrite has no records of such physical address, such notice may be delivered to your Eventbrite account email address.
The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.
and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought.
If Eventbrite and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Eventbrite may commence an arbitration proceeding.
(g) Arbitration Proceedings.The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules, or, if the actions giving rise to the dispute or claim relate to your personal or household use of the Services (rather than business use), the Consumer Arbitration Rules (in each case, the "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this Section 9, and will be administered by the AAA and settled by a single arbitrator.
(The AAA Rules are also available by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) All issues in dispute between the parties are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Section 9. 
(h) Location of Arbitration Proceedings.If you are a Consumer, any arbitration hearings will take place (at your option) either in the county of your residence or by phone, except that is you are a Consumer whose residence is outside of the United States, the hearing will take place either in San Francisco, California or by phone or videoconference, at your option and as permitted by the AAA Rules.
If you are a business (i.e., your use of the Services were for commercial use), then unless Eventbrite and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location in the United States for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances.
If the parties are unable to agree on a location, AAA will determine the location.
If your claim is for ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.
If your claim exceeds ten thousand dollars ($10,000), the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
All decisions by the arbitrator will be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
(i) Costs of Arbitration.
Legal Fees.i.
Payment of Costs and Expenses.
Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator costs and expenses imposed by AAA will be governed by the AAA rules, provided that if you are initiating an arbitration against Eventbrite and the value of the relief sought is ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or less, then Eventbrite will advance all filing, administrative and arbitration costs and expenses imposed by AAA (subject to reimbursement as set forth below).
Further, if the circumstances in the preceding sentence apply and your claim arises from your use of the Services as a Consumer, but the value of relief sought is more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) and you demonstrate to the arbitrator that such costs and expenses would be more expensive than a court proceeding, then Eventbrite will pay the amount of any such costs and expenses.
In the event that the arbitrator determines that all of the claims you assert in arbitration are frivolous according to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, you agree to reimburse Eventbrite for all such cost and expenses that Eventbrite paid and that you would have been obligated to pay under the AAA rules.
ii.
Payment of Legal Fees.
Just as in any court proceeding, each party will initially bear its own attorneys' fees and expenses in connection with any arbitration.
Should either party be determined to have substantially prevailed in the arbitration, then upon such party's request, the arbitrator will award such prevailing party the reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses that it incurred in connection with the arbitration, provided that to the extent that the dispute or claim relate to your personal or household use of the Services (rather than business use) Eventbrite will not seek to recover its attorneys' fees and expenses in an arbitration initiated by you.
The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the reimbursement of attorneys' fees and expenses upon request from either party made within fourteen (14) days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.
(j) Future Changes.Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, you and Eventbrite agree that if Eventbrite makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) Eventbrite will provide you with notice of such change and you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above.
By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision as unmodified by such rejected change.
(k) Special Severability.In the event that any provisions of this Section 9 are found to be invalid or unenforceable for any dispute or claim, then, the entirety of this Section 9 will be null and void with respect to such dispute or claim and Section 23 will apply in lieu of this Section 9.
(l) Opt Out.You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration or class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending (from the email address we associate with you as a User) written notice of your decision to opt-out to ebmail{legal@eventbrite.com=>mailto:legal@eventbrite.com?subject=ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT&body=Add your request here.}, with the subject line, "ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT." The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of your first use of the Services or your agreement to these Terms (whichever is later).
otherwise, you will be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those paragraphs.
Note that if you opt out of these arbitration provisions, Eventbrite also will not be bound by them.

(d) Without limiting the generality of any release provided under these Terms of Service, as a material inducement to Eventbrite permitting you to access and use the Services, you hereby agree to release Eventbrite, and its affiliates and subsidiaries, and each of its and their respective parent companies, subsidiaries, officers, affiliates, representatives, shareholders, contractors, directors, agents, partners and employees from all damages (whether direct, indirect, incidental, consequential or otherwise), losses, liabilities, costs and expenses of every kind and nature, including, without limitation, attorneys' fees, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with your or your affiliates' Licensure, any failure to obtain or maintain any Licensure, or any error in obtaining or maintaining any Licensure.

Fees and Refunds.
14.1 Fees That We Charge.Creating an account, listing an event and accessing the Services are free.
However, we charge fees when you sell or buy paid tickets or registrations.
These fees may vary based on individual agreements between Eventbrite and certain Organizers.
Organizers ultimately determine whether these fees will be passed along to Consumers and shown as "Fees" on the applicable event page or absorbed into the ticket or registration price and paid by the Organizer out of ticket and registration gross proceeds.
The fees charged to Consumers may include certain other charges, including without limitation, facility fees, royalties, taxes, processing fees and fulfillment fees.
Therefore, the fees paid by Consumers for an event are not necessarily the same as those charged by Eventbrite to the applicable Organizer or the standard fees described on the Services to Organizers.
In addition, certain fees are meant, on average, to defray certain costs incurred by Eventbrite, but may in some cases include an element of profit and in some cases include an element of loss.
Eventbrite does not control (and thus cannot disclose) fees levied by your bank and/or credit card company, including fees for purchasing tickets and registrations in foreign currencies or from foreign persons.
Be sure to check with your bank or credit card company prior to engaging in a transaction to understand all applicable fees, credit card surcharges and currency conversion rates.
14.2 Ticket Transfers.If you wish to transfer tickets to an event you have purchased on Eventbrite, in some instances Eventbrite may be able to accommodate this for you.
In all other instances, please contact the Organizer of the event to arrange for ticket transfer.
If you are unable to reach the Organizer, or the Organizer is unable to arrange a ticket transfer, please contact us.
14.3 Refunds.Because all transactions are between an Organizer and its respective attendees, Eventbrite asks that all Consumers contact the applicable Organizer of their event with any refund requests.
You can find help with getting a refund here.
(a) If you are a Consumer, you acknowledge that should you receive a refund for your ticket, you will discard any ticket that we or any Organizer has delivered, and will not use it (or any copy of it) to attend the event.
Violation of the foregoing constitutes fraud.
You acknowledge that the applicable procedure to check the validity of the ticket must always be followed.
Eventbrite will not be held liable under any circumstances for any costs arisen from non-compliance by Organizers with applicable procedures that must be implemented by Organizers to check validity of tickets.
Eventbrite will not be held liable under any circumstances for costs and/or damage associated with tickets arisen from situations with fraud and/or for damage associated with the purchase of the ticket through non-official means, such as third parties.
(b) If you are an Organizer, you acknowledge that the applicable procedure to check the validity of the ticket must always be followed.
Eventbrite will not be held liable under any circumstances for any costs arisen from non-compliance by Organizers with applicable procedures that must be implemented by Organizers to check validity of tickets.
Eventbrite will not be held liable under any circumstances for costs and/or damage associated with tickets arisen from situations with fraud and/or for damage associated with the purchase of the ticket through non-official means, such as third parties. 15-16 15.
