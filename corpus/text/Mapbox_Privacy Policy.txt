Your rights under the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA)

California consumers have the following rights:

to not receive discriminatory treatment by Mapbox for the exercise of privacy rights conferred by the CCPA;
to request to know the personal information Mapbox has about you.
You may access personal information associated with your Mapbox account, such as username, email address, and associated account activity by logging into your Mapbox account.
If you do not have a Mapbox account, it will not be possible for Mapbox to verify your identity to a reasonably high degree of certainty to permit disclosure of specific pieces of information, as Mapbox only has limited personal information about non-accountholders.
and
to request deletion of their personal information collected or maintained by Mapbox.

In order to submit a verifiable consumer request to delete your information, you must do the following:

If you have a Mapbox account, login to your Mapbox account, go to Settings, and click âDelete accountâ and follow the instructions.
Mapbox uses your request while you are logged in to verify that you are the account holder.
If you do not login to your Mapbox account to make this request, information associated with your Mapbox account will not be deleted.
You may, without logging into your Mapbox account, request deletion of your email address and associated personal information (if any) through this form.
Mapbox will email you a confirmation link at the email you provide in order to verify the request.
You must click on this confirmation link in the verification email Mapbox sends you to verify the email belongs to you before Mapbox can process your request.
A request through this form will only request to delete personal information from non-account-related sources (such as the list of emails we send newsletters to).
To delete account-related information, you must login to your Mapbox account to verify your identity. 
If you believe Mapbox has any personal information about you that is not account-related and not an email address and associated information, please email Mapbox at privacy@mapbox.com describing in detail the information you believe Mapbox has and how you believe Mapbox obtained it.
Please note that without an email address, it may not be possible for Mapbox to verify your identity to a reasonable degree of certainty to locate or delete any information.
Alternatively, you may call 1 (833) 732-4082 and leave a voicemail requesting deletion of personal information.
In your voicemail, leave your email address, if you have one.
You must still complete the verification steps described above in order for Mapbox to verify your identity.

It is our firm belief that we do not and will not âsellâ your personal information.
Nonetheless, if you donât agree with our opinion, you are welcome to complete this form and you will be opted out of disclosure to third parties that are not our service providers.
(If you also want to opt out of third-party cookies on our website, you can do so using your browserâs cookie preferences.
More information is available here.) Law Enforcement and Transparency
âIn General: Although we acknowledge that government sometimes must act to protect citizens' safety and security, we strongly believe that current laws regulating surveillance of individuals and access to user information need to be reformed.
We have signed the Stop Watching Us petition and supports the principles of the Reform Government Surveillance open letter to Congress.
We post anonymized information about all law enforcement requests in our transparency report.
Mapbox has never received a national security letter, FISA court order, or any other classified request for user information.
If we ever receive such a request, we will review it carefully and make sure it follows the law (including the Fourth Amendment).
If we believe a request is overly broad, we will seek to narrow it.
If we have a good faith belief that there is an emergency involving the danger of death or severe physical injury, we may disclose limited information necessary to prevent that harm.ââ


Account Information, Hosted Data, Store Data and Payment Information: We require a subpoena or court order to provide information about your account, such as the name associated with the account, means of payment, and length of service.
If we are ever forced to share identifiable information about you, we'll notify you with the full details of the request before we disclose it unless we are legally prohibited from doing so by law or court order.â


Website Logs, Cookies, APIs and Mobile SDKs: We will only disclose information collected through our Services, including maps and associated data and location information, in response to a subpoena or court order.
