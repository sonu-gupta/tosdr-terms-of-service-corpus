General information

This section of the privacy statement contains information on the scope of validity, the person responsible for data processing, the data protection officer and data security.
It also begins with a list of definitions of important terms used in the data privacy statement.

1.
Definition of main terms

Browser: Computer program used to display websites (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

Cookies: Text files which the web server places on the userâs computer by means of the browser which is used.
The stored cookie information may contain both an identifier (cookie ID) for recognition purposes and content data, such as login status or information about websites visited.
The browser sends the cookie information back to the web server with each new request upon subsequent repeat visits to these sites.
Most browsers accept cookies automatically.
Cookies can be managed using the browser functions (usually under âOptionsâ or âSettingsâ).
The storage of cookies may be disabled in this way or it may be made dependent on the userâs approval in any given case or otherwise restricted.
Cookies may also be deleted at any time.

GDPR: Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), available at http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679

Personal data: Any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.
An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.

Profiling: Any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyze or predict aspects concerning that natural personâs performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behavior, location or movements.

Services: Our offers to which this data privacy statement applies (cf.
Scope of validity).

Tracking: The collection of data and their evaluation regarding the behavior of visitors in response to our services.

Tracking technologies: Actions can be tracked either via the activity records (log files) stored on our web servers or by collecting data from end devices via pixels, cookies or similar tracking technologies.

Processing: Any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.

Pixel: Pixels are also called tracking pixels, web beacons or web bugs.
These are small, invisible graphics in HTML emails or on websites.
When a document is opened, this small image is downloaded from a server on the Internet and the download is registered there.
This allows the operator of the server to see if and when an email has been opened or a website has been visited.
This function is usually carried out by calling up a small program (JavaScript).
Certain types of information can be detected on your computer system in this way and shared, such as the content of cookies, the time and date of the visit, and a description of the page on which the tracking pixel is located.
2.
Scope of validity
This data privacy statement applies to the following properties:

the websites of Ghostery, Inc, most notably those available at www.ghostery.com
whenever reference is made to this data privacy statement from one of our properties (e.g., websites, subdomains, mobile applications, web services or integrations in third-party websites), regardless of the way in which it is accessed or used

All these properties are also collectively referred to as âservicesâ.
3.

II.
Itemization of data processing operations

This section of the data privacy statement contains detailed information about the processing of personal data in the context of our services.
The information is subdivided for greater clarity into certain functions in connection with our services.
In case of the normal use of the services, different functions and therefore also different processing operations can be implemented consecutively or simultaneously.

1.
General information about the data processing operations
The following applies to all the processing operations listed below, unless stated otherwise:
a.
No obligation to provide personal data &amp.
consequences of failure to provide such data
The provision of personal data is not required by law or contract, and you are under no obligation to provide any data.
We will inform you during the data entry process when personal information needs to be provided for the relevant service (e.g., by indicating âmandatory fieldsâ).
In cases where the provision of data is required, the consequence of not providing data will be that the service in question cannot be provided.
Otherwise, failure to provide data may result in our inability to provide our services in the same form and quality.
b.
Consent
In various cases, you may also grant us your consent to the further processing of data (or some of the data, where applicable) in connection with the operations listed below.
In this case, we will inform you separately in connection with the submission of the respective declaration of consent about all the procedures and the scope of the consent and about the purposes which we pursue in these processing operations.
The processing operations based on your consent are therefore not listed again here (Art.
13, subs.
4, GDPR).
c.
Transfer of personal data to third countries
Ghostery is a corporation of the United States, which is considered a âthird countryâ by the GDPR, i.e., a country outside the European Union.
The data transmitted to and within the United States and other third countries are transmitted strictly in compliance with the statutory conditions of admissibility.
If the transmission of the data to a third country does not serve the purpose of fulfilling our contract with you, if we do not have your consent, if the transmission is not required for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, and if no other exemption applies under Art.
49 GDPR, we will only transmit your data to a third country if in possession of an adequacy decision pursuant to Art.
45 GDPR or appropriate safeguards under Art.
46 GDPR.
One of these adequacy decisions is the Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2016/1250 of 12.07.2016 on the âEU-US Privacy Shieldâ for the USA.
The level of data protection is generally considered to be appropriate according to Art.
45 GDPR for transfers to companies which are certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield.
Alternatively or additionally, safeguards under Art.
46 subs.
2 c) GDPR through the conclusion of the EU standard data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission with the receiving body provide appropriate safeguards and an adequate level of data protection.
Copies of the standard EU data protection clauses are available on the website of the European Commission at https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en.
d.
Hosting at external service providers
Our data processing work is carried out to a large extent with the involvement of hosting service providers who provide us with storage space and processing capacities at their data centers and who also process personal data on our behalf according to our instructions.
It may be the case that personal data are transmitted to hosting service providers in respect of all of the functions listed below.
These service providers process data either exclusively in the EU or subject to guaranteed levels of data protection which we have put in place based on the standard EU data protection clauses (cf.
subsection c.).
e.
Transmission to government authorities
We send personal information to government authorities (including law enforcement agencies) when required to fulfil a legal obligation to which we are subject (legal basis: Art.
6, subs.
1 c), GDPR) or when it is necessary for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims (legal basis: Art.
6, subs.
1 f), GDPR).
f.
Period of storage
The time specified in the âperiod of storageâ paragraph indicates how long we use the data for the purposes in any given case.
At the end of this period, the data will no longer be processed by us but will be deleted at regular intervals, unless continued processing and storage are required by law (in particular, because it is necessary to fulfil a legal obligation or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims) or unless you grant us extended consent.
