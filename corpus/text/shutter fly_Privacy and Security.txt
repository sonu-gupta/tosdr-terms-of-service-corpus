Social Media

If you log into your account with any of our brands through a social media site, we will also have access to certain information from that site, such as your name, account information and profile photo, in accordance with the siteâs account verification procedures.
If you subsequently want to unlink your social media account, please contact customer service or use available tools on the site.

If you choose to âlikeâ or share content, information about you may be publicly displayed on the social network, depending on your privacy settings.
If you post information on a social media or another third-party service that references our brands or our products and services (e.g., via a Twitter hashtag), we may publish your post on our social media accounts or websites.
For more information about the privacy practices of any social media sites that you may use to log in to your account or to interact with our brands, you should review the privacy notice of that social media site and check your privacy settings through that site.

Professional Photography by Lifetouch

Lifetouch provides professional photography services to businesses, sports leagues, and other organizations across the United States and Canada.
When an organization you (or your child) are affiliated with (for example, your childâs sports league, your university, or your employer) engages Lifetouch to photograph you (or your family members), that organization may provide basic roster information about the people who will be photographed to help us facilitate Picture Day and process and fulfill product orders.
We limit the information we collect to only what is necessary for Picture Day and other related purposes authorized by your organization (such as creating a yearbook).&nbsp.
We collect this basic information to match names to the pictures we take and for efficient distribution within the organization.&nbsp.
We may also receive your email or mailing address in order to deliver Picture Day-related communications on behalf of your organization.&nbsp.
In those cases, we do not retain or use your contact information for any other purpose unless you become our customer by purchasing our products, or if you opt in to receive updates and promotional offers from us.
We may also collect your information in order to incorporate it into other items that we are providing to your organization.
For example, a directory that we produce for your employer or your university may have your contact information or other information about you.&nbsp.
Your organization controls how much, or how little, information is used in producing these items, and your organization is solely responsible for obtaining any consents necessary for Lifetouch to provide its services and produce those items.
If you have any questions about what information your organization shares with Lifetouch for Picture Day or for use in any products provided to your organization, please contact your organization directly.
If your childâs Pre K-12 school engages Lifetouch for school Picture Day, see the section titled For Pre K-12 Educators and Parents for more information.

How do we share your information with third parties? 
We do not sell, license or share the personal information we collect with unaffiliated third parties for their marketing purposes.&nbsp.
We may share personal information in the following situations.

Our service providers may receive your name and contact information, payment information, photos and other content you upload to our Sites and Apps, information about purchases youâve made, cookies and other device identifiers, IP address, and website browsing and interaction activity.
These service providers are only allowed to use your information in connection with the specific service they provide on our behalf.

Partners and Affiliates

We also work with third party retail partners such as JCPenney when we operate professional photography studios within their stores, and if you are photographed in these studios, we will share your information with our retail partner.&nbsp.
If Lifetouch photographs you or your child pursuant to a contract with a school, business or other organization you are affiliated with, Lifetouch will share your information with that organization as necessary to fulfill its contractual obligations.

Law Enforcement, Mergers, and Other Situations

We may be required to share your personal information in other, limited circumstances.
For example, we may be required to share certain information to respond to a subpoena or similar judicial process, to comply with state, federal or local laws, to protect the security or integrity of our databases or website, to take precautions against liability, in the event of a corporate reorganization or, to the extent required by law, to provide information to law enforcement agencies.
If necessary, we may also share information with law enforcement without a subpoena or similar judicial process if doing so may help protect the personal safety of a customer, a photo subject, or members of the public.
We reserve the right to report to the appropriate law enforcement or government agencies any information that we believe may be evidence of criminal activity or violation of any applicable law.

Additionally, your information may be transferred to another organization if, for example, we transfer the ownership or operation of the Sites and Apps because we have merged with or have been acquired by another organization, or if we liquidate our assets.
In those cases, the new companyâs use of your information will still be subject to this Notice and the privacy preferences you have expressed to us.
We may also share Lifetouch school photographs with law enforcement in accordance with our SmileSafeÂ® child safety program.
See the section titled For Pre K-12 Educators and Parents for more information about the SmileSafe program. Does our website collect information from children? Our Sites and Apps are intended for use by general audiences and are not targeted directly at children.

There may be times when we are unable to fulfill your request â for example, if providing access to your personal information would reveal confidential commercial or proprietary information or personal information about someone else (and we cannot separate your data), if we are prohibited by law from disclosing the information, or if we have a legal obligation to retain certain data.
We may require additional personal information from you for the purposes of verifying your identity and rights.

Shutterfly


The photos and other content that you upload to your Shutterfly account (âYour Contentâ) may include personal information about you or others, and this section of our Privacy Center addresses frequently asked questions about Your Content.

Do you share the photos that I upload to Shutterfly? 

At Shutterfly, we value the trust you place in us when you store Your Content on our platform, and we can assure you that we treat Your Content as private information that belongs to you.&nbsp.
We share your photos only in the following circumstances:



If you ask us to.
 Enabling you to share your photos electronically is one of the key benefits we offer at Shutterfly.
You are able to send an email invitation to your selected recipients, and then allow them to view, save, or purchase products from your pictures.
This email invitation contains a link created specifically for your pictures.
Similarly, if you choose to share your photo albums through Shutterfly Share Sites, you may invite recipients to participate in that site and those people will also have access to the photos on that Share Site.


Order fulfillment.
 In order to provide our service, the Shutterfly employees and agents who work to fulfill your order and service your account may see your Content in the course of performing their jobs.&nbsp.
Similarly, if you order a product that includes Your Content, we may share Your Content with third party partners who help us fulfill your order.
These parties are only allowed to use your photos to perform services for Shutterfly, though â they canât use them for any other purpose.


Can
I upload videos from YouTube to my Share Site? What information does Shutterfly
share with YouTube?

If you use Shutterflyâs Share Sites, you have the option to upload videos from YouTube to your Share Site.
We do not share your personal data with YouTube.
Instead, we share only your search terms you use to find the video to download through YouTubeâs API Services.
But, if you are curious, YouTube is owned by Google, and you can view Googleâs privacy policy here .&nbsp.


Does Shutterfly use my photos in advertisements?

No, Shutterfly does not use your photos in our advertisements.
Photos you upload to Shutterfly may be incorporated into product recommendations that appear on your Shutterfly homepage or in communications we send to you, but these photos arenât used in public advertising, and only you will receive customized product recommendations made using your photos.
You may opt out of receiving such communications from us and change your contact preferences within your account at any time.

Does Shutterfly collect information from my photos and projects? If so, how do you use it?&nbsp.





What we collect.
 When you upload your photos to our platform or give us permission to access the photos stored on your device, your photo content may also include related image information such as the time and the place your photo was taken and similar âmetadataâ captured by your image capture device.
If you wish to restrict the capture of image metadata in your individual photos, please adjust the settings on your image capture device.


How we use it

. We may analyze your photo content and metadata to help you tag and organize your photos and to make personalized product suggestions to you based on those photos, such as showing you how your pictures may look in a collage or other Shutterfly product.&nbsp.
We may send you reminders and suggestions based on the information you include in your projects, such as birthdays and anniversaries.



Face grouping.

As you add new photos, we automatically associate similar faces (if you have the face grouping feature enabled), places and other image characteristics within your photo collection.
If you have the face grouping feature enabled, when you upload photos of yourself, friends, family or others, we create a numerical representation of the faces detected in your photos and automatically group similar faces together.
We only use this feature to help you organize, tag and create personalized products from your own photos.
We never attempt to determine whether any similar faces appear in photos uploaded by different Shutterfly users or otherwise identify the people in your photos.
We do not sell or share this information with third parties.
And we wonât suggest any tags for your own photos except the ones that you choose to create for your own face groups.
You may disable this feature through your account settings at any time.
If you do so, we will delete any facial grouping data associated with your photos from our servers and will not collect such information going forward.
if you use the Shutterfly App on a mobile device, face grouping data is stored on your device, and will be deleted the next time you sign into the App.
If your account information indicates that you are a resident of Illinois, we will delete face grouping data when it has been more than three years since your last interaction with Shutterfly.
If you have face grouping enabled, you are representing to us that you have obtained consent for the feature from the people who appear in your photos or, if they are under the age of 18, from their parent or legal guardian.



How long does Shutterfly keep my photos?  What are my options?

A key benefit of the Shutterfly offering is the preservation of all of your memories in one simple spot â for free.
By default, Shutterfly will never delete your pictures, unless you instruct us to do so.&nbsp.
As a Shutterfly account holder, you control what is retained in your account and how long your account remains active.
If you delete Shutterfly photos from your account, they will be removed from your Shutterfly app and web interface immediately, and we will permanently delete them from our system in the regular course of business.



Lifetouch Professional Photography


The following frequently asked questions relate to Lifetouch professional photographs taken in portrait studios, schools, businesses and other organizations that Lifetouch serves.

Does Lifetouch use pictures of customers in advertisements?

Not without permission of the photo subject.
Lifetouch is proud of its work as a professional photographer, and from time to time we request permission from our customers to display their photos as samples of our work.&nbsp.
Lifetouch does not use its customersâ photographs in marketing or advertising materials to third parties without first obtaining a photo release from the photo subject (or, in the case of a minor, the photo subjectâs parent or legal representative). 

Does Lifetouch share my childâs school photos with my childâs school?&nbsp.


Yes â schools and preschools across the United States and Canada entrust Lifetouch to photograph students and staff as part of the time-honored tradition of Picture Day.&nbsp.
Lifetouch provides those photos to the school for use in the school yearbook, student IDs, classroom seating charts and other school-related purposes.&nbsp.
Lifetouch also offers the photographs for purchase by parents. 

How long does Lifetouch keep photos?&nbsp.
What are my options?

When Lifetouch is engaged by a school or other organization as its official photographer, the photos we capture for that organization are deleted in the ordinary course of business within a reasonable time after we have fulfilled our contractual obligations, with the exception of photos associated with customers who elect to purchase from us (Lifetouch Customers).&nbsp.
If you are a Lifetouch Customer, our goal is to make the photos we create available to you for years to come, and we will endeavor to retain a digital copy of one or more of your current and future source photos for you to claim and archive in your Shutterfly account indefinitely, if you choose to do so.
For example, if you purchase your childâs first grade school photo, and Lifetouch photographs your child the following year, we may associate that photo with you and make the digital image available to you to purchase and store in your Shutterfly account.
If you wish, you can take steps to have your photos deleted from our systems earlier, by contacting us at (800) 736-4753.
 We may require certain information from you to validate your request before deletion.&nbsp.
Please be aware, however, that Lifetouch may deny your request and retain your photos under certain limited circumstances â for example, if we have a contractual commitment to a school or other organization you are affiliated with (such as providing yearbook photos or the yearbook itself), if doing so would violate a law or court order, or if it would be unreasonably burdensome.&nbsp.
Also, please be aware that, if you shared your photo with other purchasers, your photo deletion request will not affect any photos retained in othersâ photo libraries or those purchasersâ archiving preferences.

Do I need a Shutterfly account to purchase school photos? 

No.&nbsp.
You may purchase traditional printed school photos from Lifetouch for delivery to you through your childâs school.&nbsp.
However, if you purchase a digital image or are eligible to receive a digital image through a promotion or loyalty program, you will need a Shutterfly account to claim such digital images.&nbsp.
As a part of the Shutterfly family of brands, Lifetouch delivers all digital images to customers via the Shutterfly.com secure photo platform.

What is the SmileSafeÂ® â A Lifetouch Program child safety program? 

Lifetouch provides complimentary SmileSafe photo ID cards to the families of each Pre K-12 student photographed in participating schools, at no extra cost and regardless of whether the family has purchased photographs.
We work in collaboration with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), the United Statesâ leading experts in child protection.
If a child is missing, the parent or guardian of that child can request through NCMEC that a Lifetouch photograph of their child be provided to aid search efforts.
Lifetouch does not share its photographs with law enforcement unless a parent or guardian has expressly requested us do so in accordance with our SmileSafe child safety program or on an exceptional basis pursuant to legal process.
 Lifetouch will respond on a 24/7 basis to aid search efforts.
As of the date this Notice was last updated, Lifetouch has assisted with more than 2,000 searches and has contributed to the successful recovery of 56 children from 24 states as a direct result of the SmileSafe child safety program.
Click here for more information about this exceptional child safety program.  For PreK-12 Educators and Parents Since 1936, Lifetouch has been a trusted provider of school services, providing photography services to schools and families across the United States and Canada.&nbsp.
Lifetouch photographs children by agreement with the schools we work with.&nbsp.
We offer time-honored Picture Day products to the families of children we photograph while fulfilling a necessary role at no charge to the school. 
In preparation for Picture Day, Lifetouch requires certain basic information from your childâs school record, such as name, grade and homeroom teacher name.&nbsp.
Below are a number of Frequently Asked Questions (âFAQsâ) regarding the basic information that Lifetouch needs in order to provide its photography services.&nbsp.
These FAQs are intended to provide answers to questions that you may have about Lifetouchâs use of such information and to demonstrate Lifetouchâs commitment to your childâs privacy and security. 


What student personal data does Lifetouch receive from schools?&nbsp.



The information we need for Picture Day depends upon the specific services and deliverables Lifetouch is providing your school.
We limit the information we collect to only that which is necessary for Picture Day and related authorized school purposes.&nbsp.
We collect the basic information in advance of Picture Day to match names to the pictures we take and for efficient distribution within the school.&nbsp.
We may receive your email or mailing address in order to deliver Picture Day-related communications on behalf of the school.&nbsp.
In such cases, we do not retain or use your contact information for any other purpose unless you opt in to receive updates and promotional offers from us.
In addition, the information may be incorporated into other items that we are providing to your school.&nbsp.
For example, if Lifetouch is producing student ID cards, we need the student ID number to do the job.
Our yearbook image product includes images of students sorted by name, grade and other classifying data per your schoolâs requirements.&nbsp.
Schools ultimately decide how much, or how little, information is used in producing School Service Items. &nbsp.
Lifetouch never has access to sensitive information, such as grades or attendance data, from your childâs record.


How does Lifetouch use the information it receives from schools?


As part of our agreement with your childâs school, Lifetouch provides various services that support the schoolâs administrative needs, which may include student ID cards for lunch, library and transportation purposes and digital images for the school to use for student recognition, awards, teacher tools, yearbooks, memory books and class composites.&nbsp.
These services are provided throughout the school year.&nbsp.
Lifetouch uses the basic information that it collects solely as necessary to produce such items for the school, to deliver Picture Day-related notices on behalf of your school, and to provide you opportunities to purchase your childâs school pictures. 

**Lifetouch does not sell, trade or share student data collected from your childâs school with third parties for their marketing purposes, nor do we use such data in ways that are unrelated to the purposes authorized by the school.
Lifetouch will never sell student photos or yearbooks to a third party for resale.** 

Lifetouch retains the basic information it collects from schools only as necessary and permissible to promote the sale of school pictures to parents, to retrieve the images to supply picture orders and to support the school for an approved administrative purpose.&nbsp.
Once such data is no longer needed for such purposes, it is securely destroyed.&nbsp.
While retained, it remains under Lifetouchâs control and treated as confidential information. 


What are my options as a parent?


In its role as official school photographer, Lifetouch photographs all students who appear at the camera on Picture Day, and we rely on your childâs school or district to obtain any parental consents necessary for us to do the work they engaged us for.&nbsp.
Our photographers reasonably presume that they are permitted to photograph each individual who appears at the camera for that purpose.&nbsp.
If you are a parent who does not want your child to participate in your schoolâs Picture Day, you must pre-arrange with the school not to have your child photographed. 
Lifetouch acknowledges its obligations as a service provider to your school for student and staff photography pursuant to the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (âFERPAâ).&nbsp.
Your school retains the authority to control Lifetouchâs use of the information it provides to Lifetouch and to require its return or destruction at any time. &nbsp.
We will honor a parentâs image deletion request, subject to verification and authorization of the school when deletion would impact our ability to deliver an item or service requested by the school. 
If you choose to purchase your childâs school photos from Lifetouch, the personal information you provide to us will be treated as customer information and used as described in our Privacy Notice.
 Unless purchased by a parent (or by someone with whom the parent has shared the photo), however, we retain school photos only as long as necessary to satisfy our obligations to the schools we serve.
