Unless we are obliged to do so through a legal process, we will not release the information in the Counter-Notification to the Claimant or the Claimantâs representative or representatives.

A description of where the alleged infringing material is (or was, if we have disabled access to it) located on the Site, including at least one Internet address, and with enough detail that we may find it on the Site;
