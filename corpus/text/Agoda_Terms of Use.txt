Scope of our Services


A.
Accommodation Reservation Facilitation

Through the Site, Agoda provides an online platform through which you can browse different types of lodging and temporary accommodation, including but not necessarily limited to hotels, hostels, serviced apartments, B&Bs, rooms for rent, cottages, ryokans, etc.
(collectively, the âAccommodation(s)â) and request to make reservations with such Accommodations, including already making payment for such reservations of Accommodations in advance with a credit card, debit card, e-wallet, or such other payment method to facilitate the processing of such payment (âPayment Instrumentâ).
By making a booking through the Site for the Accommodation, you make an offer to book a reservation at the price listed for such reservation and such other terms and conditions stated on the Site.
This shall become a binding contract formed in Singapore pursuant to the Terms of Use when accepted by the Accommodation and consequently Agoda.
You will receive proof of the confirmed Accommodation booking via an e-mail confirmation (with a voucher for prepaid Accommodations),which means the reservation has been confirmed by the Accommodation.
The âthank you pageâ means your reservation request has been received and is complete for final processing, no further action is required by you.
We reserve the right to reject bookings as set out below.
When rendering our services, the information that we disclose about Accommodations is based on the information provided to us by our suppliers or providers (including but not necessarily limited to the Accommodations, their representatives, distributors, destination management companies (DMCs), channel managers, partners, etc.).
As such, the Accommodations or their representatives are given access to an extranet or other connectivity solution through which they are fully responsible for updating all rates, availability, description, pictures, booking conditions, accommodation policies and other information which is displayed on the Site.
Although we will use commercially reasonable skill and care in performing our services we will not verify if, and cannot guarantee that, all information is accurate, complete, correct or up to date, nor can we be held responsible for any errors (including manifest and typographical errors), interruptions (whether due to any (temporary and/or partial) breakdown, repair, upgrade or maintenance of the Site or otherwise), inaccurate, misleading or untrue information or non-delivery of information.
Each Accommodation remains responsible at all times for the accuracy, completeness and correctness of the Accommodation information displayed on the Site.
Changes in market conditions or circumstances may occur on short notice which may make information displayed on the Site inaccurate or outdated.
In case of problems, our Customer Service will use its commercially reasonable efforts to assist you and serve as a point of contact with the Accommodation.
Please note that Agoda is one of many channels Accommodations use to make their inventory available for reservation.
When a search result indicates that a particular Accommodation has no more rooms available, that means the room type is not available for reservation through Agoda.
The Site does not constitute and should not be regarded as a recommendation or endorsement of (the quality, service level or rating of) any Accommodation listed on the Site.
We hereby expressly disclaim any representation, warranty or undertaking in relation to the quality, status or adequacy of any Accommodation listed on the Site.
The Accommodations can be ranked on the Site according to different criteria (star rating, reviews, etc.).
The default ranking is based on an automated algorithm which may be updated or amended from time to time, and which takes into account different factors including but not necessarily limited to availability, promotions and rates, historical popularity, money earned by Agoda, conversion (the ratio of reservations made to Site visits), sales of room nights, cancellations, quality of content, guest review scores, star ratings etc.
Agoda currently has a âPreferred Partnerâ program whereby certain selected Accommodations have the opportunity to improve their visibility on the Site.
Such Preferred Partner listings will be marked or contain wording for clarity.
Under certain circumstances, Agoda may also offer Accommodations the option of sponsored listings, i.e.
to pay for a top spot.
Such sponsored listings will be marked or contain wording for clarity.
To the extent permitted by applicable law, we reserve the right to, and our discretion, refuse or cancel bookings in exceptional cases and will notify you of the refusal or cancellation by email to the address you provided when you made your booking.
Typical reasons for rejecting or cancelling a booking include, but are not limited to: Accommodation or Partner request(s), actual or suspected reselling of Accommodations booked through the Site on an individual or mass basis without our prior written approval (âResellingâ), breach of the Terms of Use, force majeure events, trade or economic sanctions, embargoes, legal restrictions, (suspicions of) fraud or theft, suspected criminal activity, suspicious bookings, submission by you of misleading or erroneous information, Payment Instrument problems, inappropriate behavior, threats, insults, violence, refusal to supply information, practical obstacles, communication problems, obvious errors (see below), history, blacklisting by governments or international organizations (USA, EU, UN, Singapore), etc.
If your booking is rejected or cancelled by Agoda and a payment has already been made, you will receive a refund of the total booking value, (except in the case of unauthorized Reselling or in any other appropriate case such as unauthorized use of the Site or there is an inappropriate manner in the use of the Site, and such use is harmful to us for which the refund of the total booking value or any part thereof is not justifiable).
Refunds will not be issued in the event of unauthorized Reselling due to many negative factors including the disadvantage such practice imposes on our authorized and contracted affiliate partners, Accommodations who provide Agoda with inventory on a contracted and trusted basis and the loss and negative brand impact caused to Agoda due to unauthorized Resellers attempting to undercut Agodaâs business which may include placing the resold inventory on sites run by competitors of Agoda without our knowledge.
We also reserve the right to bar (âblacklistâ) users from the Site, on a permanent or temporary basis, at our discretion.
Any such blacklisted user must not attempt to use the Site under any other name or through any other user.
See also the section below under the heading Payment - Credit Card â âBook Now, Pay Laterâ â Age â Fraud for more information about our fraud prevention mechanisms.


In rare cases, we may also have to cancel or reject a booking or make adjustments due to âobvious errorsâ, independent of the origin of such errors.
For clarity, an obvious error is a mistake on the Site (e.g.
in terms of price, conditions, points) which a reasonable person would not consider to be normal.
If your booking is affected by an obvious error, we will notify you by email at the address you provided when you made the booking and will adjust the booking or awarded points as appropriate, and will, if  relevant, refund some or all of the amount charged.
Please note that suspected group bookings can also be rejected or cancelled by Agoda or the Accommodation as most Accommodations have specific procedures for group bookings.
Contact our Customer Service team for more information.
Circumstances such as ongoing renovations, Accommodation booking errors, and specific guest needs can affect the quality of your stay.
Be sure to let the Accommodation know any special requests or requirements you have at check-in.

A word about star ratings

The Accommodation star, other denoted ratings, or any reference on the Site to a rating on the Site (âAccommodation Ratingsâ) are provided for your information only and are only provided in relation to the Accommodation.
The Accommodation Ratings are based on information we have received from our suppliers, including the Accommodations, and may take into account the Accommodationâs facilities, rates, reviews, and services.
Accommodation Ratings are unrelated to any other ratings assigned by government tourism authorities.
We do not independently verify star ratings.
A star rating is only indicative of the level of comfort you can expect to find in a particular Accommodation, with a higher star rating generally being indicative of a higher level of comfort and amenities.
For more detailed information, please check the detailed description on the Site.
Please be aware that star ratings can vary greatly on the basis of location, available alternatives, local market conditions, practices or other circumstances.
Thus, it is possible that a star rating in one particular country or city is not comparable to the same star rating in another country or city due to such circumstances.
Star ratings do not necessarily reflect all the amenities or services that might be available at an Accommodation, and some amenities and features may not be available in every room or at every property with a particular star rating.
If there are particular amenities or features that are important to you, please contact our Customer Service and inquire as to the availability of such amenities or features.
Ratings and reviews for Ancillary Services are not covered by this section and are addressed in B.
Other Ancillary Services below.

Other Ancillary Services

Although the Agoda Site provides the platform for which you can browse and make reservations for these Ancillary Services, the Ancillary Services are provided by third parties, Agoda associated companies or partners (âPartnersâ), which have been selected by Agoda.
For example, flight display, search and reservation services on the Agoda Site are currently provided by Booking Holdings Inc.
companies KAYAK or priceline.com and their respective suppliers.
The identity of each of our Partners will be displayed on the Site when browsing the Ancillary Services and a link provided to the Partnerâs terms and conditions of use and/or privacy policy, which will govern the relationship between you and our Partner for the relevant Ancillary Service reservation.
We may be paid a fee or commission if you make a reservation for Ancillary Services.
By making a booking through the Site for the Ancillary Services, you make an offer to book a reservation (e.g.
for flights or a rental car) at the price listed for such reservation on the Site, and on such other terms and conditions notified to you by the Partner from time to time, which shall become a binding contract when your reservation is accepted by the Partner.
The Partner will indicate the acceptance of your Ancillary Service booking via an e-mail confirmation to you.
The Partner reserves the right to reject bookings as set out in their terms and conditions.
We also reserve the right to reject your booking for Ancillary Services in accordance with these terms of use.
We may display ratings for and reviews of Ancillary Services for your information only.
These are provided by the relevant Partner, which is responsible for the content of the ratings and reviews.
The ratings and rankings are subject to and governed by the Partnerâs terms and conditions.

Prices, Agoda Price Guarantee, Additional Charges, Taxes and Fees, Agoda exchange rates

Please note that, unless expressly indicated otherwise, all prices on the Site are for room reservations only, for the specified stay dates and number of people.
Without prejudice to what is set out below, before you confirm a reservation, Agoda will display the total price payable, including taxes and service fees, and what is included.
As you select options or specify additional details, we will update the total price.

A.
Prices and Best Price Guarantee for Accommodations

We strive to have the most competitive prices and we want you to pay the lowest price possible for your stay at an Accommodation.
Should you find your Accommodation room reservation, with the same booking conditions, at a lower price on the Internet after you have made a booking through us, we will match the difference between our price and the lower price under the terms and conditions of the Best Price Guarantee.
For a claim to be valid under this guarantee, it must satisfy and be submitted in compliance with all relevant terms and conditions of our Best Price Guarantee.

Sometimes cheaper rates are available on the Site for a specific stay at an Accommodation for the same room type, however, these rates made by Accommodations may carry special restrictions and conditions, for example in respect of cancellation and refund.
Please check the room type and rate details thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your reservation.
The same room type may have different rates, depending on such restrictions and conditions (see also section 6 below).
 The Best Price Guarantee does not apply to Ancillary Services provided on the Site.


B.
Additional Charges by Accommodations

 In addition to the reservation prices, some Accommodations will charge mandatory service fees, surcharges, and local taxes (for example, resort or amenity fees, transportation transfers, and city tourist tax).
If we are aware of these service fees and local taxes, we will display them with your reservation price.
These service fees and local taxes may be collected directly from you by the Accommodation, in addition to the price you pay for your reservation.
Standard room reservations are for single or double occupancy.
Extra guests or beds will usually incur extra charges.
An Accommodation may refuse to allow additional guests to stay in a room â you must specify the correct number of persons, including children who will occupy each room you reserve.

You will incur additional charges at the Accommodation for all services and products you use that are not included in the reservation price as expressly described by the booking conditions.
Charges for amenities you use and products you consume during your stay (for example, parking, internet access, food and drink) are not included in the reservation price unless specified.
During special events and periods, some Accommodations require each guest to purchase additional services (for example, a dinner on New Yearâs Eve).
If we are aware of a required additional service you must purchase, we will display it in the booking conditions or with your reservation price.
To travel to Accommodations in some locations (for example, islands in the Maldives), all guests must arrange transportation transfers in advance for an additional fee.
Some Accommodations require Agoda to collect payment for the transfer when a reservation is made.
We will show these additional transfer fees with your total price.
Agoda does not control or operate transfers, and is not responsible for the quality, safety, frequency, or service levels of the transportation.
 If you are unsure or concerned about additional charges, please verify with the Accommodation or Customer Service which extra fees (if any) are payable in addition to your reservation.

C.
Additional Charges for Ancillary Services

Please note that all prices on the Site for Ancillary Services are set by our Partners, unless otherwise indicated.
Please refer to the appropriate Partnerâs terms and conditions for any additional charges that may be applicable to your reservation (for example, airport tax).
Your reservation for, and any Ancillary Services you purchase, do not include insurance, unless expressly stated to include insurance.

D.
Currency Conversion 

The prices shown in Agoda listings are based on rates set by the properties in their Property Currency.
You may choose to view listing prices in the Property Currency or a different Display Currency.
If your payment card or account supports it, we may give you the option to select the Charge Currency before you pay for your booking.
Definitions



Account Currency means the default currency of the payment card or account you use to pay for a booking.

Charge Currency means the currency in which you are charged for a booking.

Display Currency means the currency in which you choose to view prices on our Site.&nbsp.


Property Currency means the currency in which the property or service provider sets the rates for their listings of accommodations or services on our Site and wishes to receive funds from Agoda.
By default, the Property Currency is the official currency in the territory where the property or service is located.

Indicated Rate â Bloomberg Generic Composite Rate mid-rate on the current day.

Daily Adjusted Rate â Bloomberg Generic Composite Rate on the day payment is processed plus a 5% currency conversion charge.


Account provider rates

If your Charge Currency is different from your payment account currency, your account provider will determine the exchange rate to use when the transaction is applied to your account.
Your account provider may offer a higher or lower rate than Agoda, and may charge you additional fees for a foreign transaction.
Agoda does not control or benefit from your account providerâs exchange rate or fees.

Agoda rates
 If your Charge Currency is the same as your Account Currency, but different from either the Property Currency or your Display Currency, Agoda will use our Indicated Rate or Daily Adjusted Rate to convert prices.
The applicable rate will depend on choices you select when viewing listings and making a booking, as described below.

Converted currency prices are indicative

If you choose a Display Currency that is different from the Property Currency, Agoda will display indicative prices converted using our Indicated Rate.
The converted Display Currency price is a preliminary estimate of the price in your Display Currency - it is not firm or binding.
The converted price in the Display Currency is provided for your convenience, to allow you to compare different rates, packages, and conditions in the currency you prefer to use.
Because room prices are set by properties in the Property Currency, the amount you pay for a booking will depend on three variables:

the Charge Currency ;
whether your booking is Pay Now, Book Now Pay Later, or Pay at Hotel;
the exchange rate between the Charge Currency and the Property Currency on the day we process your payment.


Pay Now bookings

If you change the Charge Currency , we will update your total price to show the amount we will process to your payment account.
We can do this because we know the exchange rate at that time.
If you choose a Charge Currency that is different from the Display Currency, Agoda will use the Daily Adjusted Rate to convert the amount.
For all other Pay Now transactions, we will use our Indicated Rate to convert currencies.

Book Now Pay Later bookings
 If your Charge Currency is different from the Property Currency or Display Currency, Agoda will use our Daily Adjusted Rate on your payment date to convert the Property Currency price to your Charge Currency.
If you change your Charge Currency , we will show you the price in the Property Currency that will be used to determine the total charge on your payment date and the estimated converted price that you will be charged based on the current Daily Adjusted Rate.
We do this because we do not know what the actual exchange rate will be on your payment date.

Pay at Hotel bookings
 When you make a Pay at Hotel booking, we will update your total price to show the amount you will pay in the Property Currency.
You will pay the Property directly, in the Property Currency or any other currency the Property agrees to accept.
If you pay in a different currency, or with a payment account that uses a different currency, the actual amount you pay will depend on the exchange rate(s) used by the Property and your payment providers.
These factors are outside of Agodaâs control.


A Word on Charges for Taxes and Fees

In connection with facilitating your Accommodation transaction, the charge to your Payment Instrument may include a charge for taxes and fees (âTaxes and Feesâ) unless indicated otherwise.
In relation to Accommodations, this charge includes an estimated amount to recover the amount Agoda pays to the Accommodation in connection with your reservation for taxes owed by the Accommodation including, without limitation, sales and use tax, occupancy tax, room tax, excise tax, value added tax and/or other similar taxes.
In certain locations, the tax amount may also include government-imposed service fees or other fees not paid directly to the taxing authorities but required by law to be collected by the Accommodation.
The amount paid to the Accommodation in connection with your reservation for taxes may vary from the amount we estimate and include in the charge to you.
The balance of the charge for Taxes and Fees, if any, is a fee Agoda retains as part of the compensation for our services and to cover the costs of your reservation, including, for example, customer service costs.
If the balance is negative, Agoda will absorb such difference.
The charge for Taxes and Fees varies based on a number of factors including, without limitation, the amount Agoda pays the Accommodation and the location of the Accommodation where you will be staying, and may include profit that Agoda retains.
Our Accommodation suppliers, as vendors, include all applicable taxes in the amount billed and Agoda pays over such amounts directly to the vendors.
Agoda is not a co-vendor associated with the vendors with whom we book or reserve your travel arrangements.
Taxability and the appropriate tax rate and the type of applicable taxes vary greatly by location.
For transactions involving Accommodations located within certain jurisdictions, the charge to your Payment Instrument for Taxes and Fees includes a payment of tax that Agoda is required to collect and remit to the jurisdiction for tax owed on amounts Agoda retains as compensation for services.
For reservations where you need to pay at the Accommodation, the price may or may not include taxes and fees.
Please verify the booking conditions and your confirmation mail or voucher or contact our Customer Service team.
 In some locations, Accommodations may be required by local law to charge and collect city, bed, tourist occupancy or equivalent taxes directly.
 Taxes and fees for Ancillary Services you may purchase are described out in our Partnerâs terms and conditions.

4.
Privacy

We respect your privacy.
Please have a look at our Privacy Policy for further information.

5.
Payment - Credit Card â âBook Now, Pay Laterâ â Age - Fraud

For pre-paid Accommodation bookings with Agoda, you authorize us to collect and process (including the collection and processing through a third party) your information required by processing service providers or the financial institution that issues your Payment Instrument such as a credit or debit card in order to verify your identity.
Personal information collected about you and that may be shared to such third parties (including to handle your transaction and/or maintain your account) is set out in our Privacy Policy.
To complete payment for such pre-paid Accommodation bookings, you authorize Agoda or Related Companies to charge or debit your Payment Instrument for the full price (sometimes without any option for refund depending on the Accommodationâs booking conditions, see below) upon reservation and confirmation of the booking or, in case of a âBook Now, Pay Laterâ booking, at the future point in time communicated in the confirmation email.
When using âBook Now, Pay Laterâ, please ensure that your Payment Instrument is valid and has sufficient credit on the future payment date.
If the Payment Instrument cannot be charged on such date for whatever reason, the booking will be cancelled unless you can ensure that the card payment can be authorized on time.
Please check the reservation details thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your reservation.
Agoda or Related Companies will process refunds, if and when applicable, within a reasonable timeframe.You also authorize the crediting to your Payment Instrument in case of reversals, refunds, or adjustments through the service which facilitates the processing of payment transactions.
For certain Accommodations, Agoda will not charge your Payment Instrument, as you will pay the Accommodation directly for your stay (post-paid).
However, in such cases some Accommodations may pre-authorize your card, charge a deposit or charge the full price of the reservation up-front.
Accommodations may require credit card details in order to guarantee your reservation.
As such, Agoda will send your Payment Instrument information directly to the Accommodation at which your booking is made and may verify (i.e.
pre-authorize) your Payment Instrument as well.
In order to safeguard and encrypt your Payment Instrument information when in transit to us, we use the "Secure Socket Layer (SSL)" technology for our services.
Please note that your bank may impose additional fees on the transaction.
Certain Payment Instrument companies charge their member banks a fee for processing "foreign transactions".
If you make card transactions and the recipient uses a bank located in a different country other than the bank which issued your card, an international service assessment, cross-border transaction fee or similar fee may be charged.
Your issuing bank may or may not pass this fee on to you (the card user).
Please contact your issuing bank for details as this is outside the control of Agoda .
In the event of Payment Instrument fraud or unauthorized use of your Payment Instrument by third parties, you should contact your bank or card issuer immediately upon becoming aware of such unauthorized use.
If you suspect an unauthorized or fraudulent booking was made via Agoda, please contact our Customer Service team immediately.

In order to make a booking you must be over 18 years old (or such other age at which majority is reached in your country or territory) and have the full legal capacity to make the transaction (or have the authorization to do so from your legal guardian).
You undertake that the Payment Instrument you are using is your own or that you are authorized to complete the booking with this Payment Instrument and that there are sufficient funds to cover the cost of the transaction.
You accept financial responsibility for all transactions made under your name or account.
You undertake that the details you provide us with in making a booking are fully correct.
Agoda reserves the right not to accept certain Payment Instruments.
Agoda may add or remove other payment methods at its discretion.
For increased convenience, Agoda now also offers the option to have your Payment Instrument details securely stored on file.
If you choose to store a credit or debit card with Agoda, we may not ask you for the Card Verification Value or security code the next time you use it to make a booking.
For more details, have a look at our Privacy Policy.
We have stringent fraud detection and prevention mechanisms in place.
In certain cases, we may require additional information or verifications to validate and confirm the booking, as explained in more detail on the Site.
A small verification charge or pre-authorization may also be made to your card, also when using "Book Now Pay Later".
The balance will be charged after confirmation or, in case of "Book Now Pay Later", on the future payment date (see the comment above about the possibility of cancellation in case the card cannot be charged on that date for whatever reason).
Reservations are not confirmed until you have received a confirmation email with a voucher and it is possible that an Accommodation or Ancillary Service could become fully booked during the fraud check, in which case the reservation will no longer be available.
Agoda can never be held liable in such cases.
Additional information submitted will be treated in line with strict industry standards to protect privacy, using encryption for transmission and specialized agents for verification.
If you choose not to submit the additional information or if we are not satisfied with the information received, the booking will be cancelled because it is incomplete and any amounts charged (including the verification charge where applicable) will be refunded.

A word about Instalments

In certain jurisdictions, Agoda supports payment by instalments (âInstalmentsâ or âDeferred Paymentsâ).
This service is not provided by Agoda but by a third party (âInstalment Facilitatorâ).
If you desire to pay in Instalments, you will need to agree to the terms and conditions of the instalment payment structure of Instalment Facilitator and/or to an additional payment agreement with Agoda made available at the Instalment Facilitatorâs website.
If you do not meet the requirements or you do not meet the terms and conditions of the Instalment Facilitator, the instalment feature will not be available to you.
If you are in breach of the terms and conditions of the Instalment Facilitator, you will be subject to the consequences stipulated by the Instalment Facilitatorâs terms and conditions.
Agoda reserves the right to cancel your booking, when you are in breach of Instalment Facilitatorâs terms and conditions.
You agree to pay and be solely liable for the full amount of the booking amount and you agree that Agoda has the right to assign the booking amount payable by you to the Instalment Facilitator and/or its factors.


A word about failed payments

For a variety of reasons, payment on the Site may fail.
In such cases, Agoda will offer you alternatives, if available, to ensure your reservation can go ahead.
If you have any questions, please contact our Customer Service department.

We recommend that you read the cancellation and no-show policy of the Accommodation carefully prior to making your reservation.
If you fail to check in to your Accommodation on time on the day of your reservation and do not alert the Accommodation, the remaining portion of your reservation may be canceled and you may not be entitled to a refund, depending on the terms and conditions of the applicable Accommodation.
Regardless of the Accommodationâs cancellation policy, Agoda reserves the right to charge a cancellation fee, this will be indicated on the Site.
Please carefully check the Accommodation details thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your reservation.
Some Accommodations will charge extra for early or late check-outs.
If you wish to review, adjust or cancel your reservation, please revert to the confirmation email and follow the instructions therein, use our self-service tool or contact Customer Service.
Many Accommodations have specific policies around children, accompanying travelers and/or traveling with pets.
As indicated above, you are strongly advised to check with Customer Service, the Accommodation itself or to verify the Accommodation policies.
Special Needs: If you have special needs (e.g., wheelchair accessible room) you must contact Customer Service or the Accommodation and verify that special needs can be met.
Please note that all special requests are subject to availability and are not guaranteed by Agoda.
Depending on the policy of the applicable Accommodation, your reservation will be refunded, canceled or modified if special needs cannot be met.
If available, your request will be confirmed upon arrival.
Agoda will not be liable to you for any damages or costs that you suffer if the Accommodation does not meet your special needs.

A word about Agoda Price Alerts

You may elect to set Agoda âPrice Alertsâ on Accommodations found on our Site.
If elected, we will send you a Price Alert when prices at your selected Accommodation(s) and for the indicated time frame on our Site change.
Price Alerts will not be specific to a type of room or other features relating to an Accommodation (e.g.
breakfast included, full board, type of bed).
A maximum of one Price Alert per Accommodation per day will be sent to you.
Sending a Price Alert will only be triggered if the Accommodation price changes beyond a "materiality" threshold we set.
The type of Price Alert sent to you will depend on the medium you use, that is by email if your chosen Site is the Agoda website or by push notification if your chosen Site is our Agoda app.
You are responsible for updating your Price Alert settings.
Price Alerts within your settings will continue to be sent to you even if you make a booking for the selected Accommodation or another Accommodation for the indicated time period until you change your Price Alert settings.
Opting into receiving Price Alerts will not affect any other choices you have made regarding receiving communications from us.
Additionally, we will of course provide you with the ability to opt out of receiving Price Alerts at any time by clicking on the âturn off price alertsâ or a similar message found in the Price Alert sent to you.
For more information on this, please see our Privacy Policy.

A word about Agodaâs Secret Deals

Through its âSecret Dealsâ program, Agoda is frequently able to offer quality Accommodation rooms at very attractive rates, which means you can enjoy great savings on quality accommodation at selected properties worldwide, from luxurious five-star to charming boutique hotels.
For various reasons, the Accommodations participating in this program prefer to stay anonymous until the booking is confirmed and paid.
Secret Deals are indicated with a specific logo and you can browse and consult key information about these properties (general area, description, facilities) prior to making a reservation, but you will not know which property it is.
Upon completion of your reservation, the property name, location and contact details will be revealed.
To ensure that Agoda can continue to offer these special rates on a regular basis, Secret Deal bookings are non-cancellable and non-refundable.

A word about PointsMAX

Through its âPointsMAXâ program, Agoda is offering you the opportunity to collect points with certain third party loyalty programs (e.g.
miles programs from airlines).
For certain Accommodations, you will be able to select a third party loyalty program from the PointsMAX menu to view offers, next to our usual room offering.
If available, you will be offered the choice of a PointsMAX booking that will incur points with your selected third party loyalty program.
The points you are earning and the program name are reconfirmed on your booking form and the thank you confirmation message you will receive after making a PointsMAX booking.
Points will be posted directly on your third-party program account within 2 to 8 weeks after your check-out date.
For the avoidance of doubt, the PointsMAX program does not apply to Ancillary Services provided on the Site.

The rates for PointsMAX bookings may be different from regular bookings at the same conditions;
PointsMAX booking rates cannot be broken down into a room rate and points component;

The arbitration of any dispute or claim will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules (as applicable), as modified by this Section.
The AAA Rules and information about arbitration and fees are available online at www.adr.org.&nbsp.
To the extent of any inconsistency, this Section will supersede and govern over the AAA Rules.
You and we agree that this Section evidences a transaction in interstate commerce and this arbitration provision will be interpreted and enforced in accordance with the U.S.
Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law, and not governed by state law.
Any arbitration will be held in a reasonably convenient location in the state in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location.
The arbitration will be conducted in the English language.
An arbitrator may award any relief that would be available in a court, including injunctive or declaratory relief to the extent required to satisfy your claim, as well as afford public injunctive relief where such claims are permitted and cannot be waived by applicable law, and must follow and enforce this Section as a court would.
Any arbitration will be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award.
Judgment on any arbitration award may be entered in any court having proper jurisdiction.
We agree that we will pay all filing, administration and arbitrator fees other than the initial filing fee that you must pay to file the initial arbitration demand, and if your claim is for less than $1,000 we will reimburse you for the filing fee if you provide a written request for reimbursement.
Otherwise, we will each bear the fees and expense of our respective attorneys, experts, witnesses and preparation and presentation of evidence at the arbitration.

In addition to the above, you and we each agree that any proceeding, whether in arbitration or in court, will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action, except for actions for injunctive relief as described below.
If a court or arbitrator determines in an action between you and us that this class action waiver is unenforceable, the arbitration Section will be void as to you.
If you opt out of the arbitration provision as specified above, this class action waiver provision will not apply to you.
Neither you, nor any other customer, can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt-out procedure set forth above.
Notwithstanding the above Terms of Use, nothing in this Section will be construed to waive any right you have under applicable law to pursue a claim for injunctive relief with the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the general public.
Any such public injunctive relief claims are preserved and will be subject to arbitration.
To the extent permitted by applicable law, any determination of the extent to which your claims qualify as seeking public injunctive relief will be heard and decided by the arbitrator.
If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, you and we each waive any right to a jury trial.
