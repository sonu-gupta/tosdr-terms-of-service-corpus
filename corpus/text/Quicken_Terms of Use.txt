It is your responsibility to submit payments to arrive by the Due Date specified on the bill or statement.
If you initiate processing on a date that causes payment to be delivered after the Due Date, we are not responsible for any late charges that you may be charged by the Payee.
We may set a maximum dollar amount for payment, and/or refuse to permit any bill payment if we reasonably believe such refusal is necessary or advisable for security reasons, to prevent misuse of the Service, to prevent any payments prohibited by these Terms and Conditions, or to prevent fraud or the commission of an illegal act.

Services Guarantee.
Due to circumstances beyond the control of the Services, particularly delays in handling and posting payments by Payees or financial institutions, some transactions may take longer to be credited to your account.
Quicken will bear responsibility for any late payment related charges up to $50.00 should a payment post after its Due Date as long as the payment was scheduled in accordance with the guidelines described above, and we have issued you a confirmation number for a payment, unless we are not responsible to you for one of the reasons listed below.
We may require that you provide us with satisfactory written documentation of any late fees before making reimbursement to you.

If we can recover an overpayment that was charged to your Funding Account, we will return the amount of the overpayment to you.
