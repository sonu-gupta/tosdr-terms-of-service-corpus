 Nexus Mods strives to provide its users with services and information that facilitate the discussion and distribution of user-submitted video game modifications ("mods") and other video game related digital media.
To that end, this document establishes various acknowledgements, entitlements, and restrictions in regards to the usage of Nexus Mods websites, content, systems, and software.
Nexus Mods reserves the right to discontinue providing any or all of these services, as well as cease any form of communications, to any user or organisation and for any reason and at any time.
Changes to Policies and Services
 We reserve the right to change this document, as well as our various policies and guidelines, at any time.
By continuing to use the service, you automatically agree to any revisions of these terms.
We encourage you to review these documents periodically at our Help Center.
 Nexus Mods reserves the right to reconfigure its offerings and organisation and may choose to do so at any time.
This includes but is not limited to our services, website designs, membership pricing and offerings, advertising programs and partnerships, as well as staff related and/or administrative restructuring.
General Usage of Websites and Services
 By accessing Nexus Mods services, you hereby represent that you are aged 18 or older, or that you are aged 13 or older and do so with the consent of a parent or legal guardian.
 You will use Nexus Mods services reasonably and as intended.
You may not display, duplicate, dismantle, reverse engineer, circumvent, or repurpose any property or service owned or operated by Nexus Mods without consent.
You will not intentionally harm, disparage, or in any way disrupt the operation of Nexus Mods websites, systems, property, or staff.
You view and use all content at your own risk.
We do not warrant the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of any content presented.
User-submitted content expresses the views of the author, not necessarily the views of any staff at Nexus Mods.
 In the interest of upholding our community standards when it comes to etiquette, we ask you to abstain from interacting with user-submitted content that you do not find to your liking, rather than engaging in active disparagement of content you disapprove of.
Fair Use Policy
 Attempting to download files or otherwise record data offered through our services (including but not limited to the Nexus Mods website and the Nexus Mods API) in a fashion that drastically exceeds the expected average, through the use of software automation or otherwise, is prohibited without expressed permission.
Users found in violation of this policy will have their account suspended.
Anti-Piracy Policy
 We have a strict anti-piracy policy and will take proactive action against anyone whose on-site activity gives us reasonable grounds to believe they are using pirated content such as, but not limited to, games and software.
Discussing, promoting or distributing such content on our sites will be met with administrative action.
Accounts and User Identity
 In order to access certain Nexus Mods services, you must create and utilise a singular account (i.e.
one account per person) consisting of a username, email address, and password.
Households or facilities from which multiple users (and therefore accounts) may access the sites and services are encouraged to inform staff to ensure that there are no potential misunderstandings in the case of moderation review.
More information can be found in our Moderation Policy.
Users who create multiple accounts may have any or all of those accounts terminated with other measures being taken to prevent such abuse as appropriate.
 It is your responsibility to ensure the email address attached to your account is up-to-date.
In the event of you losing access to your account, your email address is the only method that can be used to reclaim your account.
 When creating an account on our services, the username you choose must be appropriate for all audiences (i.e.
be free of profanity).
Accounts registered with inappropriate usernames will be subject to an immediate ban.
It is important that you keep your account information secure.
Nexus Mods is not responsible for any unauthorised use of your account.
It is the sole responsibility of the user to keep these records up to date and your failure to do so may lead to you losing access to your account.

If you are using links in your signature or on your profile page, please make sure that content featured on the linked website or webpage conforms to our requirements.

 Given the volume of user-submitted content on our services, we rely on community reports and reactive moderation when it comes to upholding our various rules and guidelines.
