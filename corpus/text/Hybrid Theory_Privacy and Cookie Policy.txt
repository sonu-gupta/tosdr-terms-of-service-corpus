Service
Hybrid Theory provides technology services that enable you to receive online advertisements that are relevant to your interests.
Through this, we process pseudonymous data regarding the relationships between people, the website pages they visit and/or the actions they take on a website, with the purpose of facilitating advertising to consumers that is more relevant and tailored to their particular interests.
We achieve this through creating segmented profiles based on usersâ browsing history that allows our clients to categorize users with similar characteristics or interests, improving their ability to deliver more relevant advertising.
In doing so, we make all efforts to ensure that we only process personal data where we have a suitable legal basis to do so and only process personal data in a pseudonymous form to the greatest degree possible.
Hybrid Theory are committed to protecting your privacy and compliance with all relevant legislation, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), where this applies to EU citizens, and the Californian Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), where this applies to California residents.

PURPOSES FOR WHICH WE WILL USE YOUR PERSONAL DATA

Profiling

Hybrid Theory may use data we receive in the form of Browsing Data from the sources listed above in order to create a profile of specific usersâ interests and Browsing information, and allow us to target them with useful advertising later on.
We may also compile Inferred Data into âsegmented profilesâ or âmodel audiencesâ based around categories of interests, which can later be associated with different users.
This is performed using an automated technological process and is passed on to our third-party partners to ensure that this information is used to target appropriate advertisements to you.
However, we take steps to exclude any categories or labels based on Special Category Personal Data being used to generate such profiles.
We have set out below, in a table format, a description of all the ways we use your personal data, and which of the legal bases we rely on to do so.
We have also identified what our legitimate interests are, where appropriate.
Note that we may process your personal data for more than one lawful ground depending on the specific purpose for which we are using your data.

Under certain circumstances, where you are an EEA citizen, you have rights under the GDPR in relation to your personal data, upon request.

Your rights include:

This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we or our third-party partners hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you.
This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
Request erasure of your personal data.
You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law.
Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest, in addition to objection to the creation of profiles about you.
You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.
You should exercise this by contacting us at privacy@hybridtheory.com or responding to the marketing email you received by clicking the relevant opt-out link or replying to the email with [OPT OUT].
Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party.
We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).
However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.
Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
Hybrid Theory is the data controller, either jointly or solely and responsible for the legality of processing your personal data (collectively referred to as â Hybrid Theoryâ, âweâ, âusâ or âourâ in this privacy policy).
