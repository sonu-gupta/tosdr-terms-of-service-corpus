We use your personal data so we can provide the best service, tell you about products and services you may be interested in, and meet our legal obligations.
Providing our services
Whenever you apply for a product or service, we will use your personal data to check your identity (as part of our KYC process) and decide whether or not to approve your application.
If you are already a Revolut customer, we use your personal data to meet our obligations relating to any transactions you make (for example, making payments into and out of your Revolut account, withdrawing cash or making payments with your Revolut Card).
If you ask us to exchange the currency of the e-money you hold in your Revolut account, we'll use your personal data to help us do that.
Where you hold a credit product with us, we use your personal data to recover debt and exercise other rights we have under any agreement we have with you.
We use your personal data to give you details of our products and services and to help us develop new products and services.

legitimate interests (to develop and improve how we deal with financial crime and meet our legal responsibilities).

provide you with information about other products and services we offer that are similar to those you have already used (or asked about, where allowed by law).
provide you with information about our products or services which we think you might be interested in.
To help us do this, we may use information about you to help us better understand your interests.
You can opt out of this by using the privacy settings in the Revolut app or by emailing our Data Protection Officer at dpo@revolut.com.
if you agree, provide you with information about our partnersâ promotions or offers which we think you might be interested in.

If you are a Revolut customer, we may contact you about optional extras or promotional offers.
We may use personal data we gather about you through your use of our services to tailor these offers to you.

For more information, please see our Cookies Policy.
We also use your personal data to allow you to take part in interactive features of our services, to tell you about changes to our services, and to help keep our website and the Revolut app safe and secure. Here's an example of how we use your personal data to run our services
If any changes we make to our services affect you, we'll normally contact you using the email address you gave us when you signed up, or through the Revolut app, to tell you about the changes.
Our legal basis is one or more of the following:

keeping to contracts and agreements between you and us;
legitimate interests (to be efficient about how we meet our obligations and keep to regulations that apply to us).
or

Helping with social interactions
We use your personal data to help social interactions through our services or to add extra functions in order to provide a better experience. Here's an example of how we use your personal data for social interactions
We'll let you know if any Revolut customers are in the same area as you (if you and they have location services switched on).

We use your personal data to provide relevant advertising to you (for example, information on nearby merchants), to protect against fraud, and to let you know when any of your contacts who are Revolut customers are in the same area as you (if they have location services switched on). Here's an example of how we use your location information If you go abroad, the Revolut app may automatically tell you the exchange rate in that country.
Our legal basis is one or more of the following:

Preparing anonymised statistical datasets
We prepare anonymised statistical datasets about our customersâ spending patterns for forecasting purposes or to help governments in policy-making.
These datasets may be shared internally or externally with others, including non-Revolut companies.
We produce these reports using information about you and other customers.
The information used and shared in this way is never personal data and you will never be identifiable from it.
Anonymised statistical data cannot be linked back to you as an individual.
Our legal basis is:

legitimate interests (to conduct research and analysis, including to produce statistical research and reports).
or
legal obligations.
 Here's an example of why we may anonymise your personal data Some countries ask us to report spending statistics and how money enters or leaves each country.
We may provide anonymised statistical information that explains the broad categories of merchants that Revolut customers in that country spend their money with.
We may also provide information about how Revolut customers top up their accounts and transfer money in that particular country.
However, we will not provide any customer-level information.
It will not be possible to identify any individual Revolut customer. Meeting our legal obligations, enforcing our rights and other legal uses
We may need to share personal data about you: 

with other organisations (for example, fraud-prevention agencies).

if this is necessary to meet our legal obligations or in connection with legal claims.
or 
to help detect or prevent crime.


You can find out more in the Do you share my personal data with anyone else? section below.

Our legal basis is one or more of the following:

substantial public interest (if we process your sensitive personal data to keep to legal requirements that apply to us).
or
legal obligations.

6.
Do you make automated decisions about me?
Depending on the Revolut products or services you use, we may make automated decisions about you.
This means that we may use technology that can evaluate your personal circumstances and other factors to predict risks or outcomes.
We do this for the efficient running of our services and to ensure decisions are fair, consistent and based on the right information.
Where we make an automated decision about you you have the right to ask that it is manually reviewed by a person.
You can find out more about this in the What are my rights? section below.
For example, we may make automated decisions about you that relate to:

Approving credit applications:


credit and affordability checks to see whether we can accept your credit application.
or
setting credit limits.


Opening accounts


anti-money laundering and sanctions checks.
and
identity and address checks.


Detecting fraud


monitoring your account to detect fraud and financial crime.

Our legal basis is one or more of the following:

keeping to contracts and agreements between you and us.
or
legal obligations.

7.
Do you carry out credit checks about me?
We and our lending partners will use credit-reference agencies (or other providers of credit information in relevant countries) to carry out credit checks on you if you apply (or tell us you want to apply) for a credit product through Revolut.
We will also share your personal data with credit-reference agencies (or other providers of credit information) to:

confirm details you have provided when you apply for products or services;
make an assessment about whether to accept your credit application.
or
determine an appropriate credit limit for you.

When you enter into a credit agreement with us we may continue sharing information with credit reference agencies or other providers of credit information (for example, information about your repayments and whether you repay in full or on time).
The personal data we share with and receive from credit reference agencies (or other providers of credit information) when you apply for, or use, a Revolut credit product will vary depending on the country you live in.
We will provide full details when you apply for a Revolut credit product.

For UK users only

If you are located in the United Kingdom, we may also check your credit history to help us develop and, in the future, offer credit products that meet the needs of our customers.
This will enable us to pre-filter the credit products that you may be eligible for and, in some cases, let you know before you apply if you will be accepted for a Revolut credit product.
However, if you would prefer that we do not use your data in this way you can use the privacy settings in the Revolut app to opt out.
Credit-reference agencies will not store any of your information that we send them when we use their services for this purpose and these checks do not leave any âfootprintâ (trace) whatsoever on your credit record held by the credit-reference agency.
The three main credit-reference agencies Revolut uses are:

TransUnion (www.transunion.com);
Equifax (www.equifax.com).
and
Experian (www.experian.com).

Our legal basis is one or more of the following:

consent (where we are required to collect your consent by law);
legal obligations;
keeping to contracts and agreements between you and us (where you take out a credit product with us).
or
legitimate interests (to develop and, in the future, offer credit products to our customers).

8.
How do you use my information for marketing?
If you sign up to our services, and where allowed by law, we will assume you want us to contact you by post, email and SMS text message with information about Revolut products, services, offers and promotions.
We may use the personal data we have collected about you in order to tailor our offers to you.
You can adjust your preferences, or tell us you don't want to hear from us, at any time.
Just use the privacy settings in the Revolut app or click on the unsubscribe links on any marketing message we send you.
We won't pass your details on to any organisations outside the Revolut group of companies for their marketing purposes without your permission.
You can find out more in the Do you share my personal data with anyone else? section. Your rights
9.
What are my rights? Your right
What it means You have the right to be told about how we use your personal data.
We provide this privacy policy to explain how we use your personal data.
If you ask, we will provide a copy of the personal data we hold about you.
We canât give you any personal data about other people, personal data which is linked to an ongoing criminal or fraud investigation, or personal data which is linked to settlement negotiations with you.
We also won't provide you with any communication we've had with our legal advisers.
You can ask us to correct your personal data if you think it's wrong.
You can have incomplete or inaccurate personal data corrected.
Before we update your file, we may need to check the accuracy of the new personal data you have provided.
You can ask us to delete your personal data.
You can ask us to delete your personal data if: â there's no good reason for us to continue using it.
â you gave us consent (permission) to use your personal data and you have now withdrawn that consent.
â you have objected to us using your personal data.
â we have used your personal data unlawfully.
or â the law requires us to delete your personal data.
Just to let you know, we may not be able to agree to your request.
As a regulated financial services provider, we must keep certain customer personal data even where you ask us to delete it (we've explained this in more detail below).
If you've closed your Revolut account, we may not be able to delete your entire file because these regulatory responsibilities take priority.
We will always let you know if we can't delete your information.
You can object to us processing your personal data for marketing purposes.
You can tell us to stop using your personal data for marketing.
You can object to us processing other personal data (if we are using it for legitimate interests).
If our legal basis for using your personal data is 'legitimate interests' and you disagree with us using it, you can object.
However, if there is an overriding reason why we need to use your personal data, we will not accept your request.
If you object to us using personal data which we need in order to provide our services, we may need to close your account as we wonât be able to provide the services.
You can ask us to restrict how we use your personal data.
You can ask us to suspend using your personal data if: â you want us to investigate whether it is accurate.
â our use of your personal data is unlawful but you do not want us to delete it.
â we no longer need the information, but you want us to continue holding it for you in connection with a legal claim.
or â you have objected to us using your personal data (see above), but we need to check whether we have an overriding reason to use it.
You can ask us to transfer personal data to you.
If we can, and are allowed to do so under regulatory requirements, we will provide your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.
You can withdraw your permission.
If you have given us any consent we need to use your personal data, you can withdraw your consent at any time by changing your privacy settings in the Revolut app or sending an email to dpo@revolut.com.
(Note, it will have been lawful for us to use the personal data up to the point you withdraw your permission).
You can ask us to carry out a human review of an automated decision we make about you.
If we make an automated decision about you that significantly affects you, you can ask us to carry out a manual review of this decision.
Your ability to exercise these rights will depend on a number of factors.
Sometimes, we will not be able to agree to your request (for example, if we have a legitimate reason for not doing so or the right does not apply to the particular information we hold about you).

10.
How do I exercise my rights?
To exercise any of your rights set out in the previous section, you can contact us through the Revolut app or send us an email at dpo@revolut.com.
For security reasons, we can't deal with your request if we are not sure of your identity, so we may ask you for proof of your ID.
Revolut will usually not charge you a fee when you exercise your rights.
However, we are allowed by law to charge a reasonable fee or refuse to act on your request if it is manifestly unfounded or excessive.
If you are unhappy with how we have handled your personal data you can complain to your local data protection authority.
In the United Kingdom, this is the ICO (website).
In the EU, there are national and regional data protection authorities (a list is available on this website).
11.
Do you share my personal data with anyone else?
Revolut group companies
We share your personal data within the Revolut group of companies in order to provide you with the best service.
Other Revolut customers
We will ask you to let us sync your mobile phone contacts.
This will help you to identify which of your trusted mobile phone contacts are Revolut customers.
Your âtrusted contactsâ will also be able to see if you are a Revolut customer through our âPayment with Friendsâ functionality.
âPayment with Friendsâ gives you access to Revolut features like requesting money from your friends, splitting bills, group vaults and paying other Revolut customers near you.
We use technological safeguards to ensure a âtrusted contactâ is somebody you already know and who knows you (for example, you have each other saved in each otherâs mobile phone contacts lists or have already received or given money through a peer-to-peer payment with them).
Both you and your trusted contact must have synced your mobile phone contacts lists with Revolut to be viewable to each other in the Revolut app.
We only show your basic contact details in the Revolut app to your trusted contacts who are also Revolut customers (for example, your name (as saved in your friendâs contacts list), mobile phone number, Revolut username, your Revolut profile photo (if you have one)).

You can, of course, choose not to sync your contacts list with Revolut.
This means that you will not be able to identify which of your mobile phone contacts are Revolut customers.
You can also turn off âPayments with Friendsâ through the privacy settings in the Revolut app.

People or companies that you transfer money to
Where you make a payment from your Revolut account, we will provide the recipient with your details (for example, your full legal name and IBAN).
Suppliers
The table below explains which suppliers we normally share your personal data with.

Type of supplier
Why we share your personal data Suppliers who provide us with IT, payment and delivery services
To help us provide our services to you.
Our banking and financial-services partners and payments networks, including Visa and Mastercard
To help us provide our services to you.
This includes banking and lending partners, banking intermediaries and international payment-service providers.
Card manufacturing, personalisation and delivery companies
To create and deliver your personalised Revolut Card.
Analytics providers and search information providers
To help us improve our website or app.
Customer-service providers, survey providers and developers
To help us to provide our services to you.
Communications services providers
To help us send you emails, push notifications and text messages.
Debt collection agencies
To manage and recover debts that you owe or may become owing if you have a Revolut credit product.
Third party payers
We may share your name with third parties that pay money into your Revolut account.
This is necessary to confirm that the payment has been made to the correct account.

Partners who help to provide our services
We may share your personal data with our partners in order to provide you with certain services you have asked us for (for example, when we offer overseas medical insurance as part of our Premium or Metal plans).
If you are a Revolut Business customer, we may share your personal data with our partners (through the Revolut Business API) when you switch this function on through Revolut Connect. Here's an example of when we might share your personal data with our partners
If you have asked for insurance services, we will share your relevant personal data with the provider of our insurance services.
The service provider will require your personal data to provide you with insurance.
We will only share your personal data in this way if you have asked for the relevant service or it is provided as part of one of our plans.

From time to time we may work with other partners to offer you co-branded services or promotional offers, and we will share some of your personal data with those partners.
We will always make sure you understand how we and our partners process your personal data for these purposes.

Our partners will have their own privacy policies explaining how they use your personal data.
It's important that you read those privacy policies as well.
For example, our third party insurance provider, White Horse Ireland dac, will process your personal data in accordance with its own privacy policy.
Credit-reference agencies
As set out in the Do you carry out credit checks about me? section, if you apply for a credit product, we'll share your personal data with
credit-reference agencies to check whether you are likely to make repayments when due.
Other financial institutions
We may share your personal data with other financial institutions if requested.
 Here's an example of when we might share your personal data with other financial institutions
If you have activated âOpen Bankingâ through an account you hold with another financial institution and given them permission, we will share data from your Revolut account with that financial institution.

We may also share your personal data with other financial institutions where you do not ask us to.
For example:

if you make an outbound payment, we share information about you alongside your payment.
This is because we, like all payment institutions, are required by law to include certain information with payments.
and
if a payment is made to your account by mistake, we can share your information with the financial institution the payment came from.
This will help the payer and the other financial institution to try and get the payment back themselves.

For legal reasons
We also share your personal data with fraud-prevention agencies to check your identity, protect against fraud, keep to anti-money laundering laws and confirm that you are eligible to use our products and services. Here's an example of when we might share your personal data for legal reasons
If you give us false or inaccurate personal data and we identify fraud, we will let fraud-prevention agencies know.
Law-enforcement agencies may check and use this personal data.
If fraud is detected, you could be refused certain services, finance or employment.
You can contact us through the Revolut app to ask us for details of the fraud-prevention agencies we may share your personal data with.
We may also need to share your personal data with other third party organisations:

if we have to do so under any law or regulation.

if we sell our business;
in connection with criminal or fraud investigations.

to enforce our rights (and those of customers or others).
or
in connection with legal claims.


Social media and advertising companies Here's an example of when we might share your personal data for advertising purposes
We may share your personal data (your name, email address and app events) with our advertising partners in the ways described below, but the personal data is hashed before we send it, and the social-media platform we share it with is only allowed to use that hashed personal data in the ways described below.
When we use social media for marketing purposes, your personal data may be shared with the social-media platforms so that they can check if you also hold an account with them.
If you do, we may ask the advertising partner or social-media provider to:

use your personal data to send our adverts to you, because we think that you might be interested in a new Revolut product or service.
