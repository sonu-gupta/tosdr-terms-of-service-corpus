We use Plaid and other third party integrations to provide this functionality to you.
In order to connect your third party accounts to your Truebill account, you must expressly authorize such connection when first registering your Truebill account or at a later time through your account settings.
You may terminate this connection at any time through your account settings. 

When you connect your third party accounts to your Truebill account, you give Truebill and the third party integration the authority to act on your behalf to access and transmit your information from the relevant bank or other entity that provides your accounts.

C.
Automatically Collected Information

When you use the Service or open one of our HTML emails, we (or our service providers or vendors) automatically collect certain information from your web browser and through your device by using different types of technology, including âcookies,â âlog files,â "pixels," and other tracking technologies.
This automatically collected information includes:



Device Data, including data about device identifiers such as IP address or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, your deviceâs operating software, your internet service provider, and your deviceâs regional and language settings. 

Service Use Data, including data about the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after the Service, the pages you view on the Service, your actions on the Service, features you use, emails and advertisements you view, products and services you view and purchase, and the dates and times that you visit, access, or use the Service.

Location Data, including imprecise location data (such as location derived from an IP address or data that indicates a city or postal code level).


â
The types of tracking technologies used include: 



Cookies.
When you use the Service, we may send one or more cookies â small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters â to your device.
We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies.
A session cookie disappears after you close your browser.
A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service to personalize your experience, remember your preferences, and support security features.
Additionally, persistent cookies allow us to bring you advertising both on and off the Service.
Persistent cookies can be removed.
Please review your web browser "Help" file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings.
Please note that if you delete, or choose not to accept, cookies from the Service, you may not be able to utilize the features of the Service to their fullest potential.

Pixels and JavaScript.
Pixels (also known as web beacons) are code
embedded in a website, video, email, or advertisement that send information about your use to a server.
There are various types of pixels, including image pixels (which are small graphic images) and JavaScript pixels (which contain JavaScript code).
When you access a website, video, email, or advertisement that contains a pixel, the pixel may permit us or a separate entity to write or read cookies on your browser.
Pixels are used in combination with cookies to track activity by a particular browser on a particular device.
We may incorporate pixels from separate entities that allow us to track our conversions, bring you advertising both on and off the Service, and provide you with additional functionality.&nbsp.
 

Device Fingerprinting.
This is the process of analyzing and combining sets of data elements from your deviceâs browser, such as JavaScript objects and installed fonts, to create a âfingerprintâ of your device and uniquely identify your browser and device. 

App Technologies. These technologies are included in our Apps that are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings.
For example, our Apps may include SDKs (e.g., the Facebook SDK), which is code that sends information about your use to a server.
These SDKs allow us to track our conversions, bring your advertising both on and off the Service, and provide you additional functionality, such as the ability to connect our Service with your Google account. 

â

For further information on how we use tracking technologies for analytics and advertising, and your rights and choices regarding them, see the âAnalytics and Advertisingâ and âYour Rights and Choicesâ sections below. â

Publicly-available sources, including data in the public domain.




We treat the information collected from other sources subject to any laws or contractual obligations applicable to us.

When We Disclose Information

We disclose information we collect in accordance with the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
The categories of parties with whom we share information include:



Service Providers.
We share information with service providers that process information on our behalf.
Service providers assist us with services such as payment processing, fraud prevention, data analytics, marketing and advertising, website hosting, and technical support.
To the extent required by law, we contractually prohibit our service providers from retaining, using, or disclosing information about you for any purpose other than performing the services for us, although we may permit them to use information that does not identify you (including information that has been aggregated or de-identified) for any purpose except as prohibited by applicable law.

Third Party Integrations. We share information with third parties (such as Plaid) and any relevant banks or other entities in connection with you connecting your third party accounts to your Truebill account.
You may terminate this connection at any time through your account settings.

Analytics and Advertising.
We share information with vendors and other parties for our analytics and advertising related purposes.
These parties may act as our service providers, or in certain contexts, independently decide how to process your information.
For more information on advertising and analytics, see the âAnalytics and Advertisingâ section below. 

Affiliates. We share information with our affiliates and related entities, including where they act as our service providers or for their own internal purposes.

Partners, Vendors, and Advertisers.
We share information in connection with offering co-branded services, selling or distributing our products, engaging in joint marketing activities, or providing advertising on our Service. 

Promotions.
Our promotions may be jointly sponsored or offered by other parties.
When you voluntarily enter a promotion, we share information as set out in the official rules that govern the promotion as well as for administrative purposes and as required by law (e.g., on a winners list).
By entering a promotion, you agree to the official rules that govern that promotion, and may, except where prohibited by applicable law, allow the sponsor and/or other entities to use your name, voice and/or likeness in advertising or marketing materials.

Merger or Acquisition.
In the event that all or a portion of Truebill or its assets are acquired by or merged with another entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have collected from users in connection with such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.

Security and Compelled Disclosure.
We share information to comply with the law or other legal process, and where required, in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
We also share information to protect the rights, property, life, health, security and safety of us, the Service or anyone else.
For example, we share information with identity verification services and fraud prevention services. 

Facilitating Requests. We share information at your request or direction. 

Consent. We share information with notice to you and your consent.
For example, where we have received your consent, we will share your Service account with your spouse.
Where we have received such consent, we are not responsible for the acts or omissions of your spouse on the Service.
You can opt-out of such sharing at any time by disabling âAccount Sharingâ in the "Profileâ section of the app.




Notwithstanding the above, we may share information that does not identify you (including information that has been aggregated or de-identified) except as prohibited by applicable law.
For information on your rights and choices regarding how we share information about you, please see the âYour Rights and Choicesâ section below.
â
â

Analytics and Advertising

We use analytics services, such as Amplitude, to help us understand how users access and use the Service.
In addition, we work with agencies, advertisers, ad networks, and other technology services to place ads about our products and services on other websites and services.
For example, we place ads through Google and Facebook that you may view on their platforms as well as on other websites and services. 

As part of this process, we may incorporate tracking technologies into our own Service (including our Site, Apps, and emails) as well as into our ads displayed on other websites and services.
Some of these tracking technologies may track your activities across time and services for purposes of associating the different devices you use, and delivering relevant ads and/or other content to you (âInterest-based Advertisingâ).

We also use audience matching services to reach people (or people similar to people) who have visited our Service or are identified in one or more of our databases (âMatched Adsâ).
This is done by us uploading a customer list to another party or incorporating a pixel or SDK from another party into our own Service, and the other party matching common factors between our data and their data or other datasets.
For instance, we incorporate the Facebook SDK on our Service and may share your email address with Facebook as part of our use of Facebook Custom Audiences. 

As indicated above, vendors and other parties may act as our service providers, or in certain contexts, independently decide how to process your information.

For further information on the types of tracking technologies we use on the Service and your rights and choices regarding analytics, Interest-based Advertising, and Matched Ads, please see the âInformation Collected Automaticallyâ and âYour Rights and Choicesâ sections.

Your Rights and Choices

You may, of course, decline to share certain information with us, in which case we may not be able to provide to you some of the features and functionality of the Service.
Below is further information regarding your rights and choices for the Service:



Account Information.
If you have an account with us, you may update, correct, or delete your profile information and preferences you set within the account at any time by accessing your account preferences page through the Service.
Please note that we will retain and use information about you as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. 

In-Service Offers.
If you have a Truebill account, we may show you offers within your account or by email that are personalized to you based on information you have provided to us.
For example, if we notice that you have a high utility bill, we may alert you to a better offer from one of our partners.
We do not share your information with the partner unless you click on the offer and direct us to share information with them.
We may get a commission from the partner if you purchase a product or service after clicking on the offer. 

Emails. If you do not wish to receive email offers or newsletters from us, you can opt-out of receiving email information from us (except for emails related to the completion of your registration, correction of user data, change of password and other similar communications essential to your transactions on the Service) by using the unsubscribe process at the bottom of the email.
You can also unsubscribe or change your email preferences by updating your account preferences through the Service.
Please note that while your changes are reflected promptly in active user databases, we may retain all information you submit for a variety of purposes, including backups and archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, and analytics.

Push Notifications. If you have opted-in to receive push notifications on your device, you can opt-out at any time by updating your account preferences through the Service, through your device settings, or by uninstalling the app.

Cookies and Pixels.
Most browsers accept cookies by default.
You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to decline or delete cookies.
If you use multiple browsers on your device, you will need to instruct each browser separately.
Your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.

Do Not Track.
Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a âDo Not Trackâ signal to online services you visit.
Note, however, there is no industry consensus as to what site and app operators should do with regard to these signals.
Accordingly, unless and until the law is interpreted to require us to do so, we do not monitor or take action with respect to âDo Not Trackâ signals.&nbsp.
For more information on âDo Not Track,â visit https://www.allaboutdnt.com.

App and Imprecise Location Technologies.
You can stop all collection of information via an app by uninstalling the app.
You can also reset your device Ad Id at any time through your device settings, which is designed to allow you to limit the use of information collected about you.

Google Analytics and Advertising.
Google provides tools to allow you to opt out of the use of certain information collected by Google Analytics at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout and by Google Analytics for Display Advertising or the Google Display Network at https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb.
 

Interest-based Advertising.
The companies we work with to provide you with targeted ads are required by us to give you the choice to opt out of receiving targeted ads.
Most of these companies are participants of the Digital Advertising Alliance (âDAAâ) and/or the Network Advertising Initiative (âNAIâ).
To learn more about the targeted ads provided by these companies, and how to opt out of receiving certain targeted ads from them, please visit: (i) for website targeted ads from DAA participants, https://www.aboutads.info/choices.
(ii) for app targeted ads from DAA participants, https://www.aboutads.info/appchoices.
and (iii) for targeted ads from NAI participants, https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices.
Opting out only means that the selected participants should no longer deliver certain targeted ads to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., in connection with the participantsâ other customers or from other technology services).

Mobile Device.
You may also limit our use of information collected from or about your mobile device for purposes of serving targeted ads to you by going to your device settings and selecting âLimit Ad Trackingâ (for iOS devices) or âOpt out of Interest-Based Adsâ (for Android devices).




Please note that if you opt out using any of these methods, the opt out will only apply to the specific browser, device, account, email address, and/or phone number from which you opt out.
It will not affect subsequent subscriptions (where applicable).
We are not responsible for any other entitiesâ effectiveness of, or compliance with, any opt out options or programs, or the accuracy of their statements regarding their opt out options or programs.
