Privacy Policy Updated: January 2020
Thank you for your interest in Typing.com! Please read the below privacy policy in detail.
However, in plain English, we do not share, sell, or otherwise give away private information to anyone! At most, some non-personal information such as IP address and web browser version will be made available as a basic mechanic of the internet, but thatâs it.
Now, please enjoy the legalese:

Typing.com has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy.
This privacy policy applies to information, including personal information, that Typing.com (a product of Teaching.com) collects about you when you visit our website.
This policy does not apply to other Teaching.com websites or apps.
Typing.com offers both a free (Student and Teacher), ad-supported version and a premium (Student and Teacher), subscription-based version.
The personal information that we collect, use, share, and disclose is dependent upon the version utilized.
While most of Typing.com is a general audience website through which we do not knowingly collect information from children under 13, the teacher portal portion of our site contains features for teachers (such as grading and reporting on performance) designed for students who may be Children.
Information Rights
This website recognizes and complies with GDPR and those rights, except as limited by applicable law.
The rights under GDPR include:

Access: This includes your right to access the personal information we gather about you, and your right to obtain information about the sharing, storage, security and processing of that information.
Correction: This is your right to request correction of your personal information.
Erasure: This is your right to request, subject to certain limitations under applicable law, that your personal information be erased from our possession (also known as the âRight to be forgottenâ).
However, if applicable law requires us to comply with your request to delete your information, fulfillment of your request may prevent you from using Basecamp services and may result in closing your account.
Complain: You have the right to make a complaint regarding our handling of your personal information with the appropriate supervisory authority.
Restrict Processing: This is your right to request restriction of how and why your personal information is used or processed.
Object: This is your right, in certain situations, to object to how or why your personal information is processed.
Portability: This is your right to receive the personal information we have about you and the right to transmit it to another party.
Automated Decision-Making: This is your right to object and prevent any decision that could have a legal, or similarly significant, effect on you from being made solely based on automated processes.
This right is limited, however, if the decision is necessary for performance of any contract between you and us, is allowed by applicable European law, or is based on your explicit consent.
