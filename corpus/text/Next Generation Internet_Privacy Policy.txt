In principle, we do not share your personal data with anyone other than the persons who work for us, as well as with the NGI4ALL project partners and with the suppliers who help us process your personal data.
Anyone who has access to your personal data will always be bound by strict legal or contractual obligations to keep your personal data safe and confidential.
This means that only the following categories of recipients will receive your personal data:

You;
Your employer or business partners, but only when this is necessary for the purposes mentioned above (e.g.

We will only transfer your personal data outside the EEA if you or your employer, as a customer or supplier, have offices outside the EEA with which we need to communicate.
If a transfer were to take place, we will take sufficient safeguards to protect your personal data during the transfer (e.g.
by entering into an agreement based on standard data protection clauses approved by the European Commission).
The NGI initiative is a project funded by the European Commission, meaning that it is a possible that another (consortium of) partner(s) will take over the NGI initiative in the future as a result of a new funding round.

We retain all personal data collected through our website for as long as necessary to protect the legitimate interests stated above.
We retain technical information such as our server log files until 6 months after your visit to our website, after which it will be deleted or de-identified.
We retain all personal data related to an event until 2 years after the event.
All personal data we collect through our interactions with you through telephone, email or other digital communication channels will be retained for as long as necessary to communicate with you, but also to maintain a historical record of our communications.
This allows us to return to previous communications when you come back to us with new questions, requests, comments or other input. 6.

The security and confidentiality of the personal data we process is very important to us.
That is why we have taken measures to ensure that all personal data processed is kept secure.

Weâve also taken other measures, such as taking internal policy measures, limiting the processing to the personal data necessary for the fulfilment of the purposes and minimizing the processing of personal data. 7.
