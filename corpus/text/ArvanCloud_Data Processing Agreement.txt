7.7.2â¯To the extent the Standard Contractual Clauses apply and the Customer reasonably argues and establishes that the above documentation and/or other third party audit reports are not sufficient to demonstrate compliance with the obligations laid down in this DPA, the Customer may execute an audit as outlined under Clause 8.9 of the Standard Contractual Clauses accordingly, provided that in such an event, the parties agree: (a) Customer is responsible for all costs and fees relating to such audit (including for time, cost and materials expended by ArvanCloud).
