Scope of this Policy
This Policy applies to individuals that subscribe to and use any Zix Company Service, as well as individuals that do not subscribe to or use any Zix Service but have sent or received emails to or from users or subscribers of Zix Company Services or who visited the Sites or Apps.
This Policy applies to all information collected through the Sites and Apps, regardless of how you access the Sites or Apps.
That is to say, this Policy applies whether you are accessing our Sites on a computer or on a mobile device like a tablet, or phone.
We may also speak with you face to face (for example at a conference) or by telephone (for example when you make a support call).
Those conversations are also covered by this Policy.
By providing information to us when subscribing, contacting or communicating with us, or using the Sites, Apps, or Services, you expressly agree to this Policy.
This Policy does not apply to information collected through any third party products or services, even if resold by Zix.
Potential Applicability of Other Privacy Policies
You might use Zix Company Services through a web portal provided by us on behalf of our customer, such as your employer, healthcare provider or financial institution.
In that case, your employer, health care provider or financial institution likely also has its own privacy policy that applies to your use of the Zix Services, and both privacy policies apply to you in those situations.
Zix is not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties.
If you are a data subject located in Europe, please see the section below entitled âData Controllerâ for more information on our relationship with our customers.

Depending on your companyâs arrangement with Zix, either Zix or your company (or their respective service providers) maintains the back-end servers that support ZixOne.

As a result, we obtain a limited amount of web surfing history.
If you choose to refer a friend or business entity to Zix, we will ask you for certain information about your friend or a contact at the business entity.
We may contact the referred party using the contact information you provide (such as by email, postal mail, landline phone, and mobile phone, as applicable).
Zix stores this information for its marketing purposes, to track the success of the referral program, and to determine our obligations under the referral program.

Information That We Automatically Collect
Zix automatically receives certain information about your device and how your device interacts with our Site.
Examples of such information include your deviceâs IP address and other device identifiers, device type, browser type (such as ChromeÂ®, FirefoxÂ®, Internet ExplorerÂ® and SafariÂ®), browser language, operating system, referring and exit page, pages visited, number of clicks, domain names, error reports, performance data, and time spent on our Site.
We use various current â and later â developed tracking technologies to collect this information, including cookies, web beacons, and embedded scripts.
Zix combines such information with other types of data it collects about you, such as your email address.
Zix treats any such combined information as personal information under applicable laws and will treat any such information in accordance with this Policy.
IP Address and Location Information
When your Web browser or email application requests content from another device on the Internet, it automatically gives that device the address where the requested information should be sent.
This is called your device's âIP address.â (IP stands for âInternet Protocol.â)
Zix and our service providers receive your IP address each time you obtain content from the Site.
We use your IP address for various purposes, including diagnosing service or technology problems that are associated with your IP address, conducting analytics, and estimating the total number of users visiting the Site from specific locales, countries or regions of the world.
An IP address generally indicates a userâs physical location.
Zix generally does not collect precise location data (such as GPS or mobile device coordinates).
however, when you install certain Apps like Total Defense, you will be asked to grant access to your mobile deviceâs geolocation data.
If you grant such permission, Zix collects information about your precise geolocation information (i.e., your real-time geographic location), and uses that information to provide or customize the Apps with location-based information and features.
IP addresses and access times are linked to your email address, but this combined information is for our internal use only and is not shared with third parties. Logs
When you request content from the Site, information related to that request is collected and stored in log files on our servers.
That information includes the date and time of the request, and the IP address of the device that requested the content.
We use log files for debugging, troubleshooting purposes and delivering messages using DeliverySlip messaging products.
For example, when you send or receive a message using DeliverySlip, we need to collect the content of that message to deliver it to an inbox, display it to the recipient, enable the ability to reply to it, and store it until the recipient decides to delete it.
For messaging functionality, we collect certain kinds of data, such as the content of communications sent or received including attachments such as files for e-signature or documents, photos, music, or videos and the subject line and body of a message.
DeliverySlip encrypts attachments, e-signature documents and the body of messages at rest and transports the content of communications using HTTPS (TLS 1.1 or higher).
Cookies
If you visit the Zix Sites, or use certain Zix Services, Zix and our service providers will set cookies and similar technologies on your computer and/or your mobile device and later access those cookies in order to deliver services.
A cookie is a small text file, which often includes a unique identifier, which is sent to your browser when you visit a Web site.
It is then stored on your computer or mobile device.
Zix uses cookies to allow you to use certain functions when you use various Zix Company Services, and to engage in interest-based digital advertising as described below in the Section entitled âAnalytics and Advertising.â Please read our Cookie Notice for further information about the types of cookies we set including information about how to control or delete cookies.
note that our Cookie Notice does not apply to the Greenview Data or Erado services or websites, including but not limited to SpamStopsHere.
If you do not accept cookies or disable these technologies, you will not be able to use all portions or functionality of our Sites and/or Services. Web Beacons
Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as "clear GIFs"), which are invisible to you, are included in our web pages and e-mail messages.
Web beacons are used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Site, to monitor how users navigate the Site, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular links were actually viewed.
Embedded Scripts
An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Site, such as the links you click on.
The code is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Site, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.
Information That Third Parties Provide About You
We receive information about you from third parties who are lawfully permitted to share your information with us.
For example, if you are on another web site and you provide information that the website operator indicates will be provided to Zix, that website operator will typically forward the information you provide.
We may contact you using the information you provided, in accordance with your communication preferences.
We also combine the information we receive from third parties with information we collect or already maintain in order to ensure the records we hold about you are accurate and up to date, among other things.
For example, if your company provides you with access credentials to the ZixOne App, we receive information about you from your company to provide you with access to the App and your related company Exchange account.
We combine information we receive from your company with information we collect through ZixOne.
In those cases, we will apply this Policy to the combined information, plus any additional restrictions imposed by the source of the data.
To enhance user experience, some DeliverySlip Client Applications provide integration capabilities with Google G Suiteâ¢ and Microsoft Office 365â¢.
In such cases, Zix will have access to emails.
calendar data.
files and folders data, such as those stored in Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive.
and contact data.
In addition, we supplement the information we collect with outside records from third parties in order to provide you with information, services or goods you have requested, to enhance our ability to serve you, and to tailor our content to you.
These third party sources vary over time, but have included data brokers from which we purchase demographic data, third party partners and resellers, our customers, social media platforms, lead generation providers, content sponsors, and publicly-available sources such as open government databases or data in the public domain.
We combine the information we receive from those other sources with information we collect through the Sites, Apps, and/or Services.
In those cases, we will apply this Policy to the combined information, plus any additional restrictions imposed by the source of the data.

Emails and Attachments
Zix uses email message and attachment content in order to provide and improve our products and services.
For example, if you request that Zix host and operate a ZixGateway appliance on your behalf (the Zixâ¢ Hosted Services), we automatically scan outbound email and attachments to determine whether they should be encrypted in accordance with your policies, and to provide you with usage reports and to improve our email filters.
and we collect and retain the content and attachments of outgoing email messages until they are delivered or the messages expire in accordance with your policies.
Likewise, if you subscribe to our advanced threat protection service, we automatically and manually (with your consent) scan inbound email and attachments to protect you against advanced threats and to provide you with usage reports and to improve our email filters.
and we collect and retain the content and attachments of inbound email messages until they are delivered or the messages expire in accordance with your settings.
We primarily use the information we collect when you use the ZixOne App to provide you with access to your Exchange account and in connection with your relationship or your companyâs relationship with Zix.
To provide and enhance App performance, the back-end servers that support ZixOne (which may be hosted by Zix, your company, or their respective service providers) use and retain temporarily (which should usually not exceed a few days) emails, attachments, contacts, calendar items and other Exchange content (collectively âExchange contentâ) that you access and view.
The Exchange content is temporarily cached on your mobile device until you exit the App.
For example, the App accesses and downloads some of your contacts from your Exchange account when you use the App, such as to send an email.
Please be aware that the App, like all other apps, runs in the background on your mobile device until you take steps to exit the App.
Please follow the directions from your mobile device manufacturer in order to exit the App.
The back-end servers sometimes retain Exchange content even after you exit the App. Employment Applications
If you use the Site to apply to work with us (for example via www.zixc.com/company/careers) we will use the information you supply to process your application and to monitor recruitment statistics.
We retain statistical information about applicants to help inform our recruitment activities.
Zix is headquartered in the United States and employee and recruitment data is held there and in other Zix locations worldwide.
Once a person has taken up employment with us, we will compile a file relating to their employment.
At that stage we will give the employee more details about how we hold employee data.

We contractually require that those Service Providers use information they obtain from Zix solely for the purpose of providing these services, although we permit them to use aggregate information that does not identify you for other purposes.

Following is additional information about the vendors with whom we work across all our various product offerings. Zix and its affiliates may also provide these types of services in providing the Services to you.

However, to the extent the California Consumer Privacy Act (âCCPAâ) is interpreted to include advertising technology activities such as those disclosed below in the Section entitled âAnalytics and Advertisingâ as a âsale,â Zix will comply with applicable law as to such activity.
For more information about how to opt-out of sale of personal information, see the Section below entitled âCalifornia Resident Rights.â
We use testimonials from our customers, with their express consent, in order to show our customers and potential customers how Zix services have benefited others.

In some cases, we may not be able to remove your information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
Without limiting the foregoing, Zix shares with certain business partners, advertisers, and other third parties certain aggregated or de-identified data that does not identify you, and email metadata (such as domains of senders and recipients), for various purposes, including marketing, except as prohibited by applicable law.
Analytics and Advertising
To analyze traffic to our Sites (excluding zixmessagecenter.com and zixmessagecentre.com), Zix uses various web analytics services, which independently set and access their own tracking technologies (including cookies, web beacons, and embedded scripts) and collect or have access to information about you.
In addition, Zix works with network advertisers and ad agencies to serve our advertisements on other web sites, within third party applications, and across the Internet, and to provide us with information regarding the effectiveness of our advertisements.
For example, if you clicked on a Zix advertisement that led you to one of our corporate sites, our service provider(s) and we can often determine which Zix advertisement you clicked on and where you were viewing the advertisement.
However, Zixâs advertising providers do not receive information regarding your use of the ZixMessage Center or your Greenview Data or Erado accounts, such as any URL you access within the message center or email message content you view.
We also target advertisements based on your IP address and your web browsing activity on non-Zix websites.
Zixâs advertising providers also store cookies and other tracking technologies on your device.

We are not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-partiesâ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.
The Zix Companies have always considered our advertising technology partners to be Service Providers.
However, regulators may interpret newer data protection laws such as the CCPA as characterizing certain kinds of digital advertising activities as âsales.â In such an event, Zix will comply with applicable laws in connection with its use of such advertising technology services on its Sites, Apps, or Services.
Social Features
Some of our Sites offer publicly accessible blogs or community forums.
You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas can be read, collected, and used by others who access them.

Social features include enabling you to âlikeâ or âshareâ our content on other web sites or services, such as Facebook, Google+, Twitter, or LinkedIn.

Security
Zix takes reasonable precautions, including the maintenance of reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards, to help protect your information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized or illegal access, disclosure, alteration, modification, use or destruction.
Zix has implemented reasonable security measures to help protect your email address and the Zix service passwords associated with your email address from unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, unlawful destruction or accidental loss.
When appropriate, Zix uses industry-standard encryption to protect certain data (e.g., credit card numbers) during transmission.
The servers on which we store your information are kept in an environment that is controlled and monitored 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.
Although Zix uses reasonable efforts to help protect your information, transmission via the Internet, Wi-Fi or mobile network is not completely secure and Zix cannot guarantee the security of your information.
In particular, it remains your responsibility:

To protect against unauthorized access to your use of the Sites and Services.
To ensure no one else uses the Sites or Services while your machine is logged on to the Sites or Services (including by logging on to your machine through a mobile, Wi-Fi or shared access connection you are using).
To log off or exit from the Sites and Services when not using them.
To keep your password or other access information secret and all of your account details secure.
Your Zix Company Service passwords and log in details are personal to you and should not be given to anyone else or used to provide shared access, for example, over a network.
To maintain good Internet security.
For example if your email account is compromised, this could allow access to your account with us.
If your email account is compromised it could be used to ask us to reset a password and gain access to your account with us.

If you think that any of your accounts has been compromised you should change your account credentials with us, and in particular make sure any compromised account (even one from another service) does not allow access to your account with us.
Never use the same passwords for different accounts (among the Zix Company Services or with respect to other unrelated services).
You should also tell us as soon as you can so that we can try to help you keep your account secure and if necessary warn anyone else who could be affected. Data Storage
Most account information (including email addresses, public keys, names, and mailing addresses, but excluding credit card information used for payment to Zix) is stored on multiple disk storage systems at our data centers in the United States or the United Kingdom or on servers in Canada, Singapore, and Amsterdam.
This means that we redundantly store data on more than one server in one of those locations.
We also store email messages on servers outside the United States and the United Kingdom including on servers in Canada, Singapore, and Amsterdam.
Zix stores only the salted hash of a Zix service password.
This means that we donât hold your Zix service password itself but rather a unique encrypted version of it.
ZixMessage Center email messages that you send or receive via Zix services will ordinarily expire from our disk storage systems based on the expiration time set by the sender at the time the email was sent (1 to 365 days from the day the email message was sent).
If you request deletion of your Zix service account, that account will be deactivated and your email address and information will be removed from our user registration database associated with that Zix service within 30 days, subject to any need we have to hold onto the data for longer to meet any legal, auditing or regulatory requirements and subject to any commitments we have given to third parties â for example your employer if your employer paid for your Zix Company Service account.
You can also request deletion of all your Zix Company Service accounts.
If we do delete any of your accounts, those accounts will be reinitiated if another email is sent to you using a Zix Company Service.
Email header information maintained for purposes of transaction logging, and user account information maintained for disaster recovery purposes, will be held longer than the content of email messages, as described above, in order to provide Zix Company Services, and support, including technical support and business continuity, to our customers.
If you use advanced threat protection services, including ZixProtect and SpamStopsHere, there will be particular points in time when the content of email messages and attachments (including non-spam messages) will not be encrypted, including but not limited to during spooling for delivery and on the way to quarantine.
Further, if you choose to use the manual review option, the content of those emails and attachments will be stored in unencrypted form for purposes of manual review. Guidelines Regarding Children
Zixâs Site, and Zix Company products and Services, are not designed for or directed to children under the age of 16, and Zix does not knowingly collect personal information as defined by the Childrenâs Online Privacy Protection Act (âCOPPAâ) or personal information as defined under the CCPA from anyone under the age of 16.
If you are under the age of 16, please do not provide personal information of any kind whatsoever and please do not use Zix products and services or participate in Zixâs surveys, contests, events, and other promotions.< Your California Privacy Rights Shine the Light Customer Rights
When California customers provide personal information as defined by Californiaâs âShine the Lightâ to a business, they have the right to request certain disclosures if that business shares the personal information (as narrowly defined under the Shine the Light law) with third parties or affiliates for the third partiesâ or affiliatesâ direct marketing purposes.
Once per calendar year the customer has the right to request that the business provide a list of companies with which it shares the personal information for the third partiesâ or affiliatesâ direct marketing purposes, and a list of the categories of personal information that the business shares.
As stated in this Policy, we do not share personal information as defined under the Shine the Light law with third parties or affiliates for those third partiesâ or affiliatesâ direct marketing purposes.
California customers can request further information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing privacy@zixcorp.com or contacting us by mail at 2711 N.
Haskell Avenue, Suite 2200, LB 36, Dallas, Texas 75204-2960, USA.
Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this e-mail address.
California Consumer Rights Under the CCPA
If you are a California resident and a consumer customer of Zix, which in most cases means you are a customer of Total Defense, you have the right effective January 1, 2020, to request access to personal information we have collected about you, and to request other disclosures regarding the categories of personal information we have disclosed about you for business purposes or commercial purposes and regarding the categories of personal information we have sold about you, over the last 12 months.
You will also have the right effective January 1, 2020, to request that we delete personal information we hold about you if we collected the information directly from you.
The Zix Companies, including Zix and AppRiver, generally provide services to business customers, not individual consumers.
 If you represent a business, you do not have rights to request access to our deletion of your information pursuant to the CCPA.
To exercise your access or deletion rights as a California resident consumer customer email us at privacy@totaldefense.com, call us at (855) 221-9691 or contact us through our online privacy request form.
Effective January 1, 2020, to the extent Zix sells your personal information as the term âsellâ is defined under CCPA, you have the right to opt-out of sales of your personal information to third parties at any time. Zix does not sell personal information as the term âsellâ is traditionally understood.
However, to the extent the CCPA is interpreted to include advertising technology activities such as those disclosed in the âAnalytics and Advertisingâ section of our policy as a âsale,â Zix will comply with applicable law as to such activity.
Please click the button below if you wish to opt-out of the sale of your personal information.
Do Not Sell My Information
As of the posting of this updated privacy policy, certain provisions of the CCPA are still in flux and may change.
Zix reserves the right to revise the sections of this policy that are impacted by those changes until such time as the regulations are finalized.
Given the potential changes in the law, the rights available to California residents may change at any time.
European Privacy Rights
If you are a data subject in Europe, you have the right to access, rectify, or erase any personal data we have collected about you.
You also have the right to data portability and the right to restrict or object to our processing of personal data we have collected about you.
In addition, you have the right to ask us not to process your personal data (or provide it to third parties to process) for marketing purposes or purposes materially different than for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you.
You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time for any data processing we do based on consent you have provided to us.
To exercise any of these rights, contact us as set forth in the section entitled âPrivacy Policy Questions, Suggestions and Complaintsâ below and specify which right you intend to exercise.
We will respond to your request within 30 days.
We sometimes require additional information from you to allow us to confirm your identity.
Please note that we store information as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected, and continue to retain and use the information even after a data subject request for purposes of our legitimate interests, including as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent fraud, and enforce our agreements.
If your information has been processed by us on behalf of one of our customers and you wish to exercise any rights you have with such information, please inquire with our customer directly.
If you wish to make your request directly to Zix, please provide the name of the Zix customer on whose behalf Zix processes your information.
We will refer your request to that customer, and will support them to the extent required by applicable law in responding to your request.
If you have any issues with our compliance, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a European supervisory authority.
Data Controller
EU data protection law makes a distinction between organizations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as âcontrollersâ) and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as âprocessorsâ).
In limited circumstances, Zix (located at the address set forth in the section entitled âPurpose of this Policyâ above) operates as a controller, such as in connection with data collected from non-subscribers who browse its Site and when Zix Company Services involves a direct to consumer relationship.
However, Zix generally operates as a processor on behalf of its customers that use the Zix services.
The customers are the data controllers and determine the purposes for which and the manner in which personal data are to be processed by Zix.
Please visit the applicable customerâs privacy policy for information about their privacy practices.
Any questions that you have relating to such personal data and your rights under data protection law should therefore be directed to the customer as the controller, not to Zix.
Moreover, Zix has partnerships with resellers who offer Zix Services directly to consumers.
The resellers are controllers of the personal data they collect while offering and selling Zix Services to consumers.
Please direct any questions you may have regarding personal data collected or processed by resellers of Zix Services to the reseller, not to Zix.
Lawful Basis for Processing
Data protection laws in Europe require a âlawful basisâ for processing personal data.
When we operate as a controller, our lawful bases include where: (a) you have given consent to the processing for one or more specific purposes.
(b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you.
(c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation.
or (d) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or a third party, and your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms do not override those interests.
Our legitimate interests include direct marketing and fraud prevention, among other things.
Privacy Shield

This means that, in addition to our other obligations under the Privacy Shield Principles, we shall be liable to you for any third party agent to which we transfer your personal data and that processes such personal data in a manner that violates the Privacy Shield Principles, unless we can demonstrate that we are not responsible for the resulting damages.
