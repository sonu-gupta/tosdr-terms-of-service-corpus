To Provide Requested Information or Materials.
For example, we may use Personal Information to deliver materials requested about a specific product, to answer a question asked about how a product works, or to deliver a requested product download or license keys for product licenses purchased.

To Market Our Products and Services. For example, we may use Personal Information to provide marketing and promotional information about products and services that Veeam offers.
Information you have provided to third parties may be combined with information we already have about you and may be used to create more tailored advertising and products.
For information about how you can opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us at any time, or withdraw your consent to receive such communications, see the section titled âYour Data Privacy Rights.â

For Business Analytics. For example, we may use Personal Information to track behavior at the aggregate/anonymous level to identify and understand trends in usage and the various interactions with our websites and marketing content and determining the effectiveness of our marketing.

For Website Optimization. For example, we may use Personal Information to administer our website and for internal operations of the website, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research, and statistical purposes.
to improve user experience.
and as a part of our efforts to keep our websites safe and secure.

To Comply With Our Legal Obligations. For example, we may use Personal Information to identify website visitors, including for account authentication purposes.
to carry out our obligations and enforce our rights arising from any agreement to which Veeam is a party.

Note that some of Veeamâs websites contain interactive elements, such as discussion forums and blogs that allow individual users to publish their own content which will then be made available to other users.
Any information posted on these blogs and forums becomes public, which means it could be read, collected or used by other users in any manner.


Lawful Bases for Processing. In certain jurisdictions, we may only process Personal Information if we have a lawful basis on which to do so.
The lawful bases for the processing described above includes:

Performance of the Contract. Sometimes, such as when we use your contact information to send you information you have requested, the reason we process Personal Information is to perform the service which you have requested of Veeam.

Legitimate Interests. In many cases we process data because it is in our legitimate interest to do so, and that interest is not overridden by your privacy interests.
This applies, for example, when we process Personal Information as part of our fraud prevention program, where our legitimate interest is in ensuring the appropriate use of our services and products, or to collect business analytics data, where our legitimate interest is in improving our business, services, and products.

Consent. In some cases, we do not process your Personal Information unless we have your consent to do so.
In particular, we will not send you marketing materials unless you have consented to receiving them.

Legal Obligation. In some cases, we collect, process, and share Personal Information because we have a legal obligation to do so.
For example, if we are subject to valid legal process, we may have no choice but to provide the sought after information.

marketing, education, distribution, and reseller partners, online marketplaces, data hosters and other service providers to or for Veeam) to perform one or more of the functions or purposes outlined above on Veeamâs behalf.

Generally

Veeam is a global company, and we collect personal information from individuals all over the world.
We strive to comply with all applicable privacy and data security laws around the globe, including GDPR, the California Consumer Privacy Act (âCCPAâ), and other applicable laws.
To that end, we offer a number of tools to help maximize your control over the information Veeam may have about you.
If you have consented to receive communications, you can manage what information you receive from Veeam about products and services and how such information is received by specifying your communication preferences and subscription details at the subscription preferences page.

In the event you choose not to provide certain Personal Information, we may not be able to respond completely or adequately to your questions, provide updates, and/or information about our products and services.
We will however continue to use your Personal Information for the limited purpose of sending you important notices relating to information about your purchases, changes to our policies and agreements, or for other reasons permitted by applicable law.

Your GDPR and California Privacy Rights.

Where GDPR and CCPA applies to the Personal Information we have collected, you may have certain rights you can exercise under certain circumstances.
These may include:

Right to Non-Discrimination: Veeam will not discriminate against you for exercising any of these rights.

Right to Lodge a Complaint: Under GDPR to lodge a complaint with an appropriate data protection authority if you have concerns about how we process your Personal Information.



Veeam does not âsellâ your Personal Information.


Some of these rights can be exercised at the subscription preferences page.
For example, you can correct certain of the Personal Information we have about you, you can withdraw consent for or object to certain processing, and you can restrict certain processing.
For any other requests to exercise your GDPR and CCPA privacy rights, please email us at privacy@veeam.com or send us your request by filling in this form.
Note that to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of your Personal Information, we may need to verify your identity before processing your request.
In some cases we may need to collect additional information to verify your identity, such as a government issued ID.
Finally, under the CCPA you may exercise these rights yourself or you may designate an authorized agent to make these requests on your behalf.
If you choose to do that, we may seek additional information to ensure that you have actually designated the agent to make the request. Data Security Veeam takes the security of Personal Information seriously.
To protect Personal Information against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration, Veeam uses risk-based technical and organizational security measures reasonably designed to prevent any unauthorized disclosure or access.
For example, Veeam has implemented strict security controls, intrusion detection software and processes to alert us in the case of a potential or actual intrusion of our information systems.
Storing and Transferring Personal Information Veeam is a global organization so the information you provide to Veeam may be transferred or accessed by Veeam corporate entities in Switzerland and other countries around the world.
No matter where Veeam stores or accesses Personal Information, it is collected, used, shared, and protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice.
Veeam uses approved Standard Contractual Clauses for the transfer of Personal Information collected in the European Economic Area and Switzerland to third countries.
Veeam also abides by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Cross Border Privacy Rules System.
The APEC CBPR system provides a framework for organizations to ensure protection of Personal Information transferred among participating APEC economies.  Childrenâs Privacy Veeam will not knowingly collect Personal Information from any person that is not a legal adult, as defined by local law, without insisting that they seek prior parental consent, if such consent is required by applicable law.
Veeam does not target children in connection with its products, services, and websites.
In the event Veeam uses or discloses Personal Information of a person that is not a legal adult, Veeam will seek parental consent pursuant to local laws and regulations in order to protect the person that is not a legal adult.
