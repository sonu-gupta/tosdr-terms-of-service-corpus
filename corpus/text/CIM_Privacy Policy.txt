Online Advertising

We endeavor, in good faith, to adhere to self-regulatory advertising principles, such as the Digital Advertising Allianceâs Principles.
If you are interested in learning more about and/or opting out of online behavioral advertising, sometimes called interest-based advertising, we encourage you to visit one of the advertising industry-developed opt-out pages, such as www.youradchoices.com or aboutads.info.
Please note that while we provide these links for your convenience, we do not have access to, or control over, these third partiesâ use of cookies or other tracking technologies.  

Protecting Your Personal Information

We implement and maintain reasonable security appropriate to the nature of the personal information that we collect, use, retain, transfer or otherwise process. Our policy is to restrict access to your personal information to only those employees, service providers and other third parties who need to know that information to provide products or services to you.
We maintain commercially reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards consistent with industry standards and other applicable standards as required by law and we require service providers and third parties to do the same.
While we are committed to developing, implementing, maintaining, monitoring and updating a reasonable information security program, unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.&nbsp.
Data security incidents and breaches can occur due to vulnerabilities, criminal exploits or other factors that cannot reasonably be prevented.&nbsp.
Accordingly, while our reasonable security program is designed to manage data security risks and thus help prevent data security incidents and breaches, it cannot be assumed that the occurrence of any given incident or breach results from our failure to implement and maintain reasonable security.
As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control.
(b) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through the website cannot be guaranteed.
and (c) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party.  

Retention 

We keep your personal information for as long as it is required by us for our legitimate business purposes, to perform our contractual obligations, or where longer, such longer period as is required by law or regulatory obligations which apply to us.
While we generally retain information about you throughout the life cycle of any investment you are involved in and for no longer than we need it, some personal information may be retained after your relationship with us ends.  

Links to Third-Party Websites

Our websites may contain links to websites operated and maintained by third parties, over which we have no control.
Privacy policies on such linked websites may be different from our Privacy Policy.
You access such linked websites at your own risk.
You should always read the Privacy Policy of a linked website before disclosing any personal information on such website.  

Policy Changes

To improve the services we can offer you, CIM may opt to expand our capabilities for obtaining information, including personal information, about users in the future.
CIM will update this Privacy Policy when necessary to ensure that you are aware of developments in this area.
We will post those changes on our websites and update our Privacy Policy so that you will know what information we collect online, how we use it and what choices you have.
Please be sure to check this page before proceeding to use our websites.
Regardless of any changes we make to our Privacy Policy, we will always use your personal information in accordance with the version of the Privacy Policy in place at the time you provided your information, unless you give your express consent for us to do otherwise.  

Additional Privacy Terms

In conducting business with CIM or using our websites, you may be required to agree to additional written or electronic agreements, including additional privacy terms and conditions (âAdditional Privacy Termsâ), as a condition to visiting the websites or receiving products, services and other information.
In the event of any conflict between the Additional Privacy Terms and this Privacy Policy, the Additional Privacy Terms shall prevail but we will treat personal information that you provide to us before we adopt such Additional Privacy Terms in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy, unless and until you agree with the application of the Additional Privacy Terms to your personal information collected by us prior to the updates or amendments.
