Our main goal is to provide information and network security by providing quality solutions and services while respecting privacy and personal data of customers, Internet users, and business partners.
This personal data notice describes what data we process as business contacts and how we may use it.
Most of the business contacts are not personal data, as they relate to the organization's data (e.g we might collect data such as name, surname, email or phone number).
Even though these data are being collected as Business Contacts , they may be used to identify the data subjects and therefore we treat them as personal data. 2.

as contact data for the organizations that have contracts (or have taken steps to conclude a contract) for Bitdefender Solutions and services or its resellers;
invoicing and reporting;
support or counseling to these business contacts on commercial or solution issues;
marketing activities for Bitdefender and not third parties;
statistical analysis and market analysis, based on aggregated data.
