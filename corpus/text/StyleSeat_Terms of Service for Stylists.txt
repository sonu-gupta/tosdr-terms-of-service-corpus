If your available StyleSeat balance is insufficient to cover the refund, StyleSeat will request your authorization to withdraw up to the requested refund amount from your bank account or debit card.
StyleSeat will then withdraw the amount you were paid (the sale amount minus the initial transaction fee) from your bank account or debit card, and credit it back into your Client's Card.
The fees are also refunded by StyleSeat, so the full purchase amount is always returned to your Client.
StyleSeat has no obligation to accept any returns of any of your goods or services on your behalf. Liability for Chargebacks and Fraudulent Actions The amount of a transaction may be reversed or charged back to your Account (a "Chargeback") if the transaction (a) is disputed, (b) is reversed for any reason by the Network, our processor, or a Client or our financial institution, (c) was not authorized or we have any reason to believe that the transaction was not authorized, (d) is allegedly unlawful, suspicious, or in violation of the terms of these Terms of Service.
StyleSeat is not liable for any losses relating to Chargebacks, fraudulent charges, or other actions by any User that are deceptive, fraudulent or otherwise invalid as determined in StyleSeat's sole discretion ("Fraudulent Actions").
By using the Services, you hereby release StyleSeat from any liability arising from Fraudulent Actions.
You will also use best efforts to promptly notify StyleSeat of any Fraudulent Actions which may affect the Services.
StyleSeat reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate the account of any User that engages in, or enables any other User to engage in, Fraudulent Actions. StyleSeat Collection Rights for Chargebacks For any transaction that results in a Chargeback, we may withhold the Chargeback amount in a Reserve.
We may debit the amount of any Chargeback and any associated fees, fines, or penalties listed in the Fee Schedule or assessed by the Association or our processor from your Account (including without limitation any Reserve), any proceeds due to you, your bank account or debit card, or other payment instrument registered with us.
If you have pending Chargebacks, we may delay payouts from your Account.
Further, if we reasonably believe that a Chargeback is likely with respect to any transaction, we may withhold the amount of the potential Chargeback from payments otherwise due to you under these Terms of Service until such time that: (a) a Chargeback is assessed due to a Client's complaint, in which case we will retain the funds.
(b) the period of time under applicable law or regulation by which the Client may dispute that the transaction has expired.
or (c) we determine that a Chargeback on the transaction will not occur.
If we are unable to recover funds related to a Chargeback for which you are liable, you will pay us the full amount of the Chargeback immediately upon demand.
You agree to pay all costs and expenses, including without limitation attorneys' fees and other legal expenses, incurred by or on behalf of us in connection with the collection of all Account deficit balances unpaid by you. Excessive Chargebacks If we determine that you are incurring an excessive amount of Chargebacks, we may establish controls or conditions governing your Account, including without limitation, by (a) establishing new processing fees, (b) creating a Reserve in an amount reasonably determined by us to cover anticipated Chargebacks and related fees, (c) delaying payouts, and (d) terminating or suspending the Services. Contesting Chargebacks You agree to assist us when requested, at your expense, to investigate any of your transactions processed through the Services.
To that end, you permit us to share information about a Chargeback with the Client, the Client's financial institution, and your financial institution in order to investigate and/or mediate a Chargeback.
We will request necessary information from you to contest the Chargeback.
If the Chargeback is contested successfully, we will release the reserved funds to your Account.
If a Chargeback dispute is not resolved in your favor by the Network or issuing bank or you choose not to contest the Chargeback, we may recover the Chargeback amount and any associated fees as described in these Terms of Service.
You acknowledge that your failure to assist us in a timely manner when investigating a transaction, including providing necessary documentation within five (5) days of our request, may result in an irreversible Chargeback.
We reserve the right, upon notice to you, to charge a fee for mediating and/or investigating Chargeback disputes. StyleSeat Set-off Rights You grant us a security interest in, as well as a right of setoff against, and hereby assign, convey, deliver, pledge and transfer to us, as security for repayment of any obligations due under these Terms of Service, all of your right, title, and interest in and to all of your accounts with us.
However, this grant will not apply to any accounts for which the grant of a security interest would be prohibited by law.
You authorize us, without prior notice to you and irrespective of (i) whether we have made demand under these Terms of Service or any other related agreements.
and (ii) whether the obligation is contingent, matured or unmatured, to the extent permitted by law, to collect, charge, and/or setoff all sums owing on the indebtedness against any and all such accounts and other obligations, and our option, to administratively freeze or direct any third party bank holding the account to freeze all such accounts to allow us to protect our security interest, collection, charge and setoff rights as provided for in this section.
To the extent permitted by law, we may set off against the balances for any obligation you owe us under these Terms of Service, including without limitation any Chargebacks.
All fees are charged at the time we process a transaction and are deducted first from the transferred or collected funds and thereafter from the balance in your Account.
If you owe us an amount that exceeds your balance, we may charge or debit a payment instrument registered in your Account or any connected Account (as well as set off against any balance in any connected Account).
Your failure to fully pay amounts that you owe us on demand will be a breach of these Terms of Service.
You will be liable for our costs associated with collection in addition to the amount owed, including without limitation attorneys' fees and expenses, collection agency fees, and any applicable interest. Inactive Accounts If there is no activity in your Account (including access or payment transactions) for at least two years, consecutively, and you have a balance, we will notify you by sending an email to the email address associated with your Account and give you the option of keeping your Account open and maintaining the balance, withdrawing the balance, or requesting a check.
If you do not respond to our notice within thirty days, we will automatically close your Account and escheat your funds in accordance with applicable law, and if permitted, to StyleSeat. Processing Errors We will attempt to rectify processing errors that we discover.
If the error resulted in your receipt of less than the amount to which you were entitled, StyleSeat will credit your Account for the difference.
If the error results in your receipt of more than the amount to which you were entitled, StyleSeat will debit the extra funds from your Account.
StyleSeat will only correct transactions that you process incorrectly if and when you notify us of such an error.
Your failure to notify us of a processing error within thirty days of when it first appears on your electronic transaction history will be deemed a waiver of any right to amounts owed to you. Professional's Loyalty Programs Professionals may offer loyalty programs to Clients.

Your address for such notices is your billing address, with an email copy to the email address you have provided to StyleSeat.
StyleSeat's address for such notices is StyleSeat, Inc., Attention: Legal, 548 Market St, PMB 80095, San Francisco, CA 94104-5401. Binding Arbitration If you and StyleSeat are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, all claims arising from use of the Services (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) shall be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.
Any election to arbitrate by one party will be final and binding on the other.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IF EITHER PARTY ELECTS TO ARBITRATE, NEITHER PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL.
The arbitration will be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and, where appropriate, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org.
Your arbitration fees and your share or arbitrator compensation will be governed by the AAA Rules (and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules).

Nothing in this arbitration provision will prevent either party from bringing an individual action in small claims court or to seek injunctive or other equitable relief on an individual basis in a federal or state court in San Francisco County, California, with respect to any dispute related to the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's intellectual property or proprietary rights. Waiver of Right to be a Plaintiff or Class Member in a Purported Class Action or Representative Proceeding.
You and StyleSeat agree that any arbitration will be limited to the Dispute between StyleSeat and you individually.

Arbitration will take place in San Francisco County, California.
You and StyleSeat agree that for any Dispute not subject to arbitration (other than claims proceeding in any small claims court), or where no election to arbitrate has been made, the California state and Federal courts located in San Francisco, California have exclusive jurisdiction and you and StyleSeat agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the subsection entitled "Exceptions to Alternative Dispute Resolution" in Section 15 is found to be illegal or unenforceable, neither you or StyleSeat will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of that subsection that is found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute will be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within San Francisco, California, and you and StyleSeat agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
Except as expressly provided otherwise, these Terms of Service are governed by, and will be construed under, the laws of the State of California, without regard to choice of law principles.
