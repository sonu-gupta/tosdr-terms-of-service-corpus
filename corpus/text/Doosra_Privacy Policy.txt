In this policy, we lay out what data we collect, the rationale behind it and how your data is handled.
This policy applies to all products built and maintained by Ten20 Infomedia Private Limited.Information CollectionWe are a privacy-focused company and our thesis is to collect the least amount of information needed to deliver the product to you.
Below are the aspects of data collection that you should know about:IdentifiersDuring the sign-up process, we ask for your primary mobile number, name and an email address(which is optional).
Since Doosra is a virtual number, you can choose to forward certain calls to your primary number.
We may also send important SMSes to your mobile number (account expiry, OTP verification during sign-up or other essential information) from time to time.
We use the name to personalise your account and to address you in communication.
The email address is optional and used to send over relevant product updates from Doosra.
We will never sell your personal information to any third party.
Period.Billing dataWe use a 3rd party payment processor for all payments made to Doosra.
That third party (may), at the time of first payment, mandates certain information such as mobile number and email.
Thatâs so we can charge you for service, calculate taxes due, and send you invoices.
Your credit card is passed directly to the payment processor and doesnât go through our servers.
We keep a record of the transaction to help with any clarifications or questions in the future.KYC dataCertain products such as Doosra Pro require users to undergo the standard e-KYC process.
This is done to ensure our services are compliant with prevailing regulations.
We store the userâs picture along with the copy of the identity proof.
both of which are mandatory to conduct an effective e-KYC.
 Upon termination of the user, the data is deleted as per the âData Management upon deletionâ policy described in this document.Geo-location dataWe keep a log of all accounts access by IP address so that we can always verify that no unauthorized access has ever happened.
This data is retained with us as long as the account is active.
We also log full IP addresses during the sign-up process forever to eliminate or reduce unauthorised or fake sign-ups.
Web analytics tools are also tied temporarily to IP addresses to assist with any troubleshooting needs in the future.
Website interactionsWhen you browse our web pages or applications, your browser automatically shares certain information such as which OS and browser version you are using.
We track that information, along with the pages you are visiting, to optimize the performance of the website, mobile apps and to test new product offerings or designs.
We may also track specific click-streams to help inform some design decisions.
CookiesWe do use persistent first-party cookies and approved 3rd party cookies from web analytics tools to store certain preferences, making it easier for you to use our applications.
A cookie is a piece of text stored by your browser to help it remember your login information, site preferences, and more.
You can adjust the settings in your own browser.
OutreachWhen you write Doosra with a question or to ask for help, we keep that correspondence, including the phone number and email address (if provided to us), so that we have a history of past correspondences to reference if you reach out in the future.
What information we do not collectWe donât collect any demographic, psychographic or personally-identifiable information (other than those described in the Section: Identity and Access - when writing into our Support team.)
Information access and sharingOur default practice is to not access your information.
The only times weâll ever access or share your info are:



To provide products or services youâve requestedâWe do use some third-party services to run our applications and only to the extent necessary process some or all of your personal information via these third parties.
No Doosra human looks at your data for these purposes.

To help you troubleshoot and resolve a software issue, with your permission
If at any point we need to access your account to help you with a Support case, we will ask for your consent before proceeding.

To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding restricted uses
Accessing a customerâs account when investigating potential abuse is a measure of last resort.
We have an obligation to protect the privacy and safety of both our customers and the people reporting issues to us.
We do our best to balance those responsibilities throughout the process.
If we do discover you are using our products for a restricted purpose, we will report the incident to the appropriate authorities.
âWhen required under applicable law
If the appropriate law enforcement authorities have the necessary warrant, or court order requiring us to share data, we have to comply.
And unless weâre legally prevented from it, weâll always inform you when such requests are made. If Ten20 Infomedia Private Limited is acquired by or merged with another company â weâll notify you well before any info about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Data locationOur products and other web properties are operated in India.
If you are located in the European Union or elsewhere outside of India, please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to India.
By using our site, participating in any of our services and/or providing us with your information, you consent to this transfer.
Data securityAll data is encrypted via SSL/TLS when transmitted from our servers to your browser.
The database backups are also encrypted.
All messages sent to your Doosraâs servers are encrypted and can be decrypted with the key generated for your account on your mobile app.
The people at Doosra do not have access to those messages.
Other data is not encrypted while they live in our database (since it needs to be ready to send to you when you need it), but we go to great lengths to secure your data at rest.
Data management after deletionIn many of our applications, we give you the option to trash data.
Anything you trash on your product accounts while they are active will be kept in an accessible trash can for up to 30 days (it varies a little by product).
After that, the trashed data are no longer accessible via the application and are deleted from our active servers within the next 30 days.
We also have some backups of our application databases, which are kept for up to another 30 days.
In total, when you trash things in our applications, they are purged within 90 days from all of our systems and logs.
We also delete your data after an account is cancelled.
