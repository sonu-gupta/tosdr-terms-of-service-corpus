COOKIE POLICY

Last updated: 12 January 2021

When you visit, access, or use the website, mobile site, application, electronic newsletter or widget that links to this Cookie Policy (collectively âSiteâ) the Foxtel Group (âwe,â âusâ, âourâ) (see section 14 of our Privacy Policy) use cookies and other tracking technologies to deliver and improve the Site, and to display relevant content, products, services and advertising.
This Cookie Policy explains these technologies, including cookies, local storage, pixels, web beacons, and flash cookies, and how you can control them.
In this policy, we will refer to all these technologies as âCookiesâ.
We hope that this Cookie Policy helps you understand, and feel more confident about, our use of Cookies.
If you have any further queries or requests, please contact us (see section 13 of our Privacy Policy).
By using the Site, you agree that we can use these Cookies as described in this Cookie Policy.
We may change this Cookie Policy at any time.
Any changes in this Cookie Policy will become effective when we make the revised Cookie Policy available on or through the Site.
1. WHAT IS A COOKIE?
Cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies and local storage, pixel beacons, web server logs and Adobe Flash technology including cookies) are comprised of small bits of data or code that often include a de-identified or anonymous unique identifier.
Websites, apps and other services send this data to your browser (on your computer or mobile device) when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer so that such websites, apps and other services can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that service.
They are widely used in order to make websites work, or work in a better, more efficient way.
For example, they can recognise you and remember important information that will make your use of a website more convenient (e.g.
by remembering your user preferences).
2.
WHAT COOKIES DO WE USE?
We use a variety of different types of Cookies on our Sites.
Different Cookies have different specific purposes but in general they are all used so that we can improve your experience in using our Sites and interacting with us.
Some of the purposes of different Cookies we use are described below.
(A)&nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
 Some Cookies are essential to the Site in order to facilitate our log-in process and enable you to move around it and to use its features.
Without these Cookies, we may not be able to provide certain services or features, and the Site will not perform as smoothly for you as we would like.
(B)        &nbsp.
We may use Cookies to allow us to remember the choices you make while browsing the Site, and to provide enhanced and more personalised content and features, such as customising a certain webpage, providing relevant advertising or editorial content, remembering if we have asked you to participate in a promotion and for other services you request, like watching a video or commenting on a blog.
(C)        &nbsp.
We may use Cookies to receive and record information about your computer, device, and browser, potentially including your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information.
If you access the Site from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device (âUDIDâ), geolocation data, or other transactional information for that device.
(D)        &nbsp.
We and our service providers and advertisers may use analytics Cookies, which are sometimes called performance cookies, to collect information about your use of the Site and enable us to improve the way it works.
Analytics Cookies collect information about how you use the Site, for instance, which pages you go to most, email and advertising views, click throughs and your frequent searches.
The information allows us to see the overall patterns of usage on the Site, help us record any difficulties you have with the Site and show us whether our advertising is effective or not.
(E)        &nbsp.
We and our service providers and advertisers may use advertising Cookies to deliver ads that we believe are more relevant to you and your interests.
For example, we may use targeting or advertising Cookies to limit the number of times you see the same ad on our Site, to help measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns as well as to customise the advertising and content you receive on our Site.
(F)         Social plug-in tracking Cookies can be used to track both members and non-members of social networks for additional purposes such as behavioural advertising, analytics, and market research.
We aggregate information received from the various Cookies placed on your browser by our connected network of sites including FOX SPORTS Australia, Foxtel, and News Corp Australia.
We may also link our anonymous Cookie IDâs with the anonymous Cookie IDâs used by third parties, including some of our service providers.
This improves our ability to provide you with more relevant editorial, marketing and advertising content based on your activity across our connected network.
We may also associate your browser and/or device with other browsers or devices you use.
All information derived from these Cookies may be combined with other information acquired from third parties, and we may share this information with other organisations, such as advertisers, provided it is anonymised.
For more information relating to this see our Privacy Policy.
3.
HOW DO THIRD PARTIES USE COOKIES ON THE SITE?
In some circumstances, we may work with third parties to provide certain services on our Site.
For example, we use analytics services supported by third party companies who generate analytics Cookies on our behalf, including Google Analytics (see section 4 below for information about opting out).
We may not have access to these Cookies, although we may use statistical information arising from the Cookies provided by these third parties to customise content and for the other purposes described above.
These companies may also transfer this information to other parties including where they are required to do so by law, or where such other parties process the information on their behalf.
Third-party advertisers and other organisations may also use their own Cookies to collect information about your activities on our Site and/or the advertisements you have clicked on.
This should only happen when approved by us.
Again, this information, which may be combined with other information acquired from third parties, may be used by them to provide you with advertisements (both on our Site and through other means) that they believe are most likely to be of interest to you based on content you have viewed.
Third-party advertisers may also use this information to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to track aggregate usage statistics.
We may not control these third-party Cookies and their use may be governed by the privacy policies of the third parties employing these Cookies.
To learn about these Cookies and to disable or reject third-party Cookies, please refer to the relevant third partyâs website.
