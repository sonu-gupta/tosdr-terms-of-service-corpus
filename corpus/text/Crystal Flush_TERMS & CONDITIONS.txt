Arbitration and Waiver of Class ActionIf you purchase or participate in a trial for Century Biotics in the United States (including its possessions and territories) or any other location, you and Century Biotics agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to the Century Biotics products or services, these Terms and Conditions of How the Offer Works, Returns and Refund Policy, Privacy Policy, Contact Information Terms and this Arbitration Agreement, shall be determined by binding arbitration or in small claims court.
Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.
Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts.
Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.
YOU AGREE THAT, BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS OF USE, THE U.S.
FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT GOVERNS THE INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS PROVISION, AND THAT YOU AND ELITE WHITE LTD ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
If this arbitration clause is determined to be unenforceable, you agree that all claims will be handled and brought in small claims court.
This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and the termination of your auto-ship membership..
If you elect to seek arbitration or file a small claim court action, you must first send to Century Biotics, by certified mail, a written Notice of your claim ("Notice").
The Notice to Century Biotics must be addressed to: General Counsel, Century Biotics., 18711 Sherman Way #106E, Reseda, CA 91335 ("Notice Address").
If Century Biotics initiates arbitration, it will send a written Notice to the email address used for your membership account.
A Notice, whether sent by you or by Century Biotics, must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.
and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand").
If Century Biotics and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Century Biotics may commence an arbitration proceeding or file a claim in small claims court.
The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA.
The AAA Rules and Forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address.
You may download or copy a form Notice and a form to initiate arbitration at www.adr.org.
If you are required to pay a filing fee, after Century Biotics receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, Century Biotics will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which event the parties will be equally responsible for filing fees.
The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement.
All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration agreement.
If your claim is for US $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.
If your claim exceeds US $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
If the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Century Bioticsâs last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected (or if Century Biotics did not make a settlement offer before an arbitrator was selected), then Century Biotics will pay you the amount of the award or US $1,000, whichever is greater.
Except as expressly set forth herein, the payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
YOU AND CENTURY BIOTICS AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR, OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
Further, unless both you and Century Biotics agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.
The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.
The arbitrator may not award either party punitive damages.
Unless prohibited by the AAA Rules, the arbitrator shall award the prevailing party its reasonable attorney's fees and costs.
