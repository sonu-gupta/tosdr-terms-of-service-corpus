I do not store or collect your personal data.


In fact, I donât even use analytics.
That said, the server inherently has logs of traffic on this site, I guess.
But I donât look at those logs or even know where to find them.

The less I know about such things, the more time I can focus on how my friends and family are doing, make sure my cat is happy, and figure out whatâs for dinner.
The only information I receive is if you leave a comment or a send a note through my contact page.
I do not do any tracking, but I have been known to embed videos on posts.
Iâm trying to strip those out.
So if you see video that you can play on a page and feel like letting me know, please do! I will turn it into an explicit link so folks can make the choice.
