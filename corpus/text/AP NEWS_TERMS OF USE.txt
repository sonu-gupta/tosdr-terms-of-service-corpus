These terms of use (the âTerms of Useâ) are a legal agreement between you and The Associated Press and its affiliates (referred to collectively as âAP,â âwe,â âus,â or âourâ).
These Terms of Use specify the terms under which you may access and use APâs website located at https://apnews.com, APâs digital news experiences, APâs mobile application (the âAppâ), other AP digital properties, and related services (collectively, the âServicesâ).
By accepting these Terms of Use, accessing or using our Services, or otherwise manifesting your assent to these Terms of Use, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be legally bound by these Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy, which is hereby incorporated by reference (collectively, this âAgreementâ).
If you do not agree to any of these terms, then please do not use the Services.

THE SECTIONS BELOW TITLED âBINDING ARBITRATIONâ AND âCLASS ACTION WAIVERâ CONTAIN A BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
THEY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.
PLEASE READ THEM.

We reserve the right, in our sole and absolute discretion, to deny you access to the Services, or any portion of the Services, without notice and without reason. 2.
ACCOUNT If you wish to save preferences to your device, you will need to register for an account.
If you elect to register with us, you may log in using a third-party login provider (e.g., Facebook, Google).

When creating your account, you must provide true, accurate, current, and complete information.
Each Sign-In Name and corresponding Password can be used by only one authorized user.
You are solely responsible for the confidentiality and use of your Sign-In Name, Password, and Unique Identifiers, as well as for any use of, misuse of, or communications entered through the App using one or more of them.
You will promptly inform us of any need to deactivate a Password or Sign-In Name or change any Unique Identifier.
We reserve the right to delete or change your Password, Sign-In Name, or Unique Identifier at any time and for any reason and shall have no liability to you for any loss or damage caused by such action.

CONTROLLING LAW This Agreement and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.
 14.
BINDING ARBITRATION In the event of a dispute arising under or relating to this Agreement, the Content, or the Services (each, a âDisputeâ), such dispute will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (âFAAâ).
NEITHER PARTY SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIM IN COURT OR TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL.
NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, EITHER PARTY MAY BRING ITS CLAIM IN ITS LOCAL SMALL CLAIMS COURT, IF PERMITTED BY THAT SMALL CLAIMS COURT RULES AND IF WITHIN SUCH COURTâS JURISDICTION.
DISCOVERY AND APPEAL RIGHTS MAY ALSO BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.
All disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator selected jointly by the parties, whose decision will be final, except for a limited right of appeal under the FAA.
The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted by JAMS pursuant to its then current Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those rules, or, where appropriate, pursuant to JAMSâ Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures.
All applicable JAMSâ rules and procedures are available at the JAMS website www.jamsadr.com.
Each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules.
Judgment on the arbitratorâs award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.
The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online.
If conducted in person, the arbitration shall take place in the United States county where you reside.
The parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay a proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
The parties shall cooperate in good faith in the voluntary and informal exchange of all non-privileged documents and other information (including electronically stored information) relevant to the Dispute immediately after commencement of the arbitration.
Nothing in this Agreement will prevent AP from seeking injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction as necessary to protect APâs proprietary interests. 15.
CLASS ACTION WAIVER You agree that any arbitration or proceeding shall be limited to the Dispute between us and you individually.
To the full extent permitted by law, (i) no arbitration or proceeding shall be joined with any other.
(ii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated or resolved on a class action-basis or to utilize class action procedures.
and (iii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.
YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST US ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. 16.
EQUITABLE RELIEF You acknowledge and agree that in the event of a breach or threatened violation of our intellectual property rights and confidential and proprietary information by you, we will suffer irreparable harm and will therefore be entitled to injunctive relief to enforce this Agreement.
We may, without waiving any other remedies under this Agreement, seek from any court having jurisdiction any interim, equitable, provisional, or injunctive relief that is necessary to protect our rights and property pending the outcome of the arbitration referenced above.
All claims or disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be heard exclusively by any of the federal or state courts of competent jurisdiction located in the State of New York. 17.
