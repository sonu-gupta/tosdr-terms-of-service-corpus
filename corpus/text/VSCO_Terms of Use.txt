ARBITRATION AND GOVERNING LAW.
 Please read the following arbitration agreement in this Section (âArbitration Agreementâ) carefully.
It requires you to arbitrate disputes with VSCO and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.


11.1 Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. You agree that any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Services, to any products sold or distributed through the Services, or to any aspect of your relationship with VSCO, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that: (a) you may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if your claims qualify.
and (b) you or VSCO may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents).
This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all disputes or claims and requests for relief that arose or were asserted before the effective date of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement.


11.2 Arbitration Rules and Forum. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.
To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your dispute or claim or request for relief to our registered agent National Registered Agents, Inc., 160 Greentree Drive, Suite 101, Dover, DE 19904.
The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider.
Disputes involving claims, counterclaims, or requests for relief under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneysâ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMSâs most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/ all other disputes shall be subject to JAMSâs most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/.
JAMSâs rules are also available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267.
If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.
If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMSâs filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, VSCO will pay them for you.
In addition, VSCO will reimburse all such JAMSâ filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for disputes, claims, or requests for relief totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.
 You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location.
Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.


11.3 Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to: (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement.
and (b) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any assertion that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.
The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and VSCO.
The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.
The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim.
The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forumâs rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement).
The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.
The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.
The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.


11.4 Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND VSCO HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.
You and VSCO are instead electing that all disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 11.1 above.
An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would.
However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.


11.5 Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief. ALL DISPUTES, CLAIMS, AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS.
ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.
If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this subsectionâs limitations as to a given dispute, claim, or request for relief, then such aspect must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the State or Federal Courts located in the State of California.
All other disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be arbitrated.


11.6 30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: opt-out@vsco.co, within 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement.
Your notice must include your name and address, your VSCO username (if any), the email address you used to set up your Account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement.
If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you.
Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.


11.7 Severability. Except as provided in subsection 11.5, if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.


11.8 Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with VSCO.


11.9 Modification. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if VSCO makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, you may reject that change within thirty (30) days of such change becoming effective by writing VSCO at the following address: 1500 Broadway, Attn: Legal, Suite 300, Oakland, CA 94612.
 Summary: This section describes how claims that you and we have against each other are resolved, including any claims that arose or were asserted before the effective date of this agreement.
In particular, it requires disputes between us to be submitted to binding and final arbitration.
Unless you opt out of the arbitration agreement, you will only be able to pursue claims and seek relief against us on an individual basis and you are waiving your right to seek relief in a court of law and to have a jury trial.
