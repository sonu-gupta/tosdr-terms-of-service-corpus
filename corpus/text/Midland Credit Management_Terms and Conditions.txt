These Payment Terms and Conditions (the âPayment Terms and Conditionsâ) are part of this TOU and govern any payment transaction you initiate on the MCM Website or the MCM App (each, a âPayment Transactionâ).&nbsp.
If you choose to use either the MCM Website or the MCM App to make a Payment Transaction, you accept and agree to these Payment Terms and Conditions.


11.1 Scope:As used herein, the words âbank accountâ refer to the account held by a bank, securities firm, or other financial institution from which payment will be made when you make a Payment Transaction.&nbsp.
The words âyour bankâ mean the bank, securities firm, or other financial institution that holds your account and/or issued your credit or debit card.&nbsp.
Making a Payment Transaction will enable you to pay your account(s) online or through the MCM App.&nbsp.
MCM, in its sole discretion, may refuse this payment option service, and specific payment methods, to anyone or any user without notice for any reason at any time.

11.2 Payment Authorization (Including Automatic Payments):&nbsp.
To make a Payment Transaction, including automatic payments (if eligible), you must designate a valid major credit card, check, or electronic check (âPayment Methodâ).&nbsp.
Each time you initiate a Payment Transaction, you authorize us or our agent to draw a check or draft, initiate an automated clearing house (âACHâ) debit, and/or charge your Payment Method, in your name to the bank account you specify, payable to us or to our agent, in the amount of the Payment Transaction, on the date(s) specified (âBilling Dateâ) of the month(s) of payment according to the schedule (one-time or recurring) that you have affirmatively elected to enroll in for your account.
Your transaction must be payable in U.S.
dollars.&nbsp.
By paying using your designated Payment Method, you agree that: (a) you have read, understand and agree to these Payment Terms and Conditions, and that this agreement constitutes a âwriting signed by youâ under any applicable law or regulation.
(b) you consent to the electronic delivery of the disclosures contained in these Terms and Conditions.

You should contact your bank for more information about the policies and procedures that apply to your account and any unauthorized transactions, including any limits on your liability.
We will not be liable to you in the following instances:

If, through no fault of ours, your account does not contain enough money to complete the transaction;

If circumstances beyond our control (such as fire or flood) prevent the transaction, despite reasonable precautions that we have taken.

MISCELLANEOUS.
The relationship between you and MCM is and shall be that of independent contractors and nothing in this TOU shall be construed or used to create or imply any relationship of partners, joint ventures, or employer and employee.
You may not assign or otherwise transfer this TOU or the license granted hereunder or delegate any of your duties specified herein, in whole or in part, without MCMâs prior written consent.
Any attempt of assignment, delegation, or transfer in violation of this TOU shall be void, of no effect, and a material breach of this TOU.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, MCM may assign this TOU in whole or in part.
Moreover, MCM may delegate its rights and responsibilities or use contractors or agents to fulfill its obligations under this TOU.
Failure by MCM to insist on strict performance of any of the terms and conditions of this TOU will not operate as a waiver of that or any subsequent default or failure of performance.
In the event any provision of this TOU is found by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, you agree that unless it materially affects the entire intent and purpose of this TOU, the invalidity, voidness, or unenforceability shall affect neither the validity of this TOU nor the remaining provisions herein, and the provision in question shall be deemed to be replaced with a valid and enforceable provision most closely reflecting the intent and purpose of the original provision.
Headings are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
