 Top Uncollected Information When you browse the IRChelp website, we don't know who you are, and we'll explain why.
Internet sites routinely try to identify you in two ways.
The first is through your web browser, which automatically sends information about your computer, for example, browser info (User Agent) and IP address.
Regarding this method, as this information can be used to link it to your browsing, we do not record (store) it in any way.
The second is through the browser's cookies, which as already defined, are information that remain on your computer and are sent to the website's engine at each request.
What some website engines usually do is store a unique identifier in your browser and then associate that identifier with your browsing.
About this second method, we make it clear that in IRChelp, no cookies are used by default. Top Information Collected 
Cookies related to login  We use cookies when you are logged in so that we can remember this action.
This saves you from having to log in every time you visit a new page.
These cookies are normally removed or cleared when you log out to ensure that you can only access restricted features and areas when you log in.

Cookies related to forms When you submit data via a form such as those found on the contact pages, cookies may be set to remember the user's details for future correspondence.


In IRChelp, no cookies are used by default.
If you have changed any settings, cookies are used to store those changes.
However, in this case they are not stored in a personally identifiable form.
If you used search engines to find our site, some of them may generate search statistics, but only to measure the site's performance.
The results of these searches are not passed on to us in a personally identifiable form (IP addresses or unique user agent strings).
We use (do not collect) aggregated non-personal survey data to find out solely which pages are accessed the most on a monthly basis and which countries are most interested in our content.
This means that no information is shared from IRChelp to the websites, and the only information that is passed on to us in this process is that of the page visited, which is not linked to any particular user and which we do not save or store for our account.
we may see anonymous information from the page visited so that we cannot link it to any particular person.
Even because these statistical data are not collected by IRChelp, they are collected by the search engine you used to find us at the time the search was carried out.
Finally, if you make any contact with us, or access our IRC Network, the information you provide may be stored on our servers.
However, you can provide anonymous feedback (by not entering your email or other personal information in the contact form), as well as accessing our Network through proxies like Tor.
The IRChelp Network operates using secure SSL/TLS connections, which means you can get end-to-end anonymous and encrypted access using Tor and IRChelp together. Top Third Party Cookies This site does not use third-party cookies.
 User Engagement The user undertakes to make proper use of the contents and information that IRChelp offers on the site and with an enunciative, but not limiting, character:

A) Not engage in activities that are illegal or contrary to good faith or public order;
B) Not to spread propaganda or content of a racist, xenophobic, games of chance, any type of illegal pornography, in defense of terrorism or against human rights;
C) Do not damage the physical (hardware) and logical (software) systems of IRChelp, its suppliers or third parties, to introduce or spread computer viruses or any other hardware or software systems that are capable of causing the aforementioned damage .
 More Information Hopefully that's clear, and as mentioned earlier, if there's something you're not sure you need or not, it's generally safer to leave cookies enabled if you're interacting with one of the features you use on our site.
This policy is effective from August/2021. Top
