 Previous Next Privacy Policy 
Last updated on July, 17, 2020

On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice for the European Union (EU) issued a significant ruling in a case examining transfers of data from the EU.
This ruling invalidated the EU/United States (US) Privacy Shield framework. We understand that some of our customers may have questions about the impact of this ruling.  As an Interfolio customer, you can continue to use the Interfolio Software as a Service in compliance with European law.
The Courtâs ruling does not change your ability to transfer data today between the EU and US.

We have provided customers with overlapping protections under both the Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) and Privacy Shield frameworks for data transfers from the EU. Although the July 16 ruling invalidated the use of Privacy Shield moving forward, the SCCs remain valid. Our customers are protected under SCCs and under GDPR. The ruling does not change data flows for our Customers.
We will continue to transfer data in compliance with todayâs ruling and further guidance from EU data protection authorities.
We routinely work to advance our protections for customers based on developments like these. Interfolio embraced Privacy Shield as a successor to Safe Harbor after that framework was invalidated, and we have extended GDPR rights to our worldwide customer base. Privacy is ever evolving.
Our customers can be assured that we are committed to ensuring their data will continue to flow securely through our services in full compliance with all applicable GDPR guidelines and that weâll work collaboratively with all involved parties as new approaches to EU/US data protection are considered and finalized.
If you have any questions, please reach out to us at privacy@interfolio.com. 
Interfolio complies with the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S.
Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data transferred from the European Union to the United States.&nbsp.
You may view our Privacy Shield Notice here.&nbsp.
If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall take precedence.
To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, the Privacy Shield Principles, and to view our certification, please visit www.privacyshield.gov.
Interfolio is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S.
Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
If the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) applies to your information, we provide this privacy policy so you can exercise your rights to receive information about our data practices, as well as to request access to and deletion of your information.
 You may request to review, update and delete your information, as well as export and download a copy of it.
Interfolio processes your information for the purposes described in this policy, which include âbusiness purposesâ under the CCPA.
Cookie Information.
Interfolio uses cookies and similar technologies in our Services and on our Website to help us collect information.
For more details about how we use these technologies, and your opt-out opportunities and other options, please see our Cookie Policy. Interfolioâs Privacy Policy Welcome to www.interfolio.com (the âSiteâ), a website owned and operated by Interfolio, Inc.
(âInterfolio,â âus,â or âweâ).
We developed this privacy policy (âPrivacy Policyâ) to explain how we collect, protect, use, and disclose information from you, our user (âyouâ orâyourâ).
Interfolio, Inc.
offers services to both individuals and institutions.
If you are using any of the Services through an educational or other institution that is a customer of Interfolio, this policy does not supersede the terms of any agreements between Interfolio and any other party, nor does it affect the terms of any agreement between any user of the Services, their educational institution or any third party.
Please make sure that you read the terms of any privacy policies that you enter into with parties other than Interfolio, including your educational institution, as those policies may also explain how your personal information is used by them.
Please review the following statement to understand how the information you provide to Interfolio through the services will be treated.
This Privacy Policy will apply to users of the Site regardless of the type of User you are.
You may be any of the following types of Users:

âVisitorâ, which means that you simply browse the Site;
âApplicantâ or âCandidateâ which means you have registered with us and established an Account.
Applicants/Candidates may be students, employees or faculty members of a University or may join Interfolio without such affiliation;
âRecommenderâ, which means that you have been asked to submit a letter of recommendation for an Applicant;
âUniversity Userâ, which means you are an employee, contractor or agent of a University operating in such capacity.
A âUniversityâ is a college or university with whom Interfolio has a contractual relationship, generally with the career services department or a specific academic department, to provide services to students, employees and faculty members.
and
âRecipient Userâ, which means an employee, contractor or agent of a college, university or other employer that uses the Service to locate potential employees and/or faculty members (âRecipientâ).

So we are clear about the terminology we are using, when we use the phrase âPersonal Informationâ, we mean contact information (i.e., your name, address, email address, and/or telephone number) and any other non-public information that is used or intended to be used to personally identify an individual, and information associated with the foregoing.
When we use the phrase âAnonymous Informationâ, we mean information that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information.
Anonymous Information does not enable identification of or contact with, individual persons.
BY USING OUR SITE OR SERVICES OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH OUR SITE OR SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND YOU EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION ACCORDING TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY. How We Collect Information 
Personal Information
We receive and store information you voluntarily provide to us (either through the Site or in some other way) upon registration or your use of the Site and Services.
When you register with us, regardless of the type of User you are, we require you to provide certain Personal Information, such as your name and email address.
You may choose to provide additional Personal Information as part of certain Services.
As a rule, Interfolio only collects information necessary to provide the Services you or your institution have requested.
Some of our Services are designed for job Applicants, in which case the following provisions apply.
Please remember that you do not have to submit any of this additional information, but we may not be able to provide you certain Services without that information.

If there are fees associated with the Services you receive, we will collect certain Personal Information in order to process payment of such fees, including a credit card number and associated billing information, and charge and collect the fees.
We refer to this information as âBilling Informationâ.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy, we will only use this Billing Information to process and collect fees.
We may store this Billing Information if you request us to do so.
Some Universities cover the fees for their students to use certain of our Services.
If you are an Applicant creating a dossier on the Site for our document transmission services (a âDossierâ), we enable you to submit information relevant to your Dossier, including your contact information, information about your experience, education, and interests.
We will also collect and manage documents associated with your Dossier, such as your writing samples, transcripts, letters of recommendation, and cover letters.
If you are an Applicant creating your portfolio on the Site to publish on our Site (âPortfolioâ), in addition to the information we may collect for your Dossier, we may collect additional information about your work history, publications, experience and other information you voluntarily submit to us, whether through the Site or otherwise.


DisclosureâInformation Collected from Third Parties.

Certain Personal Information may be provided about you by other Users.
For example, if you are a University User, someone within your University will have registered you and granted you access to our Services.
If you are a Recommender, an Applicant may provide us your name and email address.
We will consider any Personal Information about you collected as part of the registration process to be your Personal Information.
Other Users may also submit confidential Personal Information about you, including as part of your Dossier.
For example, a letter of recommendation, evaluation or committee packet for your Dossier may be provided to us by a Recommender or by your University.
We will refer to this type of Personal Information as âConfidential Personal Informationâ in this Privacy Policy.
If you are the User providing the Confidential Personal Information, you recognize that the User about whom such information pertains will be the party controlling that information, even though it may contain information about you and is designed to be confidential.
For example, if you are a Recommender, you will no longer be able to control or edit a letter of recommendation after you submit it to the Services, except that you can request that it no longer be used on behalf of the Applicant.
Rather, the Applicant will control the Recipients to whom the letter is disclosed, although it is associated with your name as Recommender, and it will not be considered your Personal Information.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Applicant will not be able to see Confidential Personal Information about him or her but will be able to direct the disclosure to certain Recipients.
The provider of Confidential Personal Information cannot see the manner in which it is disclosed.

Anonymous Information
As you use our Service, we may also collect certain information, including your Internet protocol address, browser type, and access times.
We use Cookies and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) to gather information regarding the date and time of your use of the Service.
An âInternet protocol addressâ or âIP addressâ is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet access provider when you use the Internet.
In some cases your IP address stays the same from browser session to browser session.
but if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP address probably varies from session to session.
We track IP addresses solely in conjunction with session cookies to analyze our web page flow.
âCookiesâ are small pieces of information that a web site sends to your computerâs hard drive while you are viewing a web site.
We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them).
Persistent Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.

DisclosureâUsage of Third Party Cookies

We may use a third party tracking service (such as Google Analytics) to track and analyze Anonymous Information from Users of our Site.
Such third parties may use Cookies to help track User behavior.
We do not have access or control over these cookies.
Our analytics service provider uses session IDs to help us uncover bugs, improve user pathways, and build better services. How We Use Information 
Personal Information
As we mentioned above, we use Personal Information to: (a) assist you in managing the documents in your Dossier and Portfolio, (b) provide you an online location for your academic portfolio (if you so choose).
(c) facilitate Applicants applying to Recipients.
and (d) otherwise connect Applicants to Recipients.
As a result, we use your Personal Information to:

Administer your Account;
Provide you with Services and customer support;
Tailor the features of the Site or Services to you;
Respond to your requests, resolve disputes and/or troubleshoot problems;
Verify your compliance with your obligations in our Terms of Use and/or other agreements you may have executed with us.
and
Communicate with you about the Site and the Services.

Sensitive information such as social security numbers are also collected for identity verification, but may be disclosed in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
We may also use your Personal Information to create Anonymous Information records by excluding information that makes the information personally identifiable to you, any other individual and the applicable University or Recipient.
We may send you communications via email about the Site and Services.
You can opt out of receiving certain communications from the Site by clicking the âUnsubscribeâ link at the bottom of each email.
Please note that even if you unsubscribe or opt-out, we may still send you Site and Service related communications (e.g., emails related to your account).

Anonymous Information

Generally, we use Anonymous Information in statistical analysis to help us analyze patterns in the use of our Services.
We may, through our use of Cookies, keep you logged into the Site, personalize your use of the Site and customize your experience on the Site.
We may also use your Anonymous Information to improve our internal operations, surveys and software, customize the content and layout of the Site and/or Service and notify you of updates to our Site and Services. Disclosure of Information If you are an Applicant, you are probably using our Services to help you either send components of your Dossier to Recipients or to manage your online Portfolio.
Either way, our Services operate on the principle of a submission event.
Our Services are designed to manage your distribution of certain Personal Information to selected Recipients (or, in some cases, on our Site).
As an Applicant, we may (and you hereby authorize us to) disclose the Personal Information selected by you to Recipients designated by you.
To be clear, if you tell us to send your Dossier to ABC University, we will consider it an authorization to disclose your Dossier to that university (and you agree that it will constitute an authorization).
Additionally, if you maintain a Portfolio, you authorize us to disclose the Personal Information selected by you in the manner designated by you on our Site (whether publicly or privately).
We may disclose certain Personal Information:

To third-party services to manage communications (e.g., in order to send transactional emails related to our services).
We also use third-party analytics services to help understand your usage of our services.
In particular, we provide a limited amount of your information (such as your name and email address) to third-party service providers in order to analyze your use of our website and/or product and track our relationship so that we can improve our service to you.
In such cases, we will require such vendors agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy (including your Billing Information to our payment processor).
To third parties to whom you ask or authorize us to send Personal Information (including, if applicable, Recipients and/or your University);
To a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively, âAffiliatesâ), in the event we have such Affiliates in the future, in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy;
If we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) resolve disputes, investigate problems, or enforce our Terms of Use.
(b) comply with relevant laws or to respond to requests from law enforcement or other government officials relating to investigations or alleged illegal activity, in which case we can (and you authorize us to) disclose Personal Information without subpoenas or warrants served on us.
or (c) protect and defend our rights or property or the rights and property of you or third parties.
Note that we may be compelled to reveal personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

In the event of a change in ownership, or a merger with, acquisition by, or transfer (including by bankruptcy) or sale of assets to, another entity, we reserve the right to transfer all of your Personal Information to that entity.
We will notify you (via a posting on a Site or email, in our discretion) of such a transfer.
This means if you are concerned about your Personal Information being transferred to a new owner, you can deactivate your Account.
We will require the acquiring entity to comply with this Privacy Policy.
In the event we offer public or private forums on the Site or Services, you are welcome to share as much Personal Information as you think is necessary and appropriate (or authorize us to share such information).
But please be aware than any Personal Information will be made available to other Registered Users and/or generally on our Site and we do not control what third parties do with such information.

Disclosure to Universities or Recipients

Giving you tools to help you protect your Personal Information is a vital part of our mission.
It is up to you to make sure you are comfortable with the information you provide.
We do provide Personal Information to Recipients to whom you have authorized disclosure and, if applicable, your University.
We do not control how Universities or Recipients (or their respective Users) use or disclose the information they obtain from us.
If you are affiliated with a University, you hereby authorize us, and we may disclose your Dossier, related Personal Information and your Dossierâs delivery history to your University and its University Users, unless you opt-out of such disclosure in your account settings.
If you do not wish to share this information with your University, you can opt-out by logging into your account and changing your privacy settings.
IF YOU AUTHORIZE US TO SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH A RECIPIENT OR YOUR UNIVERSITY, WE DO NOT HAVE ANY CONTROL OVER HOW ANY SUCH RECIPIENT OR UNIVERSITY USES AND DISCLOSES YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION, INCLUDING INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE DIRECTLY TO THAT RECIPIENT.
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT (1) INTERFOLIO DOES NOT EVALUATE ANY RECIPIENTâS OR UNIVERSITYâS PRIVACY PRACTICES, AND (2) INTERFOLIO WILL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY ACTIONS OF ANY RECIPIENT OR UNIVERSITY.
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT RECIPIENTS TO WHOM WE MAY DISCLOSE YOUR DISCLOSED PROFILE MAY SHARE YOUR DISCLOSED PROFILE WITH OTHERS.
