 More on Spam You may not use MeWeâs services for the purpose of spamming anyone.
Spam is generally defined on MeWe as bulk or aggressive activity that attempts to manipulate or disrupt MeWe or the experience of users on MeWe to drive traffic or attention to unrelated accounts, products, services, or initiatives.
Some of the factors that we take into account when determining what conduct is considered to be spamming include:

if you have made large number of group or user contact requests, or followed and/or unfollowed a large number of user accounts or Pages, in a short time period;
if your posts or comments consist mainly of links and/or are shared without commentary;
if a large number of people have blocked you in response to high volumes of untargeted, unsolicited, or duplicative content or engagements from your account;
if a large number of spam complaints have been filed against you;
if you post duplicative or substantially similar content, replies, comments to multiple Pages, Groups, or users.
or create duplicate or substantially similar accounts;
if you post multiple updates to a Page, Group, user or topic with an intent to subvert or manipulate the topic to drive traffic or attention to unrelated accounts, products, services, or initiatives;
if you send large numbers of unsolicited posts, comments, replies or mentions;
if you add users to lists in a bulk or aggressive manner;
if you are randomly or aggressively engaging with Pages, Groups, or users to drive traffic or attention to unrelated accounts, products, services, or initiatives;
if you repeatedly post other peopleâs account information as your own (e.g., bio, posts, comments, profile, user URL, etc.);
if you post misleading, deceptive, or malicious links (e.g., affiliate links, links to malware/clickjacking pages, etc.).
Accounts created to replace or mimic suspended accounts may be permanently suspended.
We may also remove accounts which MeWe at its discretion attributes to entities known to violate the MeWe Terms of Service.

 Our Commitment To Data Security MeWe uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information.
We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to MeWe and you do so at your own risk.
Using unsecured Wi-Fi or other unprotected networks to submit messages through the MeWe Service is never recommended.
Once we receive your transmission of information, MeWe makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems.
However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
If MeWe learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps.
MeWe may post a notice on the MeWe Site or through the MeWe Service if a security breach occurs. MeWe Content Data When you use our Services, we process any data you explicitly enter into the site (your âContent Dataâ), including your full name, email address, profile information, posts, comments, photos, voice recordings, videos, files, emojis, etc.
MeWe uses your Content Data for the sole purpose of serving and providing you with the full experience of MeWe.
You control how we process your Content Data through Privacy &amp.
Sharing settings in your account at MeWe.
At any time you can edit/update, retrieve or delete your Content Data in your account. MeWe Log Data When you use our Services, we may receive information (âLog Dataâ) such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, and device information (including device and application IDs).
We receive Log Data when you interact with our Services, for example, when you visit our websites, sign into our Services, interact with our email notifications, use your account to authenticate to a third-party website or application.
We may also receive Log Data when you click on, view or interact with links on our Services, including links to third-party applications, such as when you choose to install another application through MeWe.
MeWe uses Log Data to provide, understand, and improve our Services.
We either delete Log Data or remove any common account identifiers, such as your username, full IP address, or email address, after a maximum of 12 months. Your Data Portability At any time you can retrieve your entire Content Data package from MeWe, using the âDownload Your Contentâ feature in your account.
When you select this feature, you will be able to download your Content Data to your personal device and decide how to migrate that data anywhere you choose. Deleting Your Account - Right to Erasure At all times you have an easy way to opt out of our service and delete your account as well as ALL of your Content Data, if you do not wish to continue using our services.
You can find this in your âSettingsâ where it says âDelete My Account.â When you delete any of your Content Data, or delete your entire account, we delete your Content Data and remove your account from our production servers as soon as is technically possible based on our infrastructure design including a 30-day delay to insure the deletion request was made by you, etc. The more data you delete, the longer will the deletion process take due to load balancing protections on our servers. After weâve deleted your Content Data from our production servers, that same data may remain in our backups for a limited period of time (maximum of 7 months) due to protection regulations and our protocols for backup content protection.
We secure your data that temporarily remains on our backups with additional security protocols.
If we ever need to restore our backups into the main servers of MeWe (in a rare instance, for example recovering from a natural disaster), if any of your Content Data you have previously deleted from our main servers is still on our backups in that moment, it will be deleted prior to or right after the backups are moved to the main servers. If you own a group and delete your account, the content you posted to that group will be deleted.
however, the group(s) you own will not be deleted unless you are the only member of that group. MeWe Secret Chat MeWe offers Secret Chat as an option for MeWe users.
MeWe has no way to decrypt Secret Chat messages of MeWe users because the messages are end-to-end encrypted and MeWe does not have any knowledge of their private keys.
The encrypted messages and media (images, videos etc.) in MeWe Secret Chat are deleted on MeWe servers after they have been delivered successfully.
Header information of MeWe Secret Chat messages (sender, recipient etc.) is protected by an additional encryption layer for transmission to the server, and from the server to the recipient, to prevent eavesdropping by third parties (e.g.
in open wireless LANs). MeWe Invitations and âAdd Automaticallyâ You may desire to make it easier for you to find and connect with your friends by using MeWe âAdd Automaticallyâ.
