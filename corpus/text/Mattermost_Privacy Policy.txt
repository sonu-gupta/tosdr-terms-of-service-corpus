We will normally collect personal information from you only where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you (e.g.
to provide you with our Services), where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms, or where we have your consent.
In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you.


Performance of a 
contract.
The use of your personal data may be necessary to perform a Customer Agreement or other contract that you have with us.
For example, if you contribute to a project, create a profile, post, and comment on our Sites, we will use your information to carry out our obligation to complete and administer that Customer Agreement or contract.

Legitimate interests.
We use your personal data for our legitimate interests, such as to provide you with the best content through our Sites, Services, and communications with users and the public, to improve and promote our products and services, and for administrative, security, fraud prevention and legal purposes.

 International Data Transfers and StorageIn order for us to operate and provide our Sites and Services globally, the personal data you provide to us or that we collect may be transferred or accessed in various countries, including the United States of America.
If you are located in the European Economic Area or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S.

European Union Standard Contractual Clauses: Where this is the case, we will enter into guarantees to ensure that the right security measures are taken so that your privacy rights continue to be protected as outlined in this Privacy Policy.
If we transfer information from the European Economic Area to third parties outside the European Economic Area and to countries not subject to schemes which are considered as providing an adequate data protection standard, we will enter into contracts which are based on the EU Standard Contractual Clauses with these parties, unless any such transfer is permitted for other reasons under the GDPR.

 Retention of Your Personal InformationWe retain your personal information for as long as we need to provide our Sites and/or Services to you and the Customer(s).
After such time, we will either delete or anonymize your information.
If you have an account on Mattermost Sites or Services, we will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to perform our contractual obligations, provide you services through the Sites, to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, preserve legal rights, or enforce our Customer Agreements and agreements.
We will delete information once it is no longer necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected and processed.

Information from Website Visitors: 


If you have elected to receive marketing emails from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences for a reasonable period of time from the date you last expressed interest in our Services, such as when you last opened an email from us or ceased using your Mattermost account.
We retain information derived from cookies and other tracking technologies for a reasonable period of time from the date such information was created so long as needed for our business purposes.


Information from Mattermost Self-Hosted and Cloud Products: 


Depending on the Services plan, Customers may be able to customize their retention settings such that they are different than Mattermostâs standard data retention practices.
Customers may also apply different settings to messages, files, or other types of Customer Data.
The deletion of Customer Data and other use of the Services by Customer may result in the deletion and/or de-identification of certain personal information and other information.
Mattermost Cloud products will retain Customer Data in accordance with a Customerâs instructions, including any applicable terms in the Customer Agreement and Customerâs use of Services, and as required by applicable law.
Mattermost may provide the option for Customers to delete Customer Data after their subscription ends.
This request must be made by the customer, and Mattermost may require additional ID verification.
Mattermost will delete all information from currently-running production systems within one year of the deletion request.
National commercial or financial codes may require us to retain certain Customer information for up to 10 years.


Information from Community Members and Contributors:


Due to the open source nature of our products, services, and community, we may retain limited personal information indefinitely in order to ensure transactional integrity and nonrepudiation.
For example, if you provide your information in connection with a forum or blog post or comment, we may display that information even if you have deleted your account as we do not automatically delete community posts.
Also, if you contribute to a Mattermost project and provide your personal information in connection with that contribution, that information (including your name) will be embedded and publicly displayed with your contribution and we will not be able to delete or erase it because doing so would break the project code.

If we are involved in litigation or a governmental or regulatory investigation, then we keep personal information throughout the period of litigation or investigation and for a reasonable amount of time thereafter.
If a settlement means that we have to keep personal information for longer, then we keep personal information for the period required to administer the settlement.
If we provide personal information to law enforcement agencies, then we keep a record of this for one year beyond the end of the investigation. Your European Union Privacy Rights Regarding Your Personal InformationIf the provision of the GDPR is applicable, then you have certain rights with respect to the use of personal information on the Sites and Services.
