ð¨âð» The admin
I'm @angristan, the admin, a french tech enthusiast and Linux sysadmin at a French managed web hosting company.
I'm a student in a French IT school at the same time.
I run an english blog and a french blog if you're interested.
I made an account dedicated to mstdn.io news: @admin.
Thus you don't have to follow my personnal account to get the latest news on the instance.
I'm the only admin here so feel free to toot me if you have any question or concern about the instance!
Also, I'm a heavy user of Mastodon, so you can be sure this instance won't be abandoned because I lost interest.
I launched mstdn.io because I love FOSS, dencentralization and free software, so this is one of my hobby.
ð ð° Donations
You can donate to help me maintain this instance in the long term.
Here is what I have to pay:
â¢ Domain name: 35â¬/year
â¢ Main Server: 20â¬/month
â¢ Object storage: 5â¬/month
â¢ Backup storage: 10â¬/month
I invested a lot of time for this, hundreds of hours of installing, tweaking, debugging, optimizing, monitoring, explaining, etc.
I love it, but I do this on my free time, so any thanks for my work, financial or not, is really appreciated.
I also run a Tor relay, so your money will alway be put to good use ð
