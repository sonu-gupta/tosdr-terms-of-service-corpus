For example, all posts are moderated, and all Zap-Chat images and text are scanned before publishing and vehicle registration marks (VRMs) removed using automated visual processing. 
Zap-Map, or authorised third parties, reserve the right to cut, crop, edit or refuse to publish Usersâ content at their sole discretion.
Zap-Map may remove User content from the Sites and Services at any time. 4.
ZAP-HOME AND ZAP-WORKCharge point owners can submit details about their home charge point or work charge point for inclusion on Zap-Map Sites and Services as part of the Zap-Home or Zap-Work networks.
These networks are then available for use by other registered Zap-Map Users.
As these details include personal data, please also refer to ourâ¯Privacy Policy on the publishing of personal information. 
Charge point owners who display their charge point information on the Zap-Home or Zap-Work networks do so with the understanding that they agree to provide access to (or âshareâ) the charge point to (or with) other registered Zap-Map Users under restricted access which is specified by each charge point owner for each charge point device submitted.  
The provision of access to Zap-Home of Zap-Work chargers is made solely at the discretion of the charge point owner and any contractual or financial agreement to use the charge point is made between the charge point owner and the User.
Zap-Map is not party to this agreement and the agreement between the charge point owner and the User confers no benefits, rights or obligations whatsoever on Zap-Map.  
For avoidance of doubt, both charge point owners and Users share and/or use Zap-Home or Zap-Work charge points at their own risk.

By logging in to their registered Zap-Map account, charge point owners are able to edit and update their Zap-Home and Zap-Work details at any time, with changes immediately deployed across the Sites and Services.
By adding their charge points to the Zap-Home and/or Zap-Work network, charge point owners agree to keep their charge point, contact, access and payment information up to date, and to inform Zap-Map directly if their charge point is no longer available or decommissioned, or if they wish their charge point to be removed from our Sites and Services. 5.
ZAP-PAYAll Zap-Pay Users must accept these Zap-Map Terms and Conditions in full.  
Zap-Pay is a service provided by Zap-Map which introduces Users to CPOs allowing them to access and, in some circumstances, pay for CPO Services.&nbsp.
Zap-Pay typically processes payments by users in respect of CPO Services on behalf of the CPO (a Payment Processing Introduction).&nbsp.
However, Zap-Map has entered into arrangements with partners under which it introduces their customers or users to CPO Services, in which case payments due to the CPO are processed by the relevant partner organisation and not Zap-Map (a Partner Introduction). 
While Zap-Pay is available to Zap-Map Users within the Zap-Map platform, there is no requirement for Users to access this service, nor is there any requirement for Zap-Pay Users to undertake any account registration or subscription, or to use any specific RFID or payment card(s). 
Users of Zap-Pay accept that, where CPO Services are accessed by Users, Zap-Mapâs roles are as follows: (i) on a non-exclusive basis, introducing Zap-Pay Users to CPO via Zap-Map for the purposes of enabling Zap-Pay Usersâ access to CPO Services.
(ii) for Payment Processing Introductions only, a provider of payments services including the processing of payments and issuing of receipts to Users for EV charging services accessed via Zap-Pay.
and (iii) for Payment Processing Introductions only, a payment support service for Zap-Pay Users via a dedicated customer helpline.  
In relation to Payment Processing Introductions only: 

&nbsp.
â&nbsp.
By using Zap-Pay, Users accept that all payments made for EV charging services via Zap-Pay are processed by Zap-Map which takes full responsibility for processing the transactions made via Zap-Pay including pre-authorisation, settlement, refunds, chargebacks and cancellations.
Furthermore, Zap-Map is the first point of contact for Zap-Pay Users regarding Payment Processing Introductions, including any payment-related queries, requests for refunds, or payment disputes. 
&nbsp.
â&nbsp.
In the event of a payment-related dispute between a Zap-Pay User and the CPO providing the CPO Services, Zap-Map remains the first point of contact for Users.&nbsp.
Zap-Map aims to resolve all disputes promptly and fairly and has agreed a dispute management process with CPO.&nbsp.
In all cases, Zap-Map will be responsible for managing payment-related disputes between a Zap-Pay User and the CPO.â¯ Zap-Map will coordinate correspondence between the CPO and the Zap-Pay User in relation to a complaint and will take all reasonable steps required to facilitate an amicable resolution. 
&nbsp.
â&nbsp.
Zap-Pay includes a support service for Zap-Pay Users.
The service, which is for payment-related issues and queries, is available 24/7 via a dedicated helpline (the number is displayed across all relevant Zap-Map Sites and Services) and via the Zap-Map app using the Zap-Chat messaging service.
All Zap-Pay helpline calls and Zap-Chat messages are responded to promptly, and all Zap-Pay issues are aimed to be resolved within 48 hours.
The telephone helpline is provided on behalf of Zap-Map by the third-party provider EVA Solutions Group Ltd, a company registered at Satakunnankatu 32, Tampere, Finland 33210, with company number&nbsp.
2868557-4. 


&nbsp.
â&nbsp.
All payments made via Zap-Pay (including credit/debit card information) are processed by the payment gateway service provider Adyen (URL: https://www.adyen.com), a fully PCI DSS 3.2 compliant as a Level 1 Service Provider, which is the key security standard within the payments industry (URL: https://www.adyen.com/platform/certifications).
Adyen N.V.
is registered with the Dutch Chamber of Commerce under number 34259528 and registered address at Simon Carmiggeltstraat 6-50, 1011 DJ in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.  
&nbsp.
â&nbsp.
Use of a payment gateway means that at no time does Zap-Map have access to, collect, or store Usersâ payment card details which are all fully encrypted and handled by Adyen.&nbsp.
As a result Zap-Pay conforms with all relevant PCI DSS regulations to provide a secure online payment environment.  
&nbsp.
â&nbsp.
All payment transactions via Zap-Pay are pre-authorised with a Â£5 charge to validate the card and to demonstrate that funds are available in the Userâs bank account associated with the payment card.&nbsp.
The pre-authorisation amount may show on a Userâs account before the final amount is settled.&nbsp.
Once the charging process has completed successfully, the final amount is then charged to the Userâs card and, following full settlement, the pre-authorisation charge refunded or removed from the card transaction history.&nbsp.
If the payment process is not completed, the pre-authorisation will automatically lapse after a set period. 
&nbsp.
â&nbsp.
As part of its role as a payment service provider, Zap-Map processes and issues all VAT and sales tax information receipts to Users accessing CPO Services via Zap-Pay on behalf of the CPO.&nbsp.
At all times, the CPO remains exclusively responsible for setting the appropriate VAT classification(s) and rates, and any other sales tax rates, and remains responsible for managing any relevant communications, submissions, or responses to HMRC.&nbsp.
The CPOâs registered VAT number is clearly displayed on all VAT receipts issued by Zap-Map on the CPOâs behalf. 

Users of Zap-Pay accept that, where CPO Services are accessed by Users, the CPO provides its charging services under its existing Terms of Sale, a copy of which is available on the CPO website.
When accessing Zap-Pay via the Zap-Map app, a hyperlink is always provided to the CPO Terms of Sales as provided by the CPO website.
Delivery of the CPO Services remains the responsibility of the CPO at all times.
Zap-Map is not a party to the CPOâs Terms of Sale, and is not responsible for the CPO services if a User decides to purchase them. 
All CPOâs and CPO Services available via Zap-Pay on the Zap-Map platform are screened and verified before being made available to Zap-Pay Users.
This includes a documented review of relevant CPO policies including, but not limited to: Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Bribery, Anti-Slavery &amp.
Human Trafficking and Data Protection Policies.
Zap-Map also checks that the CPO Services are not in breach of the payment gatewayâs Prohibited and Restricted Products and Services List (as available from URL: https://www.adyen.com).  
All CPOâs offering their Services via Zap-Pay do so under contract (âZap-Pay Agreementâ), which details the respective roles and responsibilities of Zap-Map and the CPO, and includes the requirement to supply all necessary policy documents for screening and at regular intervals (at least annually) to monitor compliance at all times. 
Zap-Pay does not require Users to undertake any account registration, subscription, or membership (with either Zap-Map or the CPO), or use of a specific payment card(s).
Onboarding information is provided within the Zap-Map Sites and Services for Users new to the Zap-Pay service.
While Users are encouraged to register with Zap-Map to maximise the functionality of the platform, Zap-Pay can be accessed either as a Registered User or a temporary Gest User.  
To login as a Guest User only requires a User email for provision of the VAT receipt following a successful charging session.
If the Guest User does not convert to a Registered User within 7 days, the email is deleted from the Sites and Services with the exception of a suppression list to allow us to respond to any follow up enquiries or complaints, and to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements and protect Zap-Mapâs legal rights.
For more information, please refer to ourâ¯Privacy Policy. 
All charging devices on participating CPOs and branded networks that accept Zap-Pay are clearly marked within the Zap-Map Sites and Services at each charging location, and for each charging device for which Zap-Pay can be used.
This information is updated at least daily and is based on information sourced from the CPO.
The Zap-Pay tariff for accessing the CPO Services will be either the CPOâs standard âpay-as-you-goâ (PAYG) tariff, or alternatively a specific Zap-Pay tariff agreed with the CPO. 
Zap-Map will endeavour to make sure any additional fees a User incurs through use of Zap-Pay are kept to a minimum.
However, as operating the service involves a cost to us, we therefore reserve the right to pass a proportion of that cost on to the User as a Zap-Pay User Fee.
Users will be informed within the Zap-Map Sites and Services of both the tariff for the CPOs Services and any additional Zap-Pay User Fees that will be charged in advance of each use of the Zap-Pay service. 
Non-payment related support requests remain the responsibility of the CPO at all times (e.g.
where the payment system is working but the charging session fails in full or in part).
For these requests, the User should contact the CPO (or CPO support provider) directly as instructed by the CPO Terms of Sale.
For these non-payment related support requests, the CPO remains responsible for resolving the relevant issues with the customer of the CPO Services.
If the Zap-Pay support is contacted for a non-payment issue, the User will either be transferred to the relevant CPO support service, or given the relevant contact details for the CPOâs support provider.  
To confirm, all support requests relating to payments (including payment failures, incorrect monetary charges, and refund requests) should be directed to the Zap-Pay helpline (the number is displayed across all relevant Zap-Map Sites and Services).
All support requests relating to non-payment issues (including charging unit failures, charging service issues, and other parking/site charges) should be directed to the CPO helpline.  
Users accept that, while all reasonable measures are made to ensure the availability of Zap-Pay, Zap-Map does not guarantee that the payment service will be available at all times (due to maintenance or operational issues with Zap-Map Services, the payment gateway provider or with the CPO).
Zap-Map also reserves the right to suspend the Zap-Pay service at any time and without giving notice to Users, and/or to suspend specific Zap-Pay Users if they fail to comply with any of the Terms and Conditions. 
Users of Zap-Pay accept that: (i) payments are processed in the currency of the country in which Zap-Pay is available (e.g.
Pounds Sterling for the United Kingdom), (ii) these Zap-Pay Terms and Conditions are governed by and construed in accordance with the law of England and Wales, and (iii) the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with these Terms and Conditions. 
As part of our Limitation of Liability terms (see section 10), Zap-Map will under no circumstance be liable for indirect, special, or consequential damages including any loss of business, revenue, profits, or data, or damage to any vehicle or battery, in relation to use of Zap-Map Sites and Services, or accessing CPO Services (which remain the responsibility of the CPO at all times, and which are provided directly by the CPO to the User under the CPOâs Terms of Sale). 
If you wish to complain about any Zap-Pay related services, complaints should be made directly to the party responsible: Zap-Map for payment complaints, and the relevant CPO for CPO complaints. 6.
REFUND POLICYIf you have made a payment using Zap-Pay for EV charging services on a participating CPO but have been unable to charge your vehicle or have been incorrectly charged for the service provided, then you can request a refund for the amount incorrectly debited from your payment card.  
To request a refund, contact Zap-Map and describe the payment issue including as much detail about the transaction as possible including your Zap-Map username (if you are a Registered User), the location, date, and time of the charging session.
Zap-Map reserves the right to check any relevant details within the Userâs payment history including and any previous refund claims. 
All refund requests must be received within 28 days of the charging session for which the claim is being made.
Please note that while we will aim to process requests as quickly as possible, the refund process may take up to 10 days, depending on the policy of the card issuer. 
To contact Zap-Map, contact support@zap-map.com (mark your email âRefund requestâ), send a message on the Zap-Map app using the Zap-Chat messaging service, or phone the Zap-Pay helpline (the number is displayed across all relevant Zap-Map Sites and Services).
Alternatively you can write to: Zap-Map, Unit 52, Runway East, 1 Victoria St, Redcliffe, Bristol BS1 6AA.
Mark your letter âRefund requestâ.7.
