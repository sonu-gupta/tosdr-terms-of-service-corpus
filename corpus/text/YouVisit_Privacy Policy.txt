 Privacy Policy EAB and Our Commitment to Your Privacy 
Who Is EAB? EAB Global, Inc.
(together with its subsidiaries, including YouVisit, LLC, and its affiliates, âEABâ, âus,â âwe,â and âourâ) is a data driven research, technology, and services organization partnering with education leaders, practitioners, and staff to accelerate progress and drive results in the most pressing and complex issues facing colleges, universities, community colleges, K-12 school districts, independent schools, and graduate programs in the country.

EABâs Commitment to Privacy. EAB is deeply committed to maintaining the privacy and security of confidential and sensitive information we may collect, retain, process, or transfer or which is provided to us directly by our clients.
We collect and use personal information to provide our products and services to our clients and our clientsâ end users.
In many cases, we do this at the direction of our clients. We do not and will not sell or rent personally identifiable data to third parties.

Scope of this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy governs all services we provide directly to you and applies to personal data that can be associated with an identified or identifiable person.
This Privacy Policy does not relate to anonymized, disaggregated, or de-identified data.
Whether you are accessing our public website, exploring employment opportunities through our job portal, participating in a research membership forum, or using one of our products via a software application, this Privacy Policy governs our use of personal information for all our products and services that we provide directly to you.
When we collect personal information directly from you in connection with our interactions with you, we are a data controller.

Scope of your institutionâs privacy policies.  If you are an employee, student, prospective student, or other end user of our client, and we are collecting your personal information in connection with the products and services we provide to our clients, we are a data processor.
In this case, our use of your personal information is governed by the privacy policy of the institution from which we have received, or on whose behalf we collected or use, your personal information (âyour institutionâ).
Our Privacy Statement does not supersede the terms of any agreements between us and your institution, nor does it affect the terms of any agreements between you and your institution, including any prior consent you have provided concerning the use and distribution of your personal information.

Updates to this Privacy Policy.  From time to time, this Privacy Policy may be updated to reflect changes to our products and services, the way we operate, or to meet new legal and regulatory requirements.
You will find the latest version of this Privacy Policy at https://eab.com/privacy-policy. Information That We Collect The type of personal information we collect about you depends upon your relationship with us.

Do Not Track Signals.
Currently, various browsers â including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari â offer a âdo not trackâ or âDNTâ option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to websites visited by the user about the userâs browser DNT preference setting.
With respect to our Virtual Tour Program, EAB does not currently commit to responding to browsersâ DNT signals with respect to our websites, in part, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent. Other types of disclosures We will also share your information to the extent required in the following circumstances:

To comply with legal or regulatory requirements and to respond to lawful requests, court orders, and legal processes.

If we learn that we have collected or received personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information upon request.
Please contact us at  privacy@eab.com if you believe we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under 13 without proper consent. Security In order to protect personal information, EAB has established a data privacy program based on the âprivacy by designâ framework which proactively embeds privacy protection into the design of our IT systems, networked infrastructure, business practices, and software applications.
We employ a variety of physical, administrative, and technological safeguards designed to protect personal information against loss, misuse, and unauthorized access or disclosure.
We have dedicated information security programs and work hard to continuously enhance our technical and operational security measures.
Specifically, EAB aligns its policies with the ISO 27001 framework.
We maintain a comprehensive list of policies and procedures that are readily accessible by all workforce clients via an internal portal.
Information is encrypted at rest on laptops, removable devices, and at the data centers we partner with for our technology products and services.
EAB requires the secure transmission of personal information to and from our network.
we work with clients to discourage transmission that is otherwise not secure.
This is accomplished through a combination of secure technologies like SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) for in-transit encryption of bulk file transfers and SSL/TLS encryption in transit for web traffic.
Datacenter controls include the use of SOC-audited data centers with physical controls including multi-factor authentication for access, 24Ã7 monitoring, video monitoring, and locked cages.
We also have active detection (IDS monitoring, log consolidation, alerting) and prevention (IPS, firewall, security zones) programs to protect personal information, and vetted third party providers for centralized audit logging capabilities.
