1.2 Users. The Services are available to end user employees or contractors (âEmployeesâ) (i) whose employer or organization (âOrganizationâ) has entered into a Master Services Agreement with Fellow.
or (ii) who have signed up for the Services individually without an Organization.
Fellow may also make some aspects of the Platform and Services available for free.
By using the Services in any manner as an Employee, you represent and warrant to Fellow that you are permitted to do so by your Organization and not in breach of any Organization policy.

1.3 Third-Party Services. Your use of any third-party software, tools or integrations with the Services, including but not limited Office 365, Google or Slack will require you to agree to the terms of service and privacy policy of any such third-party.

REGISTRATION

2.1 Accounts. Employee Users must register for an account to use the Services (your âAccountâ).
In order to use the Services as an Employee, you must use the invitation from your Organization to register for an Account.
When you register for the Account, you will be required to provide certain information, which is subject to our Privacy Policy.
To access the basic version of the Platform, you still need to register for an Account but do not need an invitation from an Organization.

2.2 Credentials. After you have registered for an Account you can login using your Google, Office365 or Slack account credentials (depending on which you used to sign up).
In the future, we may add further login mechanisms including one to allow for login using an email/password combination.
You are responsible for all activity occurring on your Account, so please select a strong password for your Google/Office365/Slack accounts and if applicable, your password for Fellow (should that login mechanism be offered for using the Services).
Please keep your password (as applicable) secure, and do not share it with any other individual.
We will not be liable for any damages caused by virtue of the compromise of your Account or password, including any unauthorized access to your Account or use of your Account or any information contained therein.
Please contact us immediately if you suspect or become aware of any unauthorized use of your Account or any other breach of security.
