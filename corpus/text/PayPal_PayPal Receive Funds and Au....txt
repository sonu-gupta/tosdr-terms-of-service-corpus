PayPal Receive Funds and Automatic Transfer allows you to receive payments into your PayPal account and have those amounts automatically transferred to your linked US bank account or Visa credit card.
All payments that you receive are subject to a 30-day hold period.
Please read these terms and conditions to understand PayPalâs requirements for receiving payments.
  1.
Eligibility: 
In order to receive payments into your PayPal account, you must link your US bank account or Visa credit card to your PayPal account and complete PayPalâs credit card and/or bank account verification process.

  2.
Automatic Transfer: 
On a regular basis, PayPal will automatically transfer the amounts from your available PayPal Balance to your US bank account or Visa credit card.
The automatic transfer will occur within the first 3 days of each month, quarter, or applicable period in the country in which you reside.
There is no fee for automatic transfers to your US bank account or Visa credit card.

  3.
Manual Transfer and Fee: 
If you do not want to wait for the automatic transfer, you may manually transfer the amounts in your available PayPal balance to your US bank account or Visa credit card.

Manual transfers to your Visa credit card will incur a $5.00 USD (or equivalent) fee.
Manual transfers to your US bank account are free.



  4.
Payment Hold Period: 
All payments that you receive will be subject to an initial 30 day hold period and will be placed in a pending balance.
This means that you will not have access to your funds for at least 30 days.
After the initial 30 day hold period, your funds will be released to your available balance unless PayPal is holding the amounts for another reason as specified in the PayPal User Agreement, or other agreement that you have entered into with PayPal.
PayPal, in its sole discretion, may determine that you are no longer subject to an initial 30 day hold period.
In such an event, payments you receive into your PayPal account will appear in your available balance soon after you receive the payment.
PayPal will base its decision to remove the 30 day hold period on a number of factors including but not limited to the following: the length of time you have been a PayPal customer, the type of goods or services that you sell, and the number of customer complaints that you receive.

  5.
Withdrawal Limits: 
Automatic transfers to your Visa credit card are limited to $10,000 USD (or equivalent) per transfer.
Manual transfers to a Visa credit card are limited to $500 USD (or equivalent) per day.
The daily limit of transfers to your Visa credit card (total of automatic and manual transfers) is $10,000 USD (or equivalent).

  6.
Financial Instruments (linked US bank account or Visa credit card): 
If you have more than one financial instrument linked to your PayPal account, PayPal will use the first financial instrument that you linked to your PayPal account for automatic transfers.

This means that if you link a Visa credit card to your PayPal account one day, and then link a second Visa credit card to your account the next day, PayPal will use the first Visa credit card for the automatic transfer.
You may change this by going to the âProfileâ page, selecting âManage Automatic Transferâ, and following the instructions to select your preferred financial instrument for automatic transfers.


If you remove your US bank account and/or Visa credit card, PayPal will request that you add a new financial instrument to your PayPal account.
If you do not do so, you will lose the ability to receive payments.
If PayPal is unable to transfer your balance to your US bank account and/or Visa credit card for any reason, then PayPal will give you a limited amount of time to add a new financial instrument to your PayPal account.
If you do not do so, you will lose the ability to receive payments.

  7.
Restriction on Sending Payments: 
You may use your credit card to send payments.
You may not use your PayPal balance or US bank account to send payments.
All amounts in your available PayPal balance must be withdrawn from your PayPal account through automatic and/or manual transfer.

  8.
