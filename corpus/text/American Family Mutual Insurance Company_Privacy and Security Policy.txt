This California Privacy Notice supplements the American Family Insurance General Privacy Notice and applies solely to individuals who reside in California (âconsumersâ).
We have adopted this policy to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (âCCPAâ).

We will implement technical safeguards to prohibit re-identification of de-identified information about you.

We have collected some or all the below categories of personal information from consumers within the last twelve (12) months.

Please note that the examples are not an exhaustive list and personal information collected may fall into multiple categories.

We collect personal information about consumers from the following sources:

 Insurance applications and related forms 
Transactions with us, our affiliates or others

 the personal information we obtain.

Your personal information may be disclosed to our affiliates or an external third party for a business purpose.
When we disclose personal information to an external third party for a business purpose, we enter a contract with the recipient that describes the purpose for sharing the information and requires the recipient to protect that information.

Your Rights and How to Exercise Them

Access Request Rights

and
The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you.


Deletion Request Rights

Subject to certain exceptions, you have the right to request that we delete any of the personal information that we collected from you and have retained.
Unless an exception applies, once we receive your request and confirm your identity (see Exercising Access and Deletion Rights), we will delete your personal information from our records and direct our service providers to delete your personal information from their records.

We may deny your deletion request if we did not collect the information directly from you or we or our service providers need the information:

To complete a transaction or service that you requested;
For security purposes.

or
To comply with a laws or legal obligation.
