 Cloudflare Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy is effective as of October 27, 2020.

We have updated our March 31, 2020 privacy policy to reflect that we no longer rely on the EU-U.S.
and Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shields as a basis under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for the transfer of personal data from the EU, UK, and Switzerland to the United States.


This Cloudflare Privacy Policy (âPolicyâ) outlines the personal information that Cloudflare, Inc.
(âCloudflareâ, âweâ, âusâ or âourâ) gathers, how we use that personal information, and the options you have to access, correct, or delete such personal information.
 CLOUDFLAREâS PROMISE
Our mission to help build a better Internet is rooted in the importance we place on establishing trust with our Customers, users, and the Internet community globally.
To earn and maintain that trust, we commit to communicating transparently, providing security, and protecting the privacy of data on our systems.
We keep your personal information personal and private.
We will not sell or rent your personal information to anyone.
We will not share or otherwise disclose your personal information except as necessary to provide our Services or as otherwise described in this Policy without first providing you with notice and the opportunity to consent.



1.
POLICY APPLICATION
This Policy applies to Cloudflareâs collection, use, and disclosure of the personal information of the following categories of data subjects:

For clarity, âWebsitesâ does not include any sites owned or operated by our Customers, including where we serve as Registrar.



Customers: Individuals or entities who enter into a subscription agreement with Cloudflare (or its authorized partner) and to whom Cloudflare provides Services pursuant to such agreement.
For purposes of this Policy, âServicesâ shall refer to all of the cloud-based solutions offered, marketed, or sold by Cloudflare or its authorized partners that are designed to increase the performance, security, and availability of Internet properties, applications, devices, and networks, along with any software, software development kits, and application programming interfaces ("APIs") made available in connection with the foregoing.



Administrators: Those with login credentials for a Cloudflare account and/or those who administer any of the Services for a Customer.
In some cases, an Administrator and Customer may be the same individual.
In other cases, an Administrator may be an agent acting on behalf of a Customer.

See the 1.1.1.1 Application Privacy Policy for more information about the data collection and use practices for Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 Application and the associated 1.1.1.1 Application Services.

This Policy also does not apply to our Customersâ domains, websites, APIs, applications, and networks, which may have their own terms and privacy policies.
Our Customers are solely responsible for establishing policies for and ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including those relating to the collection of personal information, in connection with the use of our Services by End Users with whom our Customers interact.

INFORMATION WE COLLECT (Categories of Data Subjects)


Attendees



Name, email address, and other contact information: We may ask for and collect personal information such as your name, address, phone number and email address when you visit our offices, register for or attend a sponsored event or other events at which Cloudflare (and/or its representatives) participates, or participate in Cloudflareâs studies such as user experience research.

Image and voice: When you participate in a Cloudflare study, we may ask for your permission to record your voice and/or image during your participation in the study.

Name, email address, and other contact information: We ask for andâat your optionâcollect personal information from you when you submit web forms on our Websites, including opportunities to sign up for and agree to receive email communications from us.
We also may ask you to submit such personal information if you choose to use interactive features of the Websites, including participation in surveys, contests, promotions, sweepstakes, or studies, requesting customer support, submitting feedback, or otherwise communicating with us.
We will send such communications in accordance with applicable law.

Log files: Just as when you visit and interact with most websites and services delivered via the Internet, when you visit our Websites, including the Cloudflare Community Forum, we gather certain information and store it in log files.
This information may include but is not limited to Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, system configuration information, URLs of referring pages, and locale and language preferences.


Cookies and other tracking technologies: We may use cookies and other information-gathering technologies for a variety of purposes, such as providing us with information about how you interact with our Websites and assisting us in our marketing efforts.
You can control how websites use cookies by configuring your browser's privacy settings (please refer to your browser's help function to learn more about cookie controls).
Note that if you disable cookies entirely, Cloudflareâs Websites may not function properly.
We may also use cookies and similar technologies to provide you advertising on third-party sites based upon your browsing activities and interests.
If you wish not to have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking here (or if located in the European Union, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland, click here).
You may view a complete list of cookies and change your cookie preferences by clicking on the âCookie Preferencesâ link in the footer of the Cloudflare homepage at cloudflare.com.

Material contributed in Interactive Areas: The Websites may offer publicly accessible blogs, community forums, comments sections, discussion forums, or other interactive features (âInteractive Areasâ).
If you choose to participate in any of these Interactive Areas, please be aware that any information that you post in an Interactive Area might be read, collected, and used by others who access it.
If you wish to remove your personal information from any of our Interactive Areas, please see the Section 8, below.




Customers and Administrators



Customer Account Information: When you register for an account, we collect contact information.
Depending on subscription level, this contact information may include your Customer name, the email address(es) of your account Administrator(s), telephone number, and addresses necessary to process payment and delivery of Services.
In addition, when you use the Services, we collect information about how you configure your account and the Services (e.g., firewall settings for the domains you administer), and we maintain logs of Administrator activity.
We refer to all of this information collectively as âCustomer Account Informationâ for the purposes of this Policy.
Customer Account Information is required to enable your access to your Cloudflare account and Services.
By providing us with any personal information, you represent that you are the owner of such personal information or otherwise have the requisite consent to provide it to us.

Payment information: We do not require our Customers to have payment information on file with us unless they have a paid subscription to our Services.
When you sign up for one of our paid Services, you must provide payment and billing information.
The information you will need to submit depends on which payment method you choose.
For example, if you pay with a credit card, we will collect your card information and billing address, although we do not store full credit card numbers or personal account numbers.



Public DNS Resolver Users



Limited DNS query data: We will collect limited DNS query data that is sent to our 1.1.1.1 resolver.
Our 1.1.1.1 resolver service does not log personal data, and the bulk of the limited non-personally identifiable query data is only stored for 25 hours.
You can learn more about our 1.1.1.1 resolver commitment to privacy here.
Please note that our data handling practices for our 1.1.1.1 Application, which is not covered by this Policy, are somewhat different than our 1.1.1.1 resolver data handling practices and are described here.

Log Data: Cloudflare processes End Usersâ information on behalf of our Customers.
This information is processed when End Users access or use our Customersâ domains, websites, APIs, applications, devices, end points, and networks that use one or more of our Services.
Cloudflare also processes End Usersâ information on behalf of our Customers when the End Users access our Services pursuant to our Customersâ authorization.
The information processed may include but is not limited to IP addresses, system configuration information, and other information about traffic to and from Customersâ websites, devices, applications, and/or networks (collectively, âLog Dataâ).



Registrants



Contact and domain information: We collect data such as domain name and status, contact information (such as name, organization, address, phone number and email address), name server, DNSSEC, and Form of Approval (i.e., full WHOIS capture at time of transfer into our system, including the IP address that initiated the transfer).



In addition, Cloudflare stores server and network activity data, and observations and analyses derived from traffic data collected by Cloudflare in the course of providing the Services (together, âOperational Metricsâ).
Examples of Operational Metrics include service uptime and service availability metrics, request volumes, error rates, cache rates, and IP threat scores.

If you are accessing or using our Websites or Services or otherwise providing information to us, we may transfer your personal information outside of the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, ensuring appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your personal information.
We describe our additional safeguards here.
If you have any questions about or need further information concerning the appropriate safeguards Cloudflare has in place to protect your personal information, please contact us at privacyquestions@cloudflare.com.
While Cloudflare no longer relies on the EU-U.S.
and the Swiss -U.S.
Privacy Shield as a lawful basis for international transfers of personal data from the EEA and Switzerland to the U.S., Cloudflare remains certified under both the EU-U.S.
and the Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield Frameworks respectively as set forth by the U.S.
Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the EEA, the UK, and Switzerland to the United States, respectively (âPrivacy Shieldsâ).
We commit to periodically review and verify the accuracy of our policies and our compliance with the Privacy Shields.
If there is any conflict between the terms in this Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.
For more information on the EU-U.S.

If you believe that we maintain copies of your personal data within the scope of the Privacy Shields, you may direct any inquiries to SAR@cloudflare.com or via mail to: Cloudflare, Inc., 101 Townsend St., San Francisco, CA 94107, Attn: Data Protection Officer.
We will respond to your inquiry within 30 days of receipt and verification of your identity.

If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.

Our commitments under the Privacy Shields are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S.
Federal Trade Commission.
We may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
Under such circumstances, we may be prohibited by law, court order or other legal process from providing notice of disclosure.

DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS AND CHOICES
For any subject access request ("SAR"), we will need to verify a requestor is inquiring about their own information before we can assist.
Where a SAR may implicate the personal data of another individual, we must balance the request against the risk of violating another personâs privacy rights.
We will comply with SARs to the extent required by applicable law or the US-Swiss or US-EU Privacy Shield.
In the EEA, the UK, and Switzerland, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.

Attendees, Website Visitors, Customers, Administrators, and Registrants. You have the right to access, correct, update, export, or delete your personal information.
You may email us at SAR@cloudflare.com with any such subject access requests (âSARâ), and we will respond within thirty (30) days.
Customers and Administrators also can access, correct, export, or update their Account Information by editing their profile or organization record at cloudflare.com.

Public DNS Resolver Users. We do not retain any personal information about 1.1.1.1 resolver users that would be subject to the data subject rights described above.

End Users. Cloudflare has no direct relationship with End Users.
Even where âCloudflareâ may be indicated as the authoritative name server for a domain, unless Cloudflare is the owner of that domain, we have no control over a domainâs content.
Accordingly, we rely upon our Customers to comply with the underlying legal requirements for subject access requests.
If an End User requests that we access, correct, update, or delete their information, or no longer wishes to be contacted by one of our Customers that use our Services, we will direct that End User to contact the Customer website(s) with which they interacted directly.
Our Customers are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations with respect to their website users.

DATA SECURITY, DATA INTEGRITY AND ACCESS
