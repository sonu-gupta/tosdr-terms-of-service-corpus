Siteimprove would like to offer a clear website with the most relevant content for you.
To make this possible, we use technologies that can collect information about you and how you and other visitors use siteimprove.com (the "Website").
With this Cookie Notice, we want to create transparency and give you a complete overview of what the processing of your information includes, what you have to consider and which options you have to op-out.
1. Processing of Personal Data using Cookies
Cookies enable the Website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font size and other display preferences) over a period of time, so you donât have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another.
The primary information usually collected through Cookies is statistical and technical information about equipment, and visitor actions on our website, such as:

Traffic data
Location and IP address
Communication data
Operating System
Browser

Siteimproveâs use of Cookies may result in the processing of IP addresses which are considered Personal Data and we therefore recommend that you also read our Privacy Policy which describes our processing of Personal Data and your rights.
2. Consent
By clicking on "Allow all cookies" in the cookie banner or using the Website, you consent to Siteimprove using cookies as described in the form below, unless you have opted out of cookies.
If you do not deselect optional cookies at the time of consent, you can revoke the consent by blocking cookies in your web browser.
More information on how to block and delete cookies can be found in Section 4 below.
3. What are Cookies?
Cookies are small text files that the Website can place on your computer's hard drive, smartphone or other electronic equipment.
However, the term "Cookies" in this Notice and consent also means other forms of automatic data collection, e.g.
Flash cookies (Local Shared Objects), Web Storage (HTML5), Javascripts or cookies set using other software.
"Cookies" also includes IP and MAC address information and other information about your device.
Cookies can be used by both Siteimprove and by third parties.
You can read in the tables below which cookies are used and for what purposes.
4.
How to avoid and delete Cookies?
You can control and/or delete Cookies as you wish â for details, see www.allaboutcookies.org.
You can delete all Cookies that are already on your device.
You can also restrict or disable the use of cookies through your web browser.
How this is done depends on which browser you use.
Remember that if you use multiple browsers, you must delete Cookies in all of them.
As a user, you must be aware that the Website may not function 100% optimally if you delete or block Cookies.
If you do this, however, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit a site and some services and functionalities may not work.
5. How does Siteimprove respond to Do-Not-Track signals?
Currently, there is no consensus on what "Do Not Track" means and how to respond to "Do Not Track" signals.
For that reason, we do not respond to those signals.
Be advised that third-parties providing content and applications to the Website set their own policies regarding responses to Do-Not-Track signals.
