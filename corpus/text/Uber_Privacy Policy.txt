Uber collects this data from the time a ride or delivery is requested until it is finished, and any time the app is running in the foreground of their mobile device.
We use this data to enhance your use of our apps, including to improve pick-up locations, enable safety features, and prevent and detect fraud.

Enable features to personalize usersâ Uber accounts, such as creating bookmarks for favorite places, and to enable quick access to previous destinations.
We may, for example, present an Uber Eats user with personalized restaurant or food recommendations based on their prior orders.
Please see the section of this notice titled âChoice and transparencyâ to learn how to object to this use of personal data.

Enable Accessibility features that make it easier for users with disabilities to use our services, such as those that enable deaf or hard-of-hearing drivers to alert their riders of their disabilities, allow only text messages from riders, and enable receipt of flashing trip request notifications instead of sound notifications on their mobile device.

Perform internal operations necessary to provide our services, including to troubleshoot software bugs and operational problems.
to conduct data analysis, testing, and research.
and to monitor and analyze usage and activity trends.



2- Safety and security. We use personal data to help maintain the safety, security, and integrity of our services and users.
This includes:


Screening riders, drivers, and delivery persons before enabling their use of our services and at subsequent intervals, including through reviews of background checks, where permitted by law, to help prevent use of our services by unsafe drivers and/or riders.

Using data from driversâ or delivery personsâ devices to help identify unsafe driving behavior such as speeding or harsh braking and acceleration, and to inform them of safer driving practices.
We also use data from delivery personsâ devices to verify the type of vehicles they used to provide deliveries.

In certain regions, using information derived from driverâs license photos, and other photos submitted to Uber, for safety and security purposes.
This includes Uberâs Real-Time ID Check feature, which prompts drivers and delivery persons to share a selfie before going online to help ensure that the driver or delivery persons using the app matches the Uber account we have on file.
This also includes comparing photographs that we have on file against photographs (i) of other users to prevent identity-borrowing, and (ii) from public databases to verify user identity.

Using device, location, profile, usage, and other data to prevent, detect, and combat fraud or unsafe activities.


Using user ratings and feedback to encourage compliance with our Community Guidelines and as grounds for deactivating drivers and delivery persons with low ratings or who otherwise violated such guidelines in certain countries.

Direct questions to the appropriate customer support person 

Investigate and address user concerns

Monitor and improve our customer support responses and processes



4- Research and development.
We may use the data we collect for testing, research, analysis, product development, and machine learning to improve the user experience.
This helps us to improve and enhance the safety and security of our services, improve our ability to prevent the use of our services for illegal or improper purposes, develop new features and products, and facilitate insurance and finance solutions in connection with our services.


5- Enabling communications between users.
For example, a driver may message or call a rider to confirm a pickup location, a rider may contact a driver to retrieve a lost item, or a restaurant or delivery persons may call a delivery recipient with information about their order.




6- Marketing.

This includes sending users communications about Uber services, features, promotions, sweepstakes, studies, surveys, news, updates, and events.

We may also send communications to our users about products and services offered by Uber partners.
For example, if a user has placed an Uber Eats order, we may provide recommendations, promotions, or ads about similar food offered by other Uber partners.
Although we may send users communications about Uber partnersâ products and services, we do not sell usersâ personal data to, or share it with, such partners or others for purposes of their own direct marketing or advertising, except with usersâ consent.

We may use the data we collect to personalize the marketing communications (including advertisements) that we send, including based on user location, past use of Uberâs services, and user preferences and settings.
We may also send users communications regarding elections, ballots, referenda, and other political and notice processes that relate to our services.
For example, Uber has notified some users by email of ballot measures or pending legislation relating to the availability of Uberâs services in those usersâ areas.


7- Non-marketing communications.
Uber may use the data we collect to generate and provide users with receipts.
inform them of changes to our terms, services, or policies.

We may use the personal data we collect to investigate or address claims or disputes relating to use of Uberâs services, or as otherwise allowed by applicable law, or as requested by regulators, government entities, and official inquiries.


9- Automated decision-making

We use personal data to make automated decisions relating to use of our services.
This includes:

Enabling dynamic pricing, in which the price of a ride, or the delivery fee for Uber Eats orders, is determined based on constantly varying factors such as the estimated time and distance, the predicted route, estimated traffic, and the number of riders and drivers using Uber at a given moment.

Matching available drivers and delivery persons to users requesting services.
Users can be matched based on availability, proximity, and other factors.
Please see here for further information about our matching process.

Determining driver and delivery person ratings, and deactivating drivers, riders, and delivery persons with low ratings.
For more information about how ratings are determined and used, please see here for rider ratings, here for driver ratings, and here for delivery person ratings.
Please also see the section below titled âRatings look-upâ for further information.

Deactivating users who are identified as having engaged in fraud or activities that may otherwise harm Uber, its users, and others.
In some cases, such as when a user is determined to be abusing Uberâs referral program, such behavior may result in automatic deactivation.

Using driver location information, and communications between riders and drivers, to identify cancellation fees earned or induced through fraud.
For example, if we determine by using such information that a driver is delaying a rider pickup in order to induce a cancellation, we will not charge the rider a cancellation fee and will adjust the amounts paid to the driver to omit such a fee.
To object to such adjustment, please contact Uber customer support.

to protect Uberâs rights or property or the rights, safety, or property of others.
or in the event of a claim or dispute relating to the use of our services.

E.
Data retention and deletion


Uber retains user data for as long as necessary for the purposes described above.




Users may request deletion of their accounts at any time.
Uber may retain user data after a deletion request due to legal or regulatory requirements or for the reasons stated in this policy.


Uber retains user data for as long as necessary for the purposes described above.
This means that we retain different categories of data for different periods of time depending on the category of user to whom the data relates, the type of data, and the purposes for which we collected the data.

Users may request deletion of their account at any time through the Settings &gt.
Privacy menus in the Uber app, or through Uberâs website (riders and delivery recipients here.
drivers and delivery persons here).
Following an account deletion request, Uber deletes the userâs account and data, unless they must be retained due to legal or regulatory requirements, for purposes of safety, security, and fraud prevention, or because of an issue relating to the userâs account such as an outstanding credit or an unresolved claim or dispute.
Because we are subject to legal and regulatory requirements relating to drivers and delivery persons, this generally means that we retain their account and data for a minimum of 7 years after a deletion request.
For riders and delivery recipients, their data is generally deleted within 90 days of a deletion request, except where retention is necessary for the above reasons.
F.
Grounds for processing


We only collect and use personal data where we have lawful grounds to do so.
These include processing user personal data to provide requested services and features, for purposes of Uberâs legitimate interests or those of other parties, to fulfill our legal obligations, or based on consent.


We collect and use personal data only where we have one or more lawful grounds for doing so.
Such grounds may vary depending on where our users are located, but generally include processing personal data: 

A- To provide requested services and features

In order to provide our services, we must collect and use certain personal data.
This includes: 

User profile data, which we use to establish and maintain user accounts.
verify user identity.
communicate with users about their trips, orders, and accounts.
and enable users to make payments or receive earnings 
Background trip information, which is used to verify an applicantâs eligibility to be a driver or delivery person

Usage data, which is necessary to maintain, optimize, and enhance Uberâs services, including to determine incentives, connect riders and drivers, and calculate costs of trips and driver earnings
Transaction information
Information relating to customer support 



B- For purposes of the legitimate interests of Uber or other parties

This includes using personal data to maintain and enhance our usersâ safety and security.
For example, we use personal data to prevent use of our services by users who have engaged in inappropriate or dangerous behavior, such as by retaining data of banned users to prevent their use of Uberâs apps.
We also use usage data to prevent matching of riders and drivers for whom there is higher risk of conflict (for instance, because they have been the subject of prior complaints from other users).

This also includes purposes such as combating fraud.
improving our services, direct marketing, research, and development.
and enforcing Uberâs Terms of Service.
In addition, it includes using personal data to the extent necessary for the interests of other people or the general public, such as in connection with legal or insurance claims, and to protect the rights and safety of others.

C- To fulfill Uberâs legal obligations 

For example, Uber is subject to laws and regulations in many cities and countries that require it to collect and retain data about our usersâ trips and deliveries, and to provide copies of such data to the government or other authorities.
We collect and use personal data to comply with such laws.

Uber may also share data with law enforcement regarding criminal acts or threats to public safety, or requests by third parties pursuant to legal processes.
Uber may also share information with public health authorities where required or permitted by law.
For more information about such sharing, please see Uberâs Guidelines for Law Enforcement Authorities - United States, Guidelines for Law Enforcement Authorities - Outside the US, and Guidelines for Third Party Data Requests and Service of Legal Documents.

D- With consent 

Uber may collect and use personal data based on the userâs consent.
For example, we may collect personal data through voluntary surveys.
Responses to such surveys are collected on the basis of consent and will be deleted once no longer necessary for the purposes collected.

A user who has provided consent to a collection or use of their personal data can revoke it at any time.
However, the user will not be able to use any service or feature that requires collection or use of that personal data.IV.
Choice and transparency

Uber enables users to access and control the data that Uber collects, including through: 





In-app settings




Device permissions




In-app ratings pages




Marketing opt-outs 





Uber also enables users to request access to or copies of their data, changes or updates to their accounts, deletion of their accounts, or that Uber restrict its processing of user personal data.

Notifications: account and trip updates


Uber provides users with trip status notifications and updates related to activity on their account.
These notifications are a necessary part of using the Uber app and cannot be disabled.
However, users may choose the method by which they receive these notifications through the Settings &gt.
Privacy menus in the Uber app.


Notifications: discounts and news


Users may enable Uber to send push notifications about discounts and news from Uber.
Push notifications may be enabled or disabled through the Settings &gt.
Privacy menus in the Uber app.


Communications from restaurant partners 


Delivery recipients who have opted in to communications from restaurant partners may stop sharing their data with each restaurant partner in their Uber Eats account settings.


B- Device permissions

Most mobile device platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) have defined certain types of device data that apps cannot access without the device ownerâs permission, and these platforms have different methods for how that permission can be obtained.
iOS devices notify users the first time the Uber app requests permission to access certain types of data and gives users the option to grant or refuse permission.
Android devices notify users of the permissions that the Uber app seeks before their first use of the app, and use of the app constitutes a grant of such permission.

C- Ratings look-up

After every trip, drivers and riders are able to rate each other on a scale from 1 to 5.
An average of those ratings is associated with a userâs account and is displayed to other users for whom they provide or receive services.
For example, rider ratings are available to drivers from whom they request transportation, and driver ratings are available to their riders.

This 2-way system holds everyone accountable for their behavior.
Accountability helps create a respectful, safe environment for drivers and riders.

Riders can see their average rating in the main menu of the Uber app.

Drivers can see their average rating after tapping their profile photo in the Uber Driver app.
Delivery persons are also rated by delivery recipients and restaurant partners.

D- Marketing opt-outs

Users may opt out of receiving promotional emails from Uber here.
Users may also opt out of receiving emails and other messages from Uber by following the unsubscribe instructions in those messages.
We may still send users who have opted out non-promotional communications, such as receipts for rides or information about their account.
