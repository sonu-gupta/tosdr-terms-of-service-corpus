Any Coins and/or Gifts that are gifted to Users (or received by you) within the Platform are converted to virtual âdiamondsâ in the receiving Userâs account.
The purchase of any Virtual Items must be made lawfully, under legitimate means, and with Real Currency.
Notwithstanding your purchase or possession of such Virtual Items, you acknowledge and agree that you do not in fact own the Virtual Items, and that the amounts of any Virtual Items do not refer to any credit balance of Real Currency or its equivalent.

as a virtual âtipâ to any other Userâs account) may result in some revenue to such recipient User, as determined in our sole and absolute discretion, and is made solely at your own discretion.
You further agree that once you have confirmed a transfer of any Virtual Item to another Userâs account, the action cannot be undone and the Virtual Item cannot be withdrawn.
Notwithstanding, we make no guarantee that the amount or value of the Virtual Items you may give a User will correlate to the revenue such User may receive.The purchase of Virtual Items is a completed transaction upon our confirmation of electronic payment from you via the iTunes App Store, Google Play, or other channels.
Any virtual currency balance shown in your User account does not constitute Real Currency or reflect any stored value or balance, but instead constitutes a measurement of the extent of your license to the Virtual Items within the Service.
You will not be able to sell Virtual Items in exchange for virtual currency or Real Currency credited back to your account, nor will you be able to receive a refund of virtual currency or Real Currency for Virtual Items, including if your access to the Platform has been suspended, limited, or terminated pursuant to these terms and conditions.The value (i.e.

By your use of the Service, you confirm your understanding and acceptance of the exchange rate of any Virtual Items which shall be the current exchange rate at the time of your purchase of said Virtual Items.Your use of any Virtual Items purchased shall be solely for legitimate purposes within the Service, and must comply with all applicable laws and regulations at all times (i.e.

If you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions regarding purchases and/or payments regarding the Platform, please contact us at accounting@kumu.ph.8.2 Virtual diamonds â cashing out: Notwithstanding the above restriction regarding refunds, any virtual diamonds stored in your User account that exceeds the value of fifty thousand (50,000) diamonds, either by your own purchase or by receipt from another User, may be âcashed-outâ for Real Currency.
The value of any Real Currency received from any Cash-Out shall be determined by the current exchange rate at the time of Cash-Out, which we may set and change from time to time in our sole and absolute discretion.
