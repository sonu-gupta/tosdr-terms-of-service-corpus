What are "cookies" and how do I enable them?
Cookies are simply text files that allow a site to recognize you when you return.
This means you donât have to log in again and again.
Cookies used by Rakuten and our network of stores are completely safe, and they are enabled by default with most browsers.
Will I start receiving "spam" if I join?
No.
We send two types of emails to our members: member-services emails required to maintain the program (such as Cash Back credits and payment notifications) and promotional emails featuring especially good offers.
You may choose not to receive promotional emails at any time from your account page or by clicking the "unsubscribe" link in an email.
We will not sell your information to any third party. Related Articles
