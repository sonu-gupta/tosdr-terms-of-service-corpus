You may use the Services only in compliance with these Terms.
The Services may continue to change over time as we refine and add more features.
We may stop, suspend, or modify the Services at any time without prior notice to you.

Your Words &amp.
Your Privacy
By using the Services, you provide us with information, files, and folders that you submit to Transifex (together, âyour wordsâ).
You retain full ownership of your words, and Transifex has no ownership rights in your words.
These Terms do not grant us any rights to your words or intellectual property except for the limited rights that are needed for Transifex to run the Services, as explained below.
We may need your permission to do things you ask us to do with your words, for example, hosting your files, or sharing them at your direction.
This includes product features visible to you, for example, image thumbnails or document previews.
It also includes design choices we make to technically administer our Services, for example, how we redundantly backup data to keep it safe.
You give us the permissions we need to do those things solely to provide the Services.
This permission also extends to trusted third parties we work with to provide the Services, for example, RackSpace, which provides our storage space (again, only to provide the Services).
To be clear, aside from the rare exceptions we identify in our Privacy Policy, no matter how the Services change, we will not share your content with others for any purpose unless you direct us to.
How we collect and use your information generally is also explained in our Privacy Policy.
You are solely responsible for your conduct, the content of your words and files, and your communications with others while using the Services.
For example, it is your responsibility to ensure that you have the rights or permission needed to comply with these Terms.&nbsp.
You grant Transifex a non-exclusive, world-wide, perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable, sublicensable and transferable license to use your words for purposes of performing the Services.
You agree to indemnify Transifex for any third party claims, demands or losses arising as a result of your failure to obtain all such necessary rights, permissions and authorizations.
We may choose to review public content for compliance with our community guidelines, but you acknowledge that Transifex has no obligation to monitor any information on the Services.
We are not responsible for the accuracy, completeness, appropriateness, or legality of files, user posts, or any other information you may be able to access using the Services.
Sharing Your words
The Services provide features that allow you to share your words with others or to make your words public.
There are many things that users may do with those words (for example, copy it, modify it, re-share it).
Please consider carefully what you choose to share or make public.
Transifex has no responsibility for that activity.
Third-Party Services

Upon completion, Transifex will receive the translated content and make it available to the Service Buyer.
Any dates provided for delivery of the translated content or for performing the services are approximate only.
Unless otherwise expressly agreed by Transifex, time is not of the essence for delivery or performance, and no delay shall entitle you to reject any delivery or performance or to repudiate these Terms.
Transifex will not be liable in any circumstances for the consequences of any delay in delivery or performance or failure to deliver or perform.
Posting or delivery to a carrier (including post, facsimile, e-mail) for the purpose of transmission to you shall, for the purposes of these Terms, constitute delivery to you.
Risk in the translated content shall pass to you on delivery.

You may not assign any of your rights in these Terms, and any such attempt is void, but Transifex may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.

otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred.
Any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms shall be finally settled by arbitration in San Francisco, California, using the English language in accordance with the Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with the Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS.
The prevailing party in the arbitration shall be entitled to receive reimbursement of its reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorneysâ fees, expert witness fees and all other expenses) incurred in connection therewith.

Additional Disclosures
