We had an amazing first safariâ¦
We had an amazing first safari experience with Safari.com! ð¯Thanks to Dolan for the well planning and ensure our itinerary goes smoothly and safely!CSY, ZAOct 21, 2022
Superior service, knowledgeable, transparent, amazing can-do attitude
These guys get 10/10.
I have booked with them a few times.
To Kruger National Park, including both public and private(concession) camps, flights and car hire.
Their senior agent, Dolan is exceptional.
Nothing is too much trouble.
Attention to detail, transparency, and 'can-do' attitude are out of the ordinary.
I recently came into contact with Tanya at safari.com as well.
It looks like all their agents are similarly well trained.
Thank you.
I cannot recommend Dolan and his team highly enough.customer, AUNov 18, 2022
Cape Town miracle
I was in Cape Town, South Africa recently for an athletic competition and had allowed myself a week of personal time to relax and properly conclude the trip, but had not bothered to plan a safari to occupy the time.
I was skeptical of the cost and whether I would enjoy the experience, however a couple days into that final week it occurred to me, in a bit of a panic attack, what a waste it would be not to take advantage of this opportunity.
I hopped online and started looking at flights to Johannesburg (almost all the safaris in SA start there with an early morning pick up), but it was basically impossible to get a flight early enough and/or to coordinate with the multiple safaris operating in or just outside of Kruger.
With no apparent options available to turn my remaining 4 1/2 days into even a 3 day safari I stumbled on the most obvious website one could imagine, Safari.com.
I'd completely given up negotiating all the variables on my own but here was a safari travel agent that might be able to help me ..
and they were based right out of Cape Town, literally a stones throw from my lodgings.
Serendipity, or so i hoped.
I immediately sent out an email and crossed my fingers ..
for roughly an hour and a half, at which point Dolan from Safari.com responded to me requesting I give him a call so that we could expedite potential arrangements.
My in country phone plan wasn't able to make calls, but we arranged for him to call me and not 3 hours after being in the grip of despair Dolan got through to me and far from notifying me of how absurd it was to hold out hope for a literally, last minute safari adventure with barely 4 days available to me, he had already worked out all the details I'd sent and created a preliminary safari trip that would bypass Johannesburg airport for a flight the next morning to a closer, much, much smaller airport where I would be picked up taken, not to a 3 day safari, but a full 4 day safari, then back to the tiny, tiny airport for a return flight to Cape Town with 2 hours to spare for my return leg all the way home.
It almost feels like an afterthought, after the minor miracle Dolan was able to conjure up, but the safari itself at Simbavati Lodge was just an absolutely stunning experience.
The single "tent" he booked me was as luxurious as any 4 star hotel I've stayed in, the game drives, one every morning, one every evening were more amazing than I could have ever imagined, and the food, 3 meals a day with snacks and an open bar was sublime.
I could go on about the wonderful staff, or the wonderful other safari goers you can meet and grab a drink with, or the different animals walking through the open lodge facilities daily ..
but I've gone on long enough.
I'll simply conclude by saying ..
safari, absolutely, yes, do it, it is amazing.
And when you do decide, Safari.com will do you right and if you have the pleasure of working with Dolan, do give him my thanks ..
the entire experience was the best part of my trip :)Damian Glennon, CANextPreviousThe safari authorityYour own personal travel assistant25 years in businessWe know Africa bestRelationships with 500+ operators throughout AfricaConsultants available 24/755,000+ customers and countingRead moreNavigate
