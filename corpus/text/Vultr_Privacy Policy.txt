 III.
Information that we collect  Visitors to our SITE and services will have multiple manners of interacting with us.
Depending upon your level of interaction, we will collect different information about you.
We collect information about you directly from you and from third parties, as well as automatically through your use of our SITE.
The type of information collected is as follows:



Members - Members are those users who subscribe to our services will be prompted to provide their name, their address, their age, their phone number, and any other necessary billing information.


Posters - Posters are visitors to our SITE who choose to register to post information in our public forums.
We collect your email address and the password you create for your account when you register, and we also collect information about your posts to our forums.
Any information entered voluntarily by the Poster on one of our forums should be considered public information or information that is publicly available.
If you do not wish for information to be made public, you should not enter it into your user profile when registering as a Poster.


All SITE users and visitors - We automatically collect the following information from all users and visitors to our SITE through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies: your domain name.
your browser type and operating system.
web pages you view.
links you click.
your IP address.
the length of time you visit or use our SITE.
and the referring URL, or the webpage that led you to our SITE.
We may combine this information with other information that we have collected about you, including, where applicable, your user name, name, and other personal information.
Please see the section âCookies and Other Tracking Mechanismsâ below for more information.

 IV.
Our Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms  We and our third party service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms, including those designed for mobile applications, to track information about your use of our SITE.
We may combine this information with other personal information we collect from you (and our third party service providers may do so on our behalf).



Cookies. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your deviceâs hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes.
Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our SITE, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at our SITE and service, including for online advertising purposes.


Disabling Cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future.
The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.
Visitors to our SITE who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the SITE, but some features may not function.


Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your deviceâs hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages.
We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a.
web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our SITE to, among other things, track the activities of SITE visitors and users, help us manage content, and compile statistics about SITE usage.
We and our third party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our customers, to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.


Third Party Analytics. We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of our SITE.
We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our SITE.
We use these tools to help us improve our services, performance, and user experiences.
These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services.
To learn more about Googleâs privacy practices, please review the Google Policy at https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/.
You can also download the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on to prevent their data from being used by Google Analytics at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.


Do-Not-Track. Currently, our systems do not recognize browser âdo-not-trackâ requests.
You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies).
you also may opt-out of targeted advertising by following the instructions in the Third Party Ad Network section.



Third-Party Ad Networks. We use third parties such as network advertisers to serve advertisements on third-party websites or other media (e.g., social networking platforms).
This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested.
Third-party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you.
These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third partyâs specific privacy policy, not this one.
We may provide these third-party advertisers with information, including personal information, about you.

 Users in the United States may opt out of many third-party ad networks.
For example, you may go to the Digital Advertising Alliance (âDAAâ) Consumer Choice Page for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information used by DAA companies.
You may also go to the Network Advertising Initiative (âNAIâ) Consumer Opt-Out Page for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information used by NAI members.
 Opting out from one or more companies listed on the DAA Consumer Choice Page or the NAI Consumer Opt-Out Page will opt you out from those companiesâ delivery of interest-based content or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising through our SITE or on other websites.
You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads).
Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you opt out on the DAA or NAI websites, your opt out may not be effective.
Additional information is available on the DAAâs website at www.aboutads.info or the NAIâs website at www.networkadvertising.org.

Public Forums, Member Directories, and Internal Messaging:

 IX.
Security of Your Information.
 We have implemented reasonable precautions to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
For example, we take measures, including data encryption, to protect the transmission of sensitive end-user information.
Nevertheless, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party âhackersâ from illegally obtaining this information.
We take reasonable measures to prevent such breaches of security, but given the resourcefulness of cyber-criminals we are unable to guarantee that our security is 100% breach-proof.
You assume the risk of such breaches to the extent that they occur despite our reasonable security measures.
 X.
