This partnership highlights the terms and conditions of your usage of all Steller Security products and services (together, the âServicesâ).  In the area of these Services, this partnership supports both (I) your service package.

Applicable Law and Arbitration for Users in The United States 


For users in the United States, the laws of the state of California apply to this Agreement, including any conflict from or in compliance with it or about your usage of the services.
The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Selling of commodities and any other similar law, regulation or statutes in any other jurisdiction does not apply to this Agreement. 
All applicable fees and taxes will be processed on our behalf by our agent, Steller Security LLC.
This will not affect the prices described in our services &amp.
tariffs and you will not result in additional costs. 
If a conflict resulting from or about this Agreement is presented for arbitration, it is resolved by the final and binding arbitration carried out before a single arbitrator, chosen by the Steller Security, under the commercial arbitration of the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (together, " AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as amended by this Agreement, and shall be supervised by the AAA.
The arbitration before the AAA shall begin exclusively on an individual basis without the right for any cases to be arbitrated on a class action basis or bases involving cases brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of any person(s).
All cases are for the arbitrator to decide, including the domain of this arbitration clause, but the arbitrator is bound by the terms of this agreement.
The arbitration will be carried out at the location of the AAA to be decided by Steller Security in California.
In the case where you can demonstrate that the arbitration costs will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Steller Security will pay as much of your filing, administrative and arbitrator costs as part of the arbitration that the arbitrator considers very important to prevent the modification from being cost-prohibitive.
If, however, the arbitrator finds that either of the importance of your case or the aid sought is inappropriate or not guaranteed, as rated by the criteria set forth in the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, then the payment of any arbitration costs shall be regulated by the AAA Rules.
In this case, you agree to refund Steller Security for all the sums already disbursed by it which are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.
If the arbitrator gives you a relief that is equal to or above the value of your application, Steller Security must repay you for your adequate advocateâs costs and expenses incurred under that arbitration.

For users outside the united states, this agreement and any non-contractual obligations emerging from, or in connection to it, shall be governed by and interpreted by the laws of England and Wales, under only compulsory provisions of consumer law in the country in which you live.
The United States Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Commodities as well as any other similar law, regulation or statute in effect in any other jurisdiction shall not apply to this Agreement.
You and Steller Security accept irrevocably that the courts of the country in which you live must have non-exclusive jurisdiction to resolve any conflict or claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims) emerging from or in connection with this Contract (including your usage of the services) or its subject matter or formation.
