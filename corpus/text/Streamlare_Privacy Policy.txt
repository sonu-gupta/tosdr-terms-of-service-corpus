Our servers automatically recognize and log visitors' IP addresses (the number assigned to computers on the Internet), Internet service provider, browser type, computer platform, referring web site, date and time of access, links clicked through, and possibly other information as well.

Depending on how you access the Services, we may use the standard "cookies" feature of major browser applications or similar technologies such as HTML 5 local storage that allow us to store a small piece of data on your computer about your visit to our Services.
When we use cookies, we may use âsessionâ cookies (that last until you close your browser) or âpersistentâ cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them).
For example, we may use cookies to store your preferences or other settings so you donât have to set them up every time you visit our Services.
Some of the cookies we use are associated with your account (including personal information about you, such as the email address you gave us), and other cookies are not.
Advertisers may also use cookies on our Services.
We have no access to or control over these cookies once our third-party advertisers have been given permission to set cookies.
