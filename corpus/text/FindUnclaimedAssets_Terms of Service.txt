General Information



Entire Agreement.
The TOS constitutes the entire agreement between You and Company and governs your use of the Site and Service, superseding any prior agreements between You and Company with respect to the Service.

Choice of Law and Forum.
Your use of the Site, the validity and construction of these TOS and the Privacy Policy, and the interpretation of the rights and duties arising under such, and the relationship between You and Company shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its conflict of law provisions.


Arbitration and Class Action Waiver.
Except as otherwise provided by applicable law, any and all controversies and disputes arising out of or related to use of the Site, the Service, these TOS, the Privacy Policy, and/or their interpretation shall be settled by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
The arbitration shall take place in Delaware.
Arbitration hereunder shall be conducted by one neutral arbitrator appointed by the AAA.
The United States Federal Arbitration Act shall govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings pursuant to this arbitration clause.
Any disputes, including any threshold disagreement about the arbitrability of any claim, shall be delegated to the arbitrator (and not a court).
In no event shall the arbitrator have any authority to award punitive or other damages not measured by the prevailing partyâs actual damages, except as may be required by statute.
Irrespective of the outcome of arbitration, each party shall bear its own costs and expenses, including its own attorneysâ fees, and an equal share of the arbitratorâs fees and administrative fees of arbitration.
The arbitrator shall not determine or award any alternative allocation of costs and expenses, including any attorneysâ fees.
Judgment upon the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
You agree and submit to the personal jurisdiction and venue of any such court of competent jurisdiction.
In the event that this arbitration clause is deemed to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable or illegal, the remaining terms of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, including the waiver of the right to proceed in a class action.
THE PARTIES AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN ANY CONSOLIDATED OR CLASS ACTION AND AGREE THAT ALL FORMS OF CLASS ACTION OR CLASS WIDE ARBITRATION ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED.
THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THEY WILL NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY A COURT OR A JURY AND THAT THE INFORMATION THAT CAN BE OBTAINED IN DISCOVERY FROM EACH OTHER OR FROM THIRD PERSONS IN ARBITRATION IS GENERALLY MORE LIMITED THAN IN A LAWSUIT.
IN ADDITION, OTHER RIGHTS THAT THE PARTIES WOULD HAVE IN COURT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.
Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to your use of the Site, the Service, any or services offered through the Site, and/or these TOS must be brought within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.

Waiver and Severability of Terms.
The failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOS shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
If any provision of the TOS is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the partiesâ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the TOS remain in full force and effect.

No Right of Survivorship and Non-Transferability.
You agree that your account/subscription is non-transferable and any rights to or contents within your account/subscription terminate upon your death.
Upon receipt of a copy of a death certificate, your account/subscription may be terminated and all contents therein permanently deleted.

Statute of Limitations.
You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Site, Service, or the TOS must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.

The section titles in the TOS are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
