Vonage reserves the right to change pricing from time to time.
Customerâs continued use of the Services after a price change becomes effective constitutes Customerâs agreement to pay the changed amount.

Some of the Services may accept recurring period charges as agreed to by Customer on the Site.
By choosing such auto-reload payment plan, Customer acknowledges that such Services have a recurring payment feature and Customer accepts responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation.
VONAGE MAY SUBMIT PERIODIC CHARGES (E.G., MONTHLY) WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM CUSTOMER, UNTIL CUSTOMER PROVIDES PRIOR NOTICE (RECEIPT OF WHICH IS CONFIRMED BY VONAGE) THAT CUSTOMER HAS TERMINATED THIS AUTHORIZATION OR WISHES TO CHANGE ITS PAYMENT METHOD.
SUCH NOTICE WILL NOT AFFECT CHARGES SUBMITTED BEFORE VONAGE REASONABLY COULD ACT. CUSTOMER MUST PROVIDE CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE INFORMATION FOR ITS BILLING ACCOUNT.
IF CUSTOMER HAS REQUESTED AUTO-RELOAD PAYMENTS, CUSTOMER MUST PROMPTLY UPDATE ALL INFORMATION TO KEEP ITS BILLING ACCOUNT CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE (SUCH AS A CHANGE IN BILLING ADDRESS, CREDIT CARD NUMBER, OR CREDIT CARD EXPIRATION DATE), AND CUSTOMER MUST PROMPTLY NOTIFY VONAGE OR ITS PAYMENT PROCESSOR IF CUSTOMERâS PAYMENT METHOD IS CANCELED (E.G., FOR LOSS OR THEFT) OR IF CUSTOMER BECOMES AWARE OF A POTENTIAL BREACH OF SECURITY, SUCH AS THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR USE OF CUSTOMERâS USER NAME OR PASSWORD.
CHANGES TO SUCH INFORMATION CAN BE MADE IN THE ACCOUNT DASHBOARD.

Customer may present Vonage with an exemption certificate eliminating Customerâs and Vonageâs liability to pay certain Taxes.
Once Vonage has received and approved the exemption certificate, Customer shall be exempt from those Taxes on a going-forward basis.
If, a taxing jurisdiction determines that Customer is not exempt from Taxes and assesses those taxes, Customer shall pay those Taxes to Vonage, plus any applicable interest or penalties.
SUCH NOTICE WILL NOT AFFECT CHARGES SUBMITTED BEFORE VONAGE REASONABLY COULD ACT.

Neither Party shall pursue or commence proceedings regarding the dispute in any court, administrative arbitral or other adjudicative body prior to engaging in such consultations and negotiations.



b. Binding Arbitration. If negotiations fail to resolve the dispute within 30 calendar days, and/or small claims court is not a valid option due to the size or nature of the claim, all disputed claims (except for claims relating to intellectual property rights, indemnity, or confidentiality obligations, fraudulent or unauthorized use, theft, or piracy of service, or matters relating to injunctions or other equitable relief) must be resolved by binding arbitration before a single arbitrator, in the English language.
This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be given the broadest possible meaning under applicable law.
The initiation of an arbitration dispute shall not otherwise prevent Vonage or Customer from terminating Services in accordance with the Agreement.



c. Location and Procedure. A Party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other Party a written notice of dispute, which must describe the nature and basis of the dispute and set forth the specific relief sought.
The location of arbitration will be in New York, New York, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, and this dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and not by any state or national law concerning arbitration.

Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction.

The prevailing Party in any action or proceeding to enforce this Agreement shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneysâ fees and costs.



d. Jury Trial and Class Action Waiver. Each Party waives its right to a trial by jury for claims subject to arbitration hereunder.
The arbitrator may award relief only in favor of the individual Party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that Party's individual claim.
The arbitrator may not award special, indirect, punitive, incidental or consequential damages.
CUSTOMER MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST VONAGE ONLY IN CUSTOMERâS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING AND CUSTOMER EXPRESSLY WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO BRING A CLASS ACTION SUIT.
The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's or entity's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

Any purchase orders, confirmations, payment documentation, or other terms provided by Customer, even if signed by the Parties after the date hereof, shall have no force or effect.
In the event that the Parties have executed versions of this Agreement drafted in more than one language, the English language version shall govern and prevail.



b. Modifications/Waivers. Except as expressly provided elsewhere in this Agreement, this Agreement may not be changed or modified, nor may any provisions hereof be waived, nor may any consent or confirmation be considered to have been given, except by an agreement in writing signed by the Party against whom enforcement of the change or modification is asserted, and any such modification, change, waiver, consent or confirmation on Vonageâs behalf may only be given by an authorized signatory of Vonage.
The failure of either Party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.



c. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement, or any part of such provision, is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be (to the minimum extent necessary) replaced by a valid and enforceable provision the effect of which comes as close as possible to the intended economic effect of the unenforceable or invalid provision, so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.



d. Force Majeure. Neither Party is liable for any failure of performance (other than for delay or performance in the payment of money due and payable hereunder) to the extent such failure is due to any cause or causes beyond such Partyâs reasonable control, including acts of God, fire, explosion, vandalism, cable cut, adverse weather conditions, governmental action, acts of terrorism, strikes and similar labor difficulties, war, sabotage, outages of third party connections, utilities, or telecommunications networks, including, without limitation, carrier-related problems or issues, internet-access issues, denial of service attacks, shortage or unavailability of supplies, and other mechanical, electronic or communications failures or degradation.
Either Partyâs invocation of this clause will not relieve Customer of its obligation to pay for any Services actually provided or permit Customer to terminate any Services except as expressly provided herein.



e. Notices. Customer hereby authorizes Vonage to send notices to Customer relating to this Agreement (e.g., Service updates, notices of breach and/or suspension) via email to the email address Customer provides to Vonage in Customerâs Account, in addition to the other means and methods set forth in this Agreement.
It is Customerâs responsibility to keep Customerâs email address current, and Customer will be deemed to have received any email sent to the last known email address Vonage has on record for Customer.
Notices that Vonage sends to Customer via email will be deemed effective upon Vonageâs sending of the email.

legaldept@vonage.com



Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, all notices under this Agreement will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered or sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.
when receipt is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or email.
or the day after it is sent, if sent via next day delivery by recognized overnight delivery service.



f. Relationship of the Parties. The relationship of the Parties shall not be that of partners, agents or joint venturers for one another, and nothing contained in the Agreement shall be deemed to constitute a partnership or agency agreement between the Parties for any purpose.
Vonage and Customer shall be independent Parties and shall discharge their contractual obligations at their own risk subject to the terms of this Agreement.



g. Assignment. This Agreement inures to and is binding upon the Partiesâ successors and permitted assignees.
Customer shall not assign this Agreement without Vonageâs prior written consent.



h. Export Controls. By using the Services, Customer represents and warrants that (i) its use of the Services will not violate any embargoes, sanctions, trade restrictions or similar restrictions issued by any applicable governmental entity, and (ii) Customer, its Affiliates, and its End Users have not been designated by any applicable government or any government agency as a prohibited or restricted party under any trade restrictions, export laws or the like.
Customer also will not use the Site or Services for any purpose prohibited by applicable law, including the development, design, manufacture or production of missiles, or nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.
Customer may not use, export, re-export, import, or transfer any technology or data related to the Services except as authorized by both this Agreement and all applicable laws, rules and regulations.



i. Government Terms. If Customer (or its End Users) is an agency, department or other entity of any government, then any use, modification, duplication, reproduction, release, performance, display, transfer or disclosure of the Services and accompanying documentation shall be governed solely by this Agreement.
Any other use shall be prohibited and no other rights are granted.




15. Terms Applicable to EU Residents.

The terms and conditions in this Section shall apply only to Customers who reside in the European Union, and notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement.



a. Customer shall ensure that Vonage is enabled to use all Customer data (including Application Content) necessary to provide the Services.



b. The primary characteristics of the Services will remain available to Customer during the term of this Agreement.



c. For Customers who reside in Germany, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in general, warranty rights with regards to the Services are ruled by statutory law.
However, liability without fault for initial defects is excluded.
The liability with fault remains unchanged.
In assessing whether or not Vonage is in fault Customer acknowledges that software cannot actually be without defect.
Deficiencies can be cured at Vonageâs discretion either by rectification or replacement delivery.
Customer is only entitled to a termination according to statutory law due to the failure to grant use in accordance with the Agreement if Vonage has been given sufficient opportunity to rectify the deficiency and such attempt has failed.
Vonage does not warrant internet access for Customer, especially the availability or volume of internet access.
Customer is solely responsible for its access to the internet until the point where Services are handed over by Vonage.



d. Notwithstanding Section 3(d), Customer will have a reasonable period from the date of any charge to dispute such charge.



e. As to non-German Customers who reside in the EU, notwithstanding Section 11, the following shall apply in relation to the limitation of liability:
i. The Parties shall only be fully liable for intent and gross negligence as well as damages caused by injury to life, body or health;



ii. In an event of slight negligence, the Parties shall be liable only for breaches of a material contractual obligation (cardinal duty).
A âcardinal dutyâ in the sense of this provision is an obligation whose fulfillment makes the processing of this Agreement possible in the first place and on the fulfillment of which the other Party may therefore generally rely;



iii. In any of the above mentioned cases, the Parties shall not be liable for any lack of commercial success, lost profits and indirect damages;



iv. Liability in accordance with the above clauses shall be limited to the typical, foreseeable damages: and
v. Except where otherwise stated in this Agreement, the Parties shall not be liable for any loss or damage or any costs, expenses or other claims including without limitation loss of profit, business, revenue, goodwill or anticipated savings, loss of any data or information and/or special or indirect loss or consequential loss or otherwise which arise out of or in connection with this Agreement.



f. As to German Customers, notwithstanding Section 11, the following shall apply in relation to the limitation of liability:
i. The liability of Vonage is unlimited for damages arising out of death, injury to body or health based on a breach conducted by a legal representative or designated agent of Vonage, as well as for damages that arise from the lack of a guaranteed characteristic or in case of fraudulent intent;



ii. The liability of Vonage is unlimited for damages caused by Vonage, a legal representative, or designated agent by intent or gross negligence;



iii. In case of a slight negligent breach of a contractual core duty Vonage shall, except in the cases pursuant to (i) and (iv), only be liable to the amount of the typically foreseeable damage.
Contractual core duties abstractly are such duties whose accomplishment enables proper fulfilment of the contract in the first place and whose accomplishment a contractual party regularly may rely on;



iv. Liability pursuant to the German Product Liability Act remains unaffected;



v. The limitation period for claims for damages shall be one (1) year, except in the case of (i), (ii) and (iv) above, where the statutory statute of limitations shall apply.



vi. Insofar as telecommunication services are affected, Vonage shall, except in cases pursuant (i) and (iv) above, in cases of slight negligent breach of a contract only be liable for an amount that does not exceed EUR 12,500 vis-Ã -vis Customer and vis-Ã -vis all damaged parties an amount that does not exceed EUR 10,000,000 per damaging event.
If, in the latter case, the compensation exceeds the said maximum amount payable to several parties due to the same event, the compensation shall be reduced in proportion to the ratio between the total claims for damages and the upper limit.
