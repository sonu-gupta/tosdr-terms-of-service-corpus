From Customer to Temporall.
When Customer submits data via the Services that include Customer Content, Temporall requires a licence to that Customer Content so it can process the data and return results to Customer.
Therefore, by submitting Customer Content to Temporall through the Services, Customer grants to Temporall an irrevocable, royalty-free, and non-exclusive licence, during the Licence Term, to use, copy, display, perform, reproduce, adapt, modify, translate, and distribute this Customer Content solely to enable Temporall to provide the Services to Customer.

(ii) is not unnecessarily disclosed or communicated without Temporallâs prior written consent to any third party.
