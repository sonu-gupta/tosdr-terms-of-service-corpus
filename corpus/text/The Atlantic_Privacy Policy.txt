and the categories of third parties to whom we âdiscloseâ the information for a business purpose are described in Section 3 and Section 5 of this Privacy Policy

Your California Privacy Rights.
As a California resident, you have the rights listed below.
However, these rights are not absolute, and in certain cases we may decline your request as permitted by law.

Opt-in&nbsp.

How to Exercise your California Rights.
California residents may exercise the California privacy rights described above as follows:



Rights to information, access, and deletion

To request to exercise your information, access or deletion rights: 
Complete the âSubmit a CCPA Data Requestâ form available in our online Help Center.
Email privacy@theatlantic.com

Call us toll free: 1-855-940-0585.




Identity verification for CCPA rights to information, access, and deletion.


We reserve the right to confirm your California residence to process your requests and will need to confirm your identity to process your requests to exercise your CCPA rights.
Following California law, we take reasonable precautions to verify the identities of those California residents submitting requests to delete or access Personal Information, or to learn more about how their Personal Information is processed.
For requests to access specific pieces of Personal Information, we verify the requesterâs identity by having them first complete a notarized affidavit affirming their identity and California residency.
When a notarized affidavit cannot be obtained, we may request alternate forms of identification, such as by authenticating oneâs identity through their account on our site or, only when necessary and only as permissible under applicable law, by providing a copy of a government identification card.
For CCPA deletion requests and requests to learn more about how their Personal Information is processed, we verify the requesterâs identity by asking them to confirm their request by email.
We cannot process your request if you do not provide us with sufficient detail to allow us to verify your identity, understand the nature of the request, and respond to it.




Right to opt-out of the âsaleâ of your Personal Information
: The Atlantic does not sell your Personal Information in the conventional sense (i.e., for money)&nbsp.
Like many companies, however, we use services that help deliver interest-based ads to you and may transfer Personal Information to business partners for their use.
Making Personal Information (such as online identifiers or browsing activity) available to these companies may be considered a âsaleâ under the CCPA.&nbsp.
You can request to opt out of such âsaleâ of your Personal Information here: Do Not Sell My Personal Information&nbsp.
Please note that you will still see some advertising, regardless of your selection.
We do not impose verification protocols for processing California residentsâ requests to opt out of the âsaleâ of their Personal Information, unless we have reason to question the authenticity of a requesterâs identity, in which case we may request a notarized affidavit affirming their identity and California residency.


Authorized Agents.
California residents can empower an âauthorized agentâ to submit CCPA requests on their behalf through the same means outlined above through which a California resident may file a request â through our online Help Center, by emailing us at privacy@theatlantic.com, or by calling our toll free number.
Unless the California resident has provided the authorized agent power of attorney, we will also require the following before processing a request submitted via an authorized agent:

Signed authorization from the California resident permitting the authorized agent to submit CCPA requests on their behalf;
Proof of the California residentâs identity sufficient to satisfy our respective verification protocols that otherwise apply to CCPA requests to delete Personal Information, access Personal Information, learn more about how Personal Information is processed, or to opt out of the âsaleâ of Personal Information.
and
Direct confirmation sent from the consumer to us (without the authorized agent as an intermediary) affirming that the agent is authorized to act on their behalf.


Notice Regarding B2B Sites.
Three of our websites, www.Atlantic57.com, www.atlanticbrandpartners.com, and advertising.theatlantic.com (the âB2B Sitesâ), are designed solely for business use and not intended for personal or household use&nbsp.
Accordingly, we treat all information collected from the B2B Sites as pertaining to individuals acting as business representatives, rather than in their individual capacity&nbsp.
We do not âsellâ any information collected from your use of the B2B Sites, as that term is defined by the CCPA.

Notice Regarding California Residents We Know to Be Under the Age of 16.
California residents we know to be younger than 16 years of age will by default be treated as though they have exercised a request to opt out of the sale of their Personal Information with respect to information provided directly to us (as opposed to information automatically collected from them through technical means).
We do not permit such users to opt-in to the sale of their Personal Information, unless they provide proof that they are no longer under the age of 16.

CHILDRENâS PRIVACY


The Services are not intended for children under 13 years of age.
With respect to children we know to be located in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland who we also know to be under 16 years of age, and with respect to any child we know to under 13 years of age, we do not knowingly collect information from such children and we do not target the Services to such children.
If you are under 13 years of age, or if you are under 16 years of age and are located in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, do not provide personal information to The Atlantic without providing us with consent from your parents.
If we discover that any child under the age of 13 or a child from the EEA, UK, or Switzerland under the age of 16 has provided us with personal information and we do not have parental consent, we will delete that childâs information as soon as reasonably practicable.
If you believe that we have been provided with the personal information of a child from the EEA, UK, or Switzerland under the age of 16 without parental consent, or have been provided with the personal information of any child under the age of 13 without parental consent, please notify us immediately at privacy@theatlantic.com.

OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION



How Your Information Is Secured&nbsp.
The security of your personal information is important to us.&nbsp.
We employ a number of organizational, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the personal information we collect&nbsp.
However, security risk is inherent in all internet and information technologies and we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information.
You need to help protect the privacy of your own information.
You must take precautions to protect the security of any personal information that you may transmit over any home networks, wireless routers, wireless (WiFi) networks or similar devices by using encryption and other techniques to prevent unauthorized persons from intercepting or receiving any of your personal information.
You are responsible for the security of your information when using unencrypted, open access or otherwise unsecured networks.

How Long Your Information Is Stored  The time period for which we keep information varies according to the purpose for which it is used for.
In some cases, there are legal requirements to keep data for a minimum period.
Unless there is a specific legal requirement for us to keep the information, we will retain it for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data was collected or for which it is to be further processed.

When we run a contest, sweepstakes, or game relating to the Services, it will be accompanied by a set of rules.
The rules for each contest, sweepstakes or game will specify how the information gathered from you for entry will be used and disclosed if it is different than as described in this Privacy Policy&nbsp.
