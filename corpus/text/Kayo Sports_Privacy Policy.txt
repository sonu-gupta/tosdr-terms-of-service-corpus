FOXTEL GROUP PRIVACY POLICY
 

Effective: 3 February 2021

Streamotion is home to entertainment streaming service, BINGE and multi-sport streaming service, Kayo Sports. Streamotion is part of the Foxtel Group and has the same ownership, and so your privacy is protected in the same way as all entities that form part of the Foxtel Group.   
Weâve made some changes to the policy, effective 3 February largely to reflect this ownership structure, but as we get more technologically advanced, we are able to be more clever with how we are able to target programming and advertising to you, which we hope benefits our users. However, we also allow users to tailor their preferences, or completely opt out, via our Preferences and Opt Outs page if they donât want these customisations to occur. We also set out in our policy who we disclose information to and how we store it. Streamotion never sells your data and we mostly share information in an anonymised, aggregated basis which does not identify the individual.
