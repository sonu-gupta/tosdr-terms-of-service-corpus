This privacy policy applies to information collected online from users of this website.
In this policy, you can learn what kind of information we collect, when and how we might use that information, how we protect the information, and the choices you have with respect to your personal information.
What personal information is collected through this website and how is it used?
We collect information about our users in three ways: directly from the user, from our Web server logs and through cookies.
We use the information primarily to provide you with a personalized Internet experience that delivers the information, resources, and services that are most relevant and helpful to you.
We donât share any of the information you provide with others, unless we say so in this Privacy Policy, or when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.
User-supplied information
If you fill out the âcontactâ form on this website, we will ask you to provide some personal information (such as e-mail address, name, phone number and state).
We only require that you provide an e-mail address on the contact form.
Further, if chat is available through this site, you may be asked to provide information if you participate in an online chat.
Please do not submit any confidential, proprietary or sensitive personally identifiable information (e.g.

or credit card, bank account or other financial information) (collectively, âSensitive Informationâ).
If you submit any Sensitive Information, you do so at your own risk and we will not be liable to you or responsible for consequences of your submission.
Information that you provide to us through the contact form or an online chat will be used so that we may respond to your inquiry.
We may also use information you provide to us to communicate with you in the future.
If you do not wish to receive such communications, you may opt out (unsubscribe) as described below.

and
as required by law, in a matter of public safety or policy, as needed in connection with the transfer of our business assets (for example, if we are acquired by another firm or if we are liquidated during bankruptcy proceedings), or if we believe in good faith that sharing the data is necessary to protect our rights or property.
