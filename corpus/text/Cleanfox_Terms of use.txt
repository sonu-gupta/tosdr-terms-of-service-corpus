This document concerns the use of Cleanfox only and cannot have the purpose or effect of restricting or substituting other existing documents such as the user data protection policy and the cookie policy.
The fact that Cleanfox is free of charge depends on our ability to finance the service independently of any payment requested from users.

SIGNING UP FOR CLEANFOX To use Cleanfox, you must first sign up for the service on the website or www.cleanfox.io or the application Cleanfox with a valid personal email address.
The account creation process involves the following stages:
- Stage 1: you fill in your email address.
Only email addresses provided on a personal basis by ordinary email services (Gmail, Live, Hotmail, Outlook, iCloud, Orange, Yahoo, MSN, etc.) will be recognised, excluding addresses that include professional domains.
- Stage 2: you must read and agree to these general terms and the Cleanfox user data protection policy and agree to give Foxintelligence access to your emails and so that you can benefit from the Cleanfox service.
(We use only your transactional and promotional emails and never any personal email).
By validating the registration, you confirm the synchronisation of Cleanfox with your email address.
- Stage 3: for Gmail, Hotmail, Outlook, Live, MSN, Yahoo, Icloud.
for other email providers, go directly to stage 6: to make sure that it is really you who has connected to Cleanfox, you must go through the two-step authentication process, which increases the security of the connexion to your account.
For Gmail, Yahoo, Icloud: you will receive a code sent to your mobile phone, by a text message, a call or by a notification via the Android system or the Gmail app for iPhone.
For Hotmail, Outlook, Live, MSN?: your will receive a code by email to a secondary address, by text message or a notification on your smartphone via the application Microsoft Authenticator.
We will display a tailored help page to you in order to help you to complete this stage.
- Stage 4: for Gmail, Hotmail, Outlook, Live, MSN, Yahoo, Icloud.
for other email providers, go directly to stage 6: you must create an application password, i.e.
a single-use password generated by your email provider for your first login to Cleanfox.
On the app, you can either choose a manual configuration (you do all the steps yourself) or a automatic configuration (Cleanfox does it for you).
- Stage 5: only for Gmail: you must activate the IMAP protocol from your email account.
We will display a tailored help page to you in order to help you to complete this stage.
As on the prior stage, you can either choose a manual or automatic configuration.
- Stage 6: For Gmail, Hotmail, Outlook, Live, MSN, Yahoo, Icloud, you must log-in with the application password created on stage 4.
For other email providers, you must log-in with your usual password.
- Stage 7: now that your registration is complete, Cleanfox starts synchronising your email account in order to isolate newsletters as per the procedure set out hereinafter.
Because the purpose of our service is to avoid receiving unwanted emails, we have decided not to send you an email confirming that you have installed Cleanfox.
You may add or delete an email account at any time using the functionality provided for this purpose.
Adding email accounts will enable you to clean them simultaneously using the same user registration. 7.
LOGIN DETAILS  To sign up for Cleanfox, you identify yourself with your email address and, depending on which email service you use, either the password associated with your email account or the automatically-generated single-use application password.
You must check that these login details, i.e.
your email address and password where the latter is required, are correct, up to date and complete, and carefully obey the rules laid down by your email service in terms of your selection and updating of login details.
Any use of Cleanfox with your account will be attributed to you.
This means that you have sole responsibility for keeping and maintaining the confidentiality of your login details and the acts and conduct of any person who uses your account, even without your knowledge.
Therefore, we cannot be held liable for any permanent deletion of newsletters from your account or in the event of any unlawful or fraudulent use of Cleanfox.
 8.
EMAIL ACCOUNT CLEANING FUNCTION  The email account cleaning service consists of Cleanfox firstly identifying your received newsletters by means of tools that target the subjects and addresses of emails in order to make a full list of them.
Secondly, Cleanfox presents this list of newsletters to you and you may then choose, for each of them, to carry out one of the following actions: 
 - keep it in your inbox.

 - delete it, which means keeping the subscription to the newsletter for the future and putting newsletters received so far in the trash can.

 - delete it and activate automatic deletion of all newsletters sent subsequently by the same sender.

 Cleanfox never deletes newsletters permanently, they are moved to the trash can, which enables the user to delete them manually or automatically according to his/her email account settings.
 9.
STATISTICS CREATION FUNCTION  In exchange for the free provision of the email cleaning service, we use the transactional data extracted from your email account to produce anonymised data for statistical purposes for various economic operators.
Firstly, we use techniques to filter subjects and email delivery addresses to identify transactional emails, which excludes any personal communication that you have received.
Once they have been identified, we use a data extraction tool which enables us to extract the relevant transactional data from each of them, i.e.
the data that classifies the transaction.
This raw data is then enriched with artificial intelligence techniques which enable us to obtain further information about purchases made, but they cannot have the purpose or effect of identifying you in any way, and Foxintelligence uses tested pseudonymisation techniques at this stage.
This structured data is used to draw up statistical study reports for various economic operators.
At this stage, data is fully anonymised and it is therefore impossible for you to be identified again.
 10.
LACK OF ACCESS TO YOUR EMAIL  We access your email account for the sole purposes of identifying newsletters to enable you to delete them on the one hand, and identifying your transactional emails in order to extract from them the data that enables us to produce statistics on the other hand.
In the context of this access, we guarantee to you that our teams do not go through your email accounts freely.
On the contrary, we use tools to filter email subjects and delivery addresses which enable us to identify transactional emails so that we can then, without accessing them as such, extract from them the relevant data giving details of the transaction performed.
We are therefore able to guarantee that we respect the confidentiality of correspondence: firstly, we do not access any personal email that concerns you, and secondly, we do not extract any data from such emails.
On a residual and occasional basis, a limited part of our teams may access your transactional emails in order to develop and improve our tools which filter emails and extract relevant transactional data.
 11.
STATISTICS SECTION  In the Â« Statistics Â» section which can be accessed from your Cleanfox account, you can view statistics concerning the number of emails deleted and newsletters you decided to automatically delete and the number of online purchases that you have made.
 12.
SUSPENSION AND CLOSURE OF ACCOUNT  You can close your account at any time by following the procedure stated in the FAQ accessible on the website www.cleanfox.io.
In your account settings, you should select the email address with which you created your Cleanfox account and click on Â« Delete this email account Â».
Closure of your account for any reason ends the synchronisation between your email account and Cleanfox and loss of the benefit of the service offered through it.
If it identifies a proven breach by you of these general terms, Foxintelligence reserves the right to suspend your account at any time, temporarily or permanently, without giving notice or formal notice of default.
 13.
