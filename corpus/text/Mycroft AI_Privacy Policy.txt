## Our Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms
We and our third party service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information about your use of our Site or Services.
We may combine this information with other personal information we collect from you (and our third party service providers may do so on our behalf).
### Cookies.
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computerâs hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes.
Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Site and Services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at our Site and Service.
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future.
The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to control cookies through that browser.
Visitors to our Site who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the Site, but some features may not function.
### Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies.
Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computerâs hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages.
We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a.
web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Services to, among other things, track the activities of Site visitors and users, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Site usage.
We and our third party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our customers, to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.
### Third Party Analytics.
We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of our Site and, to the extent permitted, our Application.
We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our Services.
We use these tools to help us improve our Services, performance and user experiences.
These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services.
We do not share your name and contact information with these third party analytics providers.
### Do Not Track.
Currently, our Site does not recognize browser âdo-not-trackâ requests.
You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies).
## Third-Party Links
Our Site and Services may contain links to third-party websites.
Any access to and use of such linked websites is not governed by this Policy, but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third party websites.
We are not responsible for the information practices of such third party websites.
## Security of My Personal Information
We have implemented safeguards to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
Please be aware no data security measures can guarantee security.
You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private.

If youâd like to update your profile information with us, you may do so through your account.
You may also request that we delete your account by by logging in to home.mycroft.ai and choosing âDelete Accountâ under your profile.

Please note that it may take up to 10 business days for us to process opt-out requests.
If you opt-out of receiving promotional emails about recommendations or other information we think may interest you, we may still send you e-mails about your account or any Services you have requested or received from us.
