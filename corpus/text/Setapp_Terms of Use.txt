The service 2.1 General Information.
The Services are comprised largely of a platform that permits Developers to offer Developer Content to Customers.
Customers purchase subscriptions to the Services to access the Developer Content.
If you purchase a subscription to the Services (a âSubscriptionâ), you agree to pay the subscription price listed on the purchase page for the subscription period indicated thereon.
Your Subscription will renew at the end of the subscription period at the then-current rate unless you cancel the Subscription through your Account before the end of the applicable subscription period.
Additionally, when you purchase a Subscription, you authorize us to use the payment information we have on file for you to renew the Subscription as described herein.
We may, but are not required to, contact you via email or your Account prior to the end of your Subscription to let you know that your Subscription will auto-renew.
If you are directed to our third-party payment processor(s), you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third partyâs service and that third partyâs personal information collection practices.
Please review such terms and conditions and privacy policy before using the services.
2.2 Trial Period.
When you sign up for a Subscription, we may offer you a free trial period as indicated on the Services (âTrial Periodâ).
If we offer you a Trial Period, we still may require that you add a valid payment method to activate the trial.
At the end of the Trial Period, your Subscription will automatically renew at the then-current rate unless you cancel the Subscription before the end of the Trial Period through your Account or by contacting us.
If your Subscription begins following the Trial Period, but you do not access or use any of the Developer Content following the end of the Trial Period, we will refund the fees charged for the Subscription on your request, provided that you cancel the Subscription within thirty days after the end of the Trial Period.
If you use or access any Developer Content following the end of the Trial Period, you must cancel your Subscription in accordance with Section 2.1 above.
2.3 Grace Period.
If you have made at least one payment under a Subscription and we cannot renew your Subscription at the end of the applicable subscription period, we will offer a grace period (âGrace Periodâ) of 14 days.
During the Grace Period, you will be able to access your Account and the Developer Content.
If we are unable to collect payment for the renewed Subscription at the end of the Grace Period, you will no longer be able to access the Developer Content.
Access to your Account will be terminated two weeks following the end of the Grace Period.
If you wish to reactivate your Account after access has been terminated, you will be required to pay the past-due Subscription payment in addition to a new Subscription payment for the reactivation.

Given the nature of the marketplace, however, we cannot and do not guarantee availability of any particular Developer Content at any time, nor do we guarantee that any Developer Content you download will be available to you perpetually.
You may lose access to downloaded Developer Content, and you acknowledge and agree that neither we nor the Developer will provide you with a refund for such Developer Content in the event we are required to deny access to such Digital Content through the Services, except as required by law.
Your access to all Developer Content will terminate when your Subscription expires or is terminated.
