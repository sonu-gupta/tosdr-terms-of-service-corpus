 Gift Card Terms Physical and digital gift cards ("Gift Cards") are one-time use cards and are only redeemable for subscriptions to the Showtime standalone streaming service (the "Streaming Service") in the United States in US dollars.
Gift Cards are issued by Showtime Digital Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Showtime Digital," "us," or "we").
Internet access is required to redeem any Gift Card.
To redeem a Gift Card, go to www.showtime.com/redeem, and enter the card's PIN number and your ZIP code.
Use of the Streaming Service and Gift Cards is subject to acceptance of these Gift Card terms, our Terms of Use, Mobile Application End User License Agreement, Video Services and Social Networking Policy, and Privacy Policy, available at Terms of Use.
You must be 18 years of age or older to subscribe to the Streaming Service.
Gift Cards are assigned a fixed monetary value (e.g., $30).

If you are a new subscriber, you will need to create an account with the Streaming Service.
If you are a returning or existing subscriber, you will need to log in to your Streaming Service account.
The entire value of the Gift Card will be applied as a credit to your Streaming Service account upon redemption.
Gift Cards can only be redeemed on www.showtime.com/redeem.
Gift Cards cannot be redeemed on a Streaming Service account that is billed through certain third-party distributors, such as iTunes, Google Play, Amazon, or Roku (each a "Distributor").
If you wish to use a Gift Card and previously purchased your subscription to the Streaming Service through a Distributor, please visit our Help Center for more information.
The recurring subscription fee is dependent on the plan you choose and you may apply the value of the Gift Card to any plan.
Based on the credit on your Streaming Service account and the plan you choose, your Streaming Service account will be debited the applicable subscription price (plus applicable taxes and fees) starting on the day the Gift Card is redeemed and on each recurring billing period thereafter.
Your access to the Streaming Service will be terminated when the credit on your Streaming Service account is no longer of sufficient value to permit access to the Streaming Service for the applicable subscription period.
To continue your subscription a credit card or other payment method accepted by the Streaming Service will need to be provided, in which case you will be charged for subsequent periods (plus applicable taxes and fees) unless or until your subscription is cancelled prior to the applicable renewal date.
Any credit remaining on your Streaming Service account will remain on your Streaming Service account until a credit card or other payment method accepted by the Streaming Service is provided or you request a refund from us.
In order to request a refund, please Contact Us.
Once a Gift Card is redeemed it is void, and it may not be used again, transferred or assigned to another person or another Streaming Service account.

Gift Cards are not refundable (whether for cash or otherwise), either prior or subsequent to redemption, except to the extent required by applicable law.
A subscription initiated using a Gift Card is not eligible for any free trial period that may be offered and may not be eligible for certain promotional offers or codes.
Gift Cards cannot be used to purchase other Gift Cards, and cannot be reloaded, resold, or transferred for value.
For combinations with other offers, restrictions may apply.
Gift Cards do not expire and are not subject to any transaction fees.
Gift Cards may not be used in connection with any marketing, advertising or other promotional activities without our prior written approval.
Use of the Showtime name, or any Showtime logo, trade dress or trademarks in connection with the purchase or use of a Gift Card is strictly prohibited.
Furthermore, the use of Gift Cards in any manner that states or implies that any person, website, business, product or service is endorsed or sponsored by, or otherwise affiliated with, the Streaming Service or Showtime Digital is prohibited without our prior written approval.
Title to a Gift Card and the risk of loss, destruction or deterioration pass to the purchaser upon purchase.
We are not responsible for any Gift Card that is lost, stolen, destroyed or used without your permission.
Gift Cards are subject to verification, and any Gift Card that we believe in our sole discretion to have been purchased or obtained fraudulently or through illegal means will be subject to invalidation without refund.
We are not responsible for hardware issues related to your device's access to the service so please check with the applicable device maker for compatibility.
IN THE EVENT A GIFT CARD IS NON-FUNCTIONAL, YOUR SOLE REMEDY, AND OUR SOLE LIABILITY, WILL BE THE REPLACEMENT OF SUCH GIFT CARD.
When you purchase, receive or redeem a Gift Card, you agree that the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Gift Card terms.
We may modify any of the terms and conditions governing use of Gift Cards and our Terms of Use, Mobile Application End User License Agreement, Video Services and Social Networking Policy, and Privacy Policy at any time, with or without notice, even though these changes may affect your ability to use a Gift Card, subject to our compliance with applicable laws.
Your use of a Gift Card or of any Showtime property or service shall be deemed your acceptance of all then-current terms.
The most current version of these Gift Card terms will be available on this site and will supersede all previous versions of these Gift Card terms.
