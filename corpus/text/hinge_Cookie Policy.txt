At Hinge, we believe in being clear and open about how we collect and process data about you.
This page is designed to inform you about our practices regarding cookies, and to explain how you can manage them.

You already know everything there is to know about cookies and just want to adjust your settings?

No problem.
Head to your account settings in the app to adjust your privacy preferences there.

You want to know more about cookies and how we use them?

Happy to explain! Keep on reading.

Note: This Cookie Policy does not address how we process your personal information outside of our use of cookies.
To learn more about how we process your personal information, please read our Privacy Policy, here.

What are cookies?
Cookies are small text files that are sent to or accessed from your web browser or your deviceâs memory.
A cookie typically contains the name of the domain (Internet location) from which the cookie originated, the âlifetimeâ of the cookie (i.e., when it expires) and a randomly generated unique number or similar identifier.
A cookie may also contain information about your device, such as user settings, browsing history and activities conducted while using our services.
Are there different types of cookies?

First-party and third-party cookies

There are first-party cookies and third-party cookies.
First-party cookies are placed on your device directly by us.
For example, we use first-party cookies to adapt our website to your browserâs language preferences and to better understand your use of our website.
Third-party cookies are placed on your device by our partners and service providers.
You can learn more about these partners and service providers via our website and in-app consent management tools.
For details on these tools, see âHow can you control cookies?â below.

Session and persistent cookies

There are session cookies and persistent cookies.
Session cookies only last until you close your browser.
We use session cookies for a variety of reasons, including to learn more about your use of our website during one single browser session, and to help you use our website more efficiently.
Persistent cookies have a longer lifespan and last beyond the current session.
These types of cookies can be used to help you quickly sign in to our website again, for analytical purposes and for other reasons, described below.
What about other tracking technologies, such as web beacons and SDKs?
Other technologies such as web beacons (also called pixels, tags or clear gifs), tracking URLs or software development kits (SDKs) are used for similar purposes as cookies.
Web beacons are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier, enabling us to recognise when someone has visited our service or opened an email weâve sent them.
Tracking URLs are custom-generated links that help us understand where the traffic to our webpages comes from.
SDKs are small pieces of code included in apps, which function like cookies and web beacons.
For simplicity, we also refer to these technologies as âcookiesâ in this Cookie Policy.
What do we use cookies for?
Like other providers of online services, we use cookies to provide, secure and improve our services, including by remembering your preferences, recognising you when you visit our website, measuring the success of our marketing campaigns and personalising and tailoring ads to your interests.
To achieve these aims, we may also link information from cookies with other personal information we hold about you.
When you use our services, some or all of the following types of cookies may be set on your device.
How can you control cookies?
There are several cookie management options available to you.
Please note that changes you make to your cookie preferences may result in using our services becoming a less satisfying experience, as they may no longer be as personalised.
In some cases, you may even find yourself unable to use all or part of our services.

Tools we provide

You can set and adjust your cookie preferences at any time by heading to your account settings in the app and adjusting your app cookie preferences there.

Browser and device controls

Some web browsers provide settings that allow you to control or reject cookies, or that alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer.
The procedure for managing cookies is slightly different for each Internet browser.
You can check the specific steps in your particular browserâs help menu.
You may also be able to reset device identifiers or opt out from having identifiers collected or processed by using the appropriate setting on your mobile device.
The procedures for managing identifiers are slightly different for each device.
You can check the specific steps in the help or settings menu of your particular device.

Interest-based advertising tools

Advertising companies may participate in self-regulatory programmes that allow you to opt out of any interest-based ads involving them.
For more information on this, you can visit the following sites: Digital Advertising Alliance.
Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance.

Opting out does not mean you will not see advertising â it means you wonât see personalised advertising from the companies that participate in these opt-out programmes.
Also, if you delete cookies on your device after youâve opted out, you will need to opt out again.
