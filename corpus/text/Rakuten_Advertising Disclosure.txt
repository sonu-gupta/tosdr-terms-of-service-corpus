How Do We Make Money?

Our business is based on a simple idea: When you follow our links to visit a store, that store pays us a commission on whatever you buy during your visit.
We then share that commission with you, our members, as Cash Back.
In other words, retailers pay to partner with us because we send shoppers to their websites or brick-and-mortar stores.
They may also pay us to help grow their brand.
That means we might feature them on our website, in emails, etc.
Because of these partnerships, members like you benefit by earning Cash Back and getting great offers.
To sum it up, we help retailers succeed and, at the same time, help our members save money.
Weâre happy to answer any questions you have. Related Articles
