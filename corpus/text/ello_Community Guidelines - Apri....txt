         Community Guidelines Ello was created by idealists who believe that the essential nature of all human beings is to be good â kind, considerate, helpful, intelligent, responsible, supportive and respectful of others.
However, this does not mean that everyone always acts accordingly.
Therefore, weâve created a list of community guidelines that we ask all Ello members adhere to.
