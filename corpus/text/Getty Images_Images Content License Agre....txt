         GETTY IMAGES CONTENT LICENSE AGREEMENT LAST UPDATED: April 2021
This is a license agreement between you and Getty Images that explains how you can use photos, illustrations, vectors, and video clips (individually and collectively, "content") that you license from Getty Images.
By downloading content from Getty Images, you accept the terms of this agreement.



What types of licenses does Getty Images offer? Getty Images offers three types of license models: royalty-free ("RF"), rights-ready ("RR") and rights-managed ("RM").
Royalty-free does not mean there is no cost for the license.
Instead, royalty-free means that the license fee is paid once and there is no need to pay additional royalties if the content is re-used.
Royalty-free content is licensed for worldwide, unlimited, perpetual use, and pricing is based on the file size.
Rights-managed and rights-ready content is licensed for specific types of use, and pricing is based on factors such as size, placement, duration of use, and geographic distribution.

Comp license: You are welcome to use content from the Getty Images site on a complimentary basis for test or sample (composite or comp) use only, for up to 30 days following download.
However, unless a license is purchased, content cannot be used in any final materials or any publicly available materials.
No other rights or warranties are granted for comp use.



How can I use licensed content? You may use licensed content in any way consistent with the rights granted below and not restricted (see Restricted Uses below).
Subject to those restrictions and the rest of the terms of this agreement, the rights granted to you by Getty Images are: Royalty-Free
Rights-Managed/Rights-Ready Perpetual, meaning there is no expiration or end date on your rights to use the content.
Worldwide, meaning content can be used in any geographic territory.
Unlimited, meaning content can be used an unlimited number of times.
Any and all media, meaning content can be used in print, in digital or in any other medium or format.
Non-Exclusive, meaning that you do not have exclusive rights to use the content.
Getty Images can license the same content to other customers.
If you would like exclusive rights to use royalty-free content, please contact Getty Images to discuss a buy-out.
Limited to the specific use, medium, period of time, print run, placement, size of content, and territory selected, and any other restrictions that accompany the content on the Getty Images website (or any other method of content delivery) or in an order confirmation or invoice.
Non-Exclusive, meaning that, unless otherwise indicated on the website, your invoice, sales order or separate agreement, you do not have exclusive rights to use the content.
Getty Images can license the same content to other customers.
For purposes of this agreement, "use" means to copy, reproduce, modify, edit, synchronize, perform, display, broadcast, publish, or otherwise make use of.
Please make sure you read the Restricted Uses section below for exceptions.



Restricted Uses.



No Unlawful Use.
You may not use content in a pornographic, defamatory or other unlawful manner, or in violation of any applicable regulations (including for sports content, any restrictions or credentials issued by a sports league or governing body) or industry codes.

No Commercial Use of Editorial Content.
Unless additional rights are specified on the Getty Images invoice or sales order, or granted pursuant to a separate license agreement, you may not use content marked "editorial" for any commercial, promotional, advertorial, endorsement,Â advertising, gambling/betting/gaming uses or merchandising purpose.
This type of content is not model or property released and is intended to be used only in connection with events or topics that are newsworthy or of general public interest.

No Alteration of Editorial Content.
Content marked "editorial" may be cropped or otherwise edited for technical quality, provided that the editorial integrity of the content is not compromised, but you may not otherwise alter the content.

No Standalone File Use.
You may not use content in any way that allows others to download, extract, or redistribute content as a standalone file (meaning just the content file itself, separate from the project or end use).

No Sensitive Use Without Disclaimer.
If you use content that features models or property in connection with a subject that would be unflattering or unduly controversial to a reasonable person (for example, sexually transmitted diseases), you must indicate: (1) that the content is being used for illustrative purposes only, and (2) any person depicted in the content is a model.
For example, you could say: "Stock photo.
Posed by model." No disclaimer is required for content marked "editorial" that is used in a non-misleading editorial manner.

No False Representation of Authorship.
You may not falsely represent that you are the original creator of a work that is made up largely of licensed content.
For instance, you cannot create artwork based solely on licensed content and claim that you are the author.

Restricted Uses - unless additional license purchased. The following are prohibited without the prior written consent of Getty Images and payment of an additional license fee:


No 'On Demand' Products.
Unless you purchase a custom license, you may not use content in connection with "on demand" products (e.g., products in which a licensed image is selected by a third party for customization of such product on a made-to-order basis), including, without limitation, postcards, mugs, t-shirts, calendars, posters, screensavers or wallpapers on mobile telephones, or similar items (this includes the sale of products through custom designed websites, as well as sites such as zazzle.com and cafepress.com).

No Electronic Templates.
Unless you purchase a custom license, you may not use content in electronic or digital templates intended for resale or other distribution (for example, website templates, business card templates, electronic greeting card templates, and brochure design templates).

No Use in Trademark or Logo.
Unless you purchase a custom license, you may not use content (in whole or in part) as the distinctive or distinguishing feature of a trademark, design mark, tradename, business name, service mark, or logo.
Additionally, you shall not be entitled to register (in any jurisdiction) such content (in whole or in part) as a trademark or rely on any such registrations, prior use, and/or accrued goodwill to prevent any third party use of the content or any similar content (including by us, our customers, or the copyright owner of such content).

No Machine Learning, AI, or Biometric Technology Use.
Unless expressly authorized by Getty Images, you may not use content (including any caption information, keywords or other metadata associated with content) for any machine learning and/or artificial intelligence purposes, or for any technologies designed or intended for the identification of natural persons.
Additionally, Getty Images does not represent or warrant that consent has been obtained for such uses with respect to model-released content.

No Metadata Exploitation.
Unless expressly authorized by Getty Images, you may not use the caption information, keywords, accompanying text, or other metadata associated with content separate and apart from the content, or allow any third parties to access or use any such information associated with content.
Unless expressly authorized by Getty Images, you may not use any items of content in connection with an immutable digital asset intended for sale (such as a non-fungible token).




Who, besides me, can use the licensed content? The rights granted to you are non-transferable and non-sublicensable, meaning that you cannot transfer or sublicense them to anyone else.
There are two exceptions:


Employer or client.
If you are purchasing on behalf of your employer or client, then your employer or client can use the content.
In that case, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your employer or client to the terms of this agreement.
If you do not have that authority, then your employer or client may not use the content.
The rights purchased may only belong to you or your employer/client, depending on who is named as the "Licensee" at the time of purchase.
In other words, if you purchase a royalty-free image, only one of you (and not both) may re-use that image for multiple projects.

No Seat/User Restrictions for UltraPacks.
If you purchase an UltraPack, sharing and storage restrictions do not apply and an unlimited number of users within the same legal entity may use licensed content.



Subcontractors.
