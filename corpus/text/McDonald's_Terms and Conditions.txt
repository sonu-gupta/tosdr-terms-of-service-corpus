1.
About the online services.
Availability of products and services.
McDonald's products and services are available in many parts of the world.
However, the online services may describe products and services that are not available worldwide.
Obey the rules of the road.
Whenever you use the online services, you must obey the rules of the road and all applicable rules and regulations.
You must not use the online services while driving or while behind the wheel or controls of a vehicle that is moving or not in âparkâ.
In the interest of safety at all times, you should only use the online services when it is lawful and safe to do so.
You are responsible for your devices and accounts.
You are responsible for any devices, software and services needed to use the online services.
McDonaldâs does not guarantee that the online services will fully function on any particular device or with any particular software.
You are also responsible for any messaging and data charges, fees and taxes for your use of the online services, including when we communicate with you by text, email or other means that you choose.
You may only use the online services with devices that you own or control and using only the authorized operating system (e.g., Apple iPhone OS for Apple devices).
If you create an online services account, you are responsible for keeping the account secure and for all activity under the account.
You can only use one online services account and must keep your account information accurate at all times.
McDonaldâs right to update or terminate the online services.
You understand and consent that (with or without notice) McDonaldâs may update, modify or terminate the online services (or your access to them) from time to time, including by pushing updates to (or removing functionality or access from) any McDonaldâs mobile app that you have installed on your device.
Updates to these terms.
McDonald's may also update these terms at any time and at its sole discretion.
If McDonaldâs makes material changes to the terms, we will notify you by any reasonable means such as by posting the new terms in the online service.
If you do not agree to the changed terms, then you must immediately stop using the online services and request that McDonaldâs close any online services account that you have created.
To close your account, you can visit www.mcdonalds.com/contact or email us at contact.privacy@us.mcd.com.
Independent businesses own and operate many restaurants.
While McDonaldâs operates and controls the online services, it is not responsible for the operation of most restaurants.
Most restaurants are instead owned and operated by independent franchisees of McDonaldâs and some are operated by McDonaldâs subsidiaries (such franchisees and subsidiaries are together, ârestaurantsâ).
Each restaurant is solely and independently responsible for its legal and regulatory compliance, for any issues relating to the supply of the products to you, and for any employment related matters in the restaurant.
Links to job opportunities from the online services.
McDonald's and all restaurants are equal opportunity employers committed to diverse workforces.
The online services may provide links to job opportunities posted by McDonaldâs or restaurants.
These opportunities are with the restaurant alone and not with McDonaldâs or its parent company (McDonaldâs Corporation).
This means that the restaurant that posted the opportunity is alone responsible for setting the job requirements, all hiring decisions, and all other employment related matters in its business.
Neither McDonaldâs nor its parent company receives a copy of any application you submit to a restaurant that is a franchisee, neither controls whether you receive an interview or are hired, and neither controls franchiseesâ employment policies and practices.
Neither McDonaldâs nor its parent company employs independent franchisees.
If you are hired by a restaurant that is a franchisee, only that franchisee, and not McDonaldâs or its parent company (McDonaldâs Corporation), will be your employer.
How to contact us.
If you have any questions or comments regarding the online services, please refer to the Contact Us section in the online services or you can always visit www.mcdonalds.com/contact.

In addition, our communications themselves may include the opportunity to opt out.

For example, if you opt out of receiving marketing emails, you may still receive marketing text messages if youâve opted in to receiving them.
While we do our best to offer convenient methods for you to manage your communications preferences, you may need to separately adjust your preferences for each online service.
Please note that for some account-related and transactional communications, the only way to stop receiving these communications may be to close your online services account.
Lastly, please note that if you are receiving communications from a McDonaldâs franchisee, then you will need to opt out from them directly.

Sending orders to restaurants.

Please read this section before you send any orders to restaurants using the online services.
Please note that ordering may not be available in all online services.
Please refer to the FAQs for more information on ordering.
About ordering.
The purpose of ordering is to provide customers with a convenient way of building orders for products in advance and submitting their orders by checking in at a participating restaurant.
You must register an online services account in order to use ordering.
Before you submit an order, you must register a credit card or debit card (either one, a âpayment cardâ) to use with your orders.
Not all restaurants may choose to make their products available via ordering.
You may need to enable location services on your device in order for ordering to function properly.
Registering your payment method.
McDonaldâs and the restaurants use third party providers to securely store your payment card information and process your payments to restaurants.
You understand and agree that, when you register a payment card, McDonaldâs or its third party providers may verify that the payment card you registered is valid.
You also understand and agree that when you use ordering to make a purchase from a restaurant, that restaurant will be the merchant of record.
Restaurants may require information other than your order code to verify your purchase.
You represent and warrant that you are of sufficient age and have all legal rights to use all payment cards you register.
You purchase products directly from restaurants.
When you use ordering, you submit orders directly to a participating restaurant and the contract for supplying the products will be between you and the restaurant that accepts your order.
The restaurant where you collect your products is responsible for preparing the products and providing them to you.
You further understand and agree that you are purchasing directly from restaurants (and not McDonaldâs or any other Members of the McDonaldâs system) and that neither McDonaldâs nor any other Members of the McDonaldâs System have any responsibility arising out of or related to any products that you purchase from restaurants using ordering.
McDonaldâs Corporation (which is McDonaldâs parent company), its subsidiaries, affiliates, their franchisees, agents, representatives, and agencies and their officers, directors, and employees are together, âMembers of the McDonaldâs Systemâ.
About the products in the online services.
All products are subject to availability at the restaurant where you collect your order.
Some restaurants do not sell all products.
Images of products and packaging on the online services are examples only and may not be identical to the product or packaging you receive from a restaurant.
Differences may be due your deviceâs display of colors or factors such as the ingredients used, the supplier, the region of the country, and the season of the year.
About the prices in ordering.
Each restaurant independently determines its own prices and independently applies any additional taxes and fees as required by law.
Certain offers and pricing may not be available for all orders at all locations.
In the event you discover an error in the price of a product charged to you, please contact the restaurant where you purchased the product to seek a refund of the difference.
Building, confirming and sending your order to a restaurant.
You can use ordering to build your order and send it to a participating restaurant that you select.
You do not make your purchase until you check in at a restaurant, and your payment card will not be charged until you check in at a restaurant.
Orders made must be collected in person from the restaurant.
Checking in at a restaurant and making your purchase.
You can check in at any participating restaurant, even if you selected a different restaurant when you built your order.
You make your purchase from a restaurant when you complete your check in at that restaurant.
Updated order totals at check-in.
Updated order totals at check-in can result from changes in products, pricing, taxes or other fees required by law due to your arrival at a different participating restaurant than you originally selected.
Updated order totals can also result from the unavailability of certain products, changes in price, or other reasons.
Paying for your order.
You make your purchase when you complete your check in at a restaurant.
When you complete your check in, you authorize the restaurant to process your order total (and if updated, your updated order total).
The restaurantâs payment service provider will process your order total amount (and if updated, your updated order total amount) to the payment card you selected when you built your order.
You may receive a notification within the ordering feature that the restaurant has accepted your order and is preparing it.
You own the products after you have collected them.
Cancelling your order, refunds and your consumer rights.
You have the ability to update or abandon your order at any time until you check in your order at a restaurant.
However, once you complete your check in at a restaurant, you cannot cancel it.
If you desire to seek a refund for any reason, including if the products are unsatisfactory or other reasons, please contact the restaurant where you purchased the product regarding any refund due to you.
Your legal rights in this respect are not affected by anything in these terms.

If such an event occurs, then McDonaldâs obligations under these terms will be suspended for the duration of the event.
and McDonaldâs may, but is not required to, use reasonable endeavors to find a solution by which its obligations under these terms may be performed despite the event.

How we settle disputes.
You agree that:

any claim or dispute (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) you may have with McDonaldâs or any other Members of the McDonaldâs System arising from or related to the online services or these terms will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by JAMS and conducted before a single arbitrator using JAMSâs Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (ârules and proceduresâ);
this arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (âFAAâ), 9 U.S.C.
Â§Â§ 1-16;
the arbitration shall be held at a location determined by JAMS under its rules and procedures (provided such location is reasonably convenient to you), or at such other location as may be mutually agreed to by you and McDonaldâs or other Members of the McDonaldâs System;
the arbitratorâs decision shall be based on these terms and any of the other agreements referenced herein that you may have entered into in connection with the online services;
the arbitrator shall apply Illinois law consistent with the FAA, and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law;
no claims shall be arbitrated on a class or representative basis as you and McDonaldâs hereby waive the right to assert claims in any class or representative action.
arbitration will therefore only decide the individual claims of you and McDonaldâs.
it is agreed that the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of any other person or party to an arbitration between you and McDonaldâs under this provision;
you and McDonald's empower the arbitrator with the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability or enforceability of these terms or formation of this contract, including the arbitrability of any dispute and any claim that all or any part of these terms are void or voidable; 
in the event that the administrative fees, arbitrator fees and filing fees associated with the arbitration exceed $100 USD, McDonaldâs agrees to pay any such administrative, arbitrator and filing fees exceeding $100 on your behalf, subject to ultimate allocation by the arbitrator.
In addition, if you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, McDonaldâs will pay as much of your fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.
and
with the exception of subpart (6) above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the rules and procedures, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein.
If, however, subpart (6) above is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither McDonaldâs nor you shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute.
In such event, you agree to bring any and all claims arising out of or related to these terms or the online services in either the state courts of DuPage County, Illinois or the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.
Further, both you and McDonald's agree to waive any right to a trial by jury. Finally, this arbitration provision is reciprocally binding on all parties, such that both you and McDonaldâs are required to arbitrate their claims against one another.
For more information on JAMS and/or JAMS Rules and Procedures, you may visit the JAMS Website.

10.
Apple Applications
These terms incorporate and supplement the Apple, Inc.
(âAppleâ) terms and conditions, including the Licensed Application End User terms therein (âApple termsâ).
If you are using the online services through Apple application (âApple Applicationâ), you also acknowledge and agree:

Apple has no obligation at all to provide any support or maintenance services in relation to the Apple Application.
If you have any maintenance or support questions in relation to the Apple Apps, please contact McDonaldâs, not Apple, using the above Support Services details;
except as otherwise expressly set out in these terms, any claims relating to the possession or use of the Apple Application are between you and McDonaldâs (and not between you, or anyone else, and Apple).
and
in the event of any claim by a third party that your possession or use (in accordance with these terms) of the Apple Application infringes any intellectual property rights, Apple will not be responsible or liable to you in relation to that claim;

If the Apple Application that you have purchased does not conform to any warranty applying to it, you may notify Apple, which may refund the purchase price of the Apple Application to you subject to then-current Apple terms and conditions.
Subject to that, and to the maximum extent permitted by law, Apple does not give or enter into any warranty, condition or other term in relation to the Apple Application and will not be liable to you for any claims, losses, costs or expenses of whatever nature in relation to the Apple Application or as a result of you or anyone else using the Apple Application or relying on any of its content.
11.
Miscellaneous.

McDonald's makes no representation that the online services are appropriate or available outside of the United States.
If you use the online services from other locations you are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws.
These terms will be governed and interpreted pursuant to the laws of Illinois, notwithstanding any principles of conflicts of law.
Although these terms govern the online services as between McDonaldâs and you only (and neither Apple nor any other Members of the McDonaldâs System are parties to these terms), Apple and all other Members of the McDonaldâs System are third party beneficiaries under these terms and will have the right to enforce against you those rights that McDonaldâs holds under these terms to the extent such terms may pertain to them.
there are no other third beneficiaries under these terms.
The terms are written in English (US).
Any translation of the terms into another language is provided solely for your convenience, and to the extent there is any conflict between the two, the English (US) version controls.
On termination of these terms or of your permission to use the online services, all rights granted to you under terms shall cease.
however, these terms will continue to apply to your prior use of the online services and anything relating to or arising from such use.
Upon termination, all rights of McDonaldâs and other Members of the McDonaldâs System, including all intellectual property rights, proprietary rights, and licenses in these terms shall survive, as well as all restrictions on use, all limitations on liability and disclaimers, and all of Section 9 (âHow we settle disputesâ)
Each of the terms and conditions in these terms are severable and operate separately.
If any of them are unlawful, void or unenforceable, then the remaining terms and conditions will remain in full force and effect.
If McDonaldâs fails to insist that you perform any of your obligations under these terms, or if McDonaldâs does not enforce its rights against you, or delays in doing so, that will not mean that McDonaldâs has waived its rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations.
McDonaldâs may transfer its rights and obligations under these terms to another organization or entity, but this will not affect your rights or our obligations under these terms.
You may only transfer your rights or obligations under these terms to another person if McDonaldâs agrees in writing.

MyMcDonaldâs Rewards Terms (USA)

Effective: November 16, 2020
In certain geographical areas, McDonaldâs is piloting its MyMcDonaldâs Rewards program (âMyMcDonaldâs Rewardsâ, or the âprogramâ).
If you are within those geographical areas, the program may be displayed to you.
By using the online services when the program is displayed, you agree to participate in the program as part of your use of the online services.
These MyMcDonaldâs Rewards Terms (USA) (the âprogram termsâ) apply only if you participate in the program.

All definitions used in the online services terms apply to these program terms.
You understand and acknowledge that you have already agreed to the online services terms when you registered and logged into your online services account.
Although the program terms are intended to supplement and not to change the online services terms, in the event of a conflict between the program terms and online services terms that relates to the program itself, the program terms will control.
In the event of any other conflict between the program terms and the online services terms, the online services terms will control.

Important: You understand and acknowledge that the terms contain an arbitration agreement, jury and class action waivers, limitations on McDonaldâs liability and other provisions that affect your legal rights regarding the online services, including the program as part of the online services.
Please carefully read and understand these terms.

If you participated in McCafeÂ® Rewards and have made purchases as part of McCafeÂ® Rewards, but have not made enough purchases to receive a McCafeÂ® Reward, then if you choose to enroll in MyMcDonaldâs Rewards, your existing purchases qualifying towards a McCafeÂ® Reward will immediately be converted into MyMcDonaldâs Rewards points (âpointsâ).
For each purchase (up to 4 qualifying purchases) under McCafeÂ® Rewards, 400 Points will be deposited in your account.
If you have opted into receiving emails from McDonaldâs, you will receive an email alerting you of the number of points added to your account.
We will send the email to your email address that you used to create your online services account.
How to earn points.
Once enrolled in the program, when you identify your online services account at the time of purchase, you will earn 100 points for every $1 U.S dollar spent on qualifying purchases.
You can identify your online services account at the time of purchase by any way that we recognize, such as: (a) making a purchase using the Mobile Order &amp.
Pay feature of the mobile app, (b) scanning a QR code at a register or kiosk, or (c) giving the code displayed in your account to the restaurant crew person who is taking your order.
If you donât properly identify your online services account before you complete your qualifying purchase, you cannot earn any points for that purchase.
Qualifying purchases.
A âqualifying purchaseâ means using the online services to purchase eligible products from a participating restaurant in a manner that properly identifies you as described above.
Qualifying purchases where an active reward, mobile offer, or promotional offer is redeemed will accrue points, but you will only accrue points for U.S.
dollars actually spent in the transaction.
Further, the following are not considered qualifying purchases and will not accrue points: (a) taxes, bag and bottle fees, and other surcharges or fees, and (b) loading any money on a McDonaldâs Arch card (gift card), but when a McDonaldâs Arch card is used to make a qualifying purchase you will accrue points.
Verifying your points balance.
You can check your points balance in your online services account using the McDonaldâs app.
Points that you earn may not always immediately post to your account.
You are responsible to ensure points from your qualifying purchases are correct.
If you believe points from your qualifying purchase were incorrectly calculated, you must notify McDonaldâs within six (6) months of the qualifying purchase by providing your receipt to McDonaldâs Customer Care.
McDonaldâs has the sole discretion to determine points in your account and McDonaldâs has no liability for any delay or failure to correctly credit points to your account.
Exchanging your points for rewards that you choose.
You can exchange your points for rewards for free products on the Rewards Menu (each a ârewardâ), which you can then use at participating restaurants.
You must use the McDonaldâs app or other online services in order to exchange your points for rewards.
If you have enough points for a reward, the reward will be unlocked in the online services and available for a points exchange.
Potential rewards for which you donât have enough points may be displayed but locked.
Once you select a reward and exchange your points for it, the number of points for that reward will be temporarily deducted from your account and the reward will be displayed in your account.
The reward will temporarily remain in your account until you redeem it for a product, and if you do not, it will be converted back to points.
When you redeem the reward for which you exchanged points, the points will be permanently deducted from your account.
You cannot exchange points for more than one reward at a time.
When you redeem your reward for a product, you are obtaining that product directly from the participating restaurant, not from other Members of the McDonaldâs system.
Other ways to earn and redeem.
From time to time, McDonaldâs may offer new and different ways for you to earn and redeem points, including bonus campaigns or points accelerators.
McDonaldâs has the sole discretion to offer, change and terminate the different ways to earn and redeem points, including for example, the points associated with bonus campaigns and accelerators.
Sometimes earning and redeeming points may be subject to additional terms (âadditional termsâ) disclosed at the time of the offer.
Rewards Menu.
McDonaldâs publishes eligible rewards in the online services and identifies how many points are required for each reward.
The Rewards Menu may have multiple reward levels and multiple rewards on each level, which can change from time to time.&nbsp.
McDonaldâs makes no promise of the continued availability of any reward, even if it is displayed to you in the online services.&nbsp.
Rewards are available until supplies last at participating restaurants and may be modified, changed and discontinued at any time.
Point expiration.
Points expire on the first (1st) day of the month after the sixth (6th) month from the date such points were earned.
Points will be maintained in your online services account until you exchange your points for a reward, or until they expire, whichever occurs first.&nbsp.
If McDonaldâs terminates the program, any unused points in your account will expire and be void when the program is terminated.
Upon termination of your online services account for any reason (including, but not limited to, whether you choose to close your account or McDonaldâs terminates your account for a violation of these terms), all points that you have accumulated in MyMcDonaldâs Rewards will immediately expire.
Your compliance with the terms.
McDonaldâs has the discretion to invalidate or void points from your online services account, or to suspend or terminate your account (both now and in the future), if McDonaldâs believes you improperly obtained points, abused the program or otherwise violated these terms.
In that event, you forfeit any points you have accumulated (including properly obtained points) and you forfeit your right to earn points in the future.
McDonaldâs has the sole discretion to determine your compliance with these terms.
McDonaldâs determination is final.
No rights in points.
Points are not property and you have no vested right or interest in points.
Points have no cash value.
Points are not assignable or transferrable between online services accounts or otherwise, and points cannot be combined across accounts, regardless of who registered the account.
Changes to MyMcDonaldâs Rewards.
MyMcDonaldâs Rewards can change from time to time, so be sure to continue to refer to these terms for the latest details and news.
We are also constantly improving the program and we may have exciting new offers.
McDonaldâs reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to cancel, change, modify or discontinue MyMcDonaldâs Rewards, in whole or in part, including any terms, rules, features, benefits, rewards, conditions of participation, points accruing or accumulation ratio, the points redemption policy, the points expiration policy, or any other aspect of the program at any time, with or without advance notice, even though changes may affect points and rewards already in your account.
McDonaldâs may make changes to any element of the program to correct for typographical, printing or other errors and you waive any rights relating to same.&nbsp.
Any changes will become effective immediately upon posting the revisions.&nbsp.
At all times, you are solely responsible for remaining knowledgeable about and in compliance with these terms.
Miscellaneous.
All rewards offered via the program are subject to availability.
Some participating restaurants do not sell all products offered as rewards.&nbsp.
Images of products and packaging of rewards are examples only and may not be identical to the product or packaging you receive from a participating restaurant.
