Last updated: January 1, 2020

Zappos.com LLC knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly.
This notice describes our privacy policy. By visiting Zappos.com, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice.
 What Personal Information About Customers Does Zappos.com Gather? The information we collect and learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your Zappos experience.
One of our goals in collecting personal information from you is to provide an efficient, meaningful, and customized experience.
Here are the general categories of information we gather:
â¢ Information You Give Us: We receive and store information you enter on our website, or give us in any other way. Examples include, but are not limited to, information when you search, browse, buy, post reviews, participate in a sweepstakes or questionnaire, or communicate with customer service.
We use the information that you provide for purposes such as responding to your requests, processing your order, customizing future shopping experiences, responding to you, or sending you marketing and advertising communications.
If we encounter a problem when processing your order, your personal information may be used to contact you.
Please note that before accessing certain parts of Zappos.com or completing an order, you must create an account with us, through which you must provide certain personal information.
â¢ Automatic Information: We receive and store certain types of information automatically whenever you interact with us.
For example, like many websites, we use "cookies" or other unique identifiers and we obtain certain types of information when your web browser accesses Zappos.com or advertisements and other content served by, or on behalf of, Zappos.com on other websites. Other examples include, but are not limited to, log files, internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the internet, and internet browser type.
â¢ Mobile: When you download or use apps created by Zappos, we may receive information about your location and your mobile device, including a unique identifier for your device.
We may use this information to provide you with location-based services, such as advertising, search results, and other personalized content.
Most mobile devices allow you to turn off location services.
â¢ E-mail Communications: To help us make emails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open email from Zappos.com, if your computer supports such capabilities.
If you do not want to receive email from us (unrelated to transactions and/or your account), please adjust your email subscription settings in your Zappos account or contact our customer service team.
â¢ Information from Other Sources: We might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information. Examples include, but are not limited to, updated delivery and address information from our carriers and information from credit bureaus, which we use to help prevent and detect fraud. What About Cookies? â¢ Web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other unique identifiers (collectively, "cookies") are small pieces of information that are stored by your internet browser on your computerâs hard drive.
Like many websites, Zappos uses cookies to speed your navigation of Zappos.com, enable you to select products, place them in an online shopping cart, and to purchase those products, along with allowing us to maintain a record of your browsing activity on our websites.
Cookies also allow our systems to recognize your device and to provide features such as recently viewed items, brand recommendations, and personalized Zappos advertisements on other websites.
OUR COOKIES DO NOT AND CANNOT INFILTRATE YOUR HARD DRIVE TO GATHER YOUR CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
Our cookies are not "spyware."
â¢ Most internet browsers are initially set to accept cookies.
Because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of Zappos.com's essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on.
You can, however, set your browser to refuse cookies from websites or to remove cookies from your hard drive, but if you do, you may not be able to access or use portions of Zappos.com.
For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to add items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to Checkout, or use any Zappos.com products or services that require you to sign in. Does Zappos.com Share the Information It Receives? Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling, renting or trading it to others.
We share customer information only as described in this Privacy Notice and with entities within the Zappos Family of Companies.
The "Zappos Family of Companies" means Zappos.com LLC and its subsidiaries.
â¢ Third-Party Service Providers: We may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.
Examples include, but are not limited to, fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, providing customer service, storing data, and serving ads on our behalf.
They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.

When we do this, we do not allow that business to access your information.
You may have the opportunity to separately share information with those other businesses, and if you do, that information would be governed by such companyâs privacy policy.
You may adjust your email subscription settings in your Zappos.com account or by contacting our customer service team.
â¢ Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, companies, or business units.
In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing privacy notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise).
Also, in the unlikely event that Zappos, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
