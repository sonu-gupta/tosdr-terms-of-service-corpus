         Slipfox Network Suite About Me Site Status Slipfox E-Mail I do run an E-Mail service on this domain.
An account can be generated for you upon request. Rules: 
No spam.
Nothing illegal under US law.

To sign up, send an email to webmaster at slipfox dot xyz with the subject "Email Request", your erquested username, and the sum of 69420 and 1337 somewhere within the body.
 Password Reset: When you sign up, I will give you a random password to use.
*This is not recommended to be used as a permanent password.* You should absolutely set your own email password.To do so, simply ssh into [username]@slipfox.xyz and you will be provided with a password reset prompt.
Note that pubkey auth is explicitly disabled on any mailgroup accounts, so you will need to enter the password you were given at signup.
 Third Party Client Usage: Some third party clients, namely Thunderbird, will automatically attempt to use imap.slipfox.xyz and smtp.slipfox.xyz for IMAP/SMTP.
This is incorrect, and will result in issues.
Please use the following configuration:

IMAP: mail.slipfox.xyz:993
SMTP: mail.slipfox.xyz:587
