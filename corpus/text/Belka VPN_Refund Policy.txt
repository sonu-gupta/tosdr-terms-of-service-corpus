You may cancel your account with a full refund within 30 days of your initial purchase

(âMoney Back Guaranteeâ).

Refunds beyond the 30-day purchase window will be considered, at the sole discretion of

BelkaVPN, if a Subscriber can demonstrate that the Service was not available or usable

during the subscription period and that reasonable attempts were made to contact BelkaVPN

to resolve the issue.
In this case, BelkaVPN may provide the Subscriber with a pro-rata

refund of service fees paid during the period when the Service was not available or usable.

Refunds are generally processed within seven (7) days, and are made to the original form of

payment used for purchase.
All refunds are sent in USD and therefore the refund amount

could differ from the amount originally paid in local currency or bitcoin.

Any change to the original purchase, such as upgrading to an extended billing term or

purchasing of additional licenses under the same account, shall constitute a waiver of the

Money Back Guarantee option.
To request a refund under the Money Back Guarantee, send

an email with your request to the following email address:

support@belkavpn.com

Users whose subscriptions are billed as an in-app purchases through the Apple App Store

(iTunes) do not have access to the BelkaVPN 30-day money-back guarantee.
Instead, users

can request refunds through the App Store, which are issued solely at the discretion of Apple

Support.
