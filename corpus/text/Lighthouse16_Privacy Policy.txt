PrivacyIt is Lighthouse16âs policy to respect your privacy regarding any information that may be collected while operating the websites and apps, (taken together, the Service).
The Service is owned and operated by Lighthouse16.

The Service does not ask you for personal information unless the Service truly need it.
The Service does not share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop the Service products, or protect the Service rights.
The Service does not store personal information on the Service servers.

Below is the Service's privacy policy which incorporates these goals:Usage AnalyticsAll apps use Apple Analytics to collect information about the way you use them by default.
This data is always anonymised before it is sent to Apple Analytics, and cannot be used to personally identify you.
The Service look only for broad patterns in the aggregated usage data, such as whether or not a particular feature is frequently used, or whether users in general prefer one setting over another.
This helps the Service make informed decisions about the future development of it's apps.
To be clear the Service cannot track an individual userâs behaviour.
The Service also cannot receive information from your deviceâs displays, cameras, or microphones.Crash LogsIf one of it's apps crashes while you are using it, data about the crash will be collected and sent to Apple Analytics to help identify the cause of the crash so that the Service can try to fix it in a future update.
These âcrash logsâ contain information about the state of the app, operating system, and device at the time of the crash.
Nothing in the crash log can be used to personally identify you, and crash logs do not contain any of your private data.Website VisitorsWhen you interact with the Service servers using a web browser, or indirectly by network requests sent on your behalf by it's apps, some metadata about the request may be logged by the Service.
This metadata may include parts of your IP address, the name of the resource requested, and the name and version number of the software making the request.
The Service generally do not look at these logs unless a server appears to be being maliciously used or attacked in some way.
The Service may look at the information in aggregate to see statistics such as how many times the Service's apps have been downloaded, or from what sources network traffic is arriving.Gathering of Personally-Identifying InformationCertain visitors to the Service products choose to interact with the Service in ways that require the Service to gather personally-identifying information.
The amount and type of information that the Service gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.
In each case, the Service collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfil the purpose of the visitorâs interaction with the Service.
The Service does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying InformationLighthouse16 discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organisations:

that need to know that information in order to process it on the Service behalf or to provide services available at the Service products.
that have agreed not to disclose it to others.
Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organisations may be located outside of your home country.
by using the Service products, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.
The Service will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.
Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organisations, as described above.

The Service discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when the Service believes that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Lighthouse16.
The Service takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorised access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.Services usedIn addition to the websites/apps the Service provide directly.
The Service also use third party service providers (collectively referred to as âThird Party Servicesâ) who operate their own Privacy Policies.
