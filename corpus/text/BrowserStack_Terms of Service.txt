BrowserStack may retain short-term technical backups as part of providing the Services.
BrowserStack will also retain Screenshots along with the captured DOM and associated assets (CSS,images, javascript etc.) used to render the Screenshot in case of its visual testing Service.

Any Customer Content will be retained subject to BrowserStackâs data retention policies and confidentiality obligations under this Agreement.
Except as set forth above, the Services do not provide a solution for storage of Customer Content or backups.

Customer specifically agrees not to use the Services to collect, store, process or transmit any Personal Information other than Account-Related Information, and will not submit to the Services any Customer Content containing any Personal Information.
BrowserStack will have no liability under this Agreement for Personal Information included within Customer Content, or any security incident or breach regarding such Personal Information, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein.

Customer Content Guidelines. Customer will not use the Services with any Customer Content that (i) is deceptive, fraudulent, illegal, obscene, defamatory, libelous, threatening, harmful to minors, pornographic, indecent, harassing, hateful, religiously, racially or ethnically offensive, that encourages illegal or tortious conduct or that is otherwise inappropriate in BrowserStackâs discretion.

or (iii) could otherwise cause damage to BrowserStack or any third party.



Indemnification by Customer. Customer will indemnify, defend and hold harmless BrowserStack from and against any and all claims, costs, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneysâ fees and costs) arising out of or in connection with any claim arising from or relating to (a) any Customer Content or acts or omissions of Customer that constitute a breach or alleged breach by Customer of Section 3.3 (Customer Obligations) or (b) any service or product offered by Customer in connection with or related to the Services.
This indemnification obligation is subject to Customer receiving (i) prompt written notice of such claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for Customer to respond without prejudice).
(ii) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense, or settlement of such claim.
and (iii) all necessary cooperation of BrowserStack at Customerâs expense.
Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, BrowserStack may participate in the defense of any claim by counsel of its own choosing, at its cost and expense and Customer will not settle any claim without BrowserStackâs prior written consent, unless the settlement fully and unconditionally releases BrowserStack and does not require BrowserStack to pay any amount, take any action, or admit any liability.



DATA PROTECTION.
In accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR), the data protection terms relating to processing of Account-Related Information and Customer Content are contained in Exhibit A (Data Protection Addendum).
To the extent that there is any conflict between any provision of the Agreement and the contents of Exhibit A, the contents of Exhibit A shall prevail in respect of such conflict in so far as the matters of data protection are concerned.


REGULATORY COMPLIANCE.
Browserstack is currently in compliance with and shall at all times remain in compliance with the regulations of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (âOFACâ) of the Department of the Treasury and any statute, executive order, or other governmental action relating thereto.
In accordance with the regulations, BrowserStack does not offer services to users in specific sanctioned regions and hence does not allow users in such regions to access all of certain parts of the website, including certain products.
More information about the sanctions programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (âOFACâ) of the US Department of the Treasury is available at https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/pages/default.aspx.
Therefore, Customer and/or its Affiliates agree that they are not from such specific sanctioned regions and are currently in compliance with and will at all times during the Subscription Term of this Agreement remain in compliance with the regulations of OFAC and any statute, executive order, or other governmental action relating thereto.


OWNERSHIP.

BrowserStack may, in its sole discretion, offer Customer a grace-period in which their fees will not increase for a certain period of time.
If Customer does not accept the increase or addition to the existing fees, Customer may elect to terminate its account during the then current billing period and Customer shall not be liable for such fee increase after the applicable billing period.
however, any later renewal of service will be subject to the increased fee structure.

Suspension of Service. In addition to any of BrowserStackâs other rights or remedies (including but not limited to any termination rights set forth herein), BrowserStack reserves the right to suspend Customerâs access to the Services if: (i) Customerâs account is thirty (30) days or more overdue.
(ii) BrowserStack determines that Customer has breached Section 2.3 (General Restrictions) or Section 3.3 (Customer Obligations).
or (iii) BrowserStack determines that suspension is necessary to prevent harm or liability to other customers or third parties, or to preserve the security, stability, availability or integrity of the Services.
BrowserStack will have no liability for taking action as permitted above in this section.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
Each party (as âReceiving Partyâ) agrees that all code, inventions, know-how, business, technical and financial information it obtains from the disclosing party (âDisclosing Partyâ) constitute the confidential property of the Disclosing Party (âConfidential Informationâ), provided that it is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or should be reasonably known by the Receiving Party to be confidential or proprietary due to the nature of the information disclosed and the circumstances surrounding the disclosure.
Any BrowserStack Technology, performance information relating to any Service, and the terms and conditions of this Agreement will be deemed Confidential Information of BrowserStack without any marking or further designation.
Customer Content will be deemed Confidential Information of Customer without the need for any marking or further designation.
Except as expressly authorized herein, the Receiving Party will (1) hold in confidence and not disclose any Confidential Information to third parties and (2) not use Confidential Information for any purpose other than fulfilling its obligations and exercising its rights under this Agreement.
The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, agents, contractors and other representatives having a legitimate need to know (including, for BrowserStack, its subcontractors), provided that such representatives are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective of the Disclosing Party than this Section 11 and that the Receiving Party remains responsible for compliance by any such representative with the terms of this Section 11.
The Receiving Partyâs confidentiality obligations will not apply to information that the Receiving Party can document: (i) was rightfully in its possession or known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential Information.
(ii) is or has become public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party.
(iii) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation.

The Receiving Party may make disclosures to the extent required by administrative or judicial process, applicable law, or court order, provided the Receiving Party notifies the Disclosing Party in advance and cooperates in any effort to obtain confidential treatment.
The Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party will be entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.
