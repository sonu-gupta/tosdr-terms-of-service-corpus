Throughout the site, the terms âweâ, âusâ and âourâ refer to GDevelop Ltd.
GDevelop Ltd offers these websites and applications, including all information, tools and services available from this site to you, the user, conditioned upon your acceptance of all terms, conditions, policies and notices stated here.1.
TermsBy accessing this website ( https://gdevelop.io), related websites (https://forum.gdevelop.io, https://wiki.gdevelop.io, https://editor.gdevelop.io) and related applications (GDevelop), you are agreeing to be bound by these terms of service, all applicable laws and regulations, and agree that you are responsible for compliance with any applicable local laws.
If you do not agree with any of these terms, you are prohibited from using or accessing these sites and related applications.
The materials contained in these websites and related applications are protected by applicable copyright and trademark law.
The headings used in this agreement are included for convenience only and will not limit or otherwise affect these Terms.2.
Use LicenseYouâre not allowed to copy, or modify the Service, any part of the Service, or our trademarks in any way - except for parts of the Service that are open-source and licensed under the MIT license.
Youâre not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldnât try to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions - except for parts of the Service that are open-source and licensed under the MIT license.
The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to GDevelop Ltd or Florian Rival.
GDevelop Ltd is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible.
For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason.
We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what youâre paying for.3.
DisclaimerThe materials on the Service are provided on an 'as is' basis.
GDevelop Ltd makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights.
Further, GDevelop Ltd does not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the use of the materials on its website or otherwise relating to such materials or on any sites or applications linked to this Service.
The applications and websites of this Service store and process personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide the Service.
Itâs your responsibility to keep your device and access to the app secure.
We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, tablet or computer, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device.
It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phoneâs security features and it could mean that the GDevelop applications and the websites of the Service wonât work properly or at all.4.
LimitationsIn no event shall GDevelop Ltd or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on the applications and the websites of the Service, even if GDevelop Ltd or a GDevelop Ltd authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage.
Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.
Certain functions of the Service will require the Service to have an active internet connection.
The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but GDevelop Ltd cannot take responsibility for the Service not working at full functionality if you donât have access to Wi-Fi, and you donât have any of your data allowance left.
If youâre using the Service outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply.
As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the Service, or other third party charges.

region or country) without turning off data roaming.
If you are not the bill payer for the device on which youâre using the Service, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the Service.
Along the same lines, GDevelop Ltd cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the Service i.e.
