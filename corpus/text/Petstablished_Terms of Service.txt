Description of Services

Wagtopia provides an online platform and software that (1) enables AWOs to more effectively manage their operations (including pet records and information, adoptions, donations, events, staff members, fosters and volunteers) and (2) connects pet lovers with their future pets, as made available by AWOs.
In addition, Wagtopia also offers the Wagtopia Marketplace as well as PetVetMD both of which fall under these Terms, as well as the additional terms for each respective Service: Wagtopia Marketplace Additional Terms â Purchasers, and PetVetMD Additional Terms.  Wagtopia also offers ancillary Services, such as sale of microchips and registration of microchipped pets.
AWOs that participate in the Wagtopia microchip program are provided with access to Wagtopia software at no cost.
The Services are more fully described on the Site.  Wagtopia provides a venue for pet lovers to learn about animals available at AWOs for adopting or fostering, and helps facilitate the adoption/fostering process.
However, Wagtopia itself does not own or shelter any pets and is not directly involved in pet adoption or fostering proceedings conducted between pet lovers and AWOs.
Furthermore, Wagtopia does not independently verify the accuracy of any pet listings or any other information posted on the Site by either AWOs or pet lovers, including adoption profiles.
With that understanding, you acknowledge and agree to the following:

Pet adoptions are subject to certain legal requirements.
By providing the Services, Wagtopia makes no representations whatsoever regarding any AWOâs compliance with applicable laws or regulations or with regard to any pet loverâs legal capacity to complete a pet adoption or any other transaction between pet lover and AWO.

The accuracy of any animal photographs, videos, profiles or descriptions.

Wagtopia does not assume any responsibility or liability for the identity, reliability, integrity or conduct of any AWO or pet lover.
Wagtopia is not responsible for the quality or reliability of microchips purchased via the Site.
Any disputes regarding the microchips must be addressed to the microchip manufacturer.
If you make a donation to an AWO via the Site, Wagtopia makes no representations regarding how the AWO will use your donation or whether your donation may be tax deductible.

1.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
The Wagtopia Marketplace.


1.1 &nbsp.
 Description of Services. The Wagtopia Marketplace provides a venue for users to purchase certain pet products, goods, services and any other pet-related items (âProductsâ) as may be listed by Sellers.&nbsp.
 

1.2 &nbsp.
 Content, Pricing and Accuracy.  All features, content, availability, specifications, products and prices of Products described or depicted on the Wagtopia Marketplace are subject to change at any time without notice.
The inclusion of any Products on the Wagtopia Marketplace at a particular time does not imply or warrant that these Products will be available at any time.
Certain weights, measures and similar descriptions are approximate and are provided for convenience purposes only.
We make all reasonable efforts to accurately display the attributes of the Products and ensure that information on the Wagtopia Marketplace is complete, accurate and up-to-date.
Despite our efforts, the information on the Wagtopia Marketplace may occasionally be inaccurate, mispriced, incomplete or out-of-date.
We make no representation as to the completeness, accuracy or currency of any information on the Wagtopia Marketplace.
For example, Products included on the Wagtopia Marketplace may be unavailable, may have different attributes than those listed, or may carry a different price than what is stated on the Wagtopia Marketplace.
We reserve the right to correct any errors from time to time and we will not be obliged to supply the Products at the incorrect price, or in accordance with the incorrect description.
In the event of a pricing error or discrepancy on the Wagtopia Marketplace with respect to Products, we reserve the right to cancel any orders (or partial orders) for such Products.
We will (at our discretion) either cancel your order and refund the price you have paid or use reasonable efforts to contact you and ask you whether you wish to continue with the order at the correct price or correct description.
The inclusion of any Products on the Wagtopia Marketplace at a particular time does not imply or warrant that such Products will be available at any other time. 

1.3&nbsp.
 Shipping.  When a Product order is placed, it will be shipped to the address designated by you, as long as such shipping address is compliant with the shipping restrictions contained on the Wagtopia Marketplace.
Multiple items placed with separate vendors may incur multiple shipping costs per individual Seller.  REMINDER, a complete and accurate address is critical for successful delivery.
An incomplete or inaccurate address will cause significant delays and loss of shipments.
Unfortunately weâre not able to accept liability for lost Products if you input an incorrect or incomplete address, and you will not be refunded in this event.
Any recovery, re-stocking, re-shipments, or other costs related to your entry of incorrect or incomplete addresses will be at your expense.

1.4 &nbsp.
 Confirmation, Seller Cancellation and Coupons. While it is our practice to confirm online orders via email, the receipt of an email order confirmation does not constitute our acceptance of an order nor our confirmation of an offer to sell a Product.
We reserve the right, without prior notice and at any time: (a) to limit the order quantity on any Product and/or to refuse service or fulfillment of any order or to any user.
(b) to discontinue any Product or service.
(c) to bar any user from making or completing a transaction.
and (d) to limit or impose conditions on the honoring of any coupon, coupon code, promotional code, or other similar promotion.  For clarification, orders may be limited or cancelled by us or the Seller at any time including after receipt of a confirmation or shipping email.

Partial shipment or partial cancellation of orders may occur.

1.5 &nbsp.
&nbsp.
Purchaser Changes and/or Cancellation.  In most cases, once an order is placed, it is final and cannot be canceled or changed.  This is because the fulfilment process begins immediately for most orders.  You may nonetheless request a change from the Seller, and the Seller will notify you if it is possible to cancel or make basic modifications to your order (for example, for Products with longer lead-times).  Basic modifications would include changing the size or color of an item, or making a minor update to a delivery address.
It is not possible to change one item to another where the value is different, or to change the delivery address entirely from one address to another.   If the Seller is unable to cancel or amend your order, (for example if your order has already been shipped), then you will need to initiate a return after your receipt of the order.  For the purpose of clarity, personalized Product purchases are final, and not eligible for returns.

1.6 &nbsp.
 RETURNS

You may return your order, or any part of your order, in accordance with these terms, for a full refund if you are not satisfied for any reason.
In order to be eligible for a refund, you must first register your return with us within fourteen (14) days from receipt of your order (delivery date).  Wagtopia will request the Seller provide you with return instructions, and you will then send the Products back to the Seller according to their instructions no later than (five) 5 days from the date Seller sent you the return instructions.  If you ordered Products from different Sellers, then you are to follow the return instructions for each Seller individually and make sure to send the proper Product to the proper Seller.  Important note: All orders must be returned directly to the Seller(s).
Please do not return any items to Wagtopiaâs office.
We will not accept liability for any Products returned directly to us. 
Please note, all purchases are final for the following Products.  They cannot be returned in any circumstance unless they are the wrong Product or defective:

Products which are clearly personalized or made to your specifications.
Products purchased for ten dollars ($10) or less.
Products which are liable to deteriorate rapidly, (for examples, fresh pet food or supplements).
Products with health protection or hygiene considerations, if opened, (for example, doggy diapers).

Products returned must be in the same condition they were received, such that they may be resold.
Products returned must be unworn/unused with original tags and packaging.
Products should be packaged so that both the Product itself and the Product packaging (if applicable) are not damaged in transit.
Wagtopia and Sellers do not accept responsibility for items damaged in transit. 
You are responsible for the return postage costs unless an item has arrived faulty or damaged.
Note if you upgraded to express delivery, we will only refund the cost of standard delivery.
Where you purchased from multiple Seller, you must send each Product to the applicable Seller separately.
We strongly recommend using a tracked mail service (with insurance where appropriate for the Products value), and retaining proof of postage.
Wagtopia and Sellers do not accept responsibility for items lost in return transit.
If a returned Product is being shipped internationally, please mark as âRETURNED GOODSâ to avoid the Seller incurring any customs charges upon receipt of your return.
If a Product is returned but does not meet these conditions, your return may be refused and returned to you or a reduced refund may be offered. 


Damaged or faulty goods

If your order arrived damaged, or youâre having problems with a Product youâve bought, please contact us as soon as possible by visiting our Help Center.
Please note: Most Sellers will require an image or video showing the damage, fault or incorrect item received to be able to provide a solution. 

Refusing delivery

If you refuse to accept delivery of all or part of your order (where the products or packaging do not appear to be damaged or defective) any fees and charges incurred by the Seller due to a package being refused may be deducted from your merchandise refund.
The same will apply if the tracking states that delivery has been attempted and the item is awaiting collection from a point of pickup and that item is not collected and returned to the Seller. 

Refunds 

You will be refunded within fourteen (14) days of the Sellerâs receipt of the returned Products.
Refunds will be issued to the same means of payment initially used to purchase the Products.
Refunds usually take between 1 â 5 business days to show in your account, depending on the payment method used.

Informed Consent.  Telehealth is the delivery of health care services using interactive audio and video technology, where the patient and the veterinary professional are not in the same physical location.  The Telehealth Services you receive from your veterinarian are not intended to replace a veterinary client patient relationship or be your permanent medical home.
As with any online health service, there are potential risks associated with use.
When using this service, you understand the additional risks of telehealth and waive any liability to Wagtopia or the veterinarian.
These risks include but may not be limited to: 

information transmitted may not be sufficient (e.g.
poor resolution of images) to allow for appropriate health care decision making by the veterinarian; 
delays in evaluation or treatment could occur due to failures of the electronic equipment or clinic staffing; 
lack of access to all of your health records may result in adverse drug interactions or allergic reactions or other judgment errors; 
an incomplete or inaccurate diagnosis of pet.

In the event an in-office visit is requested, your veterinarian may charge you for services rendered through PetVetMD.





You may also be able to send written notes to your veterinarian or to customer support using a secure messaging portal within the Site (the âMessaging Portalâ).

If your pet is experiencing a medical emergency, you should contact the nearest emergency clinic.

(c) If you suspect your pet is having a life-threatening emergency and needs immediate care, you must consult our veterinary doctors before gaining access to the Emergency Fund.
All emergencies must be assessed and referred by one of our veterinary doctors through the PetVetMD platform.
A live face to face video call or a video recording is mandatory to determine if it is a life-threatening emergency or not.
You cannot access the Emergency Fund if the pet has been admitted for emergency care prior to contacting one of our veterinary doctors as set forth above.
(d) The Emergency Fund only pays for the initial emergency care.
All other follow up care is at the expense of the pet owner.
Additionally, the Emergency Fund will not cover additional costs associated with euthanasia, such as cremation or memorabilia.
(e) The Emergency Fund is restricted to a one-time annual pay-out in an amount not to exceed $3,000, regardless of the amount of the emergency.
In other words, you are only entitled to access the Emergency Fund one time during each year of your Subscription, even if the emergency is less than the $3,000 limit.
(f) You have up to a maximum of 4 hours to take your pet to an emergency clinic or any veterinary clinic of your choice after being referred by our vets.
If you exceed the 4-hour period to use the Emergency Fund, the funds will not be released for your pet's care.
(g) You will not qualify for the Emergency Fund if our veterinary doctors have previously recommended a visit to your vet clinic and you failed to comply.
Waiting to take your pet in for medical care can result in an unnecessary emergency for your pet and we do not support medical negligence.
(h) The Emergency Fund only covers your cats and dogs.
No other pets are entitled to participate in the Emergency Fund.
You may be required to provide proof of ownership of your pet in the form of a pet license or registration.
(i) You can take your pet to any veterinary clinic located within the United States.
Please keep in mind that some clinics require a deposit before accepting your pet for evaluation.
PetVetMD cannot provide the deposit for you, however, upon receiving the final invoice, the deposit will be included in the final payment issued by PetVetMD.
This means whatever deposit you left upon checking in will be credited back to your account at the discretion of the clinic.
(j) The Emergency Fund is non-transferable to other parties and their pets.
(k) We do not cover emergencies associated with breeding or pregnancy issues.
(l) In order to gain access to your emergency fund, we require completed profiles for all of your pets with their name, age, weight, breed, and a clear photo.
If this information is missing, you will not have access to your emergency fund.
