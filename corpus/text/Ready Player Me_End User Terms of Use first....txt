based on a selfie of you or, if you wish, without a selfie (âAvatarâ).

1.2.
The following terms of use (âTermsâ) will apply exclusively to the current and future

contractual relationships between Wolf3D and you as regards to your use of the

Platform and any of the services, including creating the Avatar, accessible through

âPartnerâs Applicationâ).

2.2.
These Terms apply only to your use of the Services (and the Platform) as framed

but not to usage of any of the sites and services provided by the Partner or any

other third party.

3.
ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS

3.1.
It is essential that you thoroughly read, understand and accept the Terms as well

as the Privacy Policy of the Platform.

3.2.
By clicking âTake a photo!â or âContinue without a photoâ, you confirm that you

have read the Terms, that you understand it and that you agree to be bound by it.

Bear in mind â the Terms are obligatory and legally binding to all Users.
If you do

not agree to these Terms, you may not use the Services (including the Platform) in

any manner.

5.
CREATING AND MAKING THE AVATAR AVAILABLE

5.1.
In order to create an Avatar, you must:

a) choose the gender of the Avatar (the algorithms for the creation of Avatars

for sexes vary slightly).

b) either:

i.
take a photo of your face (selfie) using the forward facing camera of your

device (for that we request access to your deviceâs camera) with a neutral

facial expression and good lighting or choose an existing photo that meets

the same requirements.
Also, make sure that your hair (or anything else)

does not cover your face.
Remove you glasses if you are wearing them.

This photo is used as a basis for the Avatar.

or

ii.
continue without a photo in which case a standard Avatar is taken as the

basis.

c) customise the Avatar (e.g.
select hair style, colour, accessories, etc.).

5.2.
When customizing the Avatar we do not expect you to enter correct data about your

appearance because the Avatar is not meant to be an exact copy of you.
We hope

that you are creative and let your imagination run its course.

5.3.
Once the customization is finished by you, the Avatar data file is created on the

Platform.

5.4.
Where you are using the Platform via the Partnerâs Application, you hereby give us

authorisation to make the Avatar available to the respective Partner so it can be

used in the Partnerâs Application.

5.5.
You also have a possibility to copy the link for using the Avatar in other

environments and make the Avatar available therein.
The respective instructions

are given at the Platform and/or in those other environments.

5.6.
We keep the right to retain the created Avatar in our server.
However, we do not

have the obligation to retain it.
If you wish, you can view and customize your Avatar

later by visiting the Platform as long as you have not deleted the cookies sent by

the Platform to your device from creating the Avatar.
Once you delete these cookies,

you are not able to access your Avatar from the Platform.

6.
USING THE AVATAR

6.1.
Once the Avatar has been created you can use the Avatar in any environment where

it is made available, including in the Partnerâs Application, to the extent that:

a) the Avatar is not used inappropriately or for any immoral, illegal, abusive or

harmful purpose at the sole discretion of Wolf3D â for example, it is prohibited

to use the Avatar for political reasons and/or in the adult entertainment

industry.

b) the reputation of Wolf3D nor the respective Partnerâs is in any way harmed or

decreased.

c) other terms and conditions of these Terms have been fully complied with.

6.2.
You hereby agree that it is at our sole discretion to decide whether any use of the

Avatar complies with these Terms or not and in the latter case it is at our sole

discretion to request you or the respective Partner to stop the usage of the Avatar.

Upon receiving such request, you shall stop using the Avatar immediately.

7.
NOTIFICATIONS

7.1.
From time to time we may send you notifications via e-mail (if you have given us

your e-mail address) to inform you of updates and other important information.

7.2.
You can unsubscribe from such e-mails at any time.

PAID FEATURES AND NO FEE

makeup for the use of which you must pay a fee for us (hereinafter: Paid

Features).

8.2.
The core Services, such as creation of Avatar are free of any fee payable by you to

us and at the time we have no intention of changing it.
However, we reserve the

right to do so in the future as we are entitled to amend the Terms (see clause 10
