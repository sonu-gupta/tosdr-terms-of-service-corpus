 Nintendo Tech Support Forums Terms of Use Last Updated: April 2016 
Welcome to the Nintendo Tech Support Forums (the âSupport Forumsâ).
The Support Forums are offered by Nintendo of America Inc.
(âNintendoâ) as a friendly, helpful place for you (âyouâ or âyourâ) and the Nintendo community to share information about fixes and solutions to technical issues for Nintendo software and hardware.

These Nintendo Support Forum Terms set forth the rules that apply to your use of the Support Forums.
By using or accessing the Support Forums, or by indicating your agreement when the option is made available to you (for example, when creating a Forum Account), you agree to be bound by these Nintendo Support Forum Terms, together with the Nintendo.com Terms of Use (collectively, the âForum Termsâ).

Please review the Forum Terms carefully, as they create a binding legal agreement that applies to you.
If you do not agree to the Forum Terms, do not use the Support Forums.
If you are under the age of 18 (or the age of majority where you live) you must get your parent or legal guardian to read and accept the Forum Terms.

All disputes related to your access and use of the Support Forums will be governed by the âDisclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liabilityâ and âDispute Resolution.
Binding Individual Arbitration.
Class Action Waiverâ provisions of the Nintendo.com Terms of Use.
Any additional terms posted by third party content providers do not modify these Forum Terms.
In the event of a conflict between the Forum Terms and the Nintendo.com Terms of Use, the Nintendo.com Terms of Use shall apply.


Forum Account.
You must create an account (a âForum Accountâ) with Nintendo in order to post content within the Support Forums.
A Forum Account is not needed to simply view the Support Forums.


Moderation.
Nintendo may, but is not obligated to view or moderate the Support Forums.


Age.
Community members under the age of 13 are not allowed to post content in the Support Forums.


Personal Information.
Do not provide personal information about yourself (or anyone else) in the Support Forums, including but not limited to your real name, age, location, e-mail address, or Friend Code.


Stay on topic.
The Support Forums are intended to help community members use Nintendo products more effectively.
Unless otherwise directed by Nintendo, keep your comments focused on asking and answering Support Forum questions, or addressing the applicable Support Forum topic.


Profanity.
Do not use profanity, sexually explicit language or ethnic, racial or religious slurs on the message boards or in your screen name, including but not limited to, profanity through the use of acronyms.


Threats and Bullying.
Do not threaten or abuse any Nintendo employee or community member when using the Support Forums.


Intent to Harm.
Do not suggest technical fixes that could in any way harm a Nintendo product and/or expose someone to the risk of injury.


Misrepresentation.
Do not impersonate a Nintendo employee or lead anyone to believe that you represent Nintendo when using the Support Forums.


Illegal activity.
Do not post information about illegally downloading copyrighted software or circumventing hardware anti-piracy measures, linking to sites that promote and give instruction to illegally pirating copyrighted material, reverse engineering, or attempting to upload and/or share any programs that aim to emulate or pirate copyrighted material.


Malware.
Scripts, images, files or other devices posted to the Support Forums must not be harmful to Nintendoâs or any userâs software, hardware, or other systems.


Spam.
Do not "flood" or disrupt the public areas on the Support Forums by, for example, posting to the Support Forums (a) a large number of messages not directly related to the applicable Support Forum topic or question, or (b) multiple messages with no text in the body, or (c) follow-ups to messages with no new text.


Advertising.
Do not advertise non-Nintendo websites, products, or services within the Support Forums.


Miscellaneous.
These Forum Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Nintendo with regard to your use of the Support Forums.
We reserve the right to change these Forum Terms at any time.
If we makes a change, we will post the date of such change at the top of this page.

We reserve the right to take any steps that we believe are reasonably necessary or appropriate to enforce and/or verify your compliance with any part of these Forum Terms, including without limitation, suspension or termination of your Forum Account or your use of the Support Forums.

All or a portion of the Support Forums may, from time to time, suffer occasional disruptions and outages, or may not otherwise be available to you due to legal, business, or technical limitations.
Nintendo may terminate all or a portion of the Support Forums at any time without notice to you.

The Support Forums may not be available to all user and within all areas.
