Points, Rewards and Redemption




Points


You can view your Points Balance, a description of available Rewards, and the number of Points required to obtain each Reward at any time by logging into your Account.
âPoints Balanceâ means the number of Points you have earned for use that have not yet been redeemed.â
Points earned or accumulated shall at all times remain the property of Salad Tech.
Points have no cash equivalent or similar value except to redeem for Rewards through the Platform.
Points may not be redeemed for cash.â
Points should appear in your Points Balance within five (5) business days after they are earned.
Points may only be redeemed for a Reward after they appear in your Points Balance.â




Rewards and Redemption


When you redeem your Points for a Reward, the number of Points in your Points Balance will be reduced by the number of Points used to redeem the Reward.â
Points may only be redeemed by following the appropriate redemption process for each Reward outlined within the Platform.
Salad Tech reserves the right to change the available Rewards without notice, and we do not guarantee the availability of any particular Reward.
We also reserve the right to change at any time and without notice the number of Points required to redeem a particular Reward.â
Unredeemed Points will expire twelve (12) months after the date on which they first appear in your Points Balance.â
You may be required to provide additional information (such as your name, address, mobile telephone number, or other information) in order to redeem a Reward, and your receipt of the Reward is contingent upon your providing us with the information we request.
We may also require that you take steps to verify your Account, such as by sending you a text message to which you must respond, or otherwise, before redeeming a Reward.â
A particular Reward may be subject to specific terms and conditions, such as an expiration date of the Reward, shipping and handling fees, additional purchases or other requirements to use or deliver the Reward, any return policy requirements and any warranties for the Reward, or any other limitations or restrictions on obtaining, retaining or using the Reward.
We will not be liable if a Reward expires prior to redemption or use.
You are responsible for compliance with all laws related to redeeming and receiving the Reward, including the payment and collection of any applicable federal, state, or local taxes.
Points cannot be used to pay such taxes.
In addition, in order to redeem a particular Reward, you may have to accept a particular Reward providerâs terms and conditions.â
All redemptions of Points for Rewards are final.
All non-merchandise Rewards, such as services, reward cards, gift cards and travel certificates, cannot be returned.
Rewards of merchandise may not be exchanged or refunded after they have been delivered unless such a Reward is defective or has been damaged in transit.
Our Reward providers are ultimately responsible for replacing any defective or damaged Rewards.
Refunds, exchanges and other issues relating to the Reward are governed by the Reward providerâs terms and conditions applicable to the redemption.
Redeemed Rewards are not refundable, exchangeable, or transferable for cash, credit, other Rewards or Points.
Neither Salad Tech nor our participating Reward providers are responsible for replacing lost, stolen, or mutilated Rewards, including retail or travel certificates, reward cards, gift certificates, gift cards, or merchandise.

Dispute Resolution.
 PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.
IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND WILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON HOW CLAIMS YOU AND SALAD TECH HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED.&nbsp.
You and Salad Tech agree that any claim or dispute that has or may arise between us will be resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Section.

We strongly encourage you to first contact us directly to seek a resolution of any dispute or claim by emailing support@salad.com.
 You and Salad Tech agree that any and all disputes or claims that have or may arise between you and Salad Tech shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court.
Alternatively, you may assert your claims in small claims court in New York County, New York if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.
The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate.â
The arbitration will be conducted on a confidential basis pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate.
The arbitration will be conducted before one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes.
Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury.
Arbitrator decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to very limited review by the court.â
You and Salad Tech must abide by the following rules: â1.
ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR US MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIESâ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE &nbsp.

the arbitrator will honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law;4.
the arbitration will be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award;5.
the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are permitted by applicable law.
and6.
each side pays its own attorneysâ fees and expenses unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees and litigation expenses, and then in such instances, the fees and costs awarded will be determined by applicable law.â
If any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the balance of this arbitration provision will remain in effect and will be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein.
If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the dispute will be exclusively brought in state or federal court in New York County, New York.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing herein shall be deemed as preventing Salad Tech from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights.â

Exclusions from Arbitration/Right to Opt Out.&nbsp.
Notwithstanding the above, you or Salad Tech may choose to pursue a claim or dispute in court and not by arbitration if:

Your decision to opt-out of this Arbitration Provision will have no adverse effect on your relationship with Salad Tech.  Any opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and you must pursue your claim or dispute in arbitration or small claims court.â

Jury Waiver.
You understand and agree that by entering into this Agreement you and Salad Tech are each waiving the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court.
In the absence of this Section, you and Salad Tech might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring claims or disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions).
Except as otherwise provided herein, those rights are waived.
Other rights that you would have if you went to court, such as the right to appeal and to certain types of discovery, may be more limited or may also be waived.â
Continuation.&nbsp.
This Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
However, notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, if Salad Tech makes any change to this Section (other than a change to the notice address) after the time in which you create your Account, you may reject any such change and require Salad Tech to adhere to the language in this Section as of the date your Account was created.â



Survival.
Provisions of this Agreement that by their nature or terms are intended to survive expiration or termination, will survive including without limitation those relating to indemnity, disclaimers and limitations of liability.â

Assignment.  This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Salad Tech without restriction.

If any provision of these Terms is deemed unenforceable, the enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, and such provision shall be deemed to be restated to reflect the partiesâ original intentions as nearly as possible in accordance with applicable laws.â

Changes to These Terms.&nbsp.
We may change these Terms and the other documents that are part of the Agreement at any time, as we reasonably deem appropriate.
Upon any such change, we will post the amended terms on the Platform.
