 I accept the Terms and conditions 
 Please confirm that you agree with our terms Create ... Data Privacy Statement 

The protection of your personal data is very important to us, and we strictly observe the regulations of the German Federal Data Protection Act [Bundesdatenschutzgesetz - BDSG], the German Teleservices Act [Telemediengesetz - TMG], and the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
The luckycloud services are exclusively hosted on Servers in Germany.
Your data are stored fully in accordance with the Laws on Data Protection.
Your data can be stored on our servers in encrypted form and are thereby protected against unauthorized access.
Even our administrators are not able to view encrypted folders or libraries.
Also, the media on which your data are stored are highly encrypted and therefore ensure maximum protection of your data, even in the unlikely case of a physical removal from the servers.
We do not store or transfer any IP-based user data.

We observe the highest standards to protect your personal data during the transmission process as well as thereafter and preserve the confidentiality, availability and integrity of such data.
However, we point out that security gaps in data transmission on the internet (e.g.
in the communication via email outside the luckycloud) are possible, as no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.
A guaranteed complete protection of data against unauthorized access by third parties is impossible.
