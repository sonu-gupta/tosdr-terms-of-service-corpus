 SECTION 7 â SUBSCRIPTION TERMS AND AUTOMATIC PAYMENT.
PROMOTIONAL PRICING  A Doodly user is responsible for paying all sums due to Doodly in connection with their monthly subscription in accordance with these Terms.
The first fee payable in accordance with these Terms is due when the user account is set up and payment of the monthly fee is a condition of access.
Every calendar month, your account will be charged the subscription fee plus applicable tax for the following monthâs subscription, together with any other fees for the following monthâs subscription and any amounts due for optional in-software purchases and upgrades made by the user plus any accumulated charges for the past period (collectively, âFeesâ).
Failure by the Doodly user to use any of the services available through the service provided by Doodly does not relieve the Doodly user of their payment obligations under these Terms.

 Potential users can pay by credit card or PayPal.
Payment details shall be collected by us through our secure financial data collection mechanism.
You acknowledge and agree that we hold data relating to the transaction, including the last four digits and the expiration date of the card used to purchase the products or services together with details on when payment is due.
The Doodly user further acknowledges and agrees that payments are due on a recurring basis in accordance with the payment terms for the specific service purchased (unless the subscription is cancelled or terminated in accordance with these Terms or the EULA) and therefore authorizes the automatic payment collection terms applicable to that specific service (e.g., on a monthly basis and for a specific amount).

 IF YOU ARE A DOODLY USER WITH A MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION AND YOU HAVE PROVIDED US WITH A VALID CREDIT CARD NUMBER OR PAYPAL INFORMATION, EACH PAYMENT WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY PROCESSED AT THE TIME OF YOUR DESIGNATED PAYMENT DATE (MONTHLY) AND WILL BE BILLED TO THE PAYMENT METHOD YOU PROVIDED TO US AT THE TIME OF YOUR ENROLLMENT.
IF YOU WISH TO CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION TO DOODLY, YOU MAY DO SO BY E-MAILING SUPPORT@DOODLY.COM BEFORE THE FIRST DAY OF YOUR NEXT SUBSCRIPTION MONTH AND YOUR ACCOUNT WILL BE CLOSED AT THE END OF YOUR BILLING PERIOD.

 If you are purchasing a subscription with a promotional one-time fee and no monthly fees, the following terms apply depending on the promotional offer you purchase: 

  &nbsp.
One-Time Fee for Standard product or Enterprise product: This one-time fee promotion, which Doodly offers to new customers from time-to-time, grants you a paid web subscription to the Standard or Enterprise product selected and paid for by you the user.
No additional monthly base subscription fees will be charged.

  &nbsp.
Doodly may offer other promotional offers in the future and your purchase will be subject to the terms described to and agreed upon by you at the time of purchase.
  &nbsp.
Optional in-software purchases and upgrades by the user incur additional fees indicated at the time of purchase, and those will be charged at the time of the optional purchase or upgrade and, as applicable, monthly thereafter.
There is no obligation to make optional in-software purchases or upgrades in order to use your paid Standard or Enterprise subscription.
  &nbsp.
Promotional subscriptions are subject to these Terms of Use, End User License Agreement and Privacy Policy.
Unless you make an in-software purchase or upgrade that requires payment of a recurring monthly fee, this Section 7 relating to recurring monthly fees will not apply to you.

  &nbsp.
One-time fee subscriptions are in effect for as long as the software is available commercially, unless terminated earlier in accordance with these Terms of Use or the End User License Agreement (e.g.
if you violate these agreements).


 Doodly reserves the right to immediately terminate a userâs account and/or service for any unpaid (in whole or part) period of the subscription (with or without notice).
Termination of service in no way relieves or excuses the user from any obligation to pay outstanding charges or expenses.
In the event Doodly starts collection processes of any type, you will be liable for all collection costs, including legal fees and expenses, as provided in Section 19 below.

 In addition to any Fees, Doodly may also charge applicable value added or other tax.
 SECTION 8 â SHIPPING FEES  Unless otherwise stated on the Website at the time of purchase, if we ship you a physical product, we reserve the right to add applicable shipping and handling fees to your order.
Unless otherwise stated, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to fulfill your order within a reasonable time after receipt of your properly completed and verified order.
Accurate shipping address and phone number information is required.
Although we may provide delivery or shipment timeframes or dates, such dates are good-faith estimates and are subject to change.
If your order will be delayed, we will contact you at the e-mail address you provided when placing your order.
If we are unable to contact you or you would like to cancel your order, we will cancel the order and refund the full amount charged.
We shall not be liable for any loss, damage, cost, or expense related to any delay in shipment or delivery caused by any third party carrier or other delivery service not owned or controlled by us.
The risk of loss and title for such items pass to you upon our delivery to any third party carrier.
 SECTION 9 â PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND PRICES AVAILABLE ON THE WEBSITE  Products, services, and prices are generally posted at the following URL, but are subject to change: https://www.doodly.com/pricing.

 If you request a downgrade in services, the downgrade (and corresponding price reduction) will become effective on the first day of the month following your requested downgrade.

THE RIGHTS THAT YOU AND YOUR BUSINESS WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT, SUCH AS DISCOVERY OR THE RIGHT TO APPEAL, MAY BE MORE LIMITED OR MAY NOT EXIST.

HOWEVER, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT (INCLUDING INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF OR STATUTORY DAMAGES), AND MUST FOLLOW THESE TERMS AS A COURT WOULD.

 If you have a complaint, dispute, or controversy, you agree to first contact us at support@doodly.com to attempt to resolve the dispute or controversy informally.
Any controversy or claim arising out of or related to the use of the Website, any product, service, or software, the End User License Agreement, these Terms of Use &amp.
Sale, the Privacy Policy, or your relationship with us that cannot be resolved through such informal process or through negotiation within 120 days shall be resolved by binding, confidential arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ), and judgment on the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
We agree that any claim we may have against you or your business will also be subject to this arbitration provision, except as provided in Sections 18 and 19 below.
The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator in the English language in Ada County, Idaho, unless we both agree to conduct the arbitration by telephone or written submissions.
The arbitrator shall be selected by agreement of the parties or, if the parties cannot agree, chosen in accordance with Rules of the AAA.
The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the AAAâs Commercial Arbitration Rules and Procedures, in effect at the time of submission of the demand for arbitration.
The AAAâs Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, construction, validity, applicability, or enforceability of these Terms of Use &amp.
Sale, the Privacy Policy, the End User License Agreement, this arbitration provision, and any other terms incorporated by reference into these Terms of Use &amp.
Sale.
The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether any dispute is arbitrable.
The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether this arbitration agreement can be enforced against a non-signatory to this agreement and whether a non-signatory to this agreement can enforce this provision against you or Doodly.

 Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAAâs Rules.
In all other respects, the parties shall each pay their own additional fees, costs, and expenses, including, but not limited to, those for any attorneys, experts, documents, and witnesses.

 The arbitrator shall follow the substantive law of the State of Idaho without regard to its conflicts of laws principles.
Any award rendered shall include a confidential written opinion and shall be final, subject to appeal under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.
Â§Â§ 1-16, as amended.
Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

 You and Doodly agree that disputes will only be arbitrated on an individual basis and shall not be consolidated, on a class wide, representative basis, or with any other arbitration(s) or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party.
You and Doodly expressly waive any right to pursue any class or other representative action against each other.

 Failure or any delay in enforcing this arbitration provision in connection with any particular claim will not constitute a waiver of any rights to require arbitration at a later time or in connection with any other claims except that all claims must be brought within 1 year after the claim arises (the 1 year period includes the 120-day informal resolution procedures described above).

 This arbitration provision sets forth the terms and conditions of our agreement to final and binding confidential arbitration and is governed by and enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.
Â§Â§ 1-16, as amended.

 This provision survives termination of your account or relationship with Doodly, bankruptcy, assignment, or transfer.
If the class action waiver is deemed unenforceable (i.e., unenforceability would allow arbitration to proceed as a class or representative action), then this entire arbitration provision shall be rendered null and void and shall not apply.
If a portion of this arbitration provision (other than the class action waiver) is deemed unenforceable, the remaining portions of this arbitration provision shall remain in full force and effect.

 YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND YOUR BUSINESS WOULD HAVE HAD A RIGHT TO LITIGATE THROUGH A COURT, TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE, AND TO BE PARTY TO A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.
HOWEVER, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO HAVE ANY CLAIMS DECIDED INDIVIDUALLY AND ONLY THROUGH BINDING, FINAL, AND CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION.
