We offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment (a âTrialâ).

Ludwig reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to determine your eligibility for a Trial, and, subject to applicable laws, to withdraw or to modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the greatest extent permitted under the law.
We reserve the right to revoke the free trial and put your account on hold in the event that we determine that you are not eligible.
We may use information such as device ID, method of payment or an account email address used with an existing or recent Ludwig membership to determine eligibility.
For combinations with other offers, restrictions may apply.
Promo offers are regulated by different Terms of Use.
Therefore, to activate any Promo offer you will agree to separate terms and conditions.
Those terms and conditions shall govern only with regard to the specific promo offer to which they apply, and are distinct from and supplemental to these Agreements, and do not supersede these Agreements.
If a provision contained in terms and conditions of a Promo offer conflict with these Terms, those separate terms and conditions shall prevail only to the extent of such conflict.

BY PROVIDING YOUR PAYMENT DETAILS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE TRIAL, YOU AGREE TO THIS CHARGE USING SUCH PAYMENT DETAILS.
IF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH YOUR LUDWIG ACCOUNTâS SUBSCRIPTION PAGE OR TERMINATE YOUR LUDWIG ACCOUNT BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL.

Not satisfied with your Ludwig Premium subscription? We offer a 15-day no-questions-asked refund guarantee.
The subscription's first billing will take place the day after the end of the free trial period.
We will charge your monthly/yearly subscription fee at the end of your free trial period, unless you cancel your membership prior to the end of the free trial period.
Please note that, if you have cancelled your subscription after the end of the free trial period WE WILL NOT REFUND ANY SUBSCRIPTION FEE.
In addition, no refund (partial or full) is available if you cancel your monthly/yearly premium subscription after the billing period.

Once you cancel your subscription, auto-renewal payments will stop.


3.5 Lifetime premium subscription plan.
Ludwig also offers a lifetime premium subscription plan that allows one to access Ludwigâs premium services at the time of your purchase for as long as Ludwigâs services are available.
If you purchase a Ludwig lifetime premium subscription plan, you will be charged for the entire lifetime plan amount in one single payment.
Naturally, since it is a lifetime plan, there will be no future renewals.
Please note that we may use a third-party payment processor to facilitate your payments.
You may not assign your Ludwig lifetime premium subscription plan to any other person.
Ludwig makes no warranties or representations that any of its services will continue to be available for any period of time, and in purchasing a Ludwig lifetime premium subscription plan, you acknowledge and agree that Ludwigâs services could change or terminate at any time in the future.
Therefore, in the event Ludwig: discontinues the service or ceases to do business, or in the event of an acquisition of Ludwig, change of control of Ludwig, significant merger, or other legal reorganization no refund will be issued for the cost of the service.
If Ludwig terminates your account because of a violation of our terms of service, Ludwig will not refund any portion of your subscription price.
If your Ludwig lifetime premium subscription account has no activity for a period of 2 years we will consider that account dormant and will remove online access to the data.
We will then keep the data for an additional 1-year, at which point we will delete your data.
Activity is defined as a login to the Ludwig service.
You can cancel your Ludwig lifetime premium subscription plan at any time, however cancellation of a Ludwig lifetime premium subscription plan will not result in a refund.
Please note that, as any other premium plans, a lifetime plan may not include all the features developed by Ludwig.
Therefore, in order to get any features that are not included in the premium plans, you will be asked to upgrade your plan and pay an additional fee to include those features you are interested in.

9 Service limitations and modifications

9.1 Ludwig will make reasonable efforts to keep the Ludwig Service operational.

9.2 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you have bought a monthly or annual premium subscription that Ludwig permanently discontinue prior to the end of its validity period, Ludwig will refund you the fees paid and not enjoyed because of such discontinuation.

11 Payments, cancellations, and right of withdrawal

11.1 Ludwig uses a third-party payment processor (the âPayment Processorâ) to link your credit card account to the Service.
The processing of payments or credits, as applicable, in connection with your use of the Service will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor and your credit card issuer in addition to these Terms.
Ludwig is therefore not responsible for any errors by the Payment Processor.
In connection with your use of the Service, Ludwig will obtain certain transaction details, which Ludwig will use solely in accordance with its Privacy Policy.
Specifically, we use Stripe (https://stripe.com) to process credit card payments on our website.
Stripe is certified as PCI Service Provider Level 1 the most stringent level of certification possible.
When you opt into saving your credit card with us, all storage of sensitive information (i.e., your credit card number) is kept in Stripeâs secure environment.
At no point can we see or store your credit card number on our systems.
You can learn more about Stripeâs Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy by accessing the following link: https://stripe.com/privacy


11.2 The membership fee for the Ludwig service and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the service, such as taxes and possible transaction fees, will be charged on a monthly or yearly basis (depending on the Premium plan previously purchased/subscribed) to your Payment Method on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of the paying portion of your membership.
In some cases your payment date may change, for example if your Payment Method has not successfully settled or if your paid membership began on a day not contained in a given month.
You can change your Payment Method by visiting our website and clicking on the âYour Accountâ section.
If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not change your Payment Method or cancel your account, we may suspend your access to the service until we have obtained a valid Payment Method.
When you update your Payment Method, you authorize us to continue charging the updated Payment Method, and you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts.
This may result in a change to your payment billing dates.
For some Payment Methods, the issuer of your Payment Method may charge you certain fees, such as a foreign transaction fee or other fees relating to the processing of your Payment Method.
Local tax charges may vary depending on the Payment Method used.
Check with your Payment Method service provider for details.

11.3 When you register for a Premium Subscription or Free Trial, you consent to get access to Ludwig Premium immediately.
Given that we already offer a free trial of fifteen (15) days of the Ludwigâs Premium Service, Refunds will not, however, be provided once that the free trial period of fifteen (15) days expires.
Moreover, it must be noted that the fifteen days free trial is not included if you are purchasing a Promo Offer or any discounted offer directly from Ludwig or a third party.


11.4 Your payment to Ludwigâ Premium Service will automatically renew at the end of the monthly or yearly subscription period, unless you cancel your Premium Subscription before the end of the current subscription period.
You can cancel your Ludwig membership at any time, and you will continue to have access to the Ludwig service through the end of your monthly billing period.
To the extent permitted by the applicable law, payments are non-refundable and we do not provide refunds or credits for any partial-month membership periods.
If you cancel your membership, you will be automatically downgraded to the Free Service at the end of your current billing period.
More specifically, the cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period.
However, if you cancel your payment or Paid Subscription and/or terminate any of the Agreements before the end of the current subscription period, we will not refund any subscription fees already paid to us.
To cancel, go to your âAccountâ and follow the instructions for cancellation.

11.5 If you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, your subscription is also subject to the terms of your agreement with that third party (in addition to these Terms).
To cancel your subscription, you must cancel directly with that third party.

11.6 Ludwig reserves the right to revise its Fees, including by increasing or adding new Fees, at any time on ten (10) daysâ notice.
Such notice may be sent to you by email to your most recently provided email address or posted on the Site or by any other manner chosen by Ludwig in its commercially reasonable discretion.
You will be deemed to have received any such notice that is posted on the Site on the day it was posted.
Your use of the Services after the ten (10) day notice period constitutes your acceptance of the new or revised Fees.
The Price changes for Paid Subscriptions will take effect at the start of your next monthly or yearly subscription period.
As permitted by local law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Ludwig Service after the price change takes effect.
If you do not agree with the price changes, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Ludwig Service prior to the price change going into effect.
Please therefore make sure you read any such notification of price changes carefully.

11.7 By subscribing to Ludwigâs Premium Service you acknowledge that you lost your right to withdrawal, but this does not affect your right to cancel your membership at any time.
The right of withdrawal is a right that allows European consumers to withdraw from their contract within 14 days of its effective date.
Since we at Ludwig already provide our customers with fifteen (15) days of free trial, we rely on an exception for digital content providers, and our service does not include a right of withdrawal.
Ludwig does not offer a right of withdrawal in any European country, however you can cancel at any time during the free trial of fifteen (15) days or after.
After 15 days from your purchase, you may cancel your subscription as described above but you will not receive a refund.
Specifically, at the end of the trial we will automatically apply the yearly/monthly price, at the then-current yearly/monthly price, and start charge your payment details on a yearly/monthly recurring basis, unless you cancel or change your subscription before the trial period ends.
The law requires us to inform you that you do not have a right of withdrawal.
To this end, when our customers sign up in any European country they acknowledge that they lose their right of withdrawal.
Acknowledging that you lose your right of withdrawal will not affect any of your other rights as a consumer and will not affect your ability to cancel your subscription at any time.

11.8 Invoices.
Please note that, according to Italian Fiscal law, if you need an invoice, you have to request it before you go through the payment process.
To request an invoice for your payments, send a request to invoice@ludwig.guru, adding invoice information (Business name, complete address, and VAT number).
You have 48 hours from the valid payment to request your invoice.
Don't forget that if you request an invoice for a purchase, we will send it only if you have effectively paid a premium subscription.
Once you sent us a request for your invoice within 48 hours from the payment, we will send you the invoice within seven days from the date of the effective activation of your premium subscription.
We will send you the invoice at the email address you have used to register.
12 Term and termination

12.1 The Agreements will continue to apply to you until terminated by either you or Ludwig.
However, you acknowledge and agree that the perpetual license granted by you in relation to User Content, including Feedback, is irrevocable and will therefore continue after expiry or termination of any of the Agreements for any reason.
Ludwig may terminate the Agreements or suspend your access to the Ludwig Service at any time, including in the event of your actual or suspected unauthorized use of the Ludwig Service and/or Content, or non-compliance with the Agreements.
If you or Ludwig terminate the Agreements, or if Ludwig suspends your access to the Ludwig Service, you agree that Ludwig shall have no liability or responsibility to you and Ludwig will not refund any amounts that you have already paid, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law.
To learn how to terminate your Ludwig account, please contact us through the Customer Service contact: contact@ludwig.guru.
This section will be enforced to the extent permissible by applicable law.
You may terminate the Agreements at any time.

12.2 If you are an Authorized User of an Enterprise Subscriber, and this Agreement or the applicable agreement for Services and Software is terminated in relation to such Enterprise Subscriber, or if you otherwise lose access to the Services and Software via your Enterprise Subscriber (e.g., if you graduate from that Enterprise Subscriber or are no longer employed by that Enterprise Subscriber), Ludwig may elect in its discretion to (a) terminate your account or (b) downgrade your account to an individual subscriber account, at which point you agree that your use of the Services and Software will be as an individual subscriber in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (which Agreement at that point will be solely between you and Ludwig).
If you are an Authorized User of an Enterprise Subscriber, your Enterprise Subscriber may elect in its discretion and at any time to revoke your Authorized User status and (a) terminate your account or (b) downgrade your account to an individual subscriber account, at which point you agree that your use of the Services and Software will be as an individual subscriber in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (which Agreement at that point will be solely between you and Ludwig).
Upon termination of your account(s) for any reason, your right to use the Services and Software and to access the Site and any of its content will immediately cease and all content in your account(s) will be deleted.
All provisions of this Agreement that by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, limitations of liability and miscellaneous provisions.
Except as may be expressly set forth herein, all Fees paid or accrued in connection with any Services are non-refundable, and Ludwig will not prorate any Fees paid for a subscription that is terminated before the end of its term.

12.3 This article applies only to Enterprise Subscribers.
Either Ludwig or you may terminate this Agreement by notice if the other party breaches any material term of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after receipt of notice of the breach from the non-defaulting party.
In addition, Ludwig may suspend the Services upon notice if you fail to make any payment when due and fail to cure such breach within ten (10) days after receipt of notice of the breach from Ludwig.
Any such suspension or termination shall be without limitation of any other right or remedy available to the terminating party.
Ludwig may terminate this Agreement for convenience upon sixty (60) daysâ prior written notice without liability to you.
Following a termination pursuant to the foregoing sentence, Ludwig shall refund the pro rata portion of any Fees relating to the remaining term, as applicable.
Either Ludwig or you may terminate this Agreement immediately upon notice to the other party if the other party has a receiver or similar party appointed for all or substantially all of its property, is declared insolvent by a court of competent jurisdiction, ceases to do business in the ordinary course, files a petition in bankruptcy or has a petition filed against it in bankruptcy, becomes the subject of any court or administrative proceeding related to its liquidation or insolvency (whether voluntary or involuntary) that is not dismissed within ninety (90) days, or makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors.
If this Agreement is terminated or otherwise expires for any reason, you shall promptly return to Ludwig or destroy, as directed by Ludwig, all Confidential Information, Software and other materials in your possession or under your control belonging to Ludwig, and all rights and licenses granted by Ludwig pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate.
Upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement, your right to use the Services and Software and to access the Site and any of its content will immediately cease and Ludwig may elect in its discretion to (a) terminate your Authorized Usersâ accounts or (b) downgrade your Authorized Usersâ accounts to individual subscriber accounts.
All provisions of this Agreement that by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, limitations of liability and miscellaneous provisions.

OR (3) AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE LUDWIG SERVICE, THIRD PARTY APPLICATIONS, OR THIRD PARTY APPLICATION CONTENT MORE THAN THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO LUDWIG DURING THE PRIOR TWELVE MONTHS IN QUESTION, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY APPLICABLE LAW.
15 Third party rights

15.1 You acknowledge and agree that the owners of the Content and certain distributors are intended beneficiaries of the Agreements and have the right to enforce the Agreements directly against you.
Other than as set out in this section, the Agreements are not intended to grant rights to anyone except you and Ludwig, and in no event shall the Agreements create any third party beneficiary rights.
Furthermore, the rights to terminate, rescind, or agree to any variation, waiver, or settlement of the Agreements are not subject to the consent of any other person.
16 Entire agreement
16.1 These Agreements constitute all the terms and conditions agreed upon between you and Ludwig and supersede any prior agreements in relation to the subject matter of these Agreements, whether written or oral (General Terms and Conditions).
Any additional or different terms or conditions in relation to the subject matter of the Agreements in any written or oral communication from you to Ludwig are void.
You represent that you have not accepted the Agreements in reliance on any oral or written representations made by Ludwig that are not contained in the Agreements.
Please note, however, that other aspects of your use of the Ludwig Service may be governed by additional agreements.
That could include, for example, access to Promo Offers, free or discounted Trials.
You will agree to separate terms and conditions in those circumstances.
Those terms and conditions shall govern only with regard to the specific aspect of the Service to which they apply, and are distinct from and supplemental to these Agreements, and do not supersede these Agreements.
If the provisions of any Promo Offer terms and conditions conflict with these General Terms, those separate terms and conditions shall prevail.
16.2 The General Terms shall apply to each and all the Services (whenever applied for or provided to the Customer) in addition to any Specific Terms except to the extent, if any, expressly excluded in the Specific Terms.
Nevertheless:

in the event of any conflict or inconsistency between any provision of the Specific Terms and any provision of the General Terms, such conflict or inconsistency shall, in the absence of any express agreement to the contrary, be resolved in a manner most favourable to the Service Provider and to the exercise of the Service Provider's rights and options with respect to any matter or issue to which the inconsistency or conflict relates.

only to the extent that such conflict or inconsistency cannot be so resolved, the provision of the Specific Terms shall prevail over the provision of the General Terms.

all rights conferred on the Service Provider under the General Terms with respect to any matter or event shall be additional to the rights conferred on the Service Provider under the Specific Terms or any other agreement with the Customer with respect to that matter or event.
17 Severability and waiver

17.1 Unless as otherwise stated in the Agreements, should any provision of the Agreements be held invalid or unenforceable for any reason or to any extent, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not in any manner affect or render invalid or unenforceable the remaining provisions of the Agreements, and the application of that provision shall be enforced to the extent permitted by law.

17.2 Any failure by Ludwig or any third party beneficiary to enforce the Agreements or any provision thereof shall not waive Ludwigâs or the applicable third party beneficiaryâs right to do so.
18 Assignment

18.1 Ludwig may assign the Agreements or any part of them, and Ludwig may delegate any of its obligations under the Agreements.
You may not assign the Agreements or any part of them, nor transfer or sub-license your rights under the Agreements, to any third party.
19 Indemnification

19.1 To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to indemnify and hold Ludwig harmless from and against all damages, losses, and expenses of any kind (including reasonable attorney fees and costs) arising out of: (1) your breach of this Agreement.
(2) any of your User Content.
(3) any activity in which you engage on or through the Ludwig Service.
and (4) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.
20 Choice of governing law, class action waiver and mandatory arbitration

20.1 These Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Italian laws.
These terms will not limit any consumer protection rights that you may be entitled to under the mandatory laws of your country of residence.
Unless otherwise required by a mandatory law of a member state of the European Union or any other jurisdiction, the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the Italian laws

20.2 Further, you and Ludwig agree to devolve to the jurisdiction of the Italian courts the resolution of any dispute, claim, or controversy that arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them).
Ludwig does not accept any codes of conduct as mandatory in connection with the services provided under these Agreements.

20.3 WHERE PERMITTED UNDER THE APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND LUDWIG AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.

Unless both you and Ludwig agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one personâs claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

20.4 If you are located in, are based in, have offices in, or do business in a jurisdiction in which this Section 20.4.
is enforceable, the following mandatory arbitration provisions (articles from 20.5 to 20.10) apply to you.

20.5 You and Ludwig agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Ludwig arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Ludwig as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual arbitration.
Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.
THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.
There may be more limited discovery than in court.
The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award declaratory or injunctive relief benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.
This arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.

20.6 Notwithstanding clause (20.5) above, you and Ludwig both agree that nothing herein will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in small claims court, (2) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (3) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (4) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.

20.7 Either you or Ludwig may start arbitration proceedings.
Any arbitration between you and Ludwig will be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the âICCâ) then in force (the âICC Rulesâ) by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the ICC Rules, as modified by these Agreements, and will be administered by the International Court of Arbitration of the ICC.
Any arbitration will be conducted in the Italian language and unless otherwise required by a mandatory law of a member state of the European Union or any other jurisdiction, the law to be applied in any arbitration shall be the Italian law, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.

20.8 Any arbitration must be commenced by filing a demand for arbitration within ONE (1) YEAR after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act, omission, or default giving rise to the claim.
and there shall be no right to any remedy for any claim not asserted within that time period.
If applicable law prohibits a one-year limitation period for asserting claims, any claim must be asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law.

20.9 A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by certified email (âNoticeâ).
Ludwig's address for Notice is: Ludwig Srls, Via Fiume 6, 90133, Palermo.
Ludwigâs certified email is: ludwig@mypec.eu.
The Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.
and (2) set forth the specific relief sought (âDemandâ).
We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Ludwig may commence an arbitration proceeding.
During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Ludwig shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.
In the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Ludwig shall pay you (1) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, (2) the last written settlement amount offered by Ludwig in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitratorâs award.
or (3) $1,000.00, whichever is greater.
All documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of arbitratorâs decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.
Except as required to enforce the arbitratorâs decision and award, neither you nor Ludwig shall make any public announcement or public comment or originate any publicity concerning the arbitration, including, but not limited to, the fact that the parties are in dispute, the existence of the arbitration, or any decision or award of the arbitrator.

20.10 In the event that Ludwig makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to Ludwig's address for Notice), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Ludwig's address for Notice, in which case your account with Ludwig shall be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject, shall survive.

20.11 If the class action waiver at article 20.3 is found to be unenforceable in arbitration or if any part of articles from 20.5 to 20.10 is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then all the provisions of such articles (from 20.5 to 20.10) shall be considered null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in article 20.1 shall govern any action arising out of or related to the Agreements.
