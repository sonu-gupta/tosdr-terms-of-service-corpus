 Disputes and Arbitration.


Disputes.For all disputes arising out of or relating in any way to the Glority Service, you must first send a written description of your claim to Glority LLC to allow us an opportunity to resolve the dispute.
You and Glority LLC each agree to negotiate your claim in good faith.
If we still cannot resolve the dispute you may request arbitration if your claim or dispute cannot be resolved within 60 days.
Please read this section carefully.
It affects your legal rights.
It provides for resolution of disputes through individual arbitration instead of court trials and class actions.
Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court, uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and discovery is more limited.
Arbitration is final and binding and subject to only very limited review by a court.
This arbitration clause shall survive termination of the Terms.



Governing Law.
By using the Glority Service, you agree that the statutes and laws of the United States without regard to conflicts of laws principles, will apply to all matters relating to use of the Glority Service.
If we are unable to commence arbitration, you agree that any litigation shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state or federal courts in New York, NY and shall be subject to the laws of New York without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law.

and (2) any issue as to the existence, validity or termination of the Terms) shall be referred to and finally resolved by binding arbitration administered by the International Centre for Dispute Resolution (âICDRâ) in accordance with its International Arbitration Rules in force as at the date of this Agreement (the âRulesâ), which Rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this Section 19 and as may be amended by the rest of this Section 19.

The claimant shall designate one (1) arbitrator.
The respondent shall designate one (1) arbitrator.
The two arbitrators thus appointed shall designate the third arbitrator who shall be the presiding arbitrator.
If within fourteen (14) days of a request from the other party to do so a party fails to designate an arbitrator, or if the two arbitrators fail to designate the third arbitrator within fourteen (14) days after the confirmation of appointment of the second arbitrator, the appointment shall be made, upon request of a party, by the ICDR in accordance with the Rules.



 The seat of the arbitration shall be New York, New York, U.S.A.
The language of the arbitration shall be English.
This arbitration clause shall be governed by the laws of the United States, including the Federal Arbitration Act, and to the extent not inconsistent therewith, the laws of the State of New York (United States).



 Any award of the Tribunal shall be made in writing and shall be final and binding on the parties from the day it is made.
The parties undertake to carry out the award without delay.

The award rendered by the arbitrator(s) shall include costs of the arbitration, reasonable attorneysâ fees and reasonable costs for experts and other witnesses.
Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.

The parties shall not be deemed, however, to have waived any other right to challenge any award.



 The parties agree that the arbitrator(s) shall have the authority to issue interim orders for provisional relief, including, but not limited to, orders for injunctive relief, attachment or other provisional remedy, as necessary to protect either partyâs name, proprietary information, trade secrets, know-how or any other proprietary right.
The parties agree that any interim order of the arbitrator(s) for any injunctive or other preliminary relief shall be enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction.
In addition, nothing in the Terms shall be deemed as preventing either party from seeking provisional relief from any court of competent jurisdiction, in order to protect that partyâs name or proprietary rights.
Nothing in this Section shall be construed as preventing any party from seeking conservatory or interim relief from any court of competent jurisdiction, including without limitation to protect either partyâs name, proprietary information, trade secrets, know-how or any other proprietary rights.







Miscellaneous.


Waiver.
A provision of these Terms may be waived only by a written instrument executed by the party entitled to the benefit of such provision.
The failure of any party at any time to require performance of any provision of these Terms shall in no manner affect such partyâs right at a later time to enforce the same.
A waiver of any breach of any provision of these Terms shall not be construed as a continuing waiver of other breaches of the same or other provisions of these Terms.


Severability.
