 Merchant Terms of Use TERMS UPDATED ON MAY 13, 2021
 These Merchant Terms of Use (the âTermsâ) govern the use of the products, services or any other features, technologies or functionalities related to merchant payment acceptance services (the "Acceptance Services") provided by BitPay, Inc.
(âBitPayâ, âweâ, âourâ, or âusâ) through BitPayâs website, API or through any other means to you (âMerchantâ, âyouâ or âyourâ).
By using the Acceptance Services, you accept these Terms and agree to be bound by them, confirm that you have read, understood, and accepted all of the provisions contained herein, including, without limitation, Section 18.7, Governing Law.

Waiver of Class Action.
 1.
Our Services  BitPay is a blockchain/cryptocurrency payment processor that enables you to accept cryptocurrencies as a payment method in exchange for goods or services you sell to your customers (âShoppersâ).

 BitPay is not a cryptocurrency exchange, nor does it provide cryptocurrency custody as part of the Acceptance Services.
The Acceptance Services are only available to businesses that sell products or services and registered charitable organizations that accept donations.

 By using the Acceptance Services, you authorize BitPay to act as your agent and to take any and all actions that we think are necessary or desirable to provide the Acceptance Services and to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
Payment by a Shopper to BitPay is considered the same as payment made directly to you and limits the Shopper's outstanding obligations to the extent of the payment.
 2.
Our Regulatory Compliance  BitPay is a U.S.
legal entity and is subject to U.S.
laws and regulations.
This includes the Bank Secrecy Act, the economic and trade sanctions programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the United States Department of the Treasury, the USA PATRIOT Act, and other anti-money laundering (AML) and anti-terrorist financing (ATF) laws.
BitPay is also a registered Money Service Business with the Financial Crime Enforcement Network of the U.S.
Department of the Treasury (FinCEN) and is a licensed money transmitter in the U.S.
states where applicable law requires it to be licensed.
As required by applicable laws and regulations, BitPay maintains a comprehensive AML/ATF/Sanctions compliance program.

 The individual accepting these terms on behalf of the Merchant is of the age of majority, and has all necessary power, capacity and authority to bind the Merchant hereto.

 You ensure that your use of the Acceptance Services does and at all times will comply with all applicable anti-money laundering/anti-terrorist funding compliance laws and regulations, including, without limitation, all OFAC-administered sanctions programs and any other sanctions programs that may apply to you based on the jurisdiction(s) in which you operate your business and serve your customers.

Your Merchant Account (âAccountâ) 
4.1 Account Opening and Registration

 As a regulated financial services business and licensed money transmitter, we are required to collect certain information from Merchants to comply with anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist funding laws and regulations.
Therefore, as part of establishing a BitPay Merchant Account, at a minimum you will be asked to submit business-related information such as name, mailing address, physical address, phone number, email address, information relating to the ultimate beneficial owner(s) or the individual(s) having significant control over the business such as tax identification number and government-issued identification, legal name, fictitious name (i.e.
DBA), company website, and bank account details to be used for settlement of transactions made using the Acceptance Services.
You may be asked to submit additional information and/or documents to enable us to verify your identity and assess business risk, such as entity formation documentation, third-party verification such as recent bank statements or letter of good standing, compliance program documentation, and information regarding your Shoppers and the nature of your expected transactions.

 The information you provide at the time of opening the Account must be accurate and complete, and you must inform us within ten (10) business days of any changes to such information.
BitPay has the right to reject your Account registration, to later close your Account, or to restrict the provision of the Acceptance Services to you if you do not provide and maintain accurate, complete and satisfactory information.


4.2 Transaction Processing Limits

 BitPay imposes daily and annual transaction processing volume limits per Account.
If you wish to increase your limit, you will be required to apply for an upgrade from your Account dashboard and provide us with documentation necessary to qualify for that upgrade.
Depending on the upgrade request, you may be required to provide additional information and documentation.
Requests will not be approved until all required documentation has been reviewed and the accuracy and authenticity of the information has been confirmed.
A description of the processing limits and the upgrade process is available in our FAQs here: https://support.bitpay.com/hc/en-us/articles/206003676-How-do-I-raise-my-approved-processing-volume-tier-limit- 

4.3 Shopper Verification

 Your Shoppers may be required to complete a verification process at the time of payment, depending on the amount of the transaction, as part of our AML/ATF compliance obligations.
This process is known as creating a âBitPay IDâ.
Help articles regarding BitPay ID are available in our FAQs here: https://support.bitpay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037486651-How-do-I-complete-the-BitPay-ID-process-

 6.
Security and Wallet Security 
6.1 Security

 We have implemented security measures designed to protect information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure.
Our security measures include risk assessments and controls for the following: application and system access, system and application development and maintenance, acceptable use, data classification, incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity, and security training.
We cannot guarantee that unauthorized persons will never gain access to your information, and you acknowledge that you provide your information at your own risk, except as otherwise provided by applicable law.


6.2 Digital Wallet Security

 Shoppers sending cryptocurrency payments and Merchants receiving settlements in cryptocurrency need to have a digital wallet.
A digital wallet is a piece of software enabling a user to store encrypted private keys, used to sign transactions to access funds.
A custodial digital wallet constitutes an account where third parties serve as financial intermediaries or custodians of a userâs cryptocurrencies.
A custodial wallet provider stores the userâs private keys and thus has control over the userâs funds.
A non-custodial digital wallet does not constitute an account where third parties serve as financial intermediaries or custodians of a userâs cryptocurrencies.
A non-custodial wallet provider administers only the technical platform to store a userâs private keys, but has no control over or access to the private keys, and therefore no control over or access to the userâs funds.

 Shoppers and Merchants may use any cryptocurrency wallet to store their funds, including the BitPay wallet.
BitPay does not endorse or vouch for the quality or security of any third-party wallets.
The wallet owner is solely responsible for safekeeping passwords and private keys used to access their wallet, as well as maintaining the security protocols and updates on devices used to download and use their wallet.
If a Shopper or Merchant chooses to use the BitPay wallet, they do so subject to the BitPay Wallet Terms of Use.

 BitPay is not responsible for, and cannot assist with recovery of, a loss of cryptocurrency funds incurred by a Merchant or Shopper if a wallet is compromised, for example due to loss of or unauthorized access to private keys, accidental sharing of a backup, a bug in the userâs device or the wallet software, or a malicious attack on the wallet software.

 In the event your account balance gets settled to a wallet that becomes compromised or inaccessible, or in the event a Shopperâs wallet becomes compromised or inaccessible, it is up to you to decide how to handle any inquiries or potential claims.
BitPay does not get involved in resolving such issues.
 7.
Privacy and Data Protection  Our Privacy Policy, including our California Consumer Privacy Act (âCCPAâ) terms, is available at https://bitpay.com/about/privacy, and is incorporated by reference into these Terms.
 8.
Ownership and Use of Services and Intellectual Property 
8.1 Our Ownership of the Services and BitPay Website

 You agree and acknowledge that we own all right, title, and interest in the Acceptance Services, the associated software, technology tools and content, the BitPay service marks and logos, the BitPay website, the content displayed on the website, and other materials produced by BitPay (collectively, âBitPay IPâ).
You are only permitted to use the Acceptance Services and BitPay IP to offer the Acceptance Services to your Shoppers, according to these Terms.
We grant you a personal, limited, revocable, non-exclusive and non-transferable license to use BitPay IP.
You shall not rent, lease, sublicense, distribute, transfer, copy, reproduce, download, display, modify or timeshare BitPay IP or any portion thereof, or use BitPay IP as a component of or a base for products or services prepared for commercial sale, sublicense, lease, access or distribution.
You shall not prepare any derivative work based on BitPay IP, nor shall you translate, reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble BitPay IP.


8.2 Use of BitPay Marks

 While you have an active Account with BitPay, you may use those BitPay Marks that are made available to you by us through our Brand Guidelines and strictly subject to your use being consistent with the Brand Guidelines.
Any and all goodwill arising from your use of the BitPay Marks will inure to our sole and exclusive benefit.
We reserve the right to update the BitPay Brand Guidelines from time to time, and you are responsible for maintaining compliance with the then current version, provided that you have up to sixty days following an update to make any necessary changes.
We will make commercially reasonable efforts to provide notice of any changes to the Brand Guidelines.
The Brand Guidelines are available via our website at https://brand.bitpay.com.
Without waiving any rights that may be available to us, if we determine that you are using any BitPay Marks inconsistent with the Brand Guidelines or in a manner that we reasonably determine is objectionable, we will provide you with notice and you agree to promptly discontinue the objectionable use.
Failure to discontinue objectionable uses or repeated violations of the Brand Guidelines will be deemed a breach of this Agreement.
 9.
Advertising and Marketing  With your prior written approval, we may publish your corporate name, URL, artwork, text, logo, case studies, and other publicly available information about your business ("Content") in BitPay's promotional materials, marketing channels and business directory.
A third party may use BitPay's publicly available Content and tailor the data to create entries for directories or other channels, and the data listed on third-party directories or channels will be subject to separate third-party terms of use.
We may also request a testimonial or quote in the form of a blog post, promotional material, press release, or interview, and/or a reference.
You have no obligation to provide Content, a testimonial, quote or reference.
Upon mutual agreement, you and BitPay may engage in a separate marketing campaign.

 You represent and warrant to us that you have the right to provide the Content to us, and that the use, copying, modification and publication of the Content by us: (a) will not infringe, violate or misappropriate any third-party copyright, patent, trade secret or other proprietary rights, (b) will not infringe any rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) will not be defamatory or otherwise violate any law.
 10.
Invoices 
10.1 Invoice Generation and Competitive Exchange Rate Guarantee for Your Shopper

 In order to accept a cryptocurrency payment, you need to create a payment request (âInvoiceâ) using the Acceptance Services, based on the amount you want to collect in your settlement currency, such as U.S.
Dollars or Euros, or in any of the supported cryptocurrencies.
BitPay's hosted invoice user interface must be displayed to the Shopper during checkout.

 When BitPay processes payments, we use BitPayâs Best Bid (âBBBâ) rate.
We guarantee the exchange rate for the Shopper as long as the Shopper pays within the proper time window after the invoice is created.
Invoice timeout information is clearly displayed on each BitPay invoice.
For more information about how BitPay calculates exchange rates and factors in market depth, please refer to bitpay.com/exchange-rates.

 While we guarantee the exchange rate for the Shopper as long as the Shopper pays within such time window, you agree that you assume the volatility risk of your settlement currency.
For example, if you ask us to collect $150.00 and the Shopper sends the cryptocurrency equivalent within the time window, we guarantee you will receive exactly $150.00, minus our fee, but we do not guarantee the future value of the U.S.
Dollar.
Similarly, if you elect to receive some of all of your settlement in cryptocurrency, we do not guarantee the future value of that cryptocurrency.


10.2 Invoice Completion

 An invoice is considered âcompleteâ by us if it has been fully paid by the Shopper, the corresponding transaction has reached our required number of block confirmations, and the payment has been credited to your Account ledger.

 The number of confirmations required for a transaction depends on several factors, including the blockchain being used and our internal analysis of risk.
We employ risk mitigation techniques to detect fraudulent payments, such as payments that are at risk of never receiving the required number of block confirmations.
However, these measures do not completely eliminate the risk associated with unconfirmed payments.

 You have the option to inform your Shopper earlier about the status of an invoice, e.g., if the Shopper has sent funds but the transaction has not yet been confirmed.
A confirmed invoice means that payment has been made and the required block confirmations have occurred, such that the transaction has passed our risk validation measures, but it still needs to be credited to your Account ledger.
For more information about how block confirmations and invoice completion works, see our FAQs here: https://support.bitpay.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004832203-How-do-bitcoin-block-confirmations-work- 
 BitPay is not liable for settling invoices which are not considered fully paid or complete.
In other words, if you accept a payment before it is credited by us to your Account ledger, we are not required to settle to you if we determine that the payment was fraudulent or otherwise invalid.


10.3 Supported Cryptocurrencies on the BitPay Invoice

 BitPay may add new cryptocurrencies to the BitPay Invoice.
Additional cryptocurrencies on the invoice will be on an opt-out basis, such that they will be enabled by default unless you instruct BitPay to disable them.
In addition, there may be circumstances that cause BitPay to decide to remove a particular cryptocurrency as a payment option.


10.4 Payment Exceptions

 In certain situations when an Invoice is underpaid or overpaid, it will result in a âpayment exceptionâ.
Shoppers will automatically receive an email from BitPay in order to claim the underpayment or overpayment, as described below.
BitPay incurs miner fees to refund a payment.
If a Shopper requests a refund for a payment exception, BitPay will deduct the miner fees from the refunded amount (see Section 14, Fees, for details).


10.4.1 Underpayments

 Underpayments occur when a Shopper sends less than the full amount required to mark the Invoice as fully paid.
Since the Invoice is not fully paid or complete, the funds do not get applied to your Account.
BitPay will send an email to the Shopper allowing the Shopper to request a refund for the partial payment.


10.4.2 Overpayments

 Overpayments occur when an Invoice receives excess funds.
In such cases, the Invoice passes through the state of being paid in full and is marked as an overpayment.
Once the invoice status is set to "complete", the funds to mark the Invoice as fully paid are applied to your Account.
However, the excess funds are not applied.
BitPay will send an email to the Shopper allowing the Shopper to request a refund for the excess funds.
The Shopper also has the ability to request a refund of the excess funds directly from the invoice.


10.4.3 Orphan Payments

 âOrphan paymentsâ occur when a transaction is received outside the time window referenced in Section 10.1, Invoice Generation and Competitive Exchange Rate Guarantee.
Any payments sent to the expired invoice will show up in BitPayâs system as an orphan payment.
Orphan payments also occur when a user sends cryptocurrency to one of our wallet addresses without a connection to an invoice.
For more information or to resolve orphaned payments, either you or the Shopper will need to reach out to our support team (https://bitpay.com/request-help/wizard) with required information.


10.4.4 Unsupported Payments

 For an overview of currently supported cryptocurrencies, please refer to bitpay.com/exchange-rates.
Unless explicitly mentioned in our website or in our Terms of Use, we do not support or process payments for unsupported coins, tokens, or blockchain forks, collectively known as âUnsupported Paymentsâ ("UP").
Shoppers should not pay a BitPay Invoice with UP or send UP to a BitPay address.
If a Shopper transmits UP, the Shopper may lose any perceived value in the UP.
Additionally, BitPay assumes no responsibility whatsoever with respect to UP and Shoppers will not be able to recover UP from BitPay.


10.4.5 Unclaimed Property

 If a payment exception occurs, BitPay will try to locate you or the Shopper using the information shown in our records, but if BitPay is unable to contact you or the Shopper and/or has no record of you or the Shopper's use of the Acceptance Services for several years, applicable law may require BitPay to report these funds as unclaimed property to the applicable jurisdiction.
BitPay reserves the right to deduct a dormancy fee or other administrative charges from such unclaimed funds, as permitted by applicable law.


10.5 Delayed Settlement

 If we need to conduct an investigation or resolve any pending dispute related to your Account, or if required by law, court order, or at the request of law enforcement, we may delay settlement or restrict access to settlement funds.
In the case of a delayed settlement, we will strive to promptly inform you, unless prohibited by court order or law enforcement.
We will not be liable to you for any damages or harm caused as a result of such delayed settlement or restricted access.
Unless required to delay settlement by law, we are committed to not delay or restrict settlement unnecessarily, and if partial delay or restriction is possible, we will only partially delay or restrict.
Once the reasons for delayed settlement or restricted access to settlement funds can be reasonably proven to have been resolved, BitPay will pay the full amount of such funds to you without undue delay.


10.6 Account Information

 You will have access to Account information detailing your ledger, transaction and settlement history through your Account dashboard or via BitPayâs API.
Should you identify an error, you must notify us within thirty (30) calendar days of the ledger entry posting.
 11.
Refunds 
11.1 General Procedures

 BitPay can facilitate cryptocurrency refunds to Shoppers on your behalf.
You can decide to issue a partial refund or refund the full amount of the initial purchase.
You can also decide whether to issue the refund denominated in the invoice currency or in the cryptocurrency used to pay the invoice.
If you do not have enough funds in your Account to cover pending refund requests, we may require you to make a bank deposit to an account specified by us.
Any required currency conversion during the refund process will be calculated at a spot rate determined by us, following the guidelines found here: bitpay.com/exchange-rates.


11.2 Disclosure of Merchant Refund Policy

 BitPay is not responsible for Merchant refund policies.
We suggest Merchants provide a clear refund policy to their customers (including, if applicable, âno refunds are allowed as all sales are finalâ).
For certain industries, a refund policy may not be applicable (e.g., where a service is provided).
If refunds are permitted, we recommend that Merchants refund the amount of the initial purchase in the currency in which the item was priced.


11.3 Refund of Payment Exceptions

 If a payment exception is refunded within 30 days after the invoice creation date, the exact amount of cryptocurrency originally received will be returned to the Shopper.

 If a payment exception is not refunded within 30 days after the invoice creation date, BitPay will lock the applicable cryptocurrency/USD exchange rate exactly 30 days after the date and time of invoice creation.
The locked exchange rate on the 30th day will be used to determine the amount of cryptocurrency that will be refunded.
Additionally, because of cryptocurrency price fluctuations, BitPay will only refund the cryptocurrency amount sent to BitPay or the USD value, whichever is less.

 Example for BTC (same applies to other supported cryptocurrencies) if BTC price is lower after the 30th day:  Day BTC Paid BTC Price to USD BTC Refund Amount USD Value of Refund 1 1 $1,000 1 $1,000 30 1 $900 1 $900 31 1 $800 1 $800 60 1 $450 1 $450  Example for BTC (same applies to other supported cryptocurrencies) if BTC price is higher after the 30th day:  Day BTC Paid BTC Price to USD BTC Refund Amount USD Value of Refund 1 1 $500 1 $500 30 1 $1,000 1 $1,000 31 1 $2,000 0.5 $1,000 60 1 $4,000 0.25 $1,000 
11.3.1 Refund of XRP Payment Exceptions: Requirement of InvoiceID or Tag

 Because all XRP invoices share the same address, BitPay requires all Shoppers to include the invoiceID or Destination tag when sending the XRP transaction from their wallets.
If an XRP transaction is sent to BitPay without either the invoiceID tag or the tag information and results in a payment exception, there is no guarantee that we can determine who it came from and therefore we will not be able to provide a refund.
We recommend that you include this provision language in your own terms of use.
 12.

12.1 Shopper Complaints

The debits and credits to your Account ledger are funds temporarily held by BitPay until settlement to your bank account and/or wallet can take place.
You can receive settlement in a local currency, in any of the supported cryptocurrencies, or in a mixture of both, and we have no right to impose any cryptocurrency over local currency, as your choice in this respect supersedes any of our preferences.
Please note that minimum settlement thresholds apply, as set forth in Section 13.7, below.

 An Account ledger will be created for each currency selected for settlement pursuant to your settlement preferences.
If you change your settlement preferences, those changes will be effective for Account ledger balances that are received after the date of the change.
Any Account ledger balances dating from before the preference change will settle pursuant to your pre-change settlement preferences.


13.2 Your Bank Account

 You must provide us with written notice at least one (1) business day prior to closing your bank account.
If you wish to continue to receive direct deposits, you must provide us with information for a substitute bank account.
You are solely liable for all fees and costs associated with your bank account and for all overdrafts.
You are also liable to us for any fees that we may incur based on your provision of inaccurate information or instructions.
You authorize us to initiate electronic credits to your bank account at any time, as necessary to process your transactions.
We will not be liable for any delays in receipt of funds or errors in bank account entries caused by third parties, nor will we be liable or responsible for any errors in the account or address information that you have provided to us.


13.3 Settlements in Local Currencies

 Direct deposit to a designated bank account in a fiat currency is available to Merchants located in certain countries.
Please refer to bitpay.com/docs/settlement for a list of those countries.
If you wish to receive direct deposits, you must provide valid bank account information and keep such information current.
Each business day, we will send a direct deposit to your bank account to clear out your accumulated Account ledger balance, provided that (a) the settlement minimums are met, and (b) funds will be deposited in your bank account within two business days following the settlement order.
We reserve the right to charge you applicable wire fees, except when settling in U.S.
Dollars to a bank located in the United States or when settling in Euros to a bank within the SEPA zone.

 Settlements will be initiated from a bank account held in the name of BitPay, Inc.
or Stichting Client Funds BMSE, which is a foundation established by us to segregate client funds from operational funds.


13.4 Settlements in Supported Cryptocurrencies.
Disclosure of Material Risks

 Any supported cryptocurrency accepted by BitPay on your behalf must be settled to a cryptocurrency wallet that you provide.
Payments in any of the supported cryptocurrencies will be sent to your designated wallet address, generally by the end of the day following the relevant transaction (as determined in U.S.
Eastern Standard or Daylight Time, as applicable) and provided that the settlement minimum is met.
We are not liable for any losses incurred as a result of improperly reported or designated wallet addresses that you provide.

 You assume the volatility risk of the cryptocurrencies in which settlement occurs.
If any of the supported cryptocurrencies are the chosen settlement medium, you assume the volatility risk of the cryptocurrency value.

 BitPayâs Acceptance Services do not include cryptocurrency custody.
If you choose to be settled in cryptocurrency, and if we cannot complete such settlement with you, at the time the settlement otherwise would have occurred BitPay will freeze the value of any Account ledger balance at the then applicable US Dollar conversion rate.
For example, if a Shopper makes a purchase from you such that you are to be settled 0.1 BTC, but we cannot complete the settlement to a wallet address that you provided, then when the settlement to your wallet would otherwise have occurred, we will freeze the value of the settlement in US Dollars at the applicable US Dollar conversion rate.
You may subsequently be settled in cryptocurrency or fiat, but that settlement amount will be based on the frozen US Dollar value, regardless of currency value fluctuations in the intervening period.
In this example, if at the time the settlement would otherwise have occurred to your wallet, the value of 0.1 BTC was $5,000, then that will be the value frozen for this transaction on your Account ledger.
If you ultimately decide to receive fiat settlement of this Account ledger balance, such settlement will be for $5,000, regardless of the prevailing BTC to US Dollar exchange rate at the time of settlement.
Similarly, if you maintain your bitcoin settlement preference and you provide a valid bitcoin wallet address, we will remit settlement at the then prevailing exchange rate based on the $5,000 value (e.g., if the exchange rate when we receive the valid wallet address is 1 BTC:$80,000, you will receive 0.0625 BTC, or if the exchange rate is 1 BTC:$25,000, you will receive 0.2 BTC).

 BitPay does not own or control the underlying software protocols that govern the operation of cryptocurrencies supported on our platform.
In general, the underlying protocols are open source and anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute them.
BitPay is only liable for the Account ledger balance selected in your refund reserve or payout preference (see Section 13.6, Refund Reserve).


13.5 DISCLOSURE: Material Risks of Virtual Currency Disclosure Under 23 NYCCR 200.19

 While there are material risks from accepting various forms of payment (such as cash, other fiat currencies, network card payments, other proprietary electronic payments and alternative virtual currency payments), BitPay discloses the following: 

 Virtual Currency (like Bitcoin) is not legal tender, is not backed by the government, and accounts and value balances are not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or Securities Investor Protection Corporation protections.

 Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of Virtual Currency.

 Transactions in Virtual Currency may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable.

 Some Virtual Currency transactions shall be deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that the Shopper initiates the transaction.

 The value of Virtual Currency may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange Fiat Currency for Virtual Currency, which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular Virtual Currency should the market for that Virtual Currency disappear.

 There is no assurance that a Person who accepts a Virtual Currency as payment today will continue to do so in the future.

 The volatility and unpredictability of the price of Virtual Currency relative to Fiat Currency may result in significant loss over a short period of time.

 The nature of Virtual Currency may lead to an increased risk of fraud or cyber attack.

 The nature of Virtual Currency means that any technological difficulties experienced by BitPay may prevent the access or use of a Shopperâs Virtual Currency.
and 
 Any bond or trust account maintained by BitPay for the benefit of its Merchants may not be sufficient to cover all losses incurred by customers.



13.6 Refund Reserve

 With your explicit consent, we can set a refund reserve on your Account.
The purpose of the refund reserve is to make sure there is always a buffer of funds available on your Account to cover pending refunds (e.g., when goods/services are not delivered).

 If no refund reserve is set, pending refunds will be deducted from the balance on your Account, which is settled daily by us.
If a refund reserve is set, we will only settle the pending balance sitting on top of the refund reserve amount.
If there is no balance to be settled, we will use the funds available in your refund reserve to cover pending refund requests from your Account.
If the refund reserve is being used, any incoming deposits to your Account would first refill the reserve up to the amount defined (incoming deposits are invoices paid by Shoppers and/or bank deposits from you to an account specified by BitPay).
Refund reserve values are established and maintained in fiat currency only.


13.7 Settlement Minimum

 BitPay settles the accumulated balance on your Account ledger if it is above the minimum amount defined for the settlement currency selected on the Account dashboard.
Please refer to bitpay.com/docs/settlement for information related to minimum settlement amounts and deposit frequency.

 For cryptocurrency Account ledger balances below the settlement minimum, BitPay will freeze the transaction values in your Account at the U.S.
Dollar equivalent value at the conversion rate at the time the settlement would otherwise have occurred (i.e., at the time the balance would have been settled but for the settlement minimum not being met).
Once the cumulative Account ledger balance for a given cryptocurrency reaches the settlement minimum, as measured by the conversion rate at the applicable settlement time, BitPay will remit the cryptocurrency settlement to your applicable wallet address.
 14.
Fees 
14.1 Definitions


BitPay Processing Fees
 We charge a processing fee to businesses for each transaction (Invoice) successfully processed through your Account.
These fees are deducted from your Account ledger balances (net settlements).


Miner Fees
 Cryptocurrency transactions typically incur miner fees.
These fees are automatically created by cryptocurrency wallets in order to broadcast a transaction on a given blockchain network.
These fees are paid to cryptocurrency miners (and their operators) that process transactions and maintain the respective network.
Miner fees are variable depending on network conditions and the desired confirmation speed for the transaction.
If a cryptocurrency network gets congested, the minimum required miner fee will be higher to ensure the transaction can be reliably processed on the network.
Using a lower-than-average miner fee can put a transaction at risk of slow confirmation or no confirmation at all.


BitPay Network Costs
 BitPay network costs are specific to Bitcoin (BTC) or Bitcoin Cash (BCH) payments.
they do not apply to the other cryptocurrencies supported on the BitPay invoice.
When a Shopper pays a BitPay invoice using BTC or BCH, the payment goes to a BitPay address.
We then pay network-based miner fees (like the one paid by the Shopper) to combine the different cryptocurrency amounts paid by Shoppers (called UTXO: âUnspent Transaction Outputâ), send the funds to cryptocurrency exchange platforms (âUTXO Sweepsâ), and convert them to fiat currency, which is necessary to settle businesses using the Acceptance Services.
We require timely blockchain confirmations for UTXO Sweeps so we can quickly exchange funds and promptly pay businesses using the Acceptance Services.
Network costs are calculated based on miner fees.
Therefore, if miner fees rise, network costs also rise.


14.2 Merchant Fees


BitPay Processing Fees
 We charge you a processing fee for each transaction (invoice) successfully processed through your Account.
We reserve the right to change our processing fee.
We will notify you in advance of such a change, and your continued use of the Acceptance Services after we provide notice of the fee change constitutes your acceptance of such change.
Current pricing information is provided on the BitPay website at bitpay.com/pricing.


Refund Fees on Successful Payments
 If you issue a full or partial refund on a successful payment, we deduct the miner fee used to return the cryptocurrency payment to the Shopper.
The deduction is added as a separate entry in your Account ledger after the refund is executed.


14.3 Shopper Fees


Miner Fees
 The Shopper pays a miner fee in order to send funds from his/her cryptocurrency wallet to pay a BitPay invoice.


BitPay Network Costs
 If the estimated amount of the network cost is more than 0.01 USD, BitPay charges it as a separate fee to the Shopper.
The Shopperâs payment of the network cost helps BitPay cover its miner fee costs.


Refund Fees on Payment Exceptions
 If a Shopperâs transaction ends up as a Payment Exception (see Section 10.4, Payment Exceptions), BitPay deducts the corresponding miner fee used to return the payment to the Shopper from the total refund amount.
