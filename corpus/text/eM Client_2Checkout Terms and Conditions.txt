If at any time You would like to cease doing business electronically with 2Checkout, You will need to provide 2Checkout with written notice of Your withdrawal of Your consent to do business electronically, which will then terminate this consent.
Thereafter, You shall not use this Website to place any Orders, and any notices and documents from 2Checkout will be provided to You on paper.



 3.

3.1 Prices are as specified on the Website.
however, 2Checkout reserves the right to adjust prices in its sole discretion due to increases in costs (including, without limitation, delivery costs or costs of any materials), the increase or imposition of any tax, duty or other levy, any variation in exchange rates, or any programming, data or other errors.
Prices for the Products are exclusive of shipping, handling, duties, and taxes, all of which shall be paid by You.

3.2 Prior to Product delivery, 2Checkout will notify You in writing via email of any price increases (a "Notification Email").
The Notification Email will be sent to You at the email address that We have in Our records for You.
By no later than the deadline set forth in the Notification Email, You may cancel Your Order for the Product for which the price was increased (a) via 2Checkout myAccount or (b) by sending a reply email to the Notification Email.
If You do not so cancel Your Order within said deadline, You accept the new prices and conditions for the Product as set forth in the Notification Email.
