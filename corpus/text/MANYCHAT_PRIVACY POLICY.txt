CHOICES 
You have the following rights:


 If you wish to access your personal information that ManyChat collects, you can do so at any time by contacting us using the contact details provided under âHow to Contact Usâ heading below.

 ManyChat account holders may review, update, correct or delete the personal information in their registration profile by logging into their account.
ManyChat account holders may also contact us to accomplish the foregoing or if you have additional requests or questions.

 If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (âEEAâ), you can object to processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict processing of your personal information or request portability of your personal information where it is technically possible.
Again, you can exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details below.

 Similarly, if you are a resident of the EEA, if we have collected and processed your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time.
Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

 You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information.
Contact details for data protection authorities in the EEA, Switzerland and certain non-European countries (including the U.S.
and Canada) are available here.


 We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.


Access to Data Controlled by our Customers. ManyChat has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal information is contained within the Custom User Fields processed by our Service.
An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete personal information provided by our users should direct their request to the Customer directly.
 V.
RETENTION OF INFORMATION  We will retain personal information we process on behalf of our Customers for as long as needed to provide our Services or for an indefinite time to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent abuse, and enforce our agreements.
If required by law, we will delete personal information by erasing it from our database.

By accepting the terms of this Privacy Policy, you acknowledge, agree and consent to (1) the transfer to and processing of personal information on servers located outside of the country where you reside and (2) our collection and use of your personal information as described herein and in accordance with the data protection laws of the countries in which have facilities or in which we engage service providers, which may be different and may be less protective than those in your country.
 VII.
PERSONAL INFORMATION TRANSFERRED FROM THE EA, THE UK OR SWITZERLAND TO THE UNITED STATES  ManyChat operates in countries outside the EEA, the UK, and Switzerland, such as in the United States of America and the Russian Federation and may utilize data processors and sub-processors located in third countries.
If you are located in the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, this means that we may transfer personal information outside of your country.
Such transfers are made using appropriate safeguards and supplementary measures, such as the EU Standard Contractual Clauses for Controller-to-Controller and Controller-to-Processor Transfers (âSafeguardsâ).
If you would wish to view such Safeguards, contact us at support@manychat.com.

In the event that we confirm that we have collected personal information from someone under the age of 16 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information promptly.
If you are a parent or legal guardian of a child under 16 and believe that we might have any information from or about such child, please contact us.

Safeguarding Your Information

 We take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect personal information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the personal information.
Despite these efforts to store personal information collected on and through the Site and/or the Services and otherwise by us in a secure operating environment that is not available to the public, we cannot guarantee the security of personal information during its transmission or its storage on our systems.
Further, while we attempt to ensure the integrity and security of personal information, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-parties such as so-called hackers from illegally obtaining access to personal information.
We do not warrant or represent that personal information about you will be protected against, loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties.

 Our credit card processing vendor uses security measures to protect your information both during the transaction and after it is complete.
If you have any questions about the security of your Personal Information, you may contact us by email at support@manychat.com with the subject line âquestions about privacy policyâ.
 LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION (EEA VISITORS/CUSTOMERS ONLY)  If you are a person located in the European Economic Area, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
We will normally collect personal information from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate business interests.
In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you.

 If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to enter into a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).
Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate business interests, we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate business interests are.

 If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the âHow To Contact Usâ heading below.
