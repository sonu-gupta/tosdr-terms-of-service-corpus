Change your password in 'Settings' -&gt.
'Login' -&gt.
'Password'.
Update your recovery code in 'Settings' -&gt.
'Login' -&gt.
'Recovery code'.

If the attacker had been logged in as well, changing the password automatically logs him out.
We encourage you to always use 2FA with your accounts as it makes it close to impossible for an attacker to log into your account.
If you can not log into your account any more, please check this FAQ.
Where can I view my recovery code?Go to Settings - Login and click on the pen symbol next to 'Recovery Code' to show the code or update it.
To do this, you need to enter your password.
Can we integrate Tutanota into our own product?The Tutanota clients use REST services but there is no public documentation for that API or for a library, yet.
Keep in mind that when user data is stored in or read from Tutanota, it has to be encrypted/decrypted on the client.
You may of course dig into the open source code of Tutanota and integrate with your product, but at this time we can not provide any support for this.
We will add a public API documentation in the future.
Tutanota terms: What is an account? What is a user?user

Your Tutanota PasswordTutanota secures my private key with my password.
Can you access my password?recovery
 reset
 password
No.
When a password is used for authentication (login), it is not necessary that it is known to the server you want to authenticate with.
The server only needs a fingerprint (hash) of your password.
With Tutanota your hash for authentication is calculated by your browser and only the hash is being sent.
Your password never travels the Internet in plain text and it is never seen by our server.
As hashes are non-invertible, the server is unable to reconstruct your password from the hash.
The server is not able to decrypt your message, but still able to log you in.
Recommended for further reading: Learn how Tutanota automates the encryption process while leaving you in full control of your encrypted data.
What hashing function is used for the password?Your password is salted and hashed with Bcrypt on your device before being transmitted to Tutanota.
Bcrypt is the most reliable method because brute-force attacks need much more time in comparison to conventional methods such as MD5 or SHA.ï»¿ With this method we guarantee an integrated confidentiality and we allow you to access and decrypt your emails from desktops and mobile devices instantly.
How do I choose a strong password?Tutanota uses a password strength indicator that takes several aspects of a password into consideration to make sure your chosen password is a perfect match for your secure email account.
You can find additional tips on how to choose a strong password here.
Tutanota has no limitations in regard to the password length or used characters.
all unicode characters are respected.
Does Tutanota support two-factor authentication (2FA)?Yes, Tutanota supports two-factor authentication with U2F and TOTP.
Here are details on how to set up your second factor in Tutanota.
When I log out of Tutanota, the browser or app always logs in again.
What can I do to stop this?If you click on 'Logout', you log out.
Please note: If you have previously saved the password, you are now logged out, but the password is still saved for automatic login.
To 'unsave' the password, please log out.
The login screen appears, click on 'More' and 'Delete credentials'.
Security and PrivacyWhere does the encryption process take place?Encryption and decryption of data always happens locally on your device upon login.
All data is end-to-end encrypted and only you can access the data with your password.ï»¿
What is encrypted and what can you read?encryption
Tutanota encrypts all data stored in your mailbox (contacts, emails, email signature, inbox rules, invoice data, payment method, certificate and private keys of your own domains).
When sending an email, Tutanota encrypts subject, content and attachments automatically.


You can find a detailed explanation about what is encrypted in Tutanota on our encrypted email page.

We can read only the following metadata: 

sender email address
recipient email address
date of the email

We are looking into possibilities to hide the metadata in the future as well.ï»¿
Where are my keys generated and how is my private key secured?Your private and your public keys are generated locally within your browser upon registration.
Your private key is encrypted with your password.
This way your login password receives the status of the private key.
The key is encrypted so strong that only you can use the key for encrypting and decrypting data.
This is why a strong password is essential.
An automatic password check on the client makes sure that you use a strong password.
Your password is never transmitted to the server in plain text.
It is salted and then hashed with bcrypt locally on your device so that neither the server nor we have access to your password.
With this innovative design you can access your encrypted inbox from any device (desktop, mobile) easily.ï»¿
What encryption algorithms does Tutanota use?For the email encryption between users, Tutanota uses a standardized, hybrid method consisting of a symmetrical and an asymmetrical algorithm.
Tutanota uses AES with a length of 128 bit and RSA with 2048 bit.
Emails to external recipients are encrypted symmetrically with AES 128 bit.ï»¿
How are my emails encrypted with Tutanota?The system automatically encrypts all emails stored in Tutanota.
Emails between Tutanota users are automatically encrypted end-to-end, emails to external users can be secured with the help of a password.
Here we explain the differences between a confidential (end-to-end encrypted) and a non-confidential email.
Independent of the end-to-end encryption, the transport between client and Tutanota servers is secured with TLS to maximize security.
Where are the Tutanota servers located?The Tutanota servers are located in secure and ISO27001 certified data centers in Germany.
All saved data are subject to the strict German privacy protection laws.
Independent of that all data is end-to-end encrypted and cannot be read by the Tutao GmbH as the provider or by any third party.ï»¿
Does Tutanota log IP addresses or can I use my encrypted mailbox anonymously?By default, we do not log IP addresses when you log in or when you send an email.
The IP addresses of sent and received emails are stripped so that your location remains unknown.

We only log IP addresses of individual accounts in case of serious criminal acts such as murder, child pornography, robbery, bomb threats and blackmail after being served a valid court order by a German judge.
You can find details on this as well as on German data protection rights on our blog.
Learn on our blog how Tutanota fights illegal mass surveillance by providing an anonymous email service.
Upon registration you do not need to provide any personal data (e.g.
no phone number required).
We will also make it possible to pay for Tutanota with Bitcoin.
Is my address book within Tutanota encrypted?Yes, all data within Tutanota is end-to-end encrypted and only accessible with your password.
Scanning and profiling of your data is not possible.ï»¿
Can I disable sessions remotely (session handling)?ip address
 log
 logging
 security
Yes.
You can view and remotely close active sessions under Settings -&gt.
Login.
Check our How-to to learn how to enable storing of closed sessions to monitor whether someone else has access to your account.
To guarantee the users' privacy, we have implemented the feature as follows:

The IP address is stored encrypted, and only the user can decrypt this information.
No one else - not even we at Tutanota - can access this information.
IP addresses are only stored for one week and then automatically deleted.

Do you delete inactive accounts / recycle email addresses?Your deleted email address (also if it is an alias) will not be recycled for security reasons.
There must be no possibility that someone else is able to register your previously used email address, and then, by accident, receive a confidential email that was meant for you.
Free of charge accounts are deleted after an inactive period of six months.
A regular login is necessary to prevent automatic deletion.
We delete such accounts for security reasons and also to allow us offering free of charge Tutanota accounts at all.
However, the email addresses of such deleted accounts may be taken over into another paid account and re-used as email alias or additional user address if you still have the valid login credentials.
To do so, please try to login to your lost account.
Then click on 'Help'.
There you need to enter the target address (and - if you enabled two-factor-authentication - the recovery code of the lost address).
You can create the target address (any paid Tutanota account) in a separate browser simultaneously.
Then you can add the lost address as an alias (or user) to the target email account.
We call it merging of addresses.
How can I view headers in my encrypted mailbox?You can show headers of received emails by pressing the shortcut H.
Tutanota strips headers from emails sent to protect your privacy.
To show all shortcuts in Tutanota, please press F1 (Fn &amp.
F1).
Why is automatic image loading blocked in Tutanota?Tutanota does not load pictures automatically when you open an email.
When you load external images manually, please note that

someone knows that you read the email.
someone may add cookies to your browser (if your browser is not configured to reject them).
someone may track your location with your IP address.
someone may track parameters of your device.

Here we explain how to display external images.
Please read here how we make sure that you can use Tutanota as an anonymous email service.
We plan to improve image loading in the future so that you can whitelist trusted senders.
images in emails from these senders are then loaded by default.
One of my emails is displaying a phishing warning.
What does it mean?Phishing is a name or type of online scam in which criminals try to look like a legitimate sender in order to get your data such as credentials or credit card data.
Phishers use very sophisticated psychological techniques and develop very realistic copies of real websites and emails.
If you see a phishing banner, it means that some parts of this email match our phishing signatures after other users reported similar emails as phishing.
Please be extremely careful with such messages.
Usually phishing emails contain a special link to the website which looks real but it actually is not.
If you think that the email is legitimate and you opened the link, please make sure to check the full website URL: Check that you see all of it, sometimes only one part or one character may be swapped.
Here is more information on how to prevent email phishing attacks.
You can mark an email as not phishing so you will not see the warning message any more for this email.
We never send you emails with links where you need to type in your password.
We encourage you to always protect your login credentials with 2FA as this makes it close to impossible for an attacker to log into your account.
If you already fell for a phishing attack, please check this FAQ.
One of my emails has a warning saying mail authentication is missing or failed.
What does it mean?We require all messages to be authenticated.
Without authentication, the email could be coming from anyone or could be modified so you should always treat such emails with scrutiny.
If you see a message where the authentication has failed (red warning banner), you should be especially careful as it means that this email was likely faked.
App, client, instructionsDoes Tutanota offer full-text search?Yes, Tutanota comes with full-text search of your encrypted mailbox.
In the free version, search is limited to four weeks into the past due to heavy server load caused by the encrypted search feature.
Learn here how you can improve your search results.
The spam folder is excluded from search.
Search is executed locally via an encrypted search index to guarantee security and privacy of your data as well as your search queries.
As the search index needs to be stored in your browser, it does not work in private mode/incognito mode.
Read here how our innovative full-text search on encrypted data works.
Where do I find the Settings?Settings
The Settings are in the navigation menu to the left.
Where can I request a new feature for Tutanota?You can request and discuss new features with us and other users in our Reddit community.
You can check whether someone has already requested this feature and whether we have already added it to our Roadmap.
How can I change the language in Tutanota?The language in Tutanota is taken automatically from your browser or system settings.
Please change the language there.
Alternatively, you can go to 'Settings' -&gt.
'Appearance' to switch the displayed language for Tutanota.
We also invite you to join our translation project to improve Tutanota in your native language!
Where can I get the Tutanota app?You can download the Tutanota app from the following stores:

iOS app store
Google Play store
F-Droid

In addition to that, you can also directly download and install the APK for Android.
Keep in mind that you will not get updates automatically if you ï»¿install the app manually instead of using an app store.
You can add our blog to your RSS-reader with this link to get notified about updates: RSS-Feed
How can I zoom in the Tutanota app?In the apps, you can zoom with a double tap.
We plan to improve this behavior further.
Push notifications on my Android phone are being delayed.
What can I do?Please check the app settings on your phone.
As we do not use Google's push notifications service, battery optimization must be disabled for Tutanota to receive push notifications instantly.
This is necessary to offer you an open source email service free from any links to Google.
My Tutanota app on Android was disabled, but I don't see a new version on F-Droid.
What can I do?You need to update your F-Droid repository to see the newest version of the Tutanota Android app.
Why does the Tutanota app ask me to update WebView?
WebView is a system app on Android devices which allows us to display web content inside the Tutanota app.
Newer versions let us use newer technologies to make the app smaller, faster, more beautiful and more reliable.
If you experiencing issues or bugs with the Android app, updating WebView has a good chance to help.
Here are instructions how to update WebView on your phone.
How can I use Tutanota with multiple users at the same time?In the mobile app, you can currently only login with one user.
To switch to another user, you must log out and log in again.
You can login with multiple users in the browser by opening several tabs or windows.
In the desktop clients, you can also open several windows to login with multiple users.
Where can I get the Tutanota desktop client?You can download the Tutanota desktop clients (Windows, Linux, Mac OS) on our homepage.
Please find lots of details on how to get started with the desktop clients in our How-to (install, uninstall, default mailto app, run in background).
Is it possible to merge several Tutanota email addresses in one account?address
 multiple
 several
 merge
Yes, you can add existing email addresses (e.g.
Alice2, Alice3) as aliases to a paid account (Alice1).
Before you can add the aliases, you need to delete the other accounts (Alice2, Alice3) and specify the paid account (Alice1) as the take over account upon deletion.
We explain here how to take over the email addresses.
Please note: You are only transferring the email addresses.
Emails and contacts stored in the deleted accounts (Alice2, Alice3) are being deleted.
Please export important emails before deleting the accounts.
Is there a dark theme in Tutanota?Yes.
Before logging in, click on 'More' and 'Switch color theme' to switch to the dark theme.
This works in all Tutanota clients (web, desktop, apps).
Alternatively, you can go to 'Settings' -&gt.
'Appearance' to switch to the dark theme.
To add a custom theme, you need to book whitelabel.
How do I use Tutanota?How to
 How-to
 settings
 instructions
 help
 support
Tutanota is very easy to use.
From the start we focused on usability and kept the encryption process in the background.
You do not have to install anything or worry about key handling.
Tutanota is as easy to use as Gmail or any other webmail service.ï»¿
You can start with Tutanota right away.
If any questions remain, check our detailed how-to.
This describes all Settings of Tutanota.
It also answers common usability questions such as:
How to send an encrypted email?How to switch to not confidential?How are contacts sorted?How to add / rename / delete a folder?How to use multi-select and shortcuts?How to upgrade to Premium?How to set up an alias?How to send an email from an alias?How to manage passwords for my Premium users?How to send emails with my own domain?How to add an encrypted contact form to my website?How to delete an account?
Why does Tutanota not use PGP?Current encryption standards like PGP and S/MIME have several issues that we plan to address with Tutanota.
These standards do not support forward secrecy and are not resistant to attacks from quantum computers.

In addition, it is important to us that the subject line in emails is also encrypted.
That's why we have developed a solution that is also based on recognized algorithms (RSA and AES) and that automatically encrypts the subject, the content and the attachments.
In the future, we plan to upgrade these algorithms to quantum-resistant ones that also support forward secrecy.
You can find more information on why Tutanota does not use PGP here.
We also see the importance that Tutanota needs to be interoperable with other encryption solutions.
We will develop an API so that Tutanota users can communicate with users of other secure services confidentially in the future.
What browsers does Tutanota support? Via what browsers can external recipients check their encrypted emails?Tutanota supports the current version of the following browsers:


Firefox (desktop)


Opera (desktop, Android)


Chrome (desktop, Android)


Safari from version 11.0 (desktop, iOS)


Microsoft Edge (desktop)
Tutanota also works in Internet Explorer 11, but this browser is not officially supported.


The development goes on.
What comes next?roadmap
Please have a look here and here.
What is the maximum size for emails and attachments?The size of emails with attachments sent via Tutanota is limited to 25 MB at the moment.ï»¿
Can I retrieve my Tutanota emails via IMAP to another email client?gmail
 outlook
 yahoo
 thunderbird
 redirect
This is not possible as we could not guarantee end-to-end encryption for your data.ï»¿ Instead Tutanota offers email desktop clients for Linux, Mac OS and Windows as well as a web client and apps for Android and iOS.
As an external recipient, can I re-access my emails later?Yes, you can always access the emails sent via Tutanota through the link from your latest notification email.
Old notification links from the same sender are de-activated for security reasons.
Your exchanged password, however, stays unchanged as long as the sender does not change it.
If you have saved the password upon accessing your confidential emails in your browser, you do not have to re-enter it.ï»¿
Are emails to other Tutanota users always encrypted?Yes, when sending emails from Tutanota to Tutanota, all emails are encrypted automatically end-to-end on your device.ï»¿ You do not have to enter any passwords.
Can Tutanota encrypt emails to other email services (external recipients)?Yes.
Tutanota uses a preshared password for sending an encrypted message to an external recipient, i.e.
to someone who does not use Tutanota.
Please check our how-to to learn how to send encrypted emails to external recipients.
Here we explain how to switch the default so that emails to external recipients are sent not encrypted and without a password.
What are the benefits of adding another user to my account?If you add another user to your account (family member, partner, team member etc.), you get the following benefits:

Share alias packages,
Share storage packages,
Use the same admin settings such as Spam rules and custom domains,
Reset passwords or second login factors for each other (admin status required).

Here are more details on user management.
If you do not need these sharing options, you can also upgrade accounts individually.
Please check our pricing calculator for details. 
Furthermore, we have recently added a sharing feature for the encrypted calendar which we will extend in the future.
Sharing of entire calendars only works with other paid Tutanota accounts.
Can I add alias email addresses to Tutanota?
alias
 user
Email aliases are additional email addresses that you can use with the same mailbox without having to switch accounts.
Aliases are included in al paid plans of Tutanota.
If you upgrade to Premium (â¬1 per month), you can add up to 5 aliases.
Find out more about Tutanota aliases in our How-to (create alias, change default sender, etc.).
Learn here what the purpose of an email alias compared to a user is and how aliases can increase your security.

Once upgraded, you can add as many domains as you like.

Are there email limits to protect Tutanota from being abused by spammers?Yes, Tutanota uses different variables to calculate email limits for individual accounts.
This is necessary to protect our free and anonymous email service from spammers who try to abuse Tutanota.

If you receive the following message in your Tutanota account "It looks like you exceeded the number of allowed emails.
Please try again later.", the anti-spam protection method has stopped your account temporarily from sending new emails.
Please wait a day or two to send new emails again.
If you need to send more emails immediately, please upgrade to our affordable Premium version (1 Euro per month) as limits for paying users are much higher.
Simply click on 'Premium' in your side menu bar of Tutanota.

My newly created account has been put on hold for 48 hours after registration.

This often affects IPs from VPN services or Tor as spammers try to bypass our anti-spam protection method by abusing these services.
Please read here why the 48-hour wait is necessary to protect your privacy to the maximum with a truly anonymous email service.
During these 48 hours emails cannot be sent or received.
Please do not share your new email address before the blocking has been lifted automatically.

I don't receive confirmation emails from services or newsletters.
What can I do?Please check whether the sender was blocked by following this instruction.
Sometimes newly created email addresses are put on hold for 48 hours to prevent abuse.
It is important that you do not share your email address until this block is lifted automatically.

This might lead to problems registering with this service, even in the future.
