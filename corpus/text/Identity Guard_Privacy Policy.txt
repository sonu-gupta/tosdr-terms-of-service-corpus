Our websites, for example, may use first and third party cookies.
Cookies are small bits of computer code that we or third parties with whom we have a relationship may install on your computer when it accesses our websites.

Cookies make your visit to our websites and mobile applications easier and more convenient.
We may use cookies for purposes such as to authenticate users, provide tailored content, to facilitate the display of advertisements, or to determine whether a visitor is unique or has viewed our site before.
While most browsers are set to accept cookies by default, Web browsers typically also have features that permit you to refuse cookies or to alert you before accepting them.
Your browser manufacturer has information on changing the default setting for your specific browser.
Please understand that if you refuse to accept cookies from our websites, you may not be able to use some portions of our websites or our services.
Our websites and mobile applications also may use various technologies to collect information when someone visits our websites or uses our mobile applications.
For example, as you browse one of our websites we may collect information about your visit, but not identifiers such as your name, phone number or e-mail address.
Via Web server logs, for example, we may monitor statistics such as: the number of people that visit our site, the date and time of the visit, geographic location information about the visitor, which page(s) are visited on our site, from which domain our visitors come (e.g., aol.com, hotmail.com, etc.), and the type of Internet browsers people use to visit our site (e.g., Microsoft Internet Explorer, Safari (for Apple Computers), Mozilla Firefox, etc.).
We also may use tools that allow us to monitor which links visitors are using, what content on our site is being viewed, or how a visitor is accessing content through our site.
We also may use outsourcing programs, such as Google Analytics, to assist us in analyzing data to better understand traffic to our websites, to tailor our websites and for advertising purposes.
If you would like to opt-out of Google Analytics, please click here for additional information and instructions from Google about how to do so.
Another one of our service providers is Adobe Marketing Cloud, which collects and uses personal information about our customers in order to help us deliver personalized marketing content.
You can opt-out of the collection and use of such information by Adobe by clicking here. 
We may use Google and other third-party advertising companies and advertising networks to serve ads and collect information when you visit our websites.
These companies may use information (not including your name, phone number or email address) about your visits to this and other websites over time in order to provide advertisements on this and other websites about goods and services that may be of interest to you.
With Google, for example, we use several Google offerings, including Display Advertising, Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting as part of our online advertising efforts.

In addition to the Google Analytics opt-out described in the preceding paragraph, Google also has a mechanism that allows individuals to customize their advertising preferences.
For more information, please click here.
We may also utilize other third party online advertising technologies for these purposes, such as Bing, Taboola, Outbrain, Facebook and Quora. 
This information often is aggregate data or individual information that is tied to a browser or device rather than specific identifiers such as the visitorâs name and address.
however, some of this information might be considered to be personally identifiable under some federal or state laws.

These may collect information such as whether you are a returning visitor, without collecting personally identifying information such as your name.
We also may use such technologies&nbsp.
to record images of activity on public pages of our website(s), such as mouse scrolls, clicks and/or keystrokes.
We do not, however, record images using Heap or similar technologies inside the member center.
