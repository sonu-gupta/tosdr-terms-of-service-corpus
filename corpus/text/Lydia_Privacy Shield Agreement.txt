If you are a resident of the European Union and are dissatisfied with the manner in which we have addressed your concerns about our privacy practices, you may seek further assistance, at no cost to you, from our designated Privacy Shield independent recourse mechanism:
American Arbitration Association/International Centre for Dispute Resolution
Residents of the European Union or Switzerland may elect to arbitrate unresolved complaints.&nbsp.
However, prior to initiating such arbitration, you must: (1) contact Get Real Health and afford us the opportunity to resolve the issue.
(2) seek assistance from Get Real Healthâs designated independent recourse mechanism above.
and (3) contact the U.S.
Department of Commerce (either directly or through a European Data Protection Authority or the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner) and afford the Department of Commerce time to attempt to resolve the issue.
Each party shall be responsible for its own attorneyâs fees.
Please be advised that, pursuant to the Privacy Shield, the arbitrator(s) may only impose individual-specific, non-monetary, equitable relief necessary to remedy any violation of the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to the individual.
Get Real Health is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S.
