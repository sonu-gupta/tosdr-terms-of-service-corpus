         Privacy Policy

Let's keep this simple:



Your email will only be used for account notifications,
we don't spam or sell email addresses.


All the apps in our directory are user-requested and useful.
We do not list
malware or other shady apps.


We install apps like you would: with default settings and
we say "no" to all browser toolbars and other junk.


Some apps are tagged with a Ninite affiliate key.
Ninite receives a
commission when users upgrade those apps.


After installing apps non-identifying diagnostic information (OS version, language, machine architecture, failure status of installers) is reported back to Ninite so we can improve reliability.


Ninite Pro uses a meaningless hash of the first MAC address on a machine to count unique machines where a Pro account is used.
This is transmitted when Ninite gets the latest app configurations from our server.


All we do is install the apps you choose.
With our free version or Ninite Pro Classic not even Ninite is installed.


And, of course, we do not include any form of malware or spyware.



Please send us an email
if you have further questions.
