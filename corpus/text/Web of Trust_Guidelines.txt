 Follow Web of Trust (WOT) is a worldwide community of millions of users who are dedicated to building a safer and more trustworthy web.
These guidelines will help you get the best out of working together with the community.

Be tolerant with others' opinions. WOT is a multicultural community where religions, politics and world views may vary.
Please keep this in mind when rating, commenting, and interacting with other users and site owners.

Be respectful. Treat others in a civil manner and use proper language when interacting with others.
Please do not post anything unlawful, defamatory, offensive, insulting, profane or vulgar.

Be truthful. Ratings and comments must represent your own opinion and/or experience of a website.
Try to be as objective as possible and avoid rating sites based on generalization.
Provide evidence to support your rating when possible.
Please identify yourself as the owner of a website or working for a company owning a site if you are commenting on it.

Remember your responsibility. Every member is responsible for their own ratings and comments.
Ratings can especially affect small businesses and in some cases, peopleâs lives, so try to be reasonable and do not give a rating without a good reason.
Comments that are given without basis can also have legal consequences, depending on your countryâs laws.

Language of communication. The preferred language on the forum is English, unless otherwise indicated in a subforum.
While posting comments on the scorecards, feel free to use English or the same language as the site is available in.
However, if you wish to contact WOT, please use English in your messages.

Be responsive. Site owners are given an option to claim their site, contact users directly through their user boards, and post an evaluation request on the forum if they want their site's reputation to be evaluated.
Please be responsive to site owners' requests and help us keep the reputations up to date and accurate by reviewing your ratings and comments to make sure they are still in accordance with your current opinion.

Zero tolerance for manipulation. WOT does not tolerate manipulation and a user account can be banned without prior notice if such behavior is detected.
This includes creating more than one user account, accepting compensation for ratings, paying people to rate sites, or using other unethical ways to manipulate ratings.

Third-party sources. If your rating is based on a blacklist - state the source with a link and day you found it. Best practices for commenting


Comments should be descriptive and give at least one reason.
âGood siteâ is not a good comment.


Scorecard comments are not a place to share general opinions about a topic, and should be strictly about your own experience with the website.


Do not post links to competitors or similar websites in your comment.


Keep your comments brief and to the point.


Try not to recycle the same comments for multiple websites, as each should describe the commented site as well as possible.
