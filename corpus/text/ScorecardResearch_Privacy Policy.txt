The personal information collected from you may include online identifiers (e.g., IP address) and Internet or other electronic network activity including information about your browsing history, operating system, browser type, website preferences, your use of our Website (e.g., time accessed, duration of visit, etc.).
We generally use this information in statistical and aggregate formats to assess the effectiveness of our Website and to better understand your priorities and interests.

Information collected using ScorecardResearch cookies or similar technologies ("Tags").

ScorecardResearch Tags collect the following information:

Publishers use the ScorecardResearch Tags by deploying the tags on their websites, in the advertisements served on their websites or other websites or incorporating similar technology into their applications.
These ScorecardResearch Tags send a message to the ScorecardResearch service that causes a ScorecardResearch cookie to be set or an online identifier to be collected along with information related to the usage of the services provided by the Publisher.

Interest-based advertising and market research

What is interest-based advertising?

Interest-based advertising, also known as Online Behavioral Advertising, allows advertisers to display ads tailored to your individual interests based on how you browse and shop online, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as ad delivery, reporting, attribution, analytics, and market research.
We may use third parties and service providers, as discussed in the What information is collected and why section, to collect information for interest-based advertising.
This process may involve third parties and services providers using tagging technology, such as a cookie, on your device.
These tags may collect data about your Web browsing over time and across digital properties, including information about the possible relationships among different browsers and devices.
We adhere to the Digital Advertising Alliance (âDAAâ) Self-Regulatory Principles in connection to all interest-based advertising activities.
The information collected from ScorecardResearch Tags is used for interest-based advertising purposes, where appropriate.
Please note interest-based advertising services based on information collected by ScorecardResearch are not provided in the European Union ("EU").

How do I manage my preferences for interest-based advertising?

You may visit www.aboutads.info/choices to learn more about interest-based advertising, to opt out of our collection and transfer of Web browsing information for interest-based advertising purposes, and to opt out of the collection and use of information for this purpose by other companies that participate in industry self-regulation.
To opt out of our collection and transfer of application usage information for third parties to use for their own interest-based advertising purposes, you can use any controls that are provided for this purpose by the operating system on your mobile device.
Please note that opting out will not stop advertising from appearing in your browser or in the applications you use.
It may make the ads you see less relevant to your interests.
You may also continue to receive interest-based advertising from other companies.

What is market research?

Market research is an organized effort to gather information about markets and customers.
With the use of ScorecardResearch Tags and surveys, Comscoreâs market research group collects and analyzes information to provide products and services to companies around the world.
This information helps companies better understand and meet the needs of consumers.

How do I manage my preferences for market research?

To control your level of participation in our market research programs or opt out, click here.
By opting out of our market research program, ScorecardResearch Tags will only be able to count your visit to a particular site but not identify your device beyond that count.
Additionally, if your mobile device platform offers settings to limit data collection for interest-based advertising, you can use these settings to opt out of participating in our market research programs.
For example, your device may "Limit Ad Tracking."

What does opting out of market research on your browser do?

The browser opt-out mechanisms linked above are cookie based (i.e., a cookie must be on your computer to tell our systems that you have opted out).
The cookie-based method does not prevent us from identifying certain events (e.g., when a user visits a website).
The method, however, prevents us from associating that event with your browser or otherwise identifying you beyond us merely counting your visit.
If you delete, block, or otherwise restrict cookies, this opt-out may not be effective.
Additionally, because different computers and different Internet browsers require their own version of the opt-out cookie, you may need to perform this opt-out process on any computers and browsers that you want to be opted-out.
