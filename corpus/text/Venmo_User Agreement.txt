AgreementLast updatedThis user agreement will be effective on November 11, 2020.
Welcome to Venmo!
This user agreement is a contract between you and PayPal, Inc.
governing your use of your Venmo account and the Venmo services.
You must be in the United States and have a U.S.
bank account to use the Venmo services.
You agree to comply with all of the terms and conditions in this user agreement.
The terms include an agreement to resolve disputes by arbitration on an individual basis.
You also agree to comply with the following additional policies and each of the other agreements posted on venmo.com/legal that apply to you:


Privacy Policy


Acceptable Use Policy


Consent to Receive Electronic Disclosures (E-Sign Disclosure and Consent)


We may revise this user agreement and any of the policies listed above from time to time.
The revised version will be effective at the time we post it, unless otherwise noted.
If our changes reduce your rights or increase your responsibilities we will provide notice to you of at least 21 days.
We reserve the right to amend this agreement at any time without notice, subject to applicable law.
By continuing to use our services after any changes to this user agreement become effective, you agree to abide and be bound by those changes.
If you do not agree with any changes to this user agreement, you may close your account.Opening a Venmo AccountWe offer accounts for two types of purposes: personal accounts and approved business accounts.
You may only have one personal account.
To create a personal account, you must be a resident of the United States or one of its territories, be at least 18 years old or the age of majority in your state of residence and use a cellular/wireless telephone number that you own.
Your Venmo account is a personal account unless you have received our express written approval to open a business account.
In addition to this agreement, approved business accounts are also subject to the Approved Business Account Addendum.
Personal Venmo accounts let you do things like:


Make payments with friends.


Buy things through an authorized merchantâs mobile website, app, or Venmo business profile.


We may also offer you the ability to set up a business profile within your personal Venmo account, which you can use to receive payments for the sale of goods and services.
This feature is offered in our sole discretion and may not be available to all users.
Except for commercial transactions expressly authorized by Venmo, for example, transactions with authorized merchants or business profiles, or purchases made using your Venmo MastercardÂ®, personal accounts may not be used to conduct business, commercial or merchant transactions with other personal accounts, which includes paying or accepting payment from other personal accounts held by users you do not personally know for goods or services (for example, concert tickets, electronic equipment, sneakers, a watch, or other merchandise). If you plan to use your Venmo account to sell goods or services, you must have an approved business account or a business profile.
You may also find out more information about offering Venmo as a payment option on your website or mobile app by visiting this webpage.
Keep confidential any credentials you use to access your Venmo account and the Venmo services.
You must keep your phone number, email address and other contact information current in your Venmo account profile.
Setting up a Business Profile
Venmo may offer you the ability to create a single business profile in addition to your personal profile in your personal Venmo account.
To be eligible, you must be an individual with a Venmo account in good standing and complete any required application process, including verification of the required identifying information.
Using a business profile, you can receive payments for the sale of goods and services that do not violate the Acceptable Use Policy or any other terms between you and us.
As a business profile is part of your Venmo account, any and all terms applicable to your Venmo account will also govern the business profile, unless otherwise specifically stated.
We may restrict the use of your business profile and your Venmo account if the activity through your business profile reaches certain thresholds, involves certain activities or violates any terms between you and us.
In addition, if your business profile meets certain transaction thresholds, we may require you to provide additional information and documentation to us from time to time for tax reporting or other reasons (for example, to verify your business activities or resolve claims or disputes), and we may suspend or place limits on your account until we receive the requested information and documentation.
Venmo Debit Card transactions cannot be funded by any funds held in your business profile, and instead can only be funded by funds held in your personal profile.
The information you use to complete your business profile must be accurate, and any descriptions, pictures or other content associated with your profile must be owned by you and comply with the Content Standards below.Closing Your Venmo AccountYou may close your account and terminate your relationship with us without cost, but you will remain liable for all obligations related to your Venmo account even after the Venmo account is closed.
Any incomplete transactions or transfers must be completed or canceled and you must transfer any money from any personal or business profiles of your Venmo account before closing it.
In certain cases, you may not close your Venmo account, including:


To evade an investigation.


If you have a pending transaction or an open dispute or claim.


If you owe amounts to us.


If your Venmo account is subject to a hold, limitation or reserve.


If you have a Venmo Credit Card, until such time that account is both closed and paid in full.


If your Venmo account is closed for any reason, any business profile and any Venmo Debit Card affiliated with your account will be canceled.Link or Unlink a Payment MethodYou can link or unlink certain payment methods such as a debit card, credit card, or a U.S.
bank account to your Venmo account.
Please keep your payment method information current (e.g.
credit card number and expiration date).
If this information changes, we may update it using information and third party sources available to us without any action on your part.
If you do not want us to update your card information, you may contact your issuer to request this or remove your payment method from your Venmo account.Money Sent to You on VenmoTo hold a Venmo balance and use money sent to you for Venmo payments to other users or authorized merchants, we must verify the required identifying information you provide to us. The required identifying information is:


For a personal account or a business profile of an unincorporated business/sole proprietorship: name, physical address, date of birth, and social security or taxpayer identification number.
or


For a business profile of any other type of business legal entity: business name, business address, taxpayer identification number, and proof of business existence.


Unless you add funds to your Venmo account using Direct Deposit, any money sent to you on Venmo represents an unsecured claim against us and is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).
We combine your money with the Venmo money of other Venmo users and hold it in a custodial account for the benefit of our account holders.
With the exception of funds in accounts that have used Direct Deposit, we invest the money in liquid investments in accordance with state money transmitter laws.
We own the interest or other earnings on these investments.
However, the claim against us represented by this money is not secured by these investments and you do not have any ownership interest (either legal or beneficial) in these investments.
These pooled amounts are held apart from our corporate funds, and we will neither use these amounts for our operating expenses or any other corporate purposes nor will we voluntarily make these amounts available to our creditors in the event of bankruptcy.Adding Money to and Transferring Money out of Your Venmo AccountAdding money
If we have verified the required identifying information that you provide to us, Venmo may offer you the ability to add money to your Venmo balance from a linked bank account or through Direct Deposit.
Otherwise, you cannot add money.
Remember, you may use the payment methods linked to your Venmo account to fund transactions and you donât need a Venmo balance to send money or buy something using your Venmo account.
Transferring money out of Venmo
Money in your Venmo account may be transferred out of Venmo by:


Manually transferring it to a bank account linked to your Venmo account, or


Transferring it via Instant Transfer to an eligible debit card or bank account linked to your Venmo account, subject to the fees applicable to such transfers that can be found on the Fees page.


You can manage linked payment methods in the Payment Methods section of your Venmo account settings.
We may set limits on your bank transfers, and you can view bank transfer limits on the Bank Transfer Limits page.
The fees applicable to transferring money out of Venmo can be found on the Fees page.
Fees and limits may change from time to time in our sole discretion.
Bank transfer reviews
We review account and transaction activity at various times, including when bank transfers are initiated.
This review checks for, among other things, suspicious or illegal activity, and whether your account activity and the activity of users with whom youâve transacted comply with this agreement.
In connection with our review process, you may be required to provide us with additional information and/or documentation to verify your identity.
We may limit your account and your access to money in it or that is sent to you until verification is completed.
Reviews may result in:


delayed, blocked or cancelled transfers;


money or payments being held by us;


money or payments being applied to amounts you owe to us or used to offset loss incurred by us;


account limitation, suspension or termination;


money or payments being seized to comply with a court order, warrant or other legal process.
and/or


money or payments you previously received being reversed (i.e., sent back to the sender or to the card or bank account that was used to fund the payment).


Among other reasons, we may take the above actions if you knowingly or unknowingly were a participant in a payment that was made from a stolen card, compromised bank account, or compromised Venmo account, or if you were a participant in a transaction for goods and services between two personal accounts.
VENMO SHOULD ONLY BE USED TO TRANSACT WITH PEOPLE YOU KNOW AND TRUST.
DO NOT USE VENMO TO TRANSACT WITH PEOPLE YOU DONâT KNOW, ESPECIALLY IF THE PAYMENT INVOLVES THE PURCHASE OR SALE OF A GOOD OR SERVICE.
UNLESS VENMO EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZES YOUR PAYMENT FOR A GOOD OR SERVICE, FOR EXAMPLE, TRANSACTIONS WITH AN AUTHORIZED MERCHANT OR BUSINESS PROFILE, OR TRANSACTIONS MADE WITH YOUR VENMO DEBIT CARD, PAYING OR RECEIVING PAYMENT FOR A GOOD OR A SERVICE IS PROHIBITED.
IF YOU USE VENMO TO CONDUCT SUCH A TRANSACTION AND WE LATER REVERSE THE PAYMENT (WHICH COULD OCCUR IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT THIS AGREEMENT WAS VIOLATED OR IF THE PAYMENT WAS MADE USING A COMPROMISED PAYMENT METHOD OR ACCOUNT), YOU COULD LOSE BOTH THE UNDERLYING GOODS OR SERVICES AND THE MONEY SENT FOR THEM.Direct Deposit and FDIC Pass-Through InsuranceDirect Deposit
If you are eligible for Direct Deposit and we have verified your required identifying information, you may arrange to have all or part of your paycheck or, where permitted by law, any federal or state government benefit or payment (e.g., Federal tax refunds or Social Security payment) transferred directly into your Venmo account by your employer or relevant government payer, as applicable (Direct Deposit).
We determine eligibility for Direct Deposit in our sole discretion.
If you are eligible for Direct Deposit, you will see the Direct Deposit feature in your Venmo app settings.â¯To enroll, you will need to provide your employer or the government payer, as applicable, with the account and routing numbers found in the Direct Deposit section available in the Venmo app or any alternate or additional form requested by your employer or government payer.
We do not charge any fees to set up or maintain Direct Deposit.

Direct Deposit and the earlier availability of the funds is subject to payerâs support of the feature and timing of payerâs funding.
Funds transferred via Direct Deposit generally will be available on the day the funds are applied to your account.
Because we do not receive funds via Direct Deposit instantly, there will be some delay between the payment being sent by your employer and the payment arriving to Venmo.
For example, Direct Deposit of funds may be delayed in the event of a federal or bank holiday.
You may review your periodic statements or transaction history on Venmo.com or call Customer Service to verify that each Direct Deposit has been received.
We reserve the right to accept, reject or limit transfers via Direct Deposit in our sole discretion.
If you wish to cancel Direct Deposits, you must contact your employer or government payer.
Please note that in order to assist in the prevention of fraud we require the following in connection with Direct Deposit:


In connection with tax refunds (i) the name and Social Security Number associated with each refund payment must match the name and social security number associated with your Venmo account.
and (ii) in the case of joint tax returns, the first name and Social Security Number associated with the refund payment must be the name and social security number of the Venmo account holder.


In connection with non-tax refunds (i) the name and Social Security Number associated with each payment must match the name or Social Security Number associated with your Venmo account.


FDIC Pass-Through insurance
When you add money to your Venmo balance using Direct Deposit, Venmo will deposit all funds held in your Venmo balance into one or more custodial accounts we maintain for the benefit of Venmo account holders at one or more FDIC member banks (currently Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.
or The Bancorp Bank), and the funds in your Venmo balance will be eligible to be insured by the FDIC up to the standard maximum deposit insurance amount (currently $250,000).
FDIC pass-through insurance helps protect you against the risk of loss of your funds should the FDIC-insured bank where we deposit your funds fail.
If one of the banks in which we have deposited your funds fails, your funds would be eligible to be insured by the FDIC up to the standard maximum deposit insurance amount (currently $250,000).
This limit applies per depositor and ownership capacity, not per account.
When determining your coverage limit, the FDIC will add the funds in your eligible Venmo account to amounts you hold in the same ownership capacity in other accounts at the same bank.
If funds are received in your Venmo account other than through Direct Deposit, there might be a delay between the time that funds are credited to your Venmo account and when we actually transfer those funds to one of the custodial bank accounts.
Your Venmo balance funds might not be eligible for the benefits of FDIC pass-through insurance coverage during this period, although we will still be holding the funds as your agent and custodian.
You will not receive interest or any other earnings on funds held in these custodial bank accounts and you agree that any interest that may be earned on funds in a custodial bank account are owned by Venmo.
FDIC pass-through insurance does not protect you against the risk of our insolvency.
We believe that, in the unlikely event of our insolvency, funds that we have on deposit in a custodial account for the benefit of our account holders should not be included in our bankruptcy estate and should be protected from claims by our creditors.
Additionally, even if funds in your Venmo balance (whether held by us or held in a custodial account) are eligible for FDIC pass-through insurance and may be protected from claims by our creditors in the unlikely event of our insolvency, it is possible that you will not have access to those funds while court or other legal proceedings to determine ownership of the funds are ongoing.Account StatementsYou have the right to receive an account statement showing your Venmo account activity.
You may view your Venmo account statement by logging into your Venmo account on the Venmo website.Making PaymentsYou can send money to or request money from a Venmo user using the compose payments feature in your Venmo account.
You can also request money from a Venmo user by splitting certain purchases.
Such user will have to accept any charge request before you are sent money.
When you accept a charge request sent by another Venmo user, you will send them money.

Making payments with friends
You can send money to or request money from a friend, even if they donât have a Venmo account at the time you send the payment, using their email address or mobile number.
If the friend does not have a Venmo account, they can claim the payment by opening a Venmo account.
If they donât claim any money sent within 30 days of the date it is sent, the payment will be cancelled and any money (including any fees you were charged) will be sent back to you.
Payments to a business profile
Payments for the sale of goods or services may only be sent to business profiles.
You may not send regularly recurring payments to a sellerâs business profile (for example, every month or otherwise on a routine billing cycle).
Certain qualifying payments made to a business profile are eligible for the Venmo Purchase Program.
Sellers must keep appropriate transaction documentation and we may request such information to investigate claims made under the Venmo Purchase Program.
If a seller does not provide adequate documentation, or we determine, in our sole discretion, that a claim qualifies for the Venmo Purchase Program, we may initiate a refund to the buyer by reversing the payment from the sellerâs business profile, as explained further in section Refunds for Transactions Through Business Profiles.
Taxes and information reporting for business profiles
Our fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, that may be assessed by any jurisdiction (collectively, âtaxesâ).
It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the payments you make or receive, including transactions through your business profile, and it is solely your responsibility to assess, collect, report and remit the correct taxes to the appropriate authority.
PayPal is not responsible for determining whether any taxes apply to your transaction, or for calculating, collecting, reporting or remitting taxes arising from any transaction.
You acknowledge that we may make certain reports to state and federal tax authorities regarding transactions that we process.
For example, PayPal is required to report to the Internal Revenue Service the total amount of payments for goods and services you receive each calendar year if you receive more than $20,000 in payments for goods and services and process more than 200 transactions involving goods or services in the same calendar year.
Fees and limits
We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount and/or the number of payments you can send and receive.
You can view any sending limit on our Payment Limits page.
These sending limits apply for all transactions combined in your account, including any transactions through your business profile.
The fees applicable to receiving, withdrawing and sending money can be found on the Fees page.
If you use your credit card as the payment method when sending money, you may also be charged a cash-advance fee by your card issuer.
In order to manage risk, we may limit the payment methods available when you make a payment.
Fees and limits may change from time to time in our sole discretion.Buying Something from Authorized MerchantsHow to buy something
An âauthorized merchantâ means a merchant that has been authorized by us to accept Venmo as a payment method for purchases of goods and services.
This includes, for example, buying something online using your mobile phone through an authorized merchantâs website or mobile app and selecting Venmo as your payment method at checkout, or buying something from a seller in-person by using a Venmo QR code.
Payments sent via the Venmo app or the Venmo website to another Venmo user do not qualify as payments to an authorized merchant.
Similarly, if you are charged via the Venmo app or the Venmo website and accept the charge, this is not a payment to an authorized merchant.
Except for transactions for goods and services that are expressly authorized by Venmo, for example, purchases from authorized merchants, business profiles and Venmo Debit Card purchases, you are not permitted to use Venmo as a payment method for purchases of goods and services.
Some merchants may require you to have a payment method linked to your Venmo account in order to use Venmo for purchases with the merchant.
In order to manage risk, we may limit the payment methods available for a transaction when you buy something from an authorized merchant.
When you authorize a payment to an authorized merchant, some merchants may take up to 30 days to complete the transaction.
In these instances, your payment may appear as a pending transaction in your Venmo account.
In that case, your authorization of the payment will remain valid until the merchant completes the transaction and we may place a temporary hold on the money in your Venmo account for the payment amount (but no longer than 30 days).
If you used a debit or credit card as the payment method, your debit or credit card issuer also may show a pending authorization for a period of time until they release the hold or receive a completed transaction.
If you use your Venmo account to pay for an item and you select your bank account as the funding source for the transaction, remember that your Venmo account is issued to you by PayPal, Inc.
and not your bank.
The terms, benefits, and protections associated with your Venmo account may vary from those that apply to your bank account.
If you use your Venmo account to make a purchase that exceeds the balance in your linked bank account, you could incur overdraft fees, even if you chose not to allow overdrafts with your bank.
Similarly, the liability limits applicable to your Venmo account may differ from those applicable to your bank account.
Fees and limits
We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount or the number of payments you can send, including money you send for authorized merchant purchases.
You can view any sending limit on our Payments Limits page.
Fees and limits may change from time to time in our sole discretion.
Payment review
We review payments you make at our discretion.
When we identify a potentially high-risk payment to an authorized merchant, we review the transaction more closely before allowing it to proceed.
When this happens, we will place a hold on the transaction and notify the merchant to delay shipping of the item.
As a buyer, this may delay your receipt of the item you purchased.
If we clear the transaction, we will notify the merchant and direct them to ship the item.
If we donât clear the transaction, we will cancel it and return the money to you, unless we are legally required to take other action.
Billing agreement payments and preauthorized payments
You can agree with an authorized merchant to use Venmo as the payment method for future payments with that merchant.
This agreement is between you and the authorized merchant and allows the merchant to take payments from your Venmo account with your authorization either on a one-time, regular or sporadic basis, depending on the type of billing agreement.
âPreauthorized paymentsâ are a type of billing agreement that allow an authorized merchant to receive payments from your Venmo account on a regularly recurring basis (for example, every month or otherwise on a routine billing cycle), and if such payments will vary in amount, you have the right to advance notice of the amount and date of the transfer from the merchant at least 10 days before the transfer is made.
If the merchant provides the option, you may choose to receive this advance notice only when the amount of your preauthorized payment will fall outside a range established between you and the merchant.
You may cancel a billing agreement by reaching out to the authorized merchant directly, by disconnecting the merchant in your âConnected Merchantsâ page in the Venmo app, or by calling Venmo at (855) 812-4430.
You may cancel a preauthorized payment up to 3 Business Days before the date of the next scheduled payment.
If you cancel a billing agreement, you may still owe the merchant money for the purchase or have additional obligations to the merchant for any goods or services that you receive but have not paid for.
Refunds
When you buy something from an authorized merchant using Venmo and the transaction is ultimately refunded, the money will be sent back to you.
Money may not always be refunded to the payment method originally used.Venmo Debit CardAs part of the Venmo services, you may be offered the opportunity to apply for a Venmo Mastercardâ¢ (referred to herein as âVenmo Debit Cardâ) via a designated website or the Venmo app.
The Venmo Debit Card is a debit card linked to your Venmo account, funded by your Venmo account balance and may be used everywhere Mastercard is accepted in the United States.
If you are offered the opportunity to apply for the Venmo Debit Card and proceed to apply, you will be subject to The Bancorp Bankâs approval criteria, which includes successful identity verification.
If you are unable to pass The Bancorp Bankâs identity verification procedures, you will not be eligible to receive a Venmo Debit Card.
In addition, you may be subject to separate identity verification by us, and/or we may suspend or terminate your access to the Venmo and/or PayPal services.
For users with an approved Venmo business profile, please note that you may not link a Venmo Debit Card to a business profile, and funds in your business profile cannot be used as a funding source for Venmo Mastercard transactions.
The Venmo Debit Card is issued by The Bancorp Bank and your use of the card will be subject to The Bancorp Bankâs Venmo Mastercard Cardholder Agreement as well this agreement.
Please see the Venmo Mastercard Cardholder Agreement for full terms and conditions applicable to the Venmo Debit Card.
In the event of any inconsistency between this Agreement and the Venmo Mastercard Cardholder Agreement, the Venmo Mastercard Cardholder Agreement shall govern your use of the Venmo Debit Card and your relationship with The Bancorp Bank to the extent of such conflict.
By applying for and using the Venmo Debit Card, you authorize us and The Bancorp Bank to share your Venmo account and personal information with one another as necessary to provide Venmo Debit Card related services.
You further authorize us to use Venmo Debit Card program related information provided by The Bancorp Bank to provide customer service, service your Venmo account and/or Venmo Debit Card, investigate and act on Venmo account and/or Venmo Debit Card related claims, as necessary to comply with applicable law, and as otherwise permitted by our Privacy Policy.
By applying for and using the Venmo Debit Card, you will also be subject to additional data sharing terms and conditions as provided for in the Venmo Mastercard Cardholder Agreement.
We may add, change, suspend or eliminate any or all Venmo Debit Card related features and services at any time, with or without notice, subject to applicable law.
We may terminate your access to any or all Venmo services, including the Venmo Debit Card, in the event you violate the Venmo Mastercard Cardholder Agreement or any agreement in force between you and us.
If your Venmo account is closed for any reason, any Venmo Debit Card affiliated with your account will be canceled.Venmo Credit CardAs part of the Venmo services, you may be offered the opportunity to apply for a Venmo Visa SignatureÂ® Credit Card and a Venmo VisaÂ® Credit Card (referred to herein as âVenmo Credit Cardâ) via the Venmo app.
In order to be eligible for the offer and to apply for a Venmo Credit Card, you must be the owner of the Venmo account, and the Venmo account must have been open for at least 30 days prior to application and be in good standing.
If your application is approved, your Venmo Credit Card will be linked to your Venmo account.
The Venmo Credit Card is issued by Synchrony Bank and your use of the card account will be subject to terms of the Venmo Visa SignatureÂ® Credit Card Account Agreement or the Venmo VisaÂ® Credit Card Account Agreement, as applicable (referred to herein as âVenmo Credit Card Account Agreementâ).
VISA is a registered trademark of Visa International Service Association and used under license.
By applying for and using the Venmo Credit Card, you authorize us and Synchrony Bank to share your Venmo account and personal information with one another as necessary to provide Venmo Credit Card related services.
You further authorize us to use Venmo Credit Card program related information provided by Synchrony Bank to provide customer service, service your Venmo account and/or Venmo Credit Card, investigate and act on Venmo account and/or Venmo Credit Card related claims, as necessary to comply with applicable law, and as otherwise permitted by our Privacy Policy.
By applying for and using the Venmo Credit Card, you will also be subject to additional data sharing terms and conditions as provided for in the Synchrony Bank Privacy Policy for Venmo VisaÂ® Credit Card and the Venmo Credit Card Account Agreement.
When the Venmo Credit Card is used to send money to another Venmo user through your Venmo account, the transaction will be treated as a purchase in accordance with the terms of the Venmo Credit Card Account Agreement.
However, these transactions are not considered purchases under the terms of this user agreement for any purpose, including, but not limited to, eligibility for the Venmo Purchase Program.Using Venmo as a Payment MethodIf you have access to a Venmo balance and have enough balance to cover the entire payment, Venmo will use your balance to fund your payment.
Otherwise, Venmo will charge the entire cost of the payment to your preferred payment method.
The transaction type, among other factors, determines when and how we use your preferred payment method, as explained on Payment Methods.
You can set separate preferred payment methods for paying friends, purchases from authorized merchants, and Venmo Debit Card reloads.
You can manage payment methods, including selecting preferred payment methods, in the Payment Methods section of your Venmo account settings.
If you transact with a business profile, your preferred payment method for paying friends will be used, rather than your preferred payment method for authorized merchants.
Bank account transfers
When you use your bank account as a payment method, you are allowing us to initiate a transfer from your bank account.
For these transactions, we will make electronic transfers from your bank account in the amount you authorize.
You authorize us to try this transfer again if the initial transfer is rejected by your bank for any reason.
IF YOU DONâT HAVE A VENMO BALANCE OR IT DOESNâT COVER A VENMO PAYMENT, YOU SHOULD CONFIRM THAT YOUR BANK ACCOUNT CONTAINS FUNDS SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE PAYMENT BEFORE MAKING THE PAYMENT, IF FUNDED BY YOUR BANK ACCOUNT.
THIS WILL HELP YOU AVOID OVERDRAFT OR OTHER FEES YOUR FINANCIAL INSTITUTION MAY CHARGE.
Debit card processing
Venmo will process your debit or prepaid card funded transactions through either the ATM debit network or the Visa, Mastercard or Discover network.Sharing TransactionsWe put you in control so that you can decide who can see your Venmo payments and purchases.
Payments made by new Venmo accounts may be set to public by default.
You can change your privacy settings for individual payments or in the Privacy section of your Venmo account settings.

Privacy.Venmo Purchase ProgramIMPORTANT: ONLY QUALIFYING PAYMENTS MADE TO AUTHORIZED MERCHANTS, BUSINESS PROFILES OR USING YOUR VENMO DEBIT CARD WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE VENMO PURCHASE PROGRAM.
THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT APPLY TO ANY OTHER TRANSACTION CONDUCTED USING VENMO.
When you buy something from an authorized merchant or a business with a Venmo business profile or with your Venmo Debit Card, you may be eligible for a refund under the Venmo Purchase Program.
When applicable, the Venmo Purchase Program entitles you to reimbursement for the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping costs you paid, if any.
We determine, in our sole discretion, whether your claim qualifies for the Venmo Purchase Program.
Our original determination is considered final, but you may be able to file an appeal of the decision with us if you have new or compelling information not available at the time of the original determination or you believe there was an error in the decision-making process.
You may be required to return the item to the seller or other party we specify as part of the settlement of your claim.
The Venmo Purchase Program does not entitle you to reimbursement for the return shipping costs that you may incur.
The Venmo Purchase Program may apply when you encounter these specific problems with an eligible purchase:


You didnât receive your item (referred to as an âItem Not Receivedâ claim), or


You received an item, but the item isnât what you ordered (referred to as a âSignificantly Not as Describedâ claim).


If you believe that a transaction made through your Venmo account was not authorized by you, this type of claim is different from the Venmo Purchase Program, and is described below under Protection from Unauthorized Transactions.
Item Not Received claims
Your claim will not qualify for a refund under the Venmo Purchase Program for an Item Not Received claim if:


You collect the item in person, or arrange for it to be collected on your behalf, including if you use your Venmo Debit Card or your Venmo account in a physical store, except for in-person Venmo QR code transactions or


The seller has provided proof of shipment or proof of delivery.


If the seller presents evidence that they delivered the goods to you, Venmo may find in favor of the seller for an Item Not Received claim even if you claim you did not receive the goods.
Significantly Not as Described claims
An item may be considered Significantly Not as Described if:


The item is materially different from the sellerâs description of it.


You received a completely different item.


The condition of the item was misrepresented.
For example, the item was described as ânewâ but the item was used.


The item was advertised as authentic but is not authentic (i.e.
counterfeit).


The item is missing major parts or features and those facts were not disclosed in the description of the item when you bought it.


You purchased a certain number of items but didnât receive them all.


The item was damaged during shipment.


The item is unusable in its received state and was not disclosed as such.


An item may not be considered Significantly Not as Described if:


The defect in the item was correctly described by the seller in its description of the item.


The item was properly described but you didn't want it after you received it.


The item was properly described but did not meet your expectations.


The item has minor scratches and was described as âused."


General eligibility for Venmo Purchase Program
To be eligible for the Venmo Purchase Program you must meet all of the following requirements:

Venmo Purchase Program dispute resolution process
If youâre unable to resolve a transaction related issue directly with a seller, you can file a Venmo Purchase Program claim using the steps described below.
If you do not follow these steps your claim may be denied:
Step 1: Open a dispute within 180 days of the date you made the purchase using our support channels (by calling an agent at (855) 812-4430, email support@venmo.com, or chat in the app).
Please include information on the disputed transaction and the reason for your claim, including the date and amount of the transaction, the sellerâs name, and an explanation of your issue.
Step 2: Respond to our requests for documentation or other information. We may require you to provide receipts, third party evaluations, police reports or other documents that we specify.
You must respond to these requests in a timely manner as requested in our correspondence with you.
Step 3: Comply with our shipping requests in a timely manner, if youâre filing a Significantly Not as Described claim, we may require you, at your expense, to ship the item back to the seller, to us or to a third party (which we will specify) and to provide proof of delivery.
Proof of delivery means:


For transactions that total less than $750 U.S.
dollars, confirmation that can be viewed online and includes the delivery address showing at least city/state or zip code, delivery date, and the identity of the shipping company you used.


For transactions that total $750 U.S.
dollars or more, you must provide signature confirmation of delivery.


Step 4: We will make a decision (including automatically closing any dispute or claim), in our sole discretion, based on the coverage and eligibility requirements set forth above, any additional information provided during the dispute resolution process or any other information we deem relevant and appropriate under the circumstances.
Dispute with us or your card issuer
If you used a debit or credit card as the payment method for a transaction with an authorized merchant through your Venmo account and you are dissatisfied with the transaction, you may be entitled to dispute the transaction with your card issuer.
Applicable card chargeback rights may be broader than those available to you under the Venmo Purchase Program.
For example, if you dispute a transaction with your card issuer, you may be able to recover amounts you paid for unsatisfactory items even if they donât qualify for protection under a Significantly Not as Described claim with us.
You must choose whether to pursue a dispute with us under the Venmo Purchase Program, or to pursue the dispute with your card issuer.
You canât do both at the same time or seek a double recovery.
If you pursue a dispute/claim with us under the Venmo Purchase Program and you also pursue a dispute for the same transaction with your card issuer, weâll close your dispute/claim with us.
This wonât affect the dispute process with your card issuer.
In addition, if you pursue a dispute with your card issuer, you cannot pursue a dispute/claim under the Venmo Purchase Program with us later.
If you choose to dispute a transaction with us under the Venmo Purchase Program and we decide against you, you can seek to pursue the dispute with your card issuer later.
If we do not make a final decision on your claim until after your card issuer's deadline for filing a dispute, and because of our delay you recover less than the full amount you would have been entitled to recover from the card issuer, we will reimburse you for the remainder of your loss (minus any amount you have already recovered from the seller or your card issuer).
Before contacting your card issuer or filing a dispute with us under the Venmo Purchase Program, you should contact the seller to attempt to resolve your issue in accordance with the sellerâs return policy.Venmo RewardsYou can earn Venmo Rewards by making qualifying purchases from authorized merchants using a QR code or with your Venmo Mastercard debit card at participating merchants.
For the current list of participating merchants and offers, please check the Venmo app.
Participating merchants and offer terms may be changed from time to time without notice.
Venmo will post the Venmo Rewards amount to your Venmo account based on the information we receive from our third-party service provider.
If you return, charge back, cancel, dispute, or otherwise request a refund for a qualifying purchase for which you have already received Venmo Rewards, we reserve the right to remove any related Venmo Rewards amount from your Venmo account or apply future Venmo Rewards to any such amount.
For full Venmo Rewards terms, please review the Venmo Rewards Powered by DOSH Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.Refunds, Reversals and ChargebacksRefunds for Transactions Through Business Profiles
When you buy something from a seller that has a business profile on Venmo and the transaction is refunded, the money will be sent back to you.
Money may not always be refunded to the payment method originally used.
If you receive a payment through a business profile for selling goods and services and that payment is later refunded or invalidated for any reason, you are responsible for the full amount of the payment sent to you plus any fees (including any applicable chargeback fees below).
In the event of a successful claim under the Venmo Purchase Program, we will initiate the refund process.
The amount of the refund will be deducted from your business profile.
If the balance in your business profile does not cover the payment amount due, plus the fees, this will result in a negative balance, which you owe to us.
In that situation, we may use any of the payment methods linked to your business profile to cover the amount due.
If the payment methods linked to your business profile do not cover the amount due, you must immediately add funds to your balance to resolve the negative balance.
If you donât, we will take any or all actions as outlined under Amounts Owed to Us.
Payments that are invalidated and reversed
Payments may be invalidated and reversed by us if, among other reasons, we sent the payment to you in error, the funding transaction is declined or reversed, the payment was unauthorized or unfunded, we determine that a purchase is eligible for the Venmo Purchase Program (in which case we may reverse funds from the sellerâs account to refund the buyer) or if the payment was for activities that violated this user agreement or any other agreement with us.
As the sender or recipient of a payment that is later invalidated for any reason, you may be liable to us for the full amount of the payment and we may recover the amount of the payment (plus any fees) from you.
We may recover the amount of the payment from either the sender or the recipient of an invalidated payment in our discretion (subject to applicable law).
For example, if you send a payment funded by a bank account and the bank informs us it cannot cover the payment due to a lack of funds or a dispute, we may hold you liable for the payment, or if you were the recipient of that payment, we may reverse that payment from your account to cover the liability.
When recovering the amount of an invalidated payment from you, we may apply any money sent to you on Venmo, request that you add money to your account for the amount of the payment and apply that money to amounts owed, and/or we may:


engage in collection efforts to recover such amounts from you;


take any or all action as outlined under Amounts Owed to Us.
and


place a limitation or take other action on your Venmo account as outlined under Restricted Activities and Holds and Limitations.


If we invalidate a payment because the card issuer or originating bank declined or reversed the transaction, then you may be liable for the payment even if you disagree with the decision of the card issuer or originating bank to decline or reverse the payment.
If you believe that a payment initiated with your Venmo account was not authorized, then you must notify us immediately, even if you (or someone else) disputes the transaction with the card issuer or originating bank.
Please see below under the heading Reporting an Unauthorized Transaction for information about how to notify us.
If you fail to report the unauthorized activity directly to us, then we may recover the amount of the reversed payment from you, as described above.
Chargeback fees
If you receive a debit or credit funded payment in your business profile and the buyer pursues a chargeback for the transaction with their card issuer, we may assess a chargeback fee.Restricted ActivitiesIn connection with your use of our websites, your Venmo account, the Venmo services, or in the course of your interactions with us, other customers, or third parties, you must not:

Similarly, if you receive a payment and the payment is disputed, you may be liable for the payment.Holds and LimitationsWhat are holds and limitations
Under certain circumstances, in order to protect Venmo and the security and integrity of the network that uses the Venmo services, Venmo may, in its sole discretion, take account-level or transaction-level actions.
A hold may be placed on your Venmo account, including any associated business profile.
Our decision about holds and limitations may be based on confidential criteria that are essential to our management of risk and the protection of Venmo, our customers and/or service providers.
We may use proprietary fraud and risk modeling when assessing the risk associated with your Venmo account.
In addition, we may be restricted by regulation or a governmental authority from disclosing certain information to you about such decisions.
We have no obligation to disclose the details of our risk management or security procedures to you.
Holds
A hold is an action that Venmo may take under certain circumstances either at the transaction level or the account level.
When Venmo places a temporary hold on a transaction, the money is not available to either the sender or the recipient.
Venmo reviews many factors before placing a hold on a transaction, including: account tenure, transaction activity, and past disputes.
Holds based on Venmoâs risk decisions
We may place a hold on transactions involving your Venmo account if, in our sole discretion, we believe that there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your Venmo account, or your transactions or that placing such a hold is necessary to comply with state or federal regulatory requirements.
We make decisions about whether to place a hold based on a number of factors, including information available to us from both internal sources and third parties.
Risk-based holds may remain in place for up to 180 days from the date the transaction was made.
We may release the hold earlier under certain circumstances, but any earlier release is at our sole discretion.
Account Limitations
Limitations may be placed on your account to help protect Venmo and Venmo users when we notice restricted activities or activity that appears to us as unusual or suspicious.
Limitations also help us collect information necessary for keeping your Venmo account open.
There are several reasons why your Venmo account could be limited, including:


If we suspect someone could be using your Venmo account without your knowledge, weâll limit it for your protection and look into the unusual activity.


If another financial institution alerts us that someone has used one of your linked payment methods without permission.


In order to comply with the law.


If we reasonably believe you have breached this agreement or violated the Acceptable Use Policy or Content Standards.


You will need to resolve any issues with your account before a limitation can be removed.
Normally, this is done after you provide us with the information we request.
However, if we reasonably believe a risk still exists after you have provided us that information, we may take action to protect us, our users, a third party, or you from reversals, fees, fines, penalties, legal and/or regulatory risks and any other liability.Court Orders, Regulatory Requirements or Other Legal ProcessIf we are notified of a court order or other legal process (including garnishment or any equivalent process) affecting you, or if we otherwise believe we are required to do so in order to comply with applicable law or regulatory requirements, we may be required to take certain actions, including holding payments to/from your Venmo account, placing a hold or limitation on your Venmo account, or releasing your funds.
We will decide, in our sole discretion, which action is required of us.
We do not have an obligation to contest or appeal any court order or legal process involving you or your Venmo account.
When we implement a hold or limitation as a result of a court order, applicable law, regulatory requirement or other legal process, the hold or limitation may remain in place longer than 180 days.Protection from Unauthorized TransactionsTo protect yourself from unauthorized activity in your Venmo account, you should regularly log into your Venmo account and review your Venmo account statement.
We will notify you of each transaction by sending an email to your primary email address on file and/or creating a story in your feed, depending on your preferences.
You should review these transaction notifications to ensure that each transaction was authorized and accurately completed.
We will protect you from unauthorized activity in your Venmo account.
The following terms and conditions apply with respect to all Venmo services, other than those associated with the Venmo Debit Card or Venmo Credit Card.
For resolution procedures for unauthorized transactions and other errors associated with your use of the Venmo Debit Card or Venmo Credit Card, please see the Venmo Mastercard Cardholder Agreement or the Venmo VisaÂ® Credit Card Account Agreement.
When the below protection applies, we will cover you for the full amount of the unauthorized activity as long as you cooperate with us and follow the procedures described below.

An âUnauthorized Transactionâ occurs when money is sent from your Venmo account that you did not authorize and that did not benefit you.

While you owe amounts to us, we may:


reverse payments you have sent;


engage in collection and other efforts to recover such amounts from you, including, but not limited to, making attempts on your linked payment methods to cover the amounts.

This includes accounts and amounts owed by using our various products such as PayPal, Xoom or Braintree.

PayPalâs liability is limited with respect to your Venmo account and your use of the Venmo services. In no event shall PayPal be liable for lost profits or any special, incidental or consequential damages (including without limitation damages for loss of data or loss of business) arising out of or in connection with our websites, software, systems (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the Venmo services) operated by us or on our behalf, any of the Venmo services, or this user agreement (however arising, including negligence), unless and to the extent prohibited by law.
Our liability to you or any third parties in any circumstance is limited to the actual amount of direct damages.
In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, PayPal is not liable, and you agree not to hold PayPal responsible, for any damages or losses (including, but not limited to, loss of money, goodwill, or reputation, profits, or other intangible losses or any special, indirect, or consequential damages) resulting directly or indirectly from: (1) your use of, or your inability to use, our websites, software, systems (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the Venmo services) operated by us or on our behalf, or any of the Venmo services.
(2) delays or disruptions in our websites, software, systems (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the Venmo services) operated by us or on our behalf and any of the Venmo services.
(3) viruses or other malicious software obtained by accessing our websites, software, systems (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the Venmo services) operated by us or on our behalf or any of the Venmo services or any website or service linked to our websites, software or any of the Venmo services.
(4) glitches, bugs, errors, or inaccuracies of any kind in our websites, software, systems (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the Venmo services) operated by us or on our behalf or any of the Venmo services or in the information and graphics obtained from them.

(6) a suspension or other action taken with respect to your Venmo account.

The Venmo services are provided âas-isâ and without any representation or warranty, whether express, implied or statutory.
We specifically disclaim any implied warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.
We do not have any control over the products or services provided by sellers who accept Venmo as a payment method, and we cannot ensure that a Venmo user or a seller you are dealing with will actually complete the transaction or is authorized to do so.
We do not guarantee continuous, uninterrupted or secure access to any part of the Venmo services, and operation of our websites, software, or systems (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the Venmo services) operated by us or on our behalf may be interfered with by numerous factors outside of our control.
We will make reasonable efforts to ensure that requests for electronic debits and credits involving bank accounts, debit cards, credit cards, and check issuances are processed in a timely manner but we make no representations or warranties regarding the amount of time needed to complete processing because the Venmo services are dependent upon many factors outside of our control, such as delays in the banking system or the U.S.
or international mail service.
Some states do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties, so the foregoing disclaimers may not apply to you.
Your Release of Us

In entering into this release you expressly waive any protections (whether statutory or otherwise, for example, California Civil Code Â§ 1542) that would otherwise limit the coverage of this release to include only those claims which you may know or suspect to exist in your favor at the time of agreeing to this release.Agreement to ArbitrateIf a dispute arises between you and PayPal regarding the Venmo services or otherwise, our goal is to learn about and address your concerns.

Consumer fraud warning
Weâre always looking for ways to help keep you even more secure.
So stay on the lookout for some of these common scams:


Seller Scam: a scammer sends you a fraudulent payment for goods or services you provide outside of Venmo.


Accidental Payment: a scammer sends you a fraudulent payment, claims it was accidental, and asks that you return their money.


Always use common sense when sending money.
If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
Only send money for yourself and not for others.
Remember that if you donât make a purchase from an authorized merchant, a business profile or with your Venmo Debit Card, youâre not covered by Venmo Purchase Program.
Please let us know immediately if you believe someone is trying to scam or defraud you by contacting us.

We will determine your state of residency based on the information provided for your Venmo account.

Where required, we will send you a notice prior to escheating any of your funds.
If you fail to respond to this notice, your funds held in our possession will be escheated to the applicable state.
If you would like to claim any escheated funds from the applicable state, please contact the applicable stateâs unclaimed property administrator.
