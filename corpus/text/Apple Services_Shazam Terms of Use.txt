Resolving Disputes

These Terms and the relationship between you and us shall be governed by the laws of England and Wales without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
In the event of a dispute, we want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case.
Before filing a claim against us, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting us at https://www.apple.com/legal/contact/.
Weâll try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you via email.
If a dispute is not resolved within fifteen (15) business days of submission, you or Shazam may bring a formal proceeding.

Outside of the United States. You and we agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.

In the United States. You and Shazam agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms or the Services through final and binding arbitration, except as set forth under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below.
The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes.
The arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or work, New York, NY or any other location we agree to.
The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees.
Shazam will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than $75,000.
If you receive an arbitration award that is more favorable than any offer we make to resolve the claim, we will pay you $1,000 in addition to the award.
Shazam will not seek its attorneysâ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.
Either you or Shazam may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in New York, NY or any United States county where you live or work.
Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above.
You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action.
Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed.
In the event that the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you and Shazam agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the federal or state courts of New York County, NY.
