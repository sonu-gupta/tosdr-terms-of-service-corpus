We are pleased to help support your work as you ignite discussion - and use video the way your students do.

Flipgrid, Inc., a subsidiary of Microsoft Corporation, ("Flipgrid," "we," "our," or "us") provides a collaborative platform on the Flipgrid.com website, the Flipgrid mobile app ("App"), and any associated services (collectively, the "Service").
You accept these terms of use ("Terms") by creating an account on this Service or through your use of the Service.

"You" may be a: 


"Discussion Owner" (i.e., an adult over the age of 18, a teacher or other School representative that subscribes to the Service with the administrative right to use the Service to create, invite, manage, moderate or delete a Flipgrid video group (âGroupâ) or video topic (âTopicâ).



a "School" (i.e., an educational institution, organization or other educational business for which one or more Discussion Owners offers the Service to Students).



a "Student" (i.e., a "User" who was invited to use the Service by a School Discussion Owner).
or 




a "User" (i.e., any user of the Service, including a Discussion Owner).



If you create an account, Group or Topic for the Service on behalf of an entity, such as your business or employer, you represent that you have the legal authority to bind that entity to these Terms.
Teachers and Schools, please use our Flipgrid Teacher Toolkit (https://static.Flipgrid.com/docs/Flipgrid_dos_donts.pdf) to meet your privacy commitments under these Terms and our separate Privacy Policy.

If you are a User (who is not a Student), you also represent that you are at least 18 years old and have the legal capacity to accept these Terms.
If you are not 18, not a Student, or do not have parental consent to access the Service, you may not use the Service.

You agree that we may provide notice to you of updated terms by posting them on the Service.
Use or continued use of our Service following notice of such updated terms indicates your consent to be bound by them.


1.

Your privacy and that of your Students is important to us.
We do not use personal information to market or advertise to you or Students, and we do not sell User personal data.
We do use your information for certain stated purposes, such as providing and improving the Service and communicating with Discussion Owners about Flipgrid features and events.
Please read the Privacy Policy, as it describes what information we collect from you, how we use that information, and the legal bases we have to process your information.

2.1 The Service. Flipgrid allows Discussion Owners to create one or more Groups or Topics, each of which contains content (which may include text, video, or other materials).
Discussion Owners control access to the Groups or Topics and may share the Groups or Topics with anyone they like.
For example, Discussion Owners can share their Groups with Students and guest speakers.
Users can participate in Topic discussions using video.
Discussion Owners may also record Shorts videos and may share the videos with others.

You must keep this information up to date.
You may delete your account at any time, for any reason, by following the instructions on the Service and then uninstalling the App.

For a variety of reasons, and in particular, to protect the integrity of our community, we reserve the right in our sole discretion to: (a) remove any content that you upload to the Service at any time for any reason, and (b) suspend or terminate any account and/or refuse any current or future use of the Service (or any portion thereof) at any time for any reason.
We will not be liable to you or any third party for taking either of these actions.


2.3 Account Responsibilities. To protect your account, keep your account details and password confidential, as you are responsible for activities that occur under your account.

residents, the laws of the state where you reside (or, if a School, where your principal place of business is located) govern all claims, regardless of conflict of laws principles, except that the FAA governs all provisions relating to arbitration.
You and we irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state or federal courts in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, for all disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service that are heard in court (excluding arbitration and small claims court).

11.
BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER

We hope we never have a dispute, but if we do, you and we agree to try for 60 days to resolve it informally.
If we canât, you and we agree to binding individual arbitration before the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"), and not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury.
Instead, a neutral arbitrator will decide, and the arbitratorâs decision will be final except for a limited right of review under the FAA.
Class action lawsuits, class-wide arbitrations, private attorney-general actions, and any other proceeding where someone acts in a representative capacity arenât allowed.
Nor is combining individual proceedings without the consent of all parties.


11.1 Here is what you need to know about arbitration under these Terms:


(a) Disputes CoveredâEverything Except IP.
The term "dispute" is as broad as it can be.
It includes any claim or controversy between you and us concerning the Service, the software related to the Service, the Serviceâs or softwareâs price, your account, advertising, marketing, communications, your purchase transaction, billing, or these Terms, under any legal theory including contract, warranty, tort, statute, or regulation, except disputes relating to the enforcement or validity of your, your licensorsâ, our, or our licensorsâ intellectual property rights.


(b) Mail a Notice of Dispute First.
If you have a dispute and our customer service representatives canât resolve it, send a Notice of Dispute by U.S.
Mail to Microsoft Corporation, ATTN: CELA Arbitration, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399, U.S.A.
Tell us your name, address, how to contact you, what the problem is, and what you want.
A form is available at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245499.
Weâll do the same if we have a dispute with you.
After 60 days, you or we may start an arbitration if the dispute is unresolved.


(c) Small Claims Court Option.
Instead of mailing a Notice of Dispute, you may sue us in small claims court in your county of residence (or, if a business, your principal place of business) or Borough of Manhattan, New York, U.S.A.
if you meet the courtâs requirements.


(d) Arbitration Procedure.
The AAA will conduct any arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules (or if you are an individual and use the Service for personal or household use, or if the value of the dispute is $75,000 or less whether or not you are an individual or how you use the Service, its Consumer Arbitration Rules).
For more information, see www.adr.org or call 1-800-778-7879.
In a dispute involving $25,000 or less, any hearing will be telephonic unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead.
Any in-person hearing will take place in your county of residence (or, if a business, your principal place of business) or in Borough of Manhattan, New York, if your dispute is with Flipgrid.
You choose.
The arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as a court could.
The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only to you individually to satisfy your individual claim.
Under AAA Rules, the arbitrator rules on his or her own jurisdiction, including the arbitrability of any claim.
But a court has exclusive authority to enforce the prohibition on arbitration on a class-wide basis or in a representative capacity.


(e) Arbitration Fees and Payments.


(i) Disputes Involving $75,000 or Less.
We will promptly reimburse your filing fees and pay the AAAâs and arbitratorâs fees and expenses.
If you reject our last written settlement offer made before the arbitrator was appointed, your dispute goes all the way to an arbitratorâs decision (called an "award"), and the arbitrator awards you more than this last written offer, we will: (i) pay the greater of the award or $1,000.
(ii) pay your reasonable attorneyâs fees, if any.
and (iii) reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration.


(ii) Disputes Involving More than $75,000.
The AAA rules will govern payment of filing fees and the AAAâs and arbitratorâs fees and expenses.


(f) Conflict with AAA Rules.
These Terms govern to the extent they conflict with the AAAâs Commercial Arbitration Rules or Consumer Arbitration Rules.


(g) Must File Within One Year.
You and we must file in small claims court or arbitration any claim or dispute (except intellectual property disputesâsee section 11.1 (a), above) within one year from when it first could be filed.
Otherwise, itâs permanently barred.


(h) Rejecting Future Arbitration Changes.
You may reject any change we make to section 10 (except address changes) by sending us notice within 30 days of the change by U.S.
Mail to the address in section 11.1(b).
If you do, the most recent version of section 11 before the change you rejected will apply.


(i) Severability.
If the class action waiver is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, then those parts wonât be arbitrated but will proceed in court, with the rest proceeding in arbitration.
If any other provision of section 11 is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be severed but the rest of section 11 still applies.
