Like most websites and apps we use cookies.

 A 'cookie' is a file in your web browser that enables us to recognise your computer when you visit the site.
Sorry we aren't talking about the kind that contains chocolate chips! ðª 

Cookies help us improve your browsing experience.

They tell us when and how many times you've visited the site, how long you've spent on there and what you've got up to.
We then use that data to personalise your shopping experience, making sure that everything we show you is relevant to your interests.
For example, if you visit maplin.co.uk and look at a smart home thermostat we could use cookies to show you ads about smart home thermostats on promotion.
Third-party cookies work by sharing your browser identification with the third party (like Twitter or Facebook), so they can show you the same ads on their sites.
By clicking on or navigating through our website, you agree to allow us to collect your information on and off the Maplin website.

If you turn cookies off, you might still see ads for Maplin in other places.
