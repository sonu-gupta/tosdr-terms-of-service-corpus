The vast majority of web browsers allow the use of cookies.

What types of cookies do we use
We use several different types of cookies:

Necessary cookies: Necessary cookies help make a website usable by enabling basic functions like page navigation and access to secure areas of the website.
The website cannot function properly without these cookies.
Preference cookies: Preference cookies enable a website to remember information that changes the way the website behaves or looks, like your preferred language or the region that you are in
Statistic cookies: Statistic cookies help website owners to understand how visitors interact with websites by collecting and reporting information anonymously.
Marketing cookies and social media plug-ins: Marketing cookies are used to track visitors across websites.
The intention is to display ads that are relevant and engaging for the individual user and thereby more valuable for publishers and third-party advertisers.
Thus, we may share this information with third parties for this purpose.

We also use marketing cookies in the form of social media plug-ins from social networks.
By embedding the plug-ins, the social network receives the information that a user has accessed the corresponding page of the website.
If the user is logged in to the social network, the operator of the social network can match the visit to the website to the userâs personal account.
If users interact with the plug-ins, for example by clicking the "Like" button or recommend us on social media, the corresponding information is transmitted by your browser directly to the operator of the social network and saved there.
Even if a user is not a member of a social network, there still exists the possibility that the operator of the social network will learn and save the userâs IP address as well as information on the browser and operating system s/he uses.

4.
