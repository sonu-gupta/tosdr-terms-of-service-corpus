Please read this privacy statement carefully as it contains essential information on how AFRINIC, as a controller, treat the personal data that you provide us.

2.
Which personal data do we collect?

In some cases, we may need to transfer your data with organisations located in countries outside our territorial limits to provide our services to you.
We will secure the data transfer.

However, we can only do so with your consent.
You will also be able to opt-out from receiving such communications at any time, free of charge, by contacting us following the section âContact Usâ below.
 
6.
How long do we keep your information?
Your data will be stored for as long as required to fulfil our organisational purposes and for the period required by law.

for the performance of a contract between us;

our use of your information is necessary to fulfil our statutory obligations with relevant authorities (regulators, tax officials, law enforcement bodies) or otherwise meet our legal responsibilities;

10.
Access to your data
You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we hold about you.
To do this, contact our Data Protection Officer and specify what information you would like.
We will take all reasonable steps to confirm your identity before providing details of your data.
You will not have to pay a fee to access your data (or to exercise any of your other rights).
However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is unfounded, repetitive or excessive.
Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
 
11.
Correction of your data
You have the right to ask us to update, correct or delete your data.
We will take all reasonable steps to confirm your identity before making changes to personal data we may hold about you.

12.
Withdrawal of consent and request for deletion of personal data
You may also withdraw your consent to receiving information from us, or more generally to our processing of your data, at any time, and you may in certain circumstances ask us to delete your data.
However, we may not be able to fulfil our contractual obligations towards you if you entirely withdraw your consent or ask us to delete your data entirely.
To protect your data, we shall require you to first prove your identity at the time of the request, for instance, by providing a copy of your national identification card, contact details or answering some other security questions to satisfy our authentication process, before we may proceed with your request(s).
Whenever reasonably possible and required, we will strive to grant these rights within 30 days.
However, our response time will depend on the complexity of your requests.
We will respond to your requests free of charge, unless if, your request involves processing or retrieving a significant volume of data, or if we consider that your application is unfounded, excessive or repetitive in which case we reserve the right to charge a fee (as mentioned above regarding access).
There may be circumstances where we are not able to comply with your requests, typically concerning a request to erase your data or where you object to the processing of your information for a specific purpose or where you request that we restrict the use of your data where we need to keep your data to comply with a legal obligation or where we need to use such information to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim.
To make these requests, or if you have any questions or complaints about how we handle your data or would like us to update the information we maintain about you and your preferences, please contact our Data Protection Officer at the address set out under section 16 below.
