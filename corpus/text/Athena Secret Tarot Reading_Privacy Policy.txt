This data is stored anonymously, it does not contain any personal information and can thus be disclosed to third parties, particularly for information or statistical analysis purposes, particularly in order to analyze the performance of our marketing promotions.
We may also use advertising cookies to collect certain demographics and usage statistics to improve the services.
In particular, we use the following Google Analytics Advertising Features: Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting.
Integrated services that require Google Analytics to collect data via advertising cookies and anonymous identifiers.
We also make use of âsocial pluginsâ, i.e.
plugins for social networks, including particularly the Facebook âShareâ button.
The facebook.com website is operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S.
California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA.
The plug-ins usually feature the Facebook logo.
Besides Facebook, we use plug-ins by Twitter (provider: Twitter, Inc., 1355 Market St, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA), Pinterest (provider: Pinterest Inc., 808 Brannan Street, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA (if you are located in the USA), Pinterest Europe Ltd., Palmerston House, 2nd Floor, Fenian Street, Dublin 2, Ireland (if you are located outside the USA)), Instagram (1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA) and GooglePlus (provider: Google).
For data privacy reasons, we deliberately opted against utilizing direct social network plug-ins on our website.
Instead, we employ an alternative technical solution that allows you to decide whether to transmit data to the social network operators and when.
Thus when you visit the website, data are never automatically transmitted to social networks such as Facebook or Twitter.
Only when you actively click on the respective button yourself will your web browser connect to the servers of the respective social network, i.e.
clicking on elements then clicking on the social networkâs icon indicates your consent to your browser connecting to the servers of the respective social network and sending usage data to that social network operator, whether or not you are a subscriber of such social network.
We have no influence over the nature or scope of data that social networks may then gather.
For information regarding the purpose and scope of data collection, further processing and use of data by social networks and regarding your data privacy rights and relevant configuration settings, see the social networksâ respective data privacy advisories.
 Use of your testimonials From time to time, we may post customer testimonials on our website.
We either use scrambled customer information that does not allow the identification of our customers or, if such testimonials allow the identification of our customers, will obtain your prior consent by e-mail to allow Mediaweb Limited to use the following information for promotional purposes or for testimonials: first name, surname initial, picture, town/city, country of residence, all or parts of the correspondence e-mails between you and the brand operated by Mediaweb Limited.
 How do we deal with information from individuals under the locally applicable legal age? The athena-medium.com website does not seek to collect personal data from individuals under the locally applicable legal age.
Individuals under the locally applicable legal age should receive permission from their parent or legal guardian before providing any personal information to Mediaweb Limited on the athena-medium.com website.
 What happens if this privacy policy changes? Our privacy policy applies to all the information that we process about you.
We may occasionally make updates or changes to this privacy policy, which you can consult via a direct link on all pages of the athena-medium.com website.
These changes and updates apply as of the last update date indicated at the top of this document.
We therefore ask you to consult it on a regular basis.
However, Mediaweb Limited commits not to make any changes which might weaken the protection of your personal data without your consent.
