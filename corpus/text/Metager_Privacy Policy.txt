Principles As a non-profit organization, we have committed ourselves to free access to knowledge.
Since we know that free research is not compatible with mass surveillance, we also take privacy very seriously.
We always only process the data that is necessary for the operation of our services.
Data protection is always the standard we aim for.
We do not operate profiling â i.e.
the automatic creation of user profiles.
Accumulating data by context 
 Using the web search engine MetaGer When using our web search engine MetaGer via their web form or through their OpenSearch interface, the following data is generated: 
 Internet protocol address The Internet protocol address (hereafter referred to as IP) is necessary to use web services such as MetaGer.
This IP, in combination with a date similar to a telephone number, uniquely identifies Internet access and its owner.
In general, the first three (out of four) blocks of an IP are not personal.
When rear blocks of the IP are truncated, the truncated address identifies the approximate geographic area around the Internet connection.
Examples (full IP address) 154.67.88.47 82.159.53.49 Examples (only the first two blocks) 154.67.0.0 82.159.0.0 What does MetaGer/SUMA-EV do with it? 
To protect our service from congestion, we need to limit the number of search queries per Internet connection.
For this purpose alone, we store the full IP address and a timestamp for a maximum of 96 hours.
If a noticeable number of searches are performed by an IP, this IP is temporarily stored in a revocation list (maximum 96 hours after the last search).
Then the IP is deleted.

In addition to donations and membership fees, we must finance our operation through non-personalized advertising on the results page.
To receive this advertising, we give the first two blocks of the IP in connection with parts of the so-called user agent to our advertising partners 
 Which rights do I have as a user? Since the full form of the Internet Protocol address is personal, you have the following rights in particular: View rights 
 Entered search query Entered search terms are mandatory for a web search.
As a rule, personal data cannot be obtained from them.

The results, including the search term, are kept for display for a few hours.



 User Agent Name When a website is opened, your browser automatically sends an identifier, usually with data about the browser and operating system used.
This browser identifier (the so-called user agent) can be used by web pages, for example, to recognize mobile devices and present them with a customized output.

To receive this advertising, we give parts of the user agent in connection with the first two blocks of the so-called IP-Adresse to our advertising partners.
