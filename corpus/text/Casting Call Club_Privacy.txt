("us", "we", or "our") operates the castingcall.club website and platform (the "Service").
This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.
This site uses cookies.
Here's why:

We keep track of your session, which lets you login and have an account.
We also use it to make your experience better by highlighting projects you've already seen, etc.
We let third-parties set cookies for analytics.
Analytics helps CCC because when we build a new feature and everyone hates it, we want to know how to make it better.

 Right, so your personal information.
What does this site do with it?

We collect your email address.
We only use it to email you directly about things you do on this site like when someone messages you, or when new projects are available in your search criteria.
It never leaves our database.
There are three exceptions to this rule: 1.
if you buy something (like a membership).
In this case, we send your email to PayPal or Stripe for the sole purposes of customer service.
2.
we use a service called sendgrid in order to send you emails.
3.
if you email us for customer support reasons, we use a service called helpscout.

You can fill in your profile.
Anything you put on your public profile is public.

 Can I delete my data?

Yes.
There is a delete account button in your account page.
When you click 'delete account', we remove all your data including email.
 What kind of data is processed? Personal Data While using our service, we ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you ("Personal Data").
Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to:

Email address and username
Anything you type in your public profile
Cookies and Usage Data (see below)

We may use your Personal Data to contact you with newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you.
You may opt out of receiving any, or all, of these communications from us by following the unsubscribe link or instructions provided in any email we send, or you can opt out on the Settings page. Usage Data We collect information how the service is accessed and used ("Usage Data").

IP address), browser type, browser version, the pages of our service that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, unique device identifiers and other diagnostic data.
However, personally identifable Usage Data is not collected in from our system and never tied directly to you.

The exceptions to this are when you view a project page or a profile page.
We track when the date and time you viewed those pages, but we strip all other data.
The only information we retain looks something similar to this: 'user_id 1 viewed project_id 234223 on 2017-03-19 00:23:23'.
This viewer data never leaves our database. Tracking Cookies Data For more information about cookies, see our cookie policy.
