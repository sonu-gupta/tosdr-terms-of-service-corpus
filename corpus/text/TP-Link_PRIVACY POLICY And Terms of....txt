Third-Party Sites           &nbsp.


The Services may link you to other sites on the Internet.
These sites may contain information or material that some people may find inappropriate or offensive.
These other sites are not under the control of TP-Link, and you acknowledge that (whether or not such sites are affiliated in any way with TP-Link) the TP-Link Group is not responsible for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, decency, or any other aspect of the content of such sites.
The inclusion of such a link does not imply endorsement of any site by TP-Link Group or any association with its operators.
TP-Link cannot ensure that you will be satisfied with any products or services that you purchase from any third-party site that links to or from TP-Link since the third-party sites are owned and operated by independent retailers.

Termination

You are free to stop using the Services at any time.
You understand and agree that we may or may not delete your User Content in the event that you stop using the Services.

If you transfer a Product to a new owner, your right to use the Services with respect to that Product automatically terminates.

You understand and agree that we may retain copies of such User Content indefinitely.
In the event that we elect to terminate your account, we will try to provide advance notice to you prior to termination so that you are able to retrieve any important User Content stored in your account.
You understand and agree that we may provide no advanced notice for any reason, but usually because it would be impractical, illegal, not in the interest of someone's safety or security, or otherwise harmful to the rights or property of TP-Link.

You shall be responsible for the security of your username and password (if any).
TP-Link shall be entitled to monitor your username and password and, at its discretion, require you to change it.
If you use a username and password that TP-Link considers insecure, TP-Link will be entitled to require your username or password to be changed and/or terminate your account.
However, TP-Link cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat our security measures or use your personal information for improper purposes.
You acknowledge that you provide your personal information at your own risk.
You agree to immediately notify TP-Link of any unauthorized use, or suspected unauthorized use, of your account or any other breach of security of which you become aware.
