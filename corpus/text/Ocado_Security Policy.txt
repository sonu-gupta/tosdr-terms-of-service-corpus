         Security Policy  As a company that does business purely over the internet, we understand the importance of security.
That's why we have a number of highly secure systems in place to give you confidence when paying by card, as well as when you give us personal information, such as your address or telephone number.

 We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt your details whilst they travel from your computer to our system.
This ensures your payment card and personal details are kept private except where we have advised you otherwise in our Terms &amp.
Conditions.

 We will store an encrypted token unique to your payment card and the Ocado website, so you don't need to type in your card details each time you order.
For your peace of mind, we'll show you the last four digits of your card number every time you check out.
You can delete or edit your card details at any time from your Account Settings page.
If you do this we will ask you in re-input your password in order to verify your identity.
 How can I check my details are secure?  Each time you visit our site your browser is switched to 'secure mode' to encrypt the information that you send to us.
To verify that the page of our site you are on is secure, look at the far left of your URL bar.
You should see a padlock.
