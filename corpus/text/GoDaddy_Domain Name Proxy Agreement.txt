DBP takes any of the actions set forth in subsection i, ii, or iii above or section 5.

5 .
COMMUNICATIONS FORWARDING




a.
Correspondence Forwarding

Inasmuch as DBP's name, postal address and phone number will be listed in the Whois directory, You agree DBP will review and forward communications addressed to Your domain name that are received via email, certified or traceable courier mail (such as UPS, FedEx, or DHL), or first class U.S.
postal mail.
You specifically acknowledge DBP will not forward to You first class postal mail (other than legal notices), "junk" mail or other unsolicited communications (whether delivered through email, fax, postal mail or telephone), and You further authorize DBP to either discard all such communications or return all such communications to sender unopened.
You agree to waive any and all claims arising from Your failure to receive communications directed to Your domain name but not forwarded to You by DBP.


b.
Email Forwarding


The Whois directory requires an email address for every purchased domain name registration.
When You purchase a private domain registration, DBP creates a private email address for that domain name, "@domainsbyproxy.com".
Thereafter, when messages are sent to that private email address, DBP handles them according to the email preference You selected for that particular domain name.
You have three (3) email preferences from which to choose.
You can elect to:


Have all of the messages forwarded;
 Have all of the messages filtered for Spam and then forwarded.
or
Have none of the messages forwarded.



As with all communications, You agree to waive any and all claims arising from Your failure to receive email directed to Your domain name but not forwarded to You by DBP.

c.
Notifications Regarding Correspondence and Your Obligation to Respond

When DBP receives certified or traceable courier mail or legal notices addressed to Your domain name, in most cases, DBP will attempt to forward the mail to you via email.
If You do not respond to the DBP email and/or the correspondence DBP has received regarding Your domain name registration concerns a dispute of any kind or otherwise requires immediate disposition, DBP may immediately reveal Your identity and/or cancel the DBP private registration service regarding either the domain name registration(s) in question.
This means the Whois directory will revert to displaying Your name, postal address, email address and phone number that you provided to DBP.

d.
Additional Administrative Fees


DBP reserves the right to charge You reasonable "administrative fees" or "processing fees" for (i) tasks DBP may perform outside the normal scope of its Services, (ii) additional time and/or costs DBP may incur in providing its Services, and/or (iii) Your non-compliance with the Agreement (as determined by DBP in its sole and absolute discretion).
Typical administrative or processing fee scenarios include, but are not limited to, (i) customer service issues that require additional personal time and attention.
(ii) disputes that require accounting or legal services, whether performed by DBP staff or by outside firms retained by DBP.
(iii) recouping any and all costs and fees, including the cost of Services, incurred by DBP as the result of chargebacks or other payment disputes brought by You, Your bank or Payment Method processor.
These administrative fees or processing fees will be billed to the Payment Method You have on file with Your Registrar.
You agree to waive the right to trial by jury in any proceeding that takes place relating to or arising out of this Agreement.
