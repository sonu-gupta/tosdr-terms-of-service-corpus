Pupil Cloud Terms of ServiceLast updated: 2020-01-211.
General 1.1.
Pupil Labs GmbH, registered with the German Commercial Register of the district court AG Charlottenburg (registration number HRB 155541), SanderstraÃe 28, 12047 Berlin (âPupil Labsâ.
âWeâ) offers cloud based data management services for use with an eye tracking device offered by Pupil Labs (Pupil Invisible, âPIâ) as further specified on https://www.pupil-labs.com (the âWebsiteâ) and individually offered by Pupil Labs (the âPupil Cloud Serviceâ or âPupil Cloud Servicesâ).
1.2.
All contractual relationships between Pupil Labs and any user using the Pupil Cloud Services offered by Pupil Labs (a âUserâ, âUsersâ) shall be governed by these terms of service (the âTerms of Serviceâ).
Pupil Labs may amend the Terms of Service pursuant to section 14 hereof.
1.3.
The Pupil Cloud Service offerings of Pupil Labs are available to both Consumers and Business Customers (as defined below).
For the purpose of these Terms of Service, (i) a âConsumerâ is any individual entering into the contract for a purpose not related to their business, trade or self-employed professional activity (Sec.
13 of the German Civil Code), and (ii) a âBusiness Customerâ is a User (whether an individual, company or partnership vested with legal capacity) who enters into the relevant contract in the conduct of their business or self-employed professional activity (Sec.
14 (1) of the German Civil Code).
1.4.
Standard business conditions and/or general terms and conditions of the User do not apply, regardless of whether or not Pupil Labs has expressly objected to them in a particular case. 2.
Object of contract 2.1.
Pupil Labs provides the Pupil Cloud Services as Software as a Service (SaaS).
As part of the Pupil Cloud Services, system resources will be made available to the User on a server.
2.2.
Pupil Labs is entitled to use sub-contractors in the allocation of storage space and server recourses.
Currently, Pupil Labs is using the services of Digital Ocean LLC (https://www.digitalocean.com) Hetzner Online GmbH (https://www.hetzner.de) and Amazon Web Services Inc.
(https://aws.amazon.com), but reserves the right to replace its services by similar services of third parties that are operating servers in Germany.
The use of sub-contractors does not release Pupil Labs from its obligations to full compliance with its contractual obligations hereunder.
2.3.
Pupil Labs makes available the Pupil Cloud Services at the router exit of the data center in which the server is located (âTransfer Pointâ).
The User is responsible for the Internet connection between the User and the data centre and the hardware and software required for this (e.g.
PC, network connection). 3.
Registration and use of Pupil Cloud Services 3.1.
Any use of the Pupil Cloud Services requires prior registration via the Pupil Cloud Services webinterface or in the âPupil Invisible Companion Appâ offered by Pupil Labs (the âAppâ or âInvisible Companion Appâ) that is available via the Google Play Store.
3.2.
The use of the Pupil Cloud Services in a basic version and with basic functions and within certain capacity caps is free of charge after registering.
Pupil Labs may offer the User to subscribe to a paid subscription plan to use the Pupil Cloud Services with additional functions and capacities.
3.3.
Pupil Cloud Services may be accessed via a web-browser (https://cloud.pupil-labs.com) and/or via the App.
When using the App the User is required to accept both the Terms of Use of the App (https://www.pupil-labs.com/legal/invisible-companion-terms-of-use) as well as these Terms of Service.
3.4.
Accepting of these Terms of Service by the User constitutes an offer by the User to use the Pupil Cloud Services, which shall be deemed to be accepted by Pupil Labs by making available the respective Pupil Cloud Service.
Upon the acceptance of a subscription a contract between the User and Pupil Labs is concluded (the âAgreementâ).
3.5.
The User can subscribe to additional Pupil Cloud Services on a monthly or annual basis.
All subscriptions will be automatically renewed for another month/year (as applicable) until the User or Pupil Labs terminate the subscription. 4.
Scope of Service/Availability 4.1.
The scope of the Pupil Cloud Services depends on the respective subscription plan chosen by the User as further described on the Website.
4.2.
The Pupil Cloud Services will be offered subject to availability.
Pupil Labs aims at an average service availability of 99% per calendar month.
The decisive factor is the availability of the Pupil Cloud Services at the Transfer Point.
Not included in the calculation of availability are (i) the regular maintenance windows, which can be up to 5 hours per week and are usually carried out between 22:00 and 4:00 Central European Time, (ii) times of unavailability due to mandatory unscheduled maintenance work that is necessary to eliminate malfunctions, (iii) times of unavailability due to circumstances beyond Pupil Labsâ control, in particular force majeure.
4.3.
However, if the Pupil Cloud Services are used free of charge, Pupil Labs shall only be obligated to make good efforts to make the Pupil Cloud Services accessible in accordance with the availability specified in section 4.2 above.
4.4.
The Content (as further defined below but excluding User made recordings) generated by the User using the Pupil Cloud Services will be secured by regular backups by Pupil Labs.
4.5.
Pupil Labs reserves the right to extend the Pupil Cloud Services and make improvements if they (i) serve technical progress.
or (ii) appear necessary to prevent misuse.
Further, Pupil Labs shall be entitled to change the Pupil Labs Services if (i) applicable law, court rulings or administrative decisions require such amendments, (ii) the changes are only beneficial to the User, (iii) the changes are of a purely technical or procedural nature with no material effect on the User.
All other changes to the Pupil Cloud Services shall be subject to section 14 hereof.
4.6.
Pupil Labs reserves the right to discontinue the Pupil Clouds Services in compliance with the termination regulation pursuant to section 7 hereof.
However, in this case, Pupil Labs will provide the User with an updated App, which provides all basic functionality of PI in a stand-alone fashion. 5.
Technical Requirements 5.1.
In order to use the Pupil Cloud Services, the User must frequently check all technical details and conditions on the Website, which will be updated by Pupil Labs (âTechnical Requirementsâ).
5.2.
The User is solely responsible for the fulfilment of the Technical Requirements.
Pupil Labs does not owe and/or provide any consultancy services in connection therewith if not otherwise agreed with Pupil Labs. 6.
Prices and Payment 6.1.
The User, when using a paid subscription plan, will be required to provide Pupil Labs with billing and account information for credit card, debit or other payment systems (each a âPayment Sourceâ) for which the User is authorized to approve charges to allow Pupil Labs to collect payment from the User for their purchase(s).
The User authorizes Pupil Labs to automatically and immediately bill the Payment Source when payments for subscription plans are due.
6.2.
The billing of a subscription plan is made on a pre-paid basis.
The payment source will be billed within five bank working days of the beginning of the chosen subscription period and at every renewed period of subscription respectively according to the current price list.
6.3.
Pupil Labs may amend the price list of Services at any time upon observance of statutory regulations and notifying the User about the amendment. 7.
Termination of Agreement 7.1.
The User may unsubscribe from any unpaid subscription without giving reason or notice by deleting the user account via the Pupil Cloud settings menu.
Pupil Labs shall be entitled to terminate an unpaid subscription with a notice period of three (3) months, however, not within the first two (2) years after the purchase of PI by the User.
7.2.
A paid subscription may be terminated before the end of the ordered subscription period or the end of the respective renewed period.
The User can also change the length of the ordered subscription plan before the end of their subscription period instead of terminating the Agreement.
The ordinary termination of an Agreement before expiry of the respective subscription period is hereby excluded.
7.3.
The right of termination for cause and without notice remains unaffected for both parties.
A good cause for termination shall include, but shall not be limited to, any of the following events:
7.3.1.
the User fails to comply with any applicable legal provisions;
7.3.2.
the User fails to comply with any terms of these Terms of Service, in particular section 8, and, where reasonable, Pupil Labs has given the User the opportunity to stop any misconduct but the User failed to do so .
