 Month-to-Month Subscriptions  In the event that your subscription to the Services is on a monthly basis, your subscription will be automatically renewed at the end of the monthly billing cycle unless you provide us with written notice of non-renewal during the prior calendar month.
You will be automatically charged the applicable monthly subscription fee for each month or partial month that your month-to-month subscription is in effect.
 Annual Subscriptions You may elect to purchase annual subscription.
Your annual subscription will be automatically renewed at the beginning of each subsequent anniversary year unless you give prior written notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the current year subscription. Trial Period We provide free access to the Services during the 5-days trial period starting from the moment that you activate such trial period by submitting your payment details (the âFree Trial Periodâ).
If you decide that you do not want to become a paying user of the Services upon the lapse of the Free Trial Period, you have to terminate your Services by the end of the Free Trial Period, otherwise you will become a paying user of the Services according to the subscription plan you have chosen.
You may only use this Free Trial Offer once.
The Free Trial Offer may only be used by you if you have not already used the Services.
We reserve the right to withdraw or to modify the Free Trial Offer at any time without prior notice and with no liability. Your subscription will be automatically renewed at the end of the subscription term unless you cancel it as provided in these terms.
