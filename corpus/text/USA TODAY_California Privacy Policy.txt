Definition of Personal Information For purposes of this Privacy Policy, except where a different definition is noted, "Personal Information" means information that identifies, relates to, describes, references, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer, household, or device.
Personal Information does not include:

Publicly available information from government records.
De-identified or aggregated consumer information.
Other information excluded from the CCPA's scope, such as: 
health or medical information covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA) or clinical trial data;
personal information covered by certain sector-specific privacy laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) or California Financial Information Privacy Act (FIPA), and the Driver's Privacy Protection Act of 1994.


 2.
California "Shine the Light" Law/Your California Privacy Rights California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits consumers who are California residents, to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, information about the categories of personal information (as defined in the Shine the Light law), if any, that we disclosed in the preceding calendar year to third parties for those third parties' direct marketing purposes.
Our disclosure requirements apply only if we share our consumersâ personal information with third parties for them to directly market their own products to those consumers, instead of assisting us with our own business.
If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, contact us as provided in the "Contact Us" section below.3.
CCPA Disclosures and Rights.
Do Not Sell This Section describes the categories and examples of Personal Information we collect, the sources of that Personal Information, the purposes for which we may have used that information, and the third parties with whom it may have been shared.3.1 Personal Information We CollectThe following is a list of categories of Personal Information which may have been collected from consumers or users of our Services within the last twelve (12) months.
The categories and examples provided in the chart below are those defined in the CCPA.
This does not mean that all examples of that category of Personal Information were in fact collected but reflects our good faith belief to the best of our knowledge that some of that information may have been collected about consumers.
We will update this disclosure from time to time as appropriate.
 Category Examples A.

K.
Inferences drawn from other personal information.Profile reflecting a personâs preferences, characteristics, psychological trends, predispositions, behavior, attitudes, intelligence, abilities, and aptitudes.
In response to a verified consumer request for categories of information collected, we will investigate and provide an individualized response to the consumer, and will not merely refer the consumer to our general practices outlined in this Privacy Policy unless our response would be the same for all consumers and this Privacy Policy discloses all the information that is otherwise required for the response to such a consumer request.3.2 Sources of Personal Information.


Directly from you.
For example, during account registration from forms you complete, subscriptions you purchase or comments you provide on our Websites.
Indirectly from you.
For example, from observing your actions on our Website.
From third parties.
For example, third party social networking providers and advertising companies, our affiliates and service providers who provide services or information to us.
If you do not want us to collect information from social networks, you should review and adjust your privacy settings on those networks as desired before linking or connecting them to our Websites.
â¢From publicly available sources.
For example, online database searches.
 3.3 Use and Disclosure ("Sale") of Personal InformationThe CCPA broadly defines the term "sale" to mean:
"Selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumerâs personal information by the business to a third party for valuable consideration.
or (B) sharing orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumerâs personal information with a third party, whether for valuable consideration or for no consideration, for the third partyâs commercial purposes."
Within this meaning, we may have disclosed (as that term is defined by the CCPA) Personal Information in the categories below from consumers and users of our Services within the last twelve months where such disclosure may fall within the CCPAâs definition of a "sale." When we disclose that we may have sold Personal Information, it means that we may have received some kind of benefit to our company in return for sharing Personal Information, it does not necessarily mean we received any money in exchange.
The categories below are those defined in the CCPA.
This does not mean that all examples of that category of Personal Information were in fact "sold" but reflects our good faith belief to the best of our knowledge that some of that information may have been shared for value in return.
We will update this disclosure from time to time as appropriate.
In response to a verified consumer request for categories of Personal Information "sold," we will investigate and provide an individualized response to the consumer, and will not merely refer the consumer to our general practices outlined in this Privacy Policy unless our response would be the same for all consumers and this Privacy Policy discloses all the information that is otherwise required for the response to such a consumer request.Category

You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.
The verifiable consumer request must provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.
This means that in making a request you may be required to: provide your email and phone number, customer information, and/or account sign-up authentication or other information needed to verify your identity depending on the sensitivity of the Personal Information that is the subject of the request.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you.
If we are unable to verify your identity, we reserve the right to deny the request.

Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.
We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestorâs identity or authority to make the request.
If you choose to use an authorized agent to submit a request to know or a request to delete your information, we may require that you: (1) provide the authorized agent written permission to do so.
and (2) verify your own identity directly with us.
We will not require these steps if we have received proof that you have provided the authorized agent with a power of attorney pursuant to California Probate Code sections 4000 to 4465.
We may deny a request from an agent that does not submit proof that they have been authorized by you to act on your behalf.
We may also deny a request from an agent that does not meet the requirements for authorized agents under the CCPA.
Once we have verified your identity (and your authorized agent, as applicable), we will respond to your request as appropriate.
To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may charge a reasonable fee to comply with your request.
If we are unable to complete your request in whole or in part, we will let you know why.3.6.2 Response Timing and FormatWe use good faith efforts to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days after its receipt.
If we need more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and the needed extension period in writing.
If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account.
If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by email.
Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer requestâs receipt.
If we cannot comply with any portion of a request, the response we provide will also explain why, if applicable.
For data portability requests, we will select a commercially reasonable format to provide your Personal Information that is commonly useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance, but we do not guarantee that all formats are useable in all media.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.
If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.3.6.3 Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of CCPA Privacy RightsWe will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.

Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.
Details of the incentive, if applicable, including how to opt in or out and the basis for the value of the incentive, will be provided prior to or at the time of your participation.3.7 Do Not Sell My Personal Information.The CCPA requires businesses to provide a web page where consumers can opt out of the ''sale" of their Personal Information.

California Do Not Track Disclosures We do not currently respond to browser Do Not Track signals or other browser or device based mechanisms that provide a method to opt out of the collection of information across the networks of websites and online services in which we participate.
Unless and until the law requires us to respond to browser Do Not Track signals, we will not respond to those signals as an opt out, but if we do so in the future, we will describe how we do so here.
However, we do provide consumers with the ability to manage their cookie choices as described in our Cookie Policy.

Do we use "Cookies"? Yes.
Cookies and similar technologies are small files that a website or its service provider transfers to a computerâs hard drive through a Web browser (if the user allows) that enables the websiteâs or service providerâs systems to recognize the userâs browser and capture and remember certain information.

For more information about the cookies and other technologies that we, our affiliates and third party providers and advertisers use on our Websites, please read our Cookie Policy.6.
Security We use commercially reasonable procedures and various technical, administrative and physical safeguards to help protect the confidentiality of Personal Information.
However, no data transmitted over the Internet or stored or maintained by us or our third-party service providers can be 100% secure given the reality of communication via technology systems.
Therefore, although we believe the measures implemented by us are commercially reasonable and reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved, we do not promise or guarantee, and you should not expect, that your Personal Information or private communications sent to us over those systems will always remain private or secure.
We are not responsible for the circumvention of any privacy settings or security features.
