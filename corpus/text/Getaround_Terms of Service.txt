DWU Partners using the Service to participate in the Program may only reserve DWU-Eligible Cars to do so.
DWU-Eligible Cars are visible to DWU Partners by accessing the âDrive With Uberâ section of the Getaround Software.
DWU Partners may not reserve non-DWU-Eligible Cars to participate in the Program.Program Use OnlyDWU-Eligible Cars may be used only to participate in the Program (âProgram Useâ).
They may not be used for any purpose besides participation in the Program, including without limitation the following:


Provision of passenger transportation services or food delivery services to third parties using an app other than the Uber apps;
Personal use beyond that which is strictly related to the provision of passenger transportation services pursuant to the Program.

2) the cost of any trip extensions.
and 3) any Standard Fees applicable to the initial reservation or trip extensions.
The initial reservation price, and the cost of any trip extensions, are based solely on the DWU-Eligible Car being used for the Program.
The Trip Price is charged when the initial reservation for that trip (the âDWU Tripâ) is made, or when extensions for that trip have been applied.
Earnings received while driving with Uber have no bearing on the Trip Price.Trip ParkingThe parking spots occupied by DWU-Eligible Cars at their designated parking locations are reserved solely for DWU-Eligible Cars.
Non-DWU-Eligible Cars may never occupy any parking spot reserved for Program Use, regardless of how long the occupancy lasts or the duration of any DWU Trip.

Non-DWU-Eligible Cars occupying such parking spots will be removed at their ownersâ expense, which may include towing, storage, and citation fees related to such removal.Trip ExtensionsNotwithstanding any communications or statements to the contrary, a DWU-Eligible Car may only be accessed, unlocked, used, driven, or otherwise operated (collectively, âOperatedâ) by the DWU Partner who has reserved such DWU-Eligible Car, and only for so long as such DWU Partnerâs payment method can be successfully charged for the Trip Price of the DWU Trip (including any trip extensions).
Any attempted or actual Operation of a DWU-Eligible Car in violation of the foregoing, or contrary to Program Use, regardless of whether a Return Request (defined below) has been submitted, will result in: 1) prevention of such DWU Partnerâs further Operation of the DWU-Eligible Car, with such DWU Partner responsible for all towing, impound, storage, citation, and recovery costs and fees necessary to ensure such prevention.

Such cars are referred to herein as Weekly Eligible Cars.
DWU Trips reserved in week-long increments are referred to as DWU Weekly Trips.
The minimum length or duration of a DWU Weekly Trip is 7 consecutive calendar days (the âDWU Weekly Trip Minimumâ).
The maximum length or duration of a DWU Weekly Trip is 28 consecutive calendar days, including the day on which the DWU Weekly Trip started (the âDWU Weekly Trip Maximumâ).

Once a DWU Weekly Trip has commenced, it cannot be converted into a standard (hourly) DWU Trip.
DWU Weekly Trips may only be extended in specific, predetermined increments, and only until the DWU Weekly Trip Maximum has been reached.
Subject to applicable Return Requests (defined below), DWU Weekly Trips are not eligible for refunds or promotional credits attributable to unused time.

The DWU Weekly Trip Maximum shall include: 1) any trip extensions applied to the initial reservation as the result of a DWU Partnerâs continued Operation of a Weekly Eligible Car.
and 2) any time period during which a Weekly Eligible Car has not yet been returned to its designated parking location, even if a trip extension has not been applied to such time period.
Provided that a DWU Weekly Trip has not exceeded the DWU Weekly Trip Maximum, trip extensions may be applied to such DWU Weekly Trip (either by you or by Getaround, as necessary) until such DWU Weekly Trip Maximum has been reached or the Weekly Eligible Car has been returned to its designated parking location (as described in the profile of the Weekly Eligible Car), whichever occurs earlier.

Once the DWU Weekly Trip Maximum has been reached, if the Weekly Eligible Car has not been returned to its designated parking location, the DWU Partner who is Operating the Weekly Eligible Car pursuant to such DWU Weekly Trip must immediately return the Weekly Eligible Car to its designated parking location, regardless of any trip extensions applied or automated notifications sent by Getaround.
Failure to observe the requirements of this section will result in immediate and permanent termination of such DWU Partnerâs Account with the Service.
Nothing in this section should be construed so as to allow a DWU Partner to Operate a DWU-Eligible Car or Weekly Eligible Car if such DWU Partnerâs payment method has not been successfully charged for the Trip Price of the DWU Trip or DWU Weekly Trip, as applicable, regardless of whether the DWU Weekly Trip Maximum has been reached.

While a DWU Weekly Trip is in progress, the Weekly Eligible Car being Operated pursuant to such trip may not remain parked at its designated parking location for any length of time.
If such Weekly Eligible Car is parked at its designated parking location during a DWU Weekly Trip, it will be deemed to have been returned by its DWU Partner, and Getaround may end the DWU Weekly Trip in question.

The distinctions in this section between DWU-Eligible Cars and Weekly Eligible Cars, and DWU Trips and DWU Weekly Trips, are made solely for the purposes of this section.
All other references to DWU-Eligible Cars or DWU Trips in this DWU Policy shall be understood to include Weekly Eligible Cars and DWU Weekly Trips, respectively.Return of DWU-Eligible CarsFrom time to time, as required by vehicle safety and repairs, to fulfill the provisions of this DWU Policy and our Terms of Service, or to otherwise comply with applicable laws, Getaround may, in its sole discretion, request the return of a DWU-Eligible Car to its designated parking location (each, a âReturn Requestâ) before the DWU Trip in such car is scheduled to be completed.
Return Requests may be made by oral or written communication.
You acknowledge and agree that your immediate and complete cooperation with such Return Requests is required under this DWU Policy, regardless of the nature of the Return Request, the location of the DWU-Eligible Car when the Return Request is made, or the length or duration of the DWU Trip in question.
A Return Request is deemed received upon delivery by Getaround.
Upon receipt of a Return Request, you shall, as soon as practicable, return the DWU-Eligible Car to its designated parking location in accordance with this DWU Policy and our Guest Policy.

You may request a promotional credit equal to the cost of the portion of the DWU Trip unable to be completed because of a Return Request, provided that: 1) you have strictly complied with the Return Request, and 2) you did not cause or contribute to the Return Request, in whole or in part.
An example of causing or contributing to a Return Request includes (but would not be limited to) Operation of a DWU-Eligible Car in violation of the Trip Extensions section, above, Nothing in this section shall be construed so as to require Getaround to submit Return Requests to ensure the timely, scheduled return of DWU-Eligible Cars at the completion of DWU Trips.

DWU Partners shall not be issued any promotional credits or refunds in exchange for the early return of a DWU-Eligible Car that has not been returned pursuant to a Return Request.
DWU-Eligible Cars that are returned before their scheduled trip end time cannot be unlocked, accessed, or otherwise Operated by DWU Partners once they have been returned.FuelDWU-Eligible Cars must be returned with a full tank of gas at the end of each DWU Trip, notwithstanding the fact that the tank may not have been full when you picked up the car.
DWU Partners who purchase more fuel than they used during a DWU Trip will receive a refund from their Trip Price equivalent to the cost of the excess fuel purchased (the âFuel Refundâ).
The Fuel Refund is calculated by comparing the amount of fuel present at the start of your DWU Trip, the amount of fuel remaining at the end of your DWU Trip, and the cost of fuel as reflected in the average market fuel price.
If the refund amount for a DWU Trip exceeds the initial reservation price for that trip, the DWU Partner will receive a Fuel Refund up to the amount of the initial reservation price, and a Getaround promotional code equal to the excess of the fuel cost over the initial reservation price.

DWU Partners who fail to return DWU-Eligible Cars with a full tank of gas will be charged for the amount of gas not refilled (the âFuel Chargeâ) in accordance with our Fee and Commission Schedule.
The Fuel Charge is calculated based on how much fuel is determined to have been used but not refilled during your DWU Trip, the capacity of the fuel tank of the DWU-Eligible Car you reserved, and the cost of fuel as reflected in the average market fuel price.TollsAll DWU-Eligible Cars are registered with Getaround Autotoll, which is a video-based tolling system that automatically detects when you pass through a toll plaza or electronically tolled lane.
You understand and agree that your payment method on file with the Service will be automatically charged for the price of each toll you incur, along with a $1.50 processing fee for each such toll, as specified in our Fee and Commission Schedule.

Tolls and processing fees are charged independently of the timing or amount of any corresponding reimbursements provided to DWU Partners.
You understand and acknowledge that charges and processing fees for a given toll may be charged up to 90 days after the date on which the underlying toll was incurred.DisplaysDWU-Eligible Cars may come equipped with third-party electronic displays ("Displays") that display advertisements promoted by third parties.
The Displays are permanently affixed to the DWU-Eligible Cars and are considered integral components of those cars.
They may not be damaged, defaced, obstructed, covered, unplugged, or otherwise tampered with.
