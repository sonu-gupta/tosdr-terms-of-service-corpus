Introduction
Your privacy is important to us.&nbsp.
We understand that you are aware of and care about your own personal privacy interests, and we take that seriously.
This Privacy Notices sets forth your privacy rights and applies to personal data we may collect:

Through our free, ad-supported website products, services and platforms;
Through our free, ad-supported and subscription-based mobile applications; 
Through emails and other electronic communications between you and us (with your consent, where required by law).
and
Through any software provided on or in connection with our website products, services, apps, and emails (collectively, the Services).

The Childrenâs Privacy &amp.
Student Data section of this Privacy Notice applies to personal data we may collect through our BDL Institutional, subscription-based products, services and platforms (collectively, the Institutional Services).
Your decision to use any of our Services and provide your personal data is voluntary.
We indicate on our online, mobile, and other registration forms what types of personal data are requested.
You may choose not to submit requested information online, or may choose to restrict the use of cookies (see our Cookie Policy and âYour Rights &amp.
Choices.
Opt-Outâ below for more information), but that may limit the services we are able to provide to you.
Except for our Institutional Services, the Services are a network of general audience sites, and are not targeted to, and do not knowingly collect personal data from, minors under 16 years of age.
We request that these individuals do not provide personal data through the Services.
Please see âCOPPA Complianceâ below for more information.
We recognize that information privacy is an ongoing responsibility, and so we will from time to time update this Privacy Notice as we undertake new personal data practices or adopt new privacy policies.
If you have concerns, please contact our data protection officer at dpo@eb.com.
COPPA Compliance
In accordance with the Federal Childrenâs Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly solicit, nor will we accept, personally identifiable information from users known to be under thirteen (13) years of age without the consent of their educational institution or the childâs parent or guardian.
We do, however, use COPPA-compliant, third party services that automatically collect or share certain information and usage data with us to support our internal operations as described in this Privacy Notice.   
If an educational institution with students that are under thirteen (13) years of age uses our Institutional Servcies, the educational institution also may provide us with personally identifiable information about its students.
We use student information to provide the subscribed-to Institutional Service to the educational institution and its students as provided in the Childrenâs Privacy &amp.
Student Data section below.
If you believe that we have collected personal information from someone under the age of 13, please contact us at: privacy@eb.com.
Information that You Provide to Us

Typically, payment card information is provided directly by a User, via the Services, into the PCI/DSS-compliant payment processing service to which the Britannica subscribes, and Britannica does not, itself, process or store your card information.

Other Information.
Cookie Policy
Like other commercial websites, Britannica and our authorized partners use cookies (small files transferred from a website to its visitorsâ hard drives or browsers for record-keeping purposes), including essential, functional and analytical cookies, and other similar information-gathering technologies throughout our Services to collect certain information automatically and store it in log files for a variety of legitimate business interests and purposes.
This information may include (but is not limited to) internet protocol (IP) addresses, mobile device identifiers, the region or general location where your computer or device is accessing the internet, browser type, operating system and other usage information about your use of our Services, including a history of the pages you view.
Web beacons, tags, and scripts may be used on our Services or in email or other electronic communications we send to you.
These assist us in delivering cookies, counting visits to our Websites, understanding usage and campaign effectiveness and determining whether an email has been opened and acted upon.
We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by our third-party service providers on an individual and aggregated basis.
Britannica and its authorized partners use cookies, beacons, and other similar technologies on our Services for legitimate business interests that enable us to allow you to navigate our websites, use our Services, and access secure areas of our Services.&nbsp.
We also use these technologies for statistical purposes and to analyze and improve the use of our Services and prepare aggregated usage reports.
As described below, on our free, ad-supported Services, we use these technologies for legitimate business purposes to provide standard advertising controls, determine user response to advertisements and promotions, and deliver targeted advertisements that we or our partners believe will be of most interest to you.
We may also use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website, analyze trends, track visitor movements, and gather broad demographic information that assists us in identifying visitor preferences.
We have a legitimate interest in understanding how our users, subscribers, customers, and potential customers use our Services.
Among other things, this assists us in providing more relevant products and services.&nbsp.
Please refer to our Cookie Policy and âYour Rights &amp.

Opt-Outâ below for more information.
You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.
However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our Services.
For more information about cookies, please visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org/.


Analytics &amp.
usage data



For our legitimate business interests, we may process your personal information for analytic purposes on all of our Services as described in this section. 

Together with Google Analytics, we use cookies and software logs to monitor the use of the Services and to gather non-personal information about visitors to the site.
These monitoring systems allow us to track general information about our visitors, such as the type of browsers (for example, Firefox or Internet Explorer), the operating systems (for instance, Windows or Macintosh), or the Internet providers (for instance, Comcast) they use.
This information is used for statistical and market research purposes to tailor content to usage patterns and to provide services requested by our customers.
We also have implemented certain Google Analytics Advertiser features.
These tools use cookies to collect and store standard Internet log and visitor information on our behalf, including information about what pages you visit, how long you are on our sites, how you got here, and what you click on during your visit.
This Google Analytics data is not tied to personal information, so this information cannot be used to identify who you are.
We use the data provided by Google Analytics to develop our services and content around our User demographics, interests, and behavior on our Services.
You can opt-out of this Google Analytics Advertiser feature using the Ads Settings located at https://www.google.com/settings/ads.
In addition, you can use the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on to disable tracking by Google Analytics.&nbsp.
To delete these cookies, please see your browserâs privacy settings or follow the above instructions.
We may also receive other data about your use of our Services from other sources.&nbsp.
This information may include (but is not limited to) information about your activities across unrelated websites and mobile applications, information about the possible relationships between different browsers and devices and information that we receive from our third-party service providers.
We may add this information to the information to the information we have already collect through our Services.


Advertising on our free, ad-supported Services



We participate in the IAB Transparency &amp.
Consent Framework and comply with its Specifications and Policies.
Our Consent Managment Platform (CMP) is OneTrust LLC with the CMP identification number 28.  


 


For our legitimate business interests we process and disclose your personal information collected automatically through our free, ad-supported Services for advertising, including interest-based advertising, as described in this section.
Our free Services are supported by advertising. 
As more fully described below, in order to monetize our free, ad-supported Services, we work with third parties to display advertising on the Services. 
Our subscription websites are paid for by subscription fees, and are ad-free, as are our paid-for mobile applications. 
If you would like to avoid all advertisements, sign up for a subscription or upgrade your mobile application. 


 

We work with DigiTrust to set a cookie in your browser to enable us and DigiTrust Partners to collect web viewing data that includes visits to a Britannica Service and other non-affiliated websites over time.
This data may be used to infer whether you share interests with other Users and deliver advertising relevant to those inferences.
This type of advertising is called interest-based or behavioral advertising.
You can exercise choice about the collection of data in this way for interest-based, behavioral advertising by visiting the Digital Advertising Allianceâs choice page and opting out from DigiTrust or use one of the links provided below.
Opting out from DigiTrust will stop DigiTrust Partners from using the DigiTrust identifier.
Through the DAA choice page, you may make other choices for companies that participate in the DAA, some of which are DigiTrust Partners.
Our ad-supported Services also rely on third-party service providers to do things like: take user-level information, anonymize it through hashing (a hashed email address might look something like this: e820bb4aba5ad74c5a6ff1aca16641f6) and match it against other anonymized, people-based identifiers â doing this helps us serve you personalized, relevant advertisements.&nbsp.
Specifically, when you use our ad-supported Services, we may share information that we may collect from you, including your email (in hashed form), IP address or information about your browser or operating system, with our third-party service providers, Index Exchange (IX) and LiveRamp Inc.
and its group companies (âLiveRampâ).
IX and LiveRamp may use our first party cookie on your browser to match your shared information to their marketing databases in order to provide back a pseudonymous privacy-centric identifier for our use in real time bidding in digital advertising.
These third parties may in turn link further demographic or interest-based information to your browser.
You have the choice to opt-out of the use of your data by third-party service providers for this purpose at any time.&nbsp.
Please find more information about opting out below.
Please note that limiting third-party cookies via your browser controls does not prevent our first-party cookies from being set in this way.
Also, please know, if you opt-out of interest-based advertising you will continue to receive ads on our free, ad-supported Services, but not behaviorally targeted ads.
Also, if you opt-out of Britannicaâs practices, you may continue to receive interest-based advertising through other companies.&nbsp.
If you erase your browserâs cookies, you may need to perform this process again.


Anonymous 
data


Anonymous aggregated data may be provided to other companies we do business with for statistical purposes.
For example, we may report to advertisers that a certain percentage of our siteâs visitors are adults between the ages of 25 and 35.


Device identifiers



For our legitimate business interests, we process your device identifiers as described in this section. 


 When you use a mobile device like a tablet or cell phone to access our Services, we may access and monitor one or more âdevice identifiers.â Device identifiers are small data files associated with your mobile device that uniquely identify your mobile device.
A device identifier may deliver information to us or a third party partner about how you browse and use the services and may help us or others provide reports or personalized ads.
Some features of the services may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.

Third-party activities


For our legitimate business interests, and with your consent where this is required, we may process data collected by us for advertising, including interest-based advertising, as described in this section.

As described above, in order to monetize our free, ad-supported Services, we work with third-party advertisers and advertising networks that use cookies and other similar technologies to target ads served to our free, ad-supported Services.
Our Privacy Notice does not cover the use of data that you provide directly to advertisers or third-party partners.
that usage is governed by the advertiserâs or third party partnerâs privacy policy.
What does it mean to âserve adsâ? When you visit a website, your Internet browser transmits a ârequestâ to the computer that hosts the website (the âhost serverâ) requesting that server to send you (or âserveâ) the Web page that you are seeking.
Most Web pages contain components that are pulled from different sources, for example, a Web page at a news site may get its weather section from one provider, its sports results from a different source, and advertisements from other servers.
Our Web pages contain coding that directs your browser to fill the ad spaces on the Web pages with content served by advertisers and networks of advertisers to whom we have sold the ad spaces.
The advertisers and networks use cookies and beacons to help manage ad delivery and frequency and to identify audience segment(s) for customized advertising (âtargetingâ).
These cookies are used to identify your IP address, so that when you visit another website using the same advertising network, the network will recognize the cookie as one of its own, read the information on the cookie (the record of which sites in the network you have visited) and serve you an ad that you might be interested in, based on your past visits to other sites in the network.
Advertising targeted based on past Web surfing is known as âbehavioral advertising.â
Britannica does not provide any personal information to third-party advertisers about visitors to the Services.
Our Privacy Notice does not cover the use of information that they may have collected from you by third parties on other sites.
If you would like to learn more about behavioral advertising or to opt-out of having this information used by companies that are part of the Network Advertising Initiative to deliver targeted ads, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org.
Many of the same companies are members of the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising.
You can learn more and opt-out of receiving targeted ads from them at http://www.aboutads.info/choices.
Some advertising networks require that we specifically list their opt-out links below.
When you opt-out of a network, you may receive a âopt-outâ cookie so that the network will know not to assign you new cookies in the future.
You will continue to receive ads from that network, but not behaviorally targeted ads.
If you erase your browserâs cookies, you may need to perform this process again.

Exponential Interactive, Inc.
has a legitimate interest to collect and profile personal data in the form of IP address and cookie ID from users on our website in order to provide targeted online advertising and ad measurement.
For more details including opt-out requests, access requests, or complaints, please review their privacy policy or contact their data protection officer via privacy@exponential.com.

How we respond to âDo Not Trackâ signals

When you visit a website in any browser, you automatically share information with that website, such as your IP address, and other standard PC information.
If the website contains content provided by a third-party website (for example a web measurement tools such as a web beacon or scripts), some information about you may be automatically sent to the content provider.&nbsp.
This type of arrangement has several benefits, such as allowing you to access third-party content from our Services conveniently.
Some internet browsers or other tools include âDo Not Trackâ (DNT) features that, when turned on, send a signal to websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked across websites over time.
However, since no technology standard for DNT signals has been developed or adopted to date, our Services do not currently respond to DNT signals.
Childrenâs Privacy &amp.
Student Data

A note to minors: If you are under the age of 16, please get permission from your parent/legal guardian or school before using the Services.
If we discover that we have collected any personally identifiable information from a child under the age of 16 without the proper consents required by law, we will suspend the associated account and/or remove that information from our database as soon as possible. 
Britannica does not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from or about children under 16, except as permitted by law or otherwise provided herein.
If we discover we have received any information from a child under 16 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately.
If you believe Britannica has any information from or about anyone under 16, please email us at privacy@eb.com.

Student Data

If you are a student with access to our Institutional Services through an Institutional Subscription License Agreement between your school institution and us, your student service data is processed in a way that is COPPA- and FERPA-compliant.&nbsp.
As you use this site, you will enter student data or interact with student data that has already been entered.
Under the terms of our contracts with school institutions, we agree to act as a âSchool Officialâ as defined by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), meaning that we:

Perform an institutional service or function for which the school or district would otherwise use its own employees;
Have been determined to meet the criteria set forth in the schoolâs or districtâs annual notification of FERPA rights for being a School Official with a legitimate educational interest in the education records;
Are under the direct control of the school or district with regard to the use and maintenance of education records.
and
Use education records only for authorized purposes and will not re-disclose from education records to other parties (unless we have specific authorization from the school or district to do so and it is otherwise permitted by FERPA)

However, FERPA requires limitations on disclosure of those records and implementation of appropriate security measures to protect those records.
To help your school district comply with FERPA, we have adopted certain practices, and require that educators using this site fulfill certain responsibilities to safeguard student data.
The following statement explains our practices and your responsibilities regarding the student data you enter on this site.

Student Data Security &amp.
Confidentiality Statement


Purposes of Data Entry

You control what student data is entered on this site and you retain ownership of the student data at all times.
Student data entered on this site should be limited to information that is relevant to the legitimate educational purpose of improving student performance.
We will not ask you to enter, and you are instructed not to enter, data about students that is not relevant to this legitimate educational purpose.
Therefore, only a minimum amount of personally identifiable student data required for the setup of the system is requested.
Additional data, not specific to the student, is also required to complete system setup, including the teacher first and last name, class name, grade level, and school name.

Use, Disclosure, and Storage

We will use the student data to provide the services to your school institution.
We will not keep the student data after you or the school district instructs us to delete it.
We will only disclose student data to authorized employees or representatives of the school institution, and will not knowingly disclose the student data to any third person without express written authorization.
When, at the request of the school institution, we acquire assessment or other information, including personally identifiable student data, from a third party source we treat that information with the same confidentiality and security safeguards as though it were provided directly by the school institution.
Additional agreements may be required by the third party to authorize transmission of data to us.
Your school institution may from time to time request that we provide student data to third parties of its choosing.
We will do so with written authorization, which acknowledges that we are providing that data as the requesting institutionâs agent and that once the data is received by the third party, we no longer has any control over the use or disposition of the data.
We may also use aggregated data in our research, product development, and marketing.
That aggregated, non-personally identifiable data (e.g., summary or statistical data) may be shared with third parties.
However, we do not use personally identifiable student data to market any products or services directly to students or their parents.
In the event that we wish, from time to time, to release aggregated data that identifies a school or school district by name, we will enter into a separate agreement with the institution to authorize release and publication.
We do not utilize third parties to provide products and do not share your student data with any third parties.
Security 
of Your Information
Any personally identifiable information collected through this site is stored on limited-access servers.
We will maintain safeguards to protect these servers and the information they store.&nbsp.
In addition, to help protect the privacy of data and personally identifiable information you transmit through use of our Services, we maintain physical, technical and administrative safeguards.
We update and test our security technology on an ongoing basis.
We strive to restrict access to your personal data to those employees who need to know that information to provide benefits or services to you.
In addition, we strive to all our employees about the importance of confidentiality and maintaining the privacy and security of your information.

We may share your personal information with the following categories of third parties:

The Company and our advertising partners collect the personal information identified above (such as the cookies stored on your browser, the advertising identifier on your mobile device, or the IP address of your device) when you visit our websites, apps, and other products, services and platforms, or open our emails.
We, and our partners, use this information to tailor and deliver ads to you on our websites, apps, emails, and other products, services and platforms, or to help tailor ads to you when you visit othersâ sites (or use othersâ apps).
To tailor ads that may be more relevant to you, we and/or our partners may share the information we collect with third parties.

Your Rights and Choices

The CCPA provides consumers (California residents) with specific rights regarding their personal information.
This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.


Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights 


You have the right to request that the Company disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months.
Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you:

The categories of personal information we collected about you.
The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.
Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information.
The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.
The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called a data portability request).
If we disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, we will identify the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained.


Deletion Request Rights

You have the right to request that the Company delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions.
Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.
We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:

Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.
Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.
Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.
Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.
Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal.
Penal Code Â§ 1546 et.
seq.).
Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the informationâs deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the researchâs achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.
Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.
Comply with a legal obligation.
Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.



Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights 


To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:

Calling us at (800) 323-1229.
Monday-Friday, 8:00 a.m.
to 6:00 p.m.
(U.S.
Central Time)
Emailing us at dpo@eb.com

Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information.
You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.
You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.
The verifiable consumer request must:

Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.
Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.
We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestorâs identity or authority to make the request.


Response Timing and Format 


We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt.
If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing in accordance with CCPA requirements.
If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account.
If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.
 Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer requestâs receipt.
The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.
For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
 We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.
If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.


Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights


If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us to not sell your personal information at any time (the âright to opt-outâ).
We do not sell the personal information of consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the âright to opt-inâ) from either the consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age.
Consumers who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time.
To exercise the right to opt-out, you (or your authorized representative) may submit a request to us by emailing privacy@eb.com.
Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize personal information sales.
However, you may change your mind and opt back in to personal information sales at any time by clearing cookies from your browser or emailing privacy@eb.com.
 You do not need to create an account with us to exercise your opt-out rights.
We will only use personal information provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request.

Non-Discrimination

We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.
Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:

Deny you goods or services.
Charge you different prices or rates for like-goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
Provide you a different level or quality of like-goods or services.
Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for like-goods or services or a different level or quality of like-goods or services.

However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels.
 Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your Personal Informationâs value and contain written terms that describe the programâs material aspects.
Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.
 We currently provide the following financial incentives:
