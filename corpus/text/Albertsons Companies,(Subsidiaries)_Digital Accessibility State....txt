Albertsons Commitment to Accessibility

It is the commitment of the Albertsons Companies (âAlbertsonsâ) to provide websites, mobile applications, and other digital content that are accessible to all customers, including those with disabilities.
We have adopted the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level AA as our Accessibility Standard and are continually working to maintain our web pages and apps in substantial conformance with that Standard, as well as to provide the best possible user experience for everyone.
We do this through our regular testing as well as our partnership with the American Foundation for the Blind.
