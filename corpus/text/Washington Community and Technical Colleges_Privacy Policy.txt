Personal information includes such things as an individual's name, address, and phone number.

If you choose not to participate in these activities, your choice will in no way effect your ability to use any other feature of this website.

If personal information is requested on the website or volunteered by the user, state law and the federal Privacy Act of 1974 may protect it.

If you believe that your personal information is being used for a purpose other than what was intended when submitted, you may contact us.
In all cases, we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.

Exceptions are provided by both state and federal laws.
