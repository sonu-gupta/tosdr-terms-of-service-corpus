START OF PRIVACY POLICY Information Not Collected &nbsp.
 (yes, you heard it right, Information  Not Collected ) 
 When you watch a video at PokeTube, we don't know who you are and there is no way to tie the things you are watching.
When you access a website, your Web browser automatically sends information about your computer.
(e.g.
your User agent and IP address.)
 Because this information could be used to link you to your peronsal information, we do not log (store) it at all.
This is a very unusual practice, but we feel it is an important step to protect your privacy.
It is unusual for a reason.
most server software auto-stores this information, so you have to go out of your way not to store it.
At PokeTube, no cookies are used by default.
PokeTube Doesnt use cookies (See the storage tab yourself!).

 At PokeTube, we dont collect your personal information or share it.
We dont collect your IP address.
Your device metadata (e.g.
device resolution, OS etc.) is not collected in anyway.

 Our servers are secured with SHA-384 Signature Algorithm.
meaning we cant see the videos you watching, things you search, or things you do.
Learn more About hash Algorithms here.
 We migth use third party services on PokeTube, but third party request on PokeTube is proxied by default.
no third party can see wat the hell ru doing on PokeTube.
We do this by proxying the requests via a whole diffrent server, so no third party can see you.

 Information Collected &nbsp.
We use a tool called Piwik (A free software Web analytics system, see piwik.org) to collect information.
By information we mean, aggregated data about things such as the number of visits daily/weekly/monthly to PokeTube.

 This data can't be used to identify you or your device or to learn anything about you individually.
This Information thats being collected is anonymous and only analyzed in aggregate.
It will never identify you or your machine.
 This Process does not use cookies in any way.
If you want to opt out (for some reason, we still dont know why lol), Click the "Opt out Of Metrics" Button on the bottom rigth side of the player.
No data that identifies you or that can be linked to you as an individual is collected on poketube.
We Also save searches, but again, not in a personally identifiable way, as we do not store IP addresses or unique User agent strings.
We use aggregate, non-personal search data.

Finally, if you Subscribe to updates on PokeTube status site, we may be store your email to send you email notifications whenever we create, update or resolve an incident.
you can also use a Private Duck Address to keep your email identity hidden and a email that can be easily deactivated.
Subscribing to updates is optional to do so ! Information Shared &nbsp.
