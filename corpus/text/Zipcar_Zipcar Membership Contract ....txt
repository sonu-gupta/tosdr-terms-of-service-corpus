You may review your total estimated reservation cost before you confirm your reservation.
Certain provisions of this Contract and the Rules related to your use of Zipcar vehicles and services may vary based upon the jurisdiction in which you reserve or use a Zipcar vehicle.
For example, the third party liability Zipcar provides may vary based upon the country (or, if applicable, by province or state) in which you are utilizing the Zipcar vehicle and certain different or additional fees and policies may apply.

3.2



Satisfying the foregoing criteria does not automatically give an applicant the right to become a Zipcar Member.
Acceptance of the applicant's membership is subject to approval by Zipcar in its sole discretion and, without limiting the foregoing, membership may be denied based upon other factors determined by Zipcar in its sole discretion.
In addition, even if approved for membership, a Member may be restricted from driving certain Zipcar vehicles at Zipcarâs sole discretion, or reasons including, but not limited to, the Member's driving or membership history or Zipcarâs service offerings.


4.
Fees and Responsibilities of the Member



4.1



The Member agrees to pay Zipcar all applicable driving record/insurance verification, application, membership and similar fees associated with the Member's driving/membership plan.
Such fees (if applicable) are not refundable, regardless of whether or not the application is accepted by Zipcar or a Member's membership terminates and new verification/application fees may be payable if a new membership application is resubmitted more than thirty (30) days after a Member's account with Zipcar is closed.
If your driving/membership plan includes an annual or monthly fee, your initial membership fee will be charged to you within five days of membership approval, regardless of whether you activate your Zipcard, and will only be refundable if you terminate your membership within the first thirty (30) days following membership approval.
Certain restrictions apply.
If at any time you wish to cancel your Zipcar membership, call us at 1-866-4ZIPCAR.
Certain membership plans (including for example, monthly plans, Extra Value Plans ("EVP") or Wheel Deal Plans) renew every month.
Following approval of the Member by Zipcar for a monthly renewing plan, the Member's credit or debit card will be automatically charged every month, even if the Member's Zipcard is not activated.
Monthly payments associated with such plans are non-refundable and, for EVP and Wheel Deal Plans, the driving credit associated with the monthly fee expires at the end of each month if not used and may not be carried into future months.
EVP and Wheel Deal plans are optional and may be changed/opted-out of at any time from the Member's account page or by calling 1-866-4ZIPCAR.


4.2



The Member is required to pay all fees and costs incurred (including fees and costs incurred by Associate Members) when due, including, without limitation, application fees, driving record/insurance verification fees, membership fees (which are automatically charged when due), driving charges (including but not limited to mileage overage and surcharge and/or toll fees), sales and other taxes and levies, and other costs and fees as may be detailed in the Rules and Schedules or the Member's driving/membership plan.
Members are billed for amounts due via credit or debit card or other means as established by Zipcar.
Any Member account which is past due will be suspended.
however, any reservations booked in advance shall still be charged to the Member if not timely cancelled by the Member.
If payment of any amount due is rejected by the credit or debit card provided by the Member, membership, and the use of Zipcar's services, may be suspended.
Members are responsible for providing and maintaining current credit card or debit card information on file with Zipcar.
Issues with credit or debit card billings may result in termination of membership.
Under no circumstances will Zipcar be responsible for any overdraft or other fees charged by a Member's credit card company or bank.
For past due accounts, Zipcar may also change when payment is due and/or terminate the Member's account.
In addition, Zipcar may utilize third parties to collect amounts owed to Zipcar by a Member and the Member will also be responsible for any collection or similar fees associated with these collection activities.
 
4.3



Young Driver Fees.
Due to the high costs associated with providing on-demand vehicles to young drivers, all reservations made by drivers under 25 years of age will include additional young driver fees assessed by the hour or day, as appropriate.
Please refer to the Zipcar Help Center at https://support.zipcar.com/hc/en-us for additional information on these fees.


4.4



Members are responsible for providing and maintaining current email, mobile phone, preferred search address, mailing address and other account information.
Telephone calls/texts, email correspondence and social media communications with Zipcar may be recorded or monitored.
By using these communication methods, you are consenting to the recording or monitoring of your calls/texts, emails and social media communications.


4.5



By applying for membership, each applicant authorizes Zipcar to obtain his/her driving records from the jurisdiction in which the applicant is licensed.
Members who do not have a driver's license from the jurisdiction in which they reside must comply with the licensing requirements of such jurisdiction for driving in that jurisdiction.
In addition, Zipcar may at any time require Members to demonstrate compliance with the licensing laws of their jurisdiction of residence and/or impose further policies regarding the obligation to be licensed in their jurisdiction of residence.
Zipcar reserves the right to request additional information, such as a copy of a passport or proof of address at any time.
Because driving a Zipcar vehicle requires maintaining a good driving record, Zipcar may, from time to time, check Members' driving records and reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to suspend or terminate the Membership of any Member who does not meet Zipcar's eligibility requirements.
If the Member's license is suspended or revoked or becomes invalid, if the Member has any further endorsements or accidents on their driving record or if the Member is convicted of or receives a citation for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, dangerous or reckless driving or exceeding the relevant speed limit, the Member agrees to report such suspension, revocation, changes, conviction or citation to Zipcar promptly.
Failure to notify Zipcar of any such events may lead to the Member not being covered by Zipcar's liability protection when driving a Zipcar vehicle and/or termination of membership.


5.
Damages.
Damage Fee.
Damage Fee Waivers



5.1



Damages Generally: A Member is responsible for any and all damages ("Damage Fee") that occurs to a Zipcar vehicle while in the Member's possession or control (including the entire time the vehicle is reserved under the Member's account), even if damage is weather-related, caused by a third party or arises from similar causes, and is responsible for the full value of any damages or injuries caused to third parties or their property.
Such damages include, without limitation, the repair costs (estimated or actual) for the Zipcar vehicle and third party property, injuries to third parties, costs associated with the recovery or transportation of Zipcar vehicles, and the loss of use of Zipcar vehicles or third party property.
Separate of the Damage Fee, Zipcar provides third party liability as described in Section 6 below.
If, however, a Member fails to abide by the terms and conditions of this Contract, the third party liability Zipcar provides may not apply, which may make the Member responsible for the full cost of any accident or incident and any damage arising from such accident or incident.
For example, a Member who has violated the member contract will be responsible for all damage and costs incurred as a result of the non-Member's use.
Damage Fee: Assuming a Member's compliance with all of the terms and conditions of this Contract, the Member's responsibility for the Damage Fee shall be limited to the amount associated with the Member's driving/membership plan and/or the type of Zipcar vehicle used by the Member.
Members will be responsible for up to the full amount of the Damage Fee for actual, estimated or projected expenses, whether or not an actual claim is made or processed, unless the Member has purchased a Damage Fee Waiver, or DFW.


For reservations originating in New York State: In the event a Zipcar vehicle reserved from a location in New York State is damaged while it is reserved under the Memberâs account, Zipcar will provide the Member with an incident report form, an estimate of the cost for repairing the vehicle, and the damage fee the Member is obligated to pay, if it is proven that the vehicle was damaged while it was reserved under the Memberâs account, pursuant to the terms of this Contract.
A Member is obligated to truthfully and timely complete the incident report form, or Zipcar will have the right to terminate this Contract.
The Member has the right to contest any damage that Zipcar determines may have occurred while the Zipcar vehicle was reserved under the Memberâs account.


5.2

Damage Fee Waivers: Zipcar offers for purchase, at the option of the Member, Damage Fee Waivers or DFWs.
For an additional charge, eligible Zipcar Members (generally Members age 21 or over who have not had an accident in Zipcar vehicle involving property damage or any third party during the past 12 months, subject to applicable limitations and restrictions) have the option to purchase a DFW to cover part or all of the Member's financial responsibility for damages arising from the Member's reservation ("Damage Fee").
Before purchasing a DFW, you should check to see if you already have rental vehicle collision coverage through your credit card or personal automobile insurance policy that would apply to and cover the Damage Fee.
You have no obligation to purchase a DFW.
The purchase of a DFW is optional and may be declined.
A DFW is not insurance and does not provide or alter insurance coverage.
By purchasing an optional DFW, a Member can reduce or eliminate the applicable Damage Fee.
If a Member purchases a DFW and reserves a Zipcar vehicle, Zipcar will waive that Member's responsibility for all or a portion of the applicable Damage Fee, based upon the buy down amount (all or partial) of the DFW purchased.
A DFW applies only to the Zipcar vehicles reserved by the Member purchasing the DFW and does not apply to Associate Members or use of Zipcar vehicles which were reserved by another member.
A DFW may also be limited to specific types or classes of Zipcar vehicles.
Before reserving a Zipcar vehicle, Members should confirm whether any previously purchased DFW applies to the Zipcar vehicle being used.
The purchase of a DFW is non-refundable and the DFW will not be applied if the Member has violated any of the terms or conditions of this Contract.
Separate of the third party liability described above, Members are responsible for the Damage Fee,  which is a fee of up to the first $1,000 of damage to the Zipcar vehicle per incident, and can be reduced or eliminated with the purchase of an optional Damage Fee Waiver, or DFW. 
The cost of the DFW will vary based upon, among other things, the term/type of DFW purchased (annual, monthly or per reservation), Damage Fee reduction amount (all or partial), membership location, driving experience and similar factors.
For annual or monthly waivers, the DFW is limited to the period stated at the time of purchase.
after which, if you elect not to renew or repurchase or cancel a DFW, you will be once again responsible for the full Damage Fee.
A per reservation DFW applies only to the specific reservation for which it is purchased and is not transferable in any manner.
The elimination or reduction of liability for the Damage Fee through the purchase of a DFW will not apply, and previously purchased DFWs may be terminated by Zipcar, if you (1) use the vehicle in violation of this Contract, including if you permit a non-Member to drive, engage in any prohibited use of a Zipcar vehicle or, purposely or through negligence (e.g., by putting the wrong type of fuel in a vehicle), damage a Zipcar vehicle or third party property.
(2) have had your membership suspended or terminated by Zipcar and/or have two at fault incidents in a Zipcar vehicle involving property damage or any third party.
(3) fail to close and lock all windows, doors and trunk and the vehicle is stolen, damaged or vandalized.
(4) fail to notify Zipcar immediately after an incident or loss.
or (5) fail to pay any other amount due under this Contract.


Annual and monthly DFWs typically renew automatically.
A Member's credit card will be automatically charged monthly or annually, depending upon the DFW selected, when due.
DFWs are optional.
Monthly DFWs may be opted-out of at any time from a Member's account page or by calling 1-866-4ZIPCAR.
In order to change the type of DFW purchased (for example, to change from a monthly DFW to an annual DFW), Members must call 1-866-4ZIPCAR.


6.
Third Party Liability


6.1



Any active Zipcar Member in good standing who is authorized to operate a Zipcar vehicle under this Contract is, subject to the Member fulfilling their obligations as set out in this Contract, covered for third party bodily injury and for property damage costs relating to an accident in which the member was validly and legally operating a Zipcar vehicle and for which the Member may be legally liable.
The amount of such third party liability varies depending upon the age and join date of the Member.


Members 21 years of age or older who joined the membership August 1, 2018 or later, and who are permitted to drive under this Contract, will be protected against liability for causing bodily injury or death to others or damaging the property of someone other than the authorized driver and/or the Member up to the minimum financial responsibility limits required by the law of the jurisdiction in which the accident occurs.
Minimum financial responsibility limits vary by jurisdiction.


Members 21 years of age or older who joined the membership between March 1, 2015 and July 31, 2018, and who are permitted to drive under this Contract, will be protected against liability for causing bodily injury or death to others or damaging the property of someone other than the authorized driver and/or the Member up to limits of $100,000/$300,000/$25,000 per accident.
This means $100,000 of coverage is the maximum payable for bodily injury per person, $300,000 of coverage is the maximum payable for bodily injuries for the entire accident and $25,000 of coverage is the maximum payable for property damage.


Members 21 years of age or older who joined the membership prior to March 1, 2015, and who are permitted to drive under this Contract, will be protected against liability for causing bodily injury or death to others or damaging the property of someone other than the authorized driver and/or the Member up to a combined single limit of $300,000 per accident.


Members under 21 years of age, and who are permitted to drive under this Contract will be protected against liability for causing bodily injury or death to others or damaging the property of someone other than the authorized driver and/or the Member up to the minimum financial responsibility limits required by the law of the jurisdiction in which the accident occurs.
Minimum financial responsibility limits vary by jurisdiction.


Any member who violates the terms and conditions of this Contract will only be protected against liability for causing bodily injury or death to others or damaging the property of someone else other than the authorized driver and/or the member up to the minimum financial responsibility limits required by the law of the jurisdiction in which the accident occurs.
Minimum financial responsibility limits vary by jurisdiction.


Where required by law, we provide Personal Injury Protection (PIP), or "no-fault" coverage, to the minimum level required by the jurisdiction in which the accident occurs, for injuries you may suffer in an accident.
Members may also use their own health care coverage in case of injury and any personal injury coverage that the Member has available will be primary over any PIP or no fault coverage Zipcar may provide where allowed by law.
To the extent permitted by law, Zipcar and each Member by entering into this membership agreement hereby affirmatively waives and rejects the inclusion of uninsured motorist, underinsured motorist coverage under this Contract and all optional vehicle insurance coverages under any policy of insurance or certificate of self-insurance in connection with this Contract, and each Member agrees that Zipcar is hereby authorized to sign any forms or acknowledgments on behalf of each Member rejecting such coverage.
Uninsured coverage protects the Member and all other passengers in the Zipcar vehicle for losses and damages suffered if injury is caused by the negligence of a driver who does not have any insurance or who has insufficient insurance to pay for losses and damages.
If any such protection described above is imposed by operation of law, then the limits of such protection will be the minimum required for protection by the law of the jurisdiction in which the accident occurs.
No coverage is provided for any use of a Zipcar vehicle by any unauthorized driver as defined by the terms of this Contract.
provided, however, if such coverage is mandated by law, then the limits of such protection will be the minimum financial responsibility limits required by law in the jurisdiction where the accident occurs.


The third party liability provided by Zipcar does not relieve Members of their obligations with respect to the Damage Fee described in Section 5 of this Contract.


For clarification, any coverage provided under this Contract only applies when a Member in good standing is validly and legally operating a Zipcar vehicle. 

7.



Term and Termination



7.1



This Contract shall commence upon the acceptance by Zipcar of the Member's completed membership application and the payment by the Member of any applicable fees.
The term of this Contract shall continue until such time as membership is canceled in accordance with this Section 7.
A Member may terminate membership and all associate memberships upon one day prior notice by calling us at 1-866-4ZIPCAR.
No monthly, annual, application, driving records/insurance verification or similar fee will be refunded in the event of termination by the Member, except as specifically provided in this Contract.
In addition to the termination provisions set forth in Section 7.2 below, Zipcar may terminate this Contract at any time upon no less than thirty (30) days' notice to the Member, in which event Zipcar will, if applicable, refund a prorated portion of the Member's annual membership fee for the year of termination.
With respect to any termination or cancellation of this Contract, the Member shall remain responsible for any fees, costs or expenses incurred prior to termination of this Contract.


7.2



Zipcar may also, upon notice to the Member or any Associate Member, immediately terminate this Contract if the Member or any Associate Member (a) fails to pay any sum due under this Contract, (b) fails to comply with any term or condition specified in the Contract or any Rules, (c) is involved in an incident with a Zipcar vehicle that, in Zipcar's reasonable sole discretion, renders the Member or Associate Member ineligible or inappropriate for continued membership, (d) engages in any activities or conduct that Zipcar, in its reasonable sole discretion, determines to be inappropriate, negligent, offensive, abusive or otherwise unacceptable.
or (e) is not paying the Member's debts as such debts generally become due, becomes insolvent, files or has filed against the Member a petition (or other document) under any bankruptcy or insolvency law or similar law that is unresolved within sixty (60) days of the filing of such petition (or document), proposes any dissolution, liquidation, composition, financial reorganization or recapitalization with creditors, makes a general assignment or trust mortgage for the benefit of creditors, or if a receiver, trustee, custodian or similar agent is appointed or takes possession of any of the Member's property or business.
No membership or other fees will be refunded in the event of termination pursuant to this Section 7.2.


7.3



Upon termination, all of the Member's and Associate Member's rights to use Zipcar's services and vehicles shall immediately terminate.
The Member agrees to return immediately to Zipcar any vehicle or any other property of Zipcar that the Member has in the Member's possession, including, if requested, all Zipcards.
Additionally, the Member shall be responsible for and agrees to pay any legal fees, court costs or expenses associated with enforcing the terms of this Contract, whether upon termination or otherwise (including, without limitation, any costs relating to recovering any of the foregoing property or any amounts due and owing to Zipcar).


8.
Limitations of Liability



UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL ZIPCAR BE LIABLE TO ANY MEMBER OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFIT, REVENUE, GOODWILL, BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS CONTRACT OR USE OF THE ZIPCAR SERVICES.
Without limiting the foregoing, Zipcar shall have no liability for any loss of, or damage to, any goods in or on the vehicle or in or on any third party vehicle, any loss, damage, injury or death in relation to any Member or any third party arising from the use of a Zipcar vehicle, loss or damage incurred by the Member as a result of any claims made by a third party, or loss or damage incurred by the Member arising from or in relation to either (i) the reservation, non-availability, supply, operation or use of a Zipcar vehicle or (ii) any vehicle accessories, whether supplied by Zipcar or by a Member (for example, luggage racks, bicycle racks, baby seats and the like.
the Member is responsible for the safe installation of such accessories and must check the condition of such accessories before each use), unless in each case such loss or damage is incurred due to our negligence or failure to carry out our responsibility.


9.



Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver



9.1



Pre-Dispute Resolution Procedure.
Before asserting a claim in any proceeding (including in an individual arbitration or in a small claims proceeding), you and Zipcar agree that we shall give the other party written notice of the claim to be asserted 30 days before initiating a proceeding and make a reasonable good faith effort to resolve the claim.
If you are intending to assert a claim against Zipcar, you must send the written notice of the claim to Zipcar Legal Dept, 35 Thomson Place, Boston, MA 02110.
If Zipcar is intending to assert a claim against you, we will send the written notice of the claim to you at your address appearing in our records.
NO SETTLEMENT DEMAND OR SETTLEMENT OFFER USED IN THIS PRE-DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS MAY BE USED IN ANY PROCEEDING, INCLUDING AS EVIDENCE OR AS AN ADMISSION OF ANY LIABILITY OR DAMAGES (OR LACK THEREOF).


9.2



Agreement to Arbitrate.
Except as otherwise provided in section 9.8 of this dispute resolution provision, in the event of a dispute that cannot be resolved informally through the pre-dispute resolution procedure, you and Zipcar agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims, including the interpretation and scope of this provision, and the arbitrability of the dispute or claim.


9.3



What is Arbitration.
Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit.
Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts.
Under this dispute resolution provision, arbitrators can award the same individual relief affecting individual parties that a court can award, including damages and an award of attorneysâ fees, if the applicable law allows.
BY AGREEING TO RESOLVE DISPUTES THROUGH ARBITRATION, YOU AND ZIPCAR AGREE TO EACH UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR COURT.


9.4



Class Action Waiver.
YOU AND ZIPCAR AGREE THAT ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR ZIPCAR WILL BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIESâ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND WILL NOT BE BROUGHT AS A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, COLLECTIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION.
The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one personâs claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class, representative, or private attorney general proceeding.
You and Zipcar agree to seek only such reliefâwhether in the form of damages, an injunction, or other non-monetary reliefâas is necessary to resolve any individual injury that either you or Zipcar have suffered or may suffer.
In particular, if either you or Zipcar seek non-monetary relief, such relief must be individualized and may not affect individuals or entities other than you or Zipcar.
This requirement that claims be brought in binding arbitration only in an individual capacity and not as a representative, private attorney general, or class member (âClass Action Waiverâ) is non-severable.
If the Class Action Waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this dispute resolution provision shall be null and void.


9.5



Applicable Law and Rules.
The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute resolution provision.
The arbitration shall be conducted before one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving commercial disputes from the American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ).
As modified by this Agreement, and unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties in writing, the arbitration will be governed by the AAAâs rules for commercial arbitration and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the procedures for consumer-related disputes.
For more information on AAA, its rules and procedures, and how to file an arbitration claim, you may call AAA at 800-778-7879 or visit the AAA website at http://www.adr.org.


9.6



Hearings and Decisions.
If you are an individual, arbitrations will proceed at a location that the arbitrator selects in the county of your primary residence unless you and Zipcar agree otherwise.
If you are not an individual person (but are instead, for instance, a partnership, corporation, or other form of entity or non-natural person) (hereafter âEntity Memberâ), arbitrations shall proceed at a location that the arbitrator selects unless you and Zipcar agree otherwise.


Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
The arbitratorâs award shall be final and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Further, an arbitratorâs award and any judgment confirming it shall apply only to that specific case and cannot be used in any other case except to enforce the award itself.


9.7



Fees and Costs.
If you are an individual (and not an Entity Member), in the event that (1) your claim is less than $10,000, and (2) you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to costs of litigation, Zipcar will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation.
Zipcar also reserves the right in its sole and exclusive discretion to assume responsibility for all of the costs of the arbitration.
However, Zipcar will not pay your share of the arbitration fees if the arbitrator finds that either your claim or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, as measured by the standards of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b).


9.8



Small Claims, Personal Injury Claims and Vehicle Damage or Loss Claims.
The following disputes and claims are exempt from Sections 9.2-9.7: (a) disputes and claims that are within the scope of a small claims courtâs authority.
(b) disputes and claims regarding personal injury and/or damage to or loss of a vehicle related to your Zipcar reservation.
and (c) if you are an Entity Member, disputes over the validity of any partyâs intellectual property rights.


9.9



Conflicts .
In the event of any conflict between this dispute resolution provision and any other dispute resolution provision in any other agreement between you and Zipcar, the dispute resolution provision in this Contract shall govern.


9.10



Modification of this Provision.
Notwithstanding any provision in these this Contract to the contrary, we agree that if Zipcar makes any material change to this arbitration provision, including the deletion of this provision, that change will not apply to any dispute that you had already provided Zipcar notice of in writing.


10.

10.3

Unless stated otherwise, all remedies provided for in this Contract shall be cumulative and in addition to and not in lieu of any other remedies available to either party at law, in equity, or otherwise.


10.4

The parties further agree to substitute for the invalid provision a valid provision that most closely approximates the intent and economic effect of the invalid provision.


10.5



This Contract is governed by the laws in force in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and shall be interpreted according to the internal laws of such Commonwealth, without reference to its conflicts of laws or choice of law rules.

Reserving Zipcar Vehicles


3.1  

Members must always reserve a Zipcar vehicle in advance of use and will typically be billed for usage fees at the time of booking your reservation.
The minimum period for which a Zipcar vehicle may be reserved is one hour or thirty minutes in certain circumstances.
If the Zipcar vehicle is available, a reservation may be extended in half-hour increments thereafter as provided in Section 3.2 below.
Use of a vehicle for a period of longer than seven consecutive days may be authorized at Zipcar's discretion and must be arranged with a Zipcar representative.
Consecutive (back to back) reservations in the same Zipcar vehicle will be treated as a single reservation with continuous usage and will be billed accordingly.

3.2  If you wish to cancel a reservation or shorten the period for which a vehicle has been reserved, (a) for a reservation of less than eight hours, you must do so at least three hours before the scheduled start of the reservation and (b) for reservations of 8 hours or more, you must do so at least 24 hours before the scheduled start of the reservation.
If you cancel or shorten a reservation outside of the applicable window, you may be subject to certain change or cancellation fees, as further described in the Fee Policy.
If you wish to extend a reservation, you may do so only if (i) the vehicle is available for use for the extension period (for example, it is not reserved by another Member), (ii) the request to extend is completed prior to the scheduled expiration time of your existing reservation and (iii) you have sufficient credit/funds available on the credit/debit card used to make the reservation to pay for the extension.

There is no agent reservation charge when you make, extend, update or cancel reservations yourself by website, smartphone or through our automated phone system (please note that an extension made through SMS service shall not be valid until the Member receives confirmation of the extension from Zipcar by SMS).
This charge does not apply to (a) reservations of four consecutive days or more made in accordance with Section 3.1 above or (b) as provided in the Services for Disabled Members Schedule, if you are disabled and your disability prevents you from using the website, smartphone or the automated phone system, and you identify yourself as disabled.

If the vehicle is available you may, at no additional charge, scan in to take possession of the Zipcar vehicle up to 14 minutes before your reservation start time.
you will be charged in thirty (30) minute increments if you scan in more than 14 minutes in advance.

Before driving the vehicle, you must advise Zipcar of any damage or abnormality encountered on the vehicle or in the operation of the vehicle.

If Zipcar is not notified of a problem at the start of a reservation, you will be deemed to be responsible for any problem with the vehicle discovered or reported after your reservation, including, without limitation, damage to the vehicle, lack of cleanliness or low fuel.
You may be charged the Damage Fee, a cleaning fee, low fuel fee or other applicable fees, and Zipcar may suspend, or may even terminate, your membership.


4.3  The key, key fob or other starting device to the vehicle must remain in the vehicle and/or be returned to its designated position within the vehicle at the conclusion of the reservation.

Zipcar vehicles must be returned no later than the end time of the reservation and the Member is required to scan out of the vehicle.

We provide you a fuel card for this purpose.
If the fuel card is missing or not functioning, Zipcar will reimburse you for the actual cost of fuel if you pay for it yourself in accordance with Section 5.2 below.
Members must, when returning the vehicle, ensure that the tank is at least one quarter full.
you will be charged a fee in accordance with the Fee Policy if the vehicle is returned with less than one quarter of a tank of fuel.
Zipcar fuel cards may only be used to fuel Zipcar vehicles and, as provided below, for cleaning the exterior and/or interior of the vehicle, and may not be used for any other purpose.
Members must ensure that they use the correct fuel when refueling the vehicle (gasoline or diesel).
Fuel decontamination costs and any other damage or costs (including road side assistance or recovery) arising from the use of the incorrect fuel are not limited to the Damage Fee and are not covered by Zipcar's insurance or a DFW.

5.2  An "Eligible Expense" is defined as (a) an expense incurred by the Member for minor (under $50) routine maintenance on Zipcar vehicles, such as new wiper blades, light bulbs, or windshield-washer fluid, (b) the cost of fuel when the fuel card is missing or not functioning and (c) any other expense that is authorized in advance by a Zipcar Representative.
If you pay for an Eligible Expense, you must keep the actual receipt reflecting the item or service purchased and the date and time of purchase (which must be during your reservation), and note on it the odometer reading at the time of the purchase.
Please print your name on the receipt, e-mail it to support@zipcar.com and subject to our approval, we will credit such amount to the credit/debit card you have on file for the applicable reservation.
No credit or refund will be given without a receipt, or if the receipt is submitted 30 days or more after the reservation date.

6.2  A typical noises or driving feel, including but not limited to warning lamps, indicators, inappropriate or strange engine or other mechanical sounds, performance changes or unusual driving feel, must be reported to Zipcar as soon as noted.

Such damages are not limited to the Damage Fee and are not covered by Zipcar's insurance or a DFW.

6.3  Vehicles may require Roadside Assistance from time to time.
Zipcar provides Roadside Assistance support as part of our service, and Members are typically required to stay with the vehicle.

If a Member is disabled and such disability prevents the Member from using our web sites or automated phone system to make a reservation, and the Member identifies him or herself as disabled, we will not charge the $3.50 agent reservation charge for any reservations made, extended or canceled by an agent.

Additional Drivers



4.1



Zipcar Members with disabilities have the option of opening a "household account" if their disabilities prevent them from driving and they wish to have another person drive for them.

Any further additional drivers listed on the household account will be subject to normal membership and annual fees.
Zipcar will address exceptions to this policy on a case-by-case basis.
Additional drivers can only be added to the credited driver slots on the annual anniversary date of the Member's account being created or they will be subject to any applicable fees.
The disabled Member may remove an additional driver from the "household account" at no charge at anytime.
