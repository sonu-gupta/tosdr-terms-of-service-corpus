Privacy
For your peace of mind, we would like to ensure that under no circumstances will your email be shared with (or distributed to) anyone.
Your privacy is extremely important, and weâre not kidding.
Since the site allows user contributions and posts, itâs strongly recommended you donât share your email publicly when posting.

Joining only requires an email address which is the only unique &amp.
reliable identifier for our users.
We ask for no other identifier.
Since you are permitted to change your âdisplay nameâ anytime, your login is always your original registered email.
There are no ânameâ fields, so you are not required or encouraged to use your real name, nor submit any other personal information, address or phone number.


We do not know your password.
It is stored in an encrypted hash.
You may reset your password anytime and the previous reset limit has been lifted.
We also recently removed the forcing of very strong passwords when resetting.
Once you are logged in, the account/settings page permits you to change your password.


Users may voluntarily enter their city (or country) on their profile card to let other users know where they are located â purely for interests sake and no other reason.
It is nice to know when someone is from another country so that we may translate our communications into their native language.
We strongly encourage an international community as we are multi-lingual ourselves.


Naturally, some basic and general information (such as browser type, device, and IP address etc.) is occasionally logged along with any submissions for visitors &amp.
statistic purposes, and these are essential for gaining a general knowledge of our audience.
It also assists in debugging , depending on what browser/device youâre using.
