I aim to collect as little personal data as possible. I donât know who you are, where youâre from or how you found me.
I donât use any cookies or third party companies to track you.
For security reasons my hosting provider (Netlify) collects your IP address, user agent, and requested URL.
The information is stored for 30 days before being deleted.
On some pages I embed services like YouTube and Speaker Deck.
Those services may collect personal data.
For more information, see their own privacy notices.
If you contact me, your personal data will be stored in Gmail.
All data in Gmail is stored using two-factor authentication.
If you have any questions or would like me to delete your personal data, please contact me.
