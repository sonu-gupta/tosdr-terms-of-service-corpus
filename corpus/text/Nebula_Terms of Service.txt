        Terms of Service
One person per account.
The point is to support creators.
No downloading videos to post somewhere else.
The copyright for any given video belongs to whomever posted it.
Be respectful.
We donât allow comments yet, but we might someday.
If that happens, be nice.
No intentionally abusing the service or any of its partners, including crazy amounts of traffic or doing weird stuff with code to see what will happen.
If you stumble across any kind of technology glitch or security problem, youâll tell us first and give us time to fix it and protect our users and creators.
Only use this service if youâve paid for it or if, for some reason, we gave you a promo code to use it for free.
Donât ask us for a promo code to use it for free.
We may occasionally need to change this policy.
Weâll be sure to let you know.
This might require us sending you an annoying email.
Weâre sorry in advance.
