Collection of Personal Information
1.1 Kinds of personal information we collect
The kinds of personal information we collect about you may include:

your name;
login details;
contact details;
demographic information;
competition entries;
preferences and interests;
user generated content;
research or survey responses.
and
payment details.

Some of the personal information we collect about you may be sensitive information, including information about your race or ethnicity, political opinions or affiliations, religious beliefs or affiliations, physical or mental health and sexuality.
Depending on the circumstances of collection, it may be possible for you to provide information to the ABC in a pseudonymous way so that your identity is not revealed.
For example, you may wish to sign up for an ABC Account by using an email address that does not include your name and by providing a nickname rather than your actual name.
The same applies in relation to any sub-profiles you create on ABC iview.
In some circumstances however this may not be practicable, for example where a person must disclose their identity before being granted entry to the ABC studio as an audience member.
We also collect information about your use of our digital services.
The kinds of information we collect about you in this context are described in section 1.2(c) below.
Such information may, depending on the circumstances, constitute personal information.
1.2 How we collect personal information
The main circumstances in which the ABC collects personal information about you are:
(a) when you provide it to us
If you register as a user of ABC digital services, by creating an ABC Account, you will provide information to us as part of your registration. You may also give us information when you make a purchase from us, sign up to receive ABC newsletters or enter competitions, contribute user generated content, participate in research or surveys or otherwise participate in ABC functions or activities.
For information about our collection and retention of payment information see below.
Payment informationIf you use Shopify to complete your transaction, your personal information (including credit card information) will be collected and used by Shopify.
For more information, you can read the Shopify Privacy Policy here.
If you use your credit card and the transaction is manual rather than electronic, the imprinted record will be stored by us for the period that financial records are required to be retained.
(b) when someone else provides it to us on your behalf
Sometimes someone else such as a parent, carer or friend might provide us with information about you so that we can provide you with products or services. For example, someone else may provide us with information about you when creating a sub-profile for you on ABC iview.
In some circumstances, we may also collect information about you from our ABC online store fulfilment partners.
Other times we may collect personal information about you from publicly available sources, including social media sites, or when you sign up for an ABC Account via another account.
For more information about our practices in relation to children, see below.
Additional information for parents and young peopleThe digital services provided by the ABC allow access by children and some are specifically designed for children.
ABC KIDS for pre-school children and ABC ME for older children are examples.
When a sub-profile is created for a child on ABC iview, the ABC will make available content that is suitable for their age group.
We strongly encourage parents and carers to monitor and participate in their childrenâs use of the ABCâs digital services.
The ABC aims to ensure that children and young people who engage with our online spaces understand the possible risks they face and how to minimise them.
ABC digital services designed for children are subject to House Rules which guide participation and are designed to maintain safe and appropriate behaviour.
House Rules include restrictions on the types of personal information the ABC allows children to communicate publicly.
Content submitted to ABC childrenâs sites is largely pre-moderated in order to enforce the House Rules and protect children.
If your child is participating in ABC online community activities, we recommend you read the House Rules for that space with your child and explain anything to them that they may not understand.
The ABC policy in relation to Cookies, Beacons, Local Storage and Other Technologies described below applies to all ABC properties, including those specifically designed for children.
Parents and carers should also be aware that if their children are using social media sites that were not designed for their age group, they will be exposed to the various tracking and analytic technologies applied by third parties when they access or share ABC content on or via those sites. 
Children will be automatically opted out of the disclosure of a hashed version of their email address for the purpose of promotional targeting.
(c) when we collect it in relation to your use of digital services
We also collect information about your use of our digital services through the use of technologies like cookies, beacons and local storage. 
When you use our websites, mobile sites, mobile applications, email newsletters or applications on any other devices such as Apple TV, Chromecast or PlayStation, these technologies may be used to improve your user experience and our digital services.
They may also be used to show you promotions for ABC content on third party digital services, such as Google and Facebook, as well as on ABC digital services.
From July 2021, registration for an ABC Account will be required in order to access ABC iview. 
You will remain able to access our content, including news, on our other websites and apps, and through our broadcasts, without registering for an ABC Account. 
If you are a registered ABC Account holder, or newsletter subscriber, we may link the information collected about you to your account.&nbsp.
If a sub-profile is created for you on ABC iview, we may link the information collected about you with your sub-profile.    

If you are not a registered ABC Account holder, or newsletter subscriber, and you do not have a sub-profile on ABC iview, then we will track this information by reference to digital information such as an IP address, or an identifier for your device or browser, and will not seek to identify you.
If we do not collect information about you or your use of our digital services, we may not be able to provide you with certain digital services, or we may not be able to tailor or enhance your reading, viewing or listening experience.
 
Use of Cookies, Beacons, local storage, and Other Technologies Across our digital services
What are these technologies?âCookiesâ and âlocal storageâ are technologies that allow websites, applications and emails to gather information and store it on your computer or device.
This information is used to identify your browser or device so that these websites and applications can follow your user activity over time and remember things such as your personalised settings and preferences.
A âbeaconâ is a signal sent from your computer or device to a server on the Internet.
Websites, applications and emails use software that reads cookies, local storage and other information stored on your computer or device and sends beacons to record that information.
This may include information about your user activity, including behavioural data such as your viewing history and location data such as your IP address, as well as information about your personalised settings and preferences.Why do we use these technologies?The ABC uses these technologies in a variety of ways to deliver, measure and improve our services and products.
These uses generally fall into one of the following categories:

Site and application functionality: To enable interactive features such as forums, voting, some games, and online shopping.
For instance, cookies allow our servers to keep track of your customer details between visits to our websites.
They can allow us to remember your place in a video so you can pick up where you left off or remember your preferences and settings so you get your local weather or preferred radio station.
In order to deliver similar functionality, some ABC websites and applications may also ask your permission to collect geolocation data.
Promotional targeting: Placing cookies on your device or browser also means we can serve you promotional information that you might be more interested in.
The promotional information can appear on third party digital services as well as ABC digital services.
It also allows us to control the number of times you see that promotional information and measure how effective the campaign has been.
Audience analytics: The aggregate information gathered from these technologies helps us to improve our products and understand how people use our services.
Personalised content and services: Information about what content is viewed allows us to customise our services with more relevant content like tailored trends or recommendations.
For example, by knowing what articles you have already read, cookies can help us make smarter and more relevant suggestions about what new content you might enjoy or find useful.
You will still be able to watch other content too.
Third party cookies, beacons, local storage and other technologiesThe ABC allows a number of its suppliers to use cookies, beacons, local storage and other technologies on ABC digital services to gather information about visitor activity in order to deliver their services.
These third parties may include:
a) marketing and promotions service providers including social media platforms, such as Facebook, and digital advertising services, such as Google Ads;
b) analytics service providers, such as Google Analytics (more information here) and Chartbeat.
and
c) ratings service providers such as Nielsen, which measures digital audiences in Australia (more information here), and OzTAM, which measures broadcast video on demand and live streaming audiences in Australia.
In addition, if we embed posts, photos or videos from third parties, such as Facebook and YouTube, those third parties may use cookies, beacons, local storage and other technologies in relation to that content.
If you then âshareâ that content, the service you have chosen to share content through may also use these technologies.
The ABC cannot control the use of cookies, beacons, local storage and other technologies in relation to embedded content, or content sharing, and does not block third parties from using these technologies in these ways.
The ABC does not collect personal information about you when we allow third parties to use cookies, beacons, local storage and other technologies on our digital services.Controlling and deleting cookiesPopular browsers will usually give users a level of control over cookies.
You can set your browsers to accept or reject all, or certain, cookies.
You can also set your browser to prompt you each time a cookie is offered.
Most cookies are easy to delete, and the âHelpâ function within your browser should tell you how.
Some digital services may not load properly or function as intended if cookies are disabled, however it is up to you to determine the balance of convenience and computer privacy that you are comfortable with.
Some browsers offer a âDo Not Trackâ (DNT) setting, which sends an additional piece of information when a cookie is downloaded that the user does not wish to be tracked.
However, the ABCâs digital services do not recognise DNT settings.
The ABC uses beacons in combination with cookies to track activity.
If you turn off a browserâs cookies, the beacon will still record your visit anonymously, however your unique information will not be recorded.&nbsp.
If you turn off cookies then we may not be able to personalise or customise content for you, which will affect your user experience.
Our applications and email newsletters do not offer these controls.Information that is personally identifiable to the ABC**If you have registered for an ABC Account, or subscribed to an ABC newsletter, or if a sub-profile is created for you on ABC iview, we may combine information from your registration with the information we collect about your use of our digital services, and other information you provide to us.
This is done in order to analyse how you and other people use our digital services in detail and, where you have opted to receive such communications, to send you email and other communications that might be of interest to you.
This information may also be used to provide personalised services or content suggestions based on your previous use of our digital services, and to show you promotions for ABC content on third party digital services as well as ABC digital services.&nbsp.
The combined information may include information that is collected about your use of our digital services while you are not signed in, and information that was collected before you registered or signed in.
Where the combined information can be used to identify you, we may use and disclose it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
