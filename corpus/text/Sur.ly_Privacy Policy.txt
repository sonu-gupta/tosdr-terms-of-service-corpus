This also applies to any profiling based on these provisions.
To determine the legal basis, on which any processing of data is based, please consult this Data Protection Declaration.
If you log an objection, we will no longer process your affected personal data, unless we are in a position to present compelling protection worthy grounds for the processing of your data, that outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms or if the purpose of the processing is the claiming, exercising or defence of legal entitlements (objection pursuant to Art.
