Service Summary
When you purchase a Kasa Camera product, you have the option of using
our Kasa Care Services.
With the Kasa Care Services, any video footage
captured by your Kasa Cam is automatically sent to our servers for
storage.
From your iOS or Android device(s) you can then access
recordings covering limited time frames depending on your level of Kasa
Care Services.
Subscription Plans
Every Kasa Cam comes with our free Kasa Care Services package ("Free
Package") that may provide you with various services.
We reserve the
right to modify any services provided under the Free Package or
terminate the Free Package at any time in our sole discretion.
We also offer multiple tiers of paid subscription plans for our Kasa
Care Services.

Subscription fees are charged on the first day of the applicable
subscription period.
If your credit card transaction is declined or your
credit card expires, we reserve the right to cancel your Kasa Care
Services subscription, but your subscription will not automatically be
terminated.
You will remain responsible for all unpaid amounts that
accrue as a result of your declined or expired credit card.
Additionally, you will be responsible for all costs we incur in
connection with the collection of such unpaid amounts, including court
costs, attorneys' fees, collection agency fees and any other associated
costs.
(a) Subscription Renewal
All Kasa Care Services subscription plans renew automatically.
When we
renew your subscription plan, we will use the payment method then
currently associated with your account.
You will not be notified in
advance of impending renewals unless you choose an annual subscription
plan, in which case we will send an annual renewal reminder to the email
associated with your account.
Following the processing of your
applicable subscription payment, we will send you a receipt to the email
associated with your account.
When you purchase any of our Kasa Care
Services subscription plans, you expressly acknowledge and agree that
(1) TP-Link is authorized to charge you a subscription fee (in addition
to any applicable taxes) on a monthly or annually recurring basis
depending on the billing cycle you choose and the promotion code you
apply, if any, for as long as your subscription is in effect, and (2)
your subscription is in effect until you cancel it or it is terminated
at our discretion because your credit card was declined or you otherwise
fail to pay your subscription fee.

entitled to a refund.
When you cancel an annual subscription plan, you
