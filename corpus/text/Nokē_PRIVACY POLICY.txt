 Information We Collect  While using our Sites or Mobile App, you may provide us with certain Personal Data of our customers, employees of our customers using our app, or tenant data that can be used to contact or identify you.
This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information.
This is information which may be connected to you specifically as the individual to whom the information relates.
Such information may include name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, or any other information defined as personally identifiable information (or similar term) by applicable law.
For this Privacy Policy the definition of âPersonal Dataâ is the definition under the law applicable to the person whose data is collected.

If the Personal Data is that of a California resident, the definition is as provided under California law.
Personal Data does not include your personally identifiable information that has been deidentified, pseudonymized, anonymized, aggregated, and/or otherwise processed so as to be unidentifiable in such a way that the data can no longer be attributed to a specific individual (by reasonable means) without the use of additional information, and where such additional information is kept separate and under adequate security to prevent unauthorized re-identification of a specific individual such that one could not, using reasonable efforts, link such information back to a specific individual (the foregoing in this sentence being referred to as âDe-Identified Personal Dataâ).

Tenant identification information
