If you participate in a sweepstakes, contest or giveaway on our Site, we may ask you for your e-mail address and/or home number (to notify you if you win or not).
We may also ask for first and last names, and sometimes post office addresses to verify your identity.
In some situations we may need additional information as a part of the entry process, such as a prize selection choice.
These sweepstakes and contests are voluntary.
We recommend that you read the rules for each sweepstakes and contest that you enter.
We may also collect personal information, such as at other points in our Service that state that personal information is being collected.
(b) Information You Provide to Facebook and other Social Networking SitesThe Services allow users to access Facebook to interact with friends and to share on Facebook and/or Google+ through friendsâ news feeds.
When you click on âPersonalize with Facebook,â or a similar connection on another social networking service (each, an âSNSâ), you will be prompted to enter your SNS credentials or to âSign Upâ for the SNS.
By proceeding, you are allowing the Services to access your information and you are agreeing to the Facebook or other SNSâs Terms of Use in your use of the Services.
In this case, we may receive information from Facebook or another SNS to make it easier for you to create an Account on the Site and show our relevant content from your Facebook or SNS friends.
Once you register on the Site and connect with Facebook or another SNS, you will be able to automatically post recent activity back to Facebook or the other SNS.
Any information that we collect from your Facebook or other SNS account may depend on the privacy settings you have with that SNS, so please consult the SNSâs privacy and data practices.
