LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

CALENDLY WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR OTHERS FOR ANY DAMAGES RESULTING FROM YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITE OR YOUR DISPLAYING, COPYING, OR DOWNLOADING ANY MATERIALS TO OR FROM THE WEBSITE.

LOCAL LAWS.
EXPORT CONTROL

We control and operate the Website from our headquarters in the United States of America and the entirety of the Website may not be appropriate or available for use in other locations.
If you use the Website outside the United States of America, you are solely responsible for following applicable local laws.


Calendly and you shall comply with all relevant United States export control laws and regulations.
Without limiting the foregoing: (a) you acknowledge that the Website may be subject to the United States Export Administration Regulations.
(b) you affirm that you are not, and you will not (i) permit Calendly Users or Invitees to access or use the Website in a United States embargoed country.
(ii) or permit Calendly Users or Invitees on the U.S.
Commerce Departmentâs Denied Persons, Entity, or Unverified Lists or (iii) permit Calendly Users or Invitees on the U.S.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION.
CLASS ACTION WAIVER.

Please Read This Provision Carefully.
It Affects Your Legal Rights.


This provision facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any dispute that may arise between you and us.
Effectively, then, âdisputeâ is given the broadest meaning enforceable by law and includes any claims against other parties relating to services or products provided or billed to you (such as our licensors, suppliers, dealers or third-party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in the same proceeding.


This provision provides that all disputes between you and us will be resolved by binding arbitration because acceptance of these Terms constitutes a waiver of your right to litigate claims and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury.
We prefer this because we believe arbitration is less drama-filled than litigation.
To be clear, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.
The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorneyâs fees).
YOU AND CALENDLY AGREE THAT ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION.

Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution

For all disputes, you must first give us an opportunity to resolve the dispute which is first done by emailing us at support@calendly.com the following information: (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) a written description of your claim, and (4) a description of the specific relief you seek.
If we do not resolve the dispute within 45 days after receiving your notification, then you may pursue your dispute in arbitration.

Arbitration Procedures

If this provision applies and the dispute is not resolved as provided above (Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution) either you or we may initiate arbitration proceedings.
JAMS, www.jamsadr.com, will arbitrate all disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator.
The arbitration will be commenced as an individual arbitration, and will in no event be commenced as a class arbitration.
This provision governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules.
Under no circumstances will class action procedures or rules apply to the arbitration.
Because this Website and these Terms concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (âFAAâ) governs the arbitrability of all disputes.
However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.
You or we may initiate arbitration in either Georgia or the federal judicial district where you are located.

Class Action Waiver

Except as otherwise provided in this provision, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one personâs claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, consolidated action or private attorney general action) unless both you and Calendly specifically agree to do so following initiation of the arbitration.

Other

You understand and agree that by accepting this provision in these Terms, you and we are each waiving the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court.
If any clause within this provision (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this provision whose remainder will be given full force and effect.
If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire provision will be unenforceable and the dispute will be decided by a court.
This provision will survive the termination of your account with us or our affiliates and your discontinued use of this Website.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if we make any change to this provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change and require us to adhere to the language in this provision if a dispute between us arises.

GENERAL TERMS

We think direct communication resolves most issues â if we feel that you are not complying with these Terms, we will likely tell you.
We may even provide you with recommended necessary corrective action(s) if possible.
However, certain violations of these Terms, as determined by us, may require immediate termination of your access to this Website without prior notice to you.


The Federal Arbitration Act, Georgia state law and applicable U.S.
federal law, without regard to the choice or conflicts of law provisions, will govern these Terms to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.
Except for disputes subject to arbitration as described above, any disputes relating to these Terms or this Website will be heard in the courts located in Fulton County, Georgia.
Except as otherwise set forth in the dispute resolution provision, if any of these Terms are deemed inconsistent with applicable law, then such term(s) will be interpreted to reflect the intentions of the parties, and no other terms will be modified.
By choosing not to enforce any of these Terms, we are not waiving our rights.
These Terms, together with our Privacy Notice, End User License Agreement, FERPA and COPPA Privacy Policy and Notice, and the Data Processing Addendum (as applicable), contain the entire agreement between you and us and, therefore, supersede all prior or contemporaneous negotiations, discussions or agreements between Calendly and you about the Website and our services.
Any definitions found in the Privacy Notice, End User License Agreement, FERPA and COPPA Privacy Policy and Notice, and Data Processing Addendum are hereby adopted by reference in this Agreement.
The rights of Calendly under our Terms will survive the termination of our Terms.
No additional terms, conditions, consent, waiver, alteration, or modification shall be binding unless in writing and signed by both parties.
Acceptance of any order by Calendly is expressly limited to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
Any proposed additional or inconsistent terms or conditions, including those in or accompanying any Customer proposal, any Customer purchase order, or other agreement or any other Customer document issued in connection with the sale or delivery of Products or Services is deemed by Calendly to be a material change and is objected to and rejected by Calendly.
Calendly's acceptance of any orders will not constitute acceptance of any terms and conditions contained therein.


Neither You or Calendly will be liable to the other for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under these Terms (except for a failure to pay fees) if the delay or failure is due to events which are beyond reasonable control, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, for failure, or diminishment of power or telecommunications or data networks or services.


Unless you have specifically notified Calendly to the contrary in writing (including via email to support@calendly.com), Calendly may disclose your company as a customer of Calendly (if you use Calendly for business purposes and/or use a business email address as your Calendly User email address) and may use your companyâs name and logo on the Website and in Calendlyâs promotional content.
Calendly will request your prior written consent for any other uses.

CHANGES

We may amend our Terms at any time by publishing revised Terms on our Website and/or by sending an email to the address you gave us.
These Terms are current as of the Effective Date set forth above.
If any changes are made to these Terms, weâll post them on this page, so please be sure to check back periodically.
If you continue to use Calendly after those changes are in effect, you agree to the revised Terms.
Therefore, it is important for you to periodically review our Terms to make sure you still agree to them.
If you object to any such modifications, your sole recourse will be to cease using this Website.
Calendly reserves the right to change any and all features of our Website, at any time, without notice.

CANADA

The parties declare that they have required that these Terms and Conditions and all documents related hereto, either present or future, be drawn up in the English language only.

Les parties dÃ©clarent par les prÃ©sentes quâelles exigent que cette entente et tous les documents y afferents, soit pour le present ou le future, soient rÃ©digÃ©s en langue anglaise seulement.
