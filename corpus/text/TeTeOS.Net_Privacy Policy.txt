We care about your privacy and security.

TeTeOS.Net uses the information it collects from you to provide you with a better experience.
Of course, cookies also play a big role in this.
(See also: Cookie Usage Policy)



Retained data of users with TeTeOS.Net Account:


Information specific to your profile, such as your e-mail address and the username you specify
Public posts such as your replies to posts, forum discussions, and replies to blog posts
Your IP addresses, browser language and basic analytics information.

Basic analysis information.


We do not store TeTeOS.Net Account password!

While TeTeOS.Net saves the password you have created for your account in its memory, it encrypts it and saves it in the database as encrypted.
That's why even our computer systems that keep the database don't know your password.
When you log in, if you enter the correct password, our system will encrypt the password you entered in the same way, and if this password matches, our system will understand that you entered the correct password.

We do not share your data!

Regarding the protection of stored data, your personal information security rights take precedence.
For this reason, none of your data mentioned in this article is shared with third parties, individuals, companies or institutions.
However, if the user has to provide information due to the request of the relevant official authorities and legal obligation, the requested information may be shared with the Official Institutions.
This only happens in extraordinary situations such as being a member of or supporting a terrorist organization or having an unforgivable crime such as cybercrime.
