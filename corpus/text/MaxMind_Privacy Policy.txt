You may choose to voluntarily submit other information to us through the Services that we do not request, and, in such instances, you are solely responsible for such information. Information Collected Automatically We automatically collect information about your device and how your device interacts with our Services and other services.
The categories of information we automatically collect, including in the last 12 months, and the methods by which we may collect such information include the following: Cookies, Web Beacons, and Embedded Scripts The Services use "cookies" and similar technologies, including HTML5 local storage.
A cookie is a file stored on your device that may be used to identify an individual as a unique user by storing certain personal preferences and user data.
MaxMind uses cookies and other technologies to identify your device, identify authorized users of the MaxMind Account Portal, track affiliate referrals, complete online purchases through MaxMind's shopping carts, and similar Services monitoring activities.
MaxMind may also use web beacons, small graphic images or other web programming code (also known as "1x1 GIFs" or "clear GIFs"), which may be included in our web pages and e-mail messages.
Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon.
Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Services, to monitor how users navigate the Services, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.
MaxMind may also use embedded scripts in connection with the provision of its Services.
"Embedded scripts" are programming code designed to collect information about your interactions with a website, such as the links you click on, and may assist our customers in providing us with information used to provide the Services.
The code is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server, our customer's web server, or a service provider or other party, is active only while you are connected to the website containing the embedded script, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter. Log File Information Your web browser automatically sends information to every website you visit, including ours.
For example, our server logs may receive and record information such as the pages you access on the Services, referring URLs, your browser type, your operating system, the date and time of your visit, and the duration of your visit to each page. User Agent Strings Log file information may also include a user agent string, a series of characters automatically sent with your Internet requests that provide information necessary for smooth Internet communications, such as the operating system and browser you used.
A user agent string might be used to identify the device originating a message. Location Data MaxMind may also request access to or otherwise receive information about your device location when you access the Services.
Your location data may be based on your IP address and other location-aware technologies.
We use location data in connection with providing the Services and to help improve the Services. Unique Identification Number MaxMind may assign your computer or mobile device a unique identification number ("Unique ID") based on log file information when you access the Services.
MaxMind may set a cookie on your device containing, amongst other things, the device's Unique ID.
MaxMind uses information generated from the Unique ID for purposes of improving our Services, primarily our ability to detect fraud.
MaxMind does not share the Unique ID or any associated data with unaffiliated parties in the traditional sense of sharing.
However, some of the services offered by MaxMind, including some that are available through the Services, may require the placement of a snippet of JavaScript on the customer's own website (either by the customer itself or by MaxMind), and that JavaScript collects the information used by MaxMind to create the Unique ID.
If the customer uses the MaxMind minFraud service, it may receive back the Unique ID MaxMind associated with the IP address being used in the request made to the minFraud service. Information Collected through the GeoIP2 JavaScript Client API MaxMind offers a GeoIP2 JavaScript Client API available to its customers via geoip-js.com and js.maxmind.com.
Where a MaxMind customer uses the GeoIP2 JavaScript Client API, MaxMind collects IP addresses and other information (e.g., HTTP headers) provided via geoip-js.com or js.maxmind.com on behalf of the customer, and logs such information only for the purposes of monitoring, alerting, and internal reporting for the specific customer for up to 30 days.
MaxMind does not share information collected through geoip-js.com or js.maxmind.com among customers. Information MaxMind Receives from Other Sources MaxMind receives information about you from other sources.
We may combine the information we receive from third parties with information we collect through the Services.

These other parties set and access their own tracking technologies (including cookies, embedded scripts, and web beacons) and may otherwise collect or have access to your IP address or other unique identifier, log information, and related information about you.

Please note that where we use and disclose personal information for purposes related to security, fraud detection, and other similar purposes, some of your rights may be limited to the extent that they adversely affect the rights and freedoms of other consumers.

In particular, you have the right to request the following from us:

ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES FOR NEVADA RESIDENTS Nevada law requires certain businesses to establish a designated request address where Nevada consumers may submit requests directing the business not to sell certain kinds of personal information that the business has collected or will collect about the consumer.
A sale under Nevada law is the exchange of personal information for monetary consideration by the business to a third party for the third party to license or sell the personal information to other third parties.

ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES FOR DATA SUBJECTS IN EUROPE AND THE UNITED KINGDOM Roles EU and UK data protection laws make a distinction between organizations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as "controllers") and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as "processors").
MaxMind, located at the address set forth in Section 11 above, generally operates as a processor on behalf of its customers that use the MaxMind's services.
The MaxMind customer, the controller, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.
Specifically, MaxMind's customer decides what personal data to share with MaxMind in order for MaxMind to provide the customer with robust risk score information, certain licensed data, the ability to flag potentially fraudulent activity, and other services as purchased by the customer.
Please visit the applicable customer's privacy policy for information about their privacy practices.
MaxMind also operates as a controller with respect to certain of its services and/or databases.
For example, MaxMind operates as a controller in connection with personal data collected from visitors through its website, including through data correction requests.
Also, when MaxMind combines personal data from different customers, like many kinds of analytics services, it may do this both as a processor at its customers' instruction and as a controller itself for the purpose of providing services to all of its customers.
For example, MaxMind may process and aggregate or otherwise de-identify some of the personal data that a customer shares with MaxMind in order to make that personal data part of another database for one or more other services provided to MaxMind customers. Data Subject Rights If you are a data subject in the European Union or UK, you have the right to access, rectify, or erase any personal data we have collected about you through the Services.
You also have the right to data portability and the right to restrict or object to our processing of personal data we have collected about you through the Services.
In addition, you have the right to ask us not to process your personal data (or provide it to third parties to process) for marketing purposes or purposes materially different than for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you.
You may withdraw your consent at any time for any data processing we do based on consent you have provided to us.
To exercise any of these rights, contact us using the information at Section 11 above and specify which right you intend to exercise.
We will respond to your request within 30 days.
We may require additional information from you to allow us to confirm your identity.
Please note that we store information as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, and may continue to retain and use the information even after a data subject request for purposes of our legitimate interests, including as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent fraud, and enforce our agreements.
If your information has been processed by us on behalf of one of our customers and you wish to exercise any rights you have with such information, please inquire with our customer directly.
If you wish to make your request directly to MaxMind, please provide the name of the MaxMind customer on whose behalf MaxMind processes your information.
We will refer your request to that customer, and will support them to the extent required by applicable law in responding to your request.
If you have any issues with our compliance, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a European supervisory authority. International Transfer For personal data transferred from the European Union, the UK, and Switzerland to third countries that do not ensure an adequate level of data protection, we will provide appropriate safeguards, such as through the use of Standard Contractual Clauses.
In addition, MaxMind participates in the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from the European Union, the United Kingdom and Switzerland to the United States, respectively.

ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES FOR DATA SUBJECTS IN BRAZIL Roles Brazilian data protection laws make a distinction between organizations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as "controllers") and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as "processors").
MaxMind, located at the address set forth in Section 11 above, generally operates as a processor on behalf of its customers that use the MaxMind's services.
The MaxMind customer, the controller, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.
Specifically, MaxMind's customer decides what personal data to share with MaxMind in order for MaxMind to provide the customer with robust risk score information, certain licensed data, the ability to flag potentially fraudulent activity, and other services as purchased by the customer.
Please visit the applicable customer's privacy policy for information about their privacy practices.
MaxMind also operates as a controller with respect to certain of its services and/or databases.
For example, MaxMind operates as a controller in connection with personal data collected from visitors through its website, including through data correction requests.
Also, when MaxMind combines personal data from different customers, like many kinds of analytics services, it may do this both as a processor at its customers' instruction and as a controller itself for the purpose of providing services to all of its customers.
For example, MaxMind may process and aggregate or otherwise de-identify some of the personal data that a customer shares with MaxMind in order to make that personal data part of another database for one or more other services provided to MaxMind customers.

You may withdraw your consent at any time for any data processing we do based on consent you have provided to us.
To exercise any of these rights, contact us using the information at Section 11 above and specify which right you intend to exercise.
To exercise your right for confirmation of the existence of processing, access to data, portability of data, deletion of personal data, revocation of consent, or information on public and private entities with which the controller has shared the data, please submit a request through our online form available at /en/lgpd.
We will respond to your request within 30 days and within 15 days if you would like MaxMind to confirm if your data is processed by us or to exercise the right of access to your personal data.

Please note that we store information as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, and may continue to retain and use the information even after a data subject request for purposes of our legitimate interests, including as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent fraud, and enforce our agreements.
If your information has been processed by us on behalf of one of our customers and you wish to exercise any rights you have with such information, please inquire with our customer directly.
