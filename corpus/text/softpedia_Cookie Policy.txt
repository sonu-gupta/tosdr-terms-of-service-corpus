 Cookie management information
Disabling cookies makes the Website harder to use.
Some features will be degraded while others will not work at all.
For example, it is impossible to register or log in without cookies.
This way, using the download basket or the watchlist features is no longer possible.
Nevertheless, users can configure their web browser to reject (or accept) cookies sent by specific sites.
All modern browsers offer this functionality, which can be accessed through the âoptionsâ or âpreferencesâ menu.
Disabling cookies will not stop advertisements from being show, but it might make them less relevant to usersâ interests.
