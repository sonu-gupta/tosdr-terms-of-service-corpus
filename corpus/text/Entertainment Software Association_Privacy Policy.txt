Rating Customers

Sections of the Websites are dedicated to ESRBâs business function of rating computer and video games and online apps.

We consider this to be a legitimate commercial interest that justifies our collection of your information.&nbsp.
Moreover, our collection may be necessitated by our contractual obligations to provide and track ratings, all of which is in the publicâs interest.&nbsp.
However, the decision whether to provide the information to us, belongs to you.
If you prefer not to disclose the information, you will still be able to utilize the Websites, but you will not be able to submit a game or app for rating.
We maintain the information obtained in connection with a rating, including the personal and business information you provide us, in a database.
Because our rating of a game or app does not expire, we maintain this information indefinitely, meaning we will not delete it.
We maintain credit card information only as long as necessary to satisfy its operational purpose.
