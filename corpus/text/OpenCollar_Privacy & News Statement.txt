Updates During its life cycle the products described on this website may receive notifications about new updates.

Then, it is up to you if you choose to acquire and install the update, or if you are still satisfied with this product as it is.
Updates may include, but are not limited to, bug fixes, memory improvements, cosmetic enhancement, and new features.

News Some products described on this website come with a feature that allows us to broadcast news when you are currently logged into Second LifeÂ®.
News are small pieces of text that are no greater than 1,024 characters in length.
They are only sent once per rezzed or worn product, and the same news are never repeated on the same copy of this product.
The news may include, but are not limited to, links to blog posts, promotional offers, announcements of interesting events and new product releases, or invitations to beta tests and community gatherings.
Unlike common mailing lists that rely on storing some of your data, such as your user name or email address, our news feature can do away without this by downloading the information directly from a web server.
This ensures that you will never receive any news from us in your email inbox when not currently logged into Second LifeÂ®, and your data stays with you and is never shared with us, or with anyone else, when you use this product.
If you don't want to receive any news at all, you can disable the news feature in every product described on this website that has such a feature installed.
Collars have a selection box for news in their About menus that can be unchecked or checked.
To disable the news feature in other products, you have to wear that particular product, then open your Nearby Chat and enter: /301 news offâ
If we ever change this privacy policy The updates will be posted online.
If these are substantial changes, we will announce the update through the usual channels for such announcements.
Your continued use of the product or service after the effective date of such changes constitutes your acceptance of such changes and to make your review more convenient, we will post an effective date here at the end of this policy.
