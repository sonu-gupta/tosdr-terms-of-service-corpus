In case you want to send us a letter, we are based at Jogailos g.

If you have any questions about these terms and conditions (Terms) or anything at all, just drop our friendly customer support team a line at support@curve.com or get in touch via the Curve app.
If we need to contact you, weâll contact you in English via the Curve app, by email, phone or using your home address - depending on the information we need to share - so make sure your details are always up to date.
If in doubt, these Terms are concluded in English.

These Terms set out the terms of service for your Curve account and other important things you need to know.
By clicking âaccept/continueâ youâre entering into a legally binding agreement with Curve Europe UAB, which issues your Curve card and electronic money (e-money). 
Curve is authorised to issue e-money by the Bank of Lithuania (located at Gedimino ave.
6, LT-01103, Vilnius, Lithuania, telephone no.
+370 800 50 500.
More information about the Bank of Lithuania is detailed by this link https://www.lb.lt/en/) (licence No.

Anything else you should read?
The Fee Schedule forms part of these Terms and we highly recommend reading it.
Along with these Terms, you should take a look at our Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, Fair Use Policy, Curve Customer Protection Policy and refer to the FAQs for any questions you may have.
Definitions used in these Terms are provided in Annex No 1.
Please read these Terms carefully and contact us at support@curve.com or get in touch via the Curve app if you have any questions. 
Who can open a Curve account?
You can open a Curve account:


if youâre a resident in one of the eligible countries listed in the app or on our website,


have the full legal capacity to enter into a contract, and


youâre 18 years old or over.


You canât open a Curve account:


on someone elseâs behalf, or


if you already have a Curve account, or


if there is any reason that Curve is unable to grant you an account under the law that applies to us.


When you open your account, we ask you for information which is required to open the account.&nbsp.
If this information is not provided, your account opening will be delayed.&nbsp.
We may ask you for additional information, from time to time, in addition to what you provided when you opened your account and if this information is not provided to meet our requirements this may result in your account being suspended or closed.
What should you know about your Curve account?

E-money.
Your Curve account stores e-money, an electronic alternative to cash that can be used to pay for goods and services, in store or online and to take money out at an ATM.
Rest assured that your money is always kept separate from our own.
This is known as customer funds safeguarding.
It is required by law and ensures that your money is protected and returned to you in full if we decide to cease operations or become insolvent.
 

No interest.
Weâre not allowed to pay you interest on the funds we hold for you and they are not protected by the Deposit Insurance Fund.
Donât worry: Curve is required to keep your funds safe in a safeguarding bank account, which means that all of your funds are protected.

How it works.
You need to link and verify an eligible payment card to your Curve account in the Curve app, before you can use your Curve card.
The payment card can be any debit card, credit card or prepaid card that we allow you to link to your Curve account.
We may need to introduce certain restrictions on the cards that we are able to accept on to the Curve system and will try to keep you informed on any changes, some of which may depend on the card schemes.
When you make a transaction using your Curve card, Curve (with your permission) loads funds from your selected payment card to Curve.
This is done for you automatically by the Curve processing system (no hassle to you).
The amount loaded will be the value of the transaction, plus any fees for that transaction (including for any Curve services provided).
The loaded funds are used to issue e-money which is loaded onto your Curve e-money account and are then used to pay for the transaction made with your Curve card.
If your selected payment card account has insufficient funds or declines the transaction for any other reason, the transaction will be declined.
In case Curve receives a decline from the payment card selected in the Curve app, we may try to process the transaction from the cards that you have set as your default or back up cards (for more information on how to set this up, go here)
You can add multiple payment cards to the Curve app and change the selected payment card at any time using the Curve app.
Each time you link a payment card to your Curve account youâre giving us a continuous authority to use that payment card to fund the purchase of the e-money used to pay for transactions.
Curve will use various means to identify that the card you have added to your account is yours and that you have the right to use it.
You can see your transactions on the timeline in the Curve app.
What should you know about your Curve card?
Curve will issue you either a personal or business Curve Card, based on the purpose of the card use you selected during the sign-up process.
It will either be a physical and/or digital card.
A digital card is a card where you can see your Curve card details in the Curve app only, and can request a physical card if you want one (fees for this are in the Fee Schedule).
You can use your Curve card to make purchases for goods and services, in store or online.
To withdraw cash, you will&nbsp.
need a physical Curve card.
Please note that you cannot withdraw cash at an ATM if you have your Curve Cash card selected as a funding source for the Curve card.
ACCOUNTS &amp.
SECURITY
What type of accounts can you open?

Personal or business.
Curve offers both
personal and&nbsp.
business accounts.
You can only open a business account if you are a sole-trader or a self-employed natural person and intend to use your Curve account exclusively for business spend.
You cannot open a business account for a company or partnership. 
We can suspend your account or change it from business to personal if we reasonably think it is not being used for business purposes.
If we change your account type, we will issue you with a replacement card.
.
From time to time, we may request further information from you, to verify your business status and business spend.
Please note that the use of a Curve business account for personal spend is not permitted under these Terms.  
If you have a business account but wish to use Curve for personal reasons, you must contact us to change your account type.
There is no cost to you for this change.

Minimum subscription periods

When you subscribe to Curve Black or Metal, you can choose to pay monthly or annually.
Depending on which you choose, minimum subscription periods apply.

If you choose to pay monthly, the minimum subscription period is 6 months.
If you wish to cancel your subscription you may do so but you will not be refunded any amount paid for the current month of the subscription.
If you cancel your subscription and it is less than 4 months since the start of it, you must give us 2 monthsâ advance notice (such notice period to run from the end of your current subscription month).
You do not need to give us advance notice if you want to cancel and it is more than 4 months since the start of it.

If you choose to pay annually, the minimum subscription period is 12 months.
This minimum subscription period will apply each time your subscription is renewed.
If you wish to cancel your subscription you may do so but you will not be refunded any amount of the annual subscription fee.
You do not need to give us advance notice to cancel your subscription. 
In all cases where your subscription is subject to a minimum subscription period (whether 6 months because you pay monthly or 12 months because you pay annually), you will continue to have all of the benefits available under those subscriptions until the end of the period for which you have paid.
For example, if you cancel your 12 month subscription during its second month, you can continue to use the benefits under the subscription for the remaining 10 months.
If you were&nbsp.
an existing Curve Black or Metal subscriber at the time version 1.2 of these Terms was published (29 April 2021), the minimum subscription periods detailed above will not apply to you for so long as you continue on your current subscription (this includes annual subscribers when their subscription renews).
If you upgrade from Black to Metal or downgrade from Metal to Black or change your subscription payment schedule from monthly to annually or annually to monthly, the minimum subscription periods will apply.

More than one account.
You can not hold more than one Curve account.
We can close down additional accounts without informing you first.

Upgrading your account.
You can upgrade your account simply by clicking on the âManage Your Subscriptionâ tab in the app.
You can also change the payment card your subscription is charged to using the same tab.
If we canât charge your nominated payment card for subscription fees or any other fees you owe us - e.g., if your card has expired or has insufficient funds - you agree that we can take them from any other payment card youâve linked to your Curve account.
If we canât take the fees from any of the other payment cards either, youâll need to provide us with a valid payment card within 30 days of our request to do so, otherwise we may either close or downgrade your account.

Downgrading your account.
You can downgrade your account by getting in touch with us and fees may be payable in accordance with the Fee Schedule.
Curve reserves the right to restrict the ability to subscribe to the Curve Metal or Curve Black account for customers who upgrade or downgrade from another type of Account, more than once in a given 12 month period.

Fees.
You can find details of the fees we charge in the Fee Schedule.
We will keep you informed before we introduce any new fee or make changes to any existing fees.

Replacement Card.
We charge fees for replacing your Curve card at the time we process the request for a replacement card.
We can charge the fee from any of the payment cards linked to your Curve account.
We wonât charge you to replace a card that has been stolen or misappropriated.

Curve Fronted
.
Using your Curve card (with a debit or credit card as your payment card) to pay merchants who only accept payments by debit card, or who either impose a charge or deny certain types of credit cards (e.g.
paying off a credit card with an underlying credit card selected), is defined by Curve as a Curve Fronted transaction and will attract a service fee (see our Fees Schedule for details).
Please note that before you start using this function you should make sure that your underlying credit card issuer allows usage of your credit card to fund Curve card transactions.
Please remember that when you fund your Curve card with a credit card or other card that applies fees to transactions:


your underlying credit card issuer may also apply fees in relation to Curve Fronted transactions using Curve.
Curve will not be liable for such fees.
These fees are strictly non-refundable in nature,


you may have to pay other costs, taxes or charges which are outside our control and not charged by us e.g.
your payment card issuer may charge you for making a payment through your Curve card.


Keeping your account safe
Please keep your Curve card, account information, security details and the devices you use to access your account safe.
This means:


signing your Curve card as soon as you receive it (if you can),


not sharing your security details with anyone (including your Curve card PIN, Curve app password or PIN or other security information used to protect your Curve account),


not letting anyone else use your Curve card or Curve app,


keeping your Curve card and card details (physical or digital) safe,


making sure you close down the Curve app when you're not using it; 


keeping your mobile phone and your email account secure.


If you think your card is lost or stolen, someone knows your security details or there are transactions on your account you donât recognise, you must immediately:


immediately lock your Curve card in the app,


let us know ASAP by calling +44(0)2033222585 (lines are open 24/7) or any number linked here, by email on support@curve.com or via the Curve app,


stop using your Curve account and card until you hear from us.


If you find your Curve card after youâve locked it but before youâve notified us, simply unlock it again via the app.
Because we send important notifications and information to you via the Curve app and the proper functioning and security of the app relies on updates from time to time, you agree that you will keep the Curve app on your mobile devices up to date.
USING CURVE
Using your Curve card

Uses.
You can use your Curve card to make payments online or at mPos or to withdraw cash.

Authorised transactions. Weâll consider a transaction to be authorised by you when you do at least one of the following:


enter your PIN,


sign a receipt,


provide your Curve card details (card number, expiry date, CVV number),


wave or swipe your Curve card (digital or physical) over or near a contactless payment reader,


use your Curve card and PIN to withdraw cash from a payment terminal, e.g at ATM,


select a contact of yours and instruct the transfer of funds to that person in the Curve app.


When you use your Curve Card to make a withdrawal from an ATM or make a payment (for example, in a shop or restaurant), we will consider the payment to be authorised by you unless:


you let us know that the money has been stolen from your account.
or


you don't think we've carried out your instructions correctly.


We start to process your transaction at the time you use your card either for an ATM withdrawal, online transaction or payment at a terminal.
Itâs important to note that the authorisation for a transaction lasts for 30 days and can be processed at any time during these 30 days.
If a merchant processes your transaction after 30 days, you agree that we can still process the transaction.
You remain responsible under these Terms in respect of all transactions you authorise on your Curve account including all charges and other amounts incurred.
You also agree that if Curve is unable to collect the corresponding funds from your funding card at time these become due to be paid by Curve to the merchant, Curve is authorised to collect such funds from any of your other funding cards loaded into the Curve app.

Cancelling transactions.
You can cancel a transaction youâve agreed to pay in the future up until close of business on the day before the transaction is due to take place.
Just contact us to do this.

Changes to payment amounts.
Sometimes, you might make changes to a purchase between the time you authorise the transaction and the time the merchant processes it.
In these cases, the merchant may amend the payment amount to reflect this change.
You agree that we may pay the additional amount to the merchant on the basis of your initial authorisation and charge the shortfall to&nbsp.
you.

Pre-authorisations.
If youâve used your card to pre-authorise a transaction of less than EUR 150 (or its equivalent in your local currency), we may place a block on those funds (meaning you canât use them) or charge the amount to your payment card at the time you pre-authorise the transaction.
If the final amount is less than EUR 150, weâll refund or unblock the difference.

Continuous payment authority.
You can use your Curve card to set up a future payment (either on a one-off or recurring basis) on a selected payment card.
Weâll make the payment from the payment card youâve selected in the Curve App at the time we process the transaction, which may be a different payment card to the one you had selected at the time you set up the future payment.
If you need to cancel such payments, get in touch with us.

Spending limits.
We have limits on how much you can spend or withdraw - these are set out in your Curve app.
We may change these limits every now and then.
You can ask us to increase your limits - if we refuse, you have to wait 3 months to request another review.

Reasons we may&nbsp.
refuse or delay a payment?




Security: Weâre concerned about the security of your Curve card or account,



Fraud: We suspect fraud on your account,



Law or regulation: We need to comply with the relevant law or regulation,



Your actions: The transaction breaches limits which apply to your Curve account youâve breached these Terms, youâve failed to provide us with information weâve asked for, or your account has been blocked for any other legitimate reason, or



Third parties: If a third party (e.g.
a card network) prevents us from making the payment.


If we are permitted to do so, weâll tell you if we refuse to make a payment and (where possible) why.
We may need to contact you urgently if we suspect or find fraudulent activity has occurred on your account (provided we are not prohibited from doing so by law) or if we suffer a security threat.
When we contact you, we will also give you information on how you can minimise any risk to your payment instrument depending on the nature of the fraud or security threat.
Weâll use the same contact details which you have already provided us with when contacting you.
so please make sure you keep your account details up to date by contacting us.
What about foreign currency transactions?



In case of withdrawals or purchases using your Curve card where the currency of your selected payment card is different to the currency of the transaction - Curve will perform a currency conversion for you.



If, when making a transaction, you have set your payment&nbsp.
card currency in the Curve app to a different currency than that of the payment card itself then your payment card issuer may charge a fee for using their currency conversion services.
This might be in addition to any fees that Curve charges you. 
If we have to convert the currency of a payment made using your Curve card weâll use an exchange rate which will be either the:



Standard exchange rate.



On a weekday we will normally use an exchange rate collected from our wholesale provider, though when the exchange rate is volatile we may use the rate as of midnight on that day.
Weâll use this rate during the hours foreign currency markets are open in London, UK.
We can let you know the rate for a transaction if you get in touch with us.



Weekend exchange rate.



This is the rate at the time the markets are closed in London, U.K.
It will apply from the time the markets close until they open again.
We can let you know the rate for a transaction if you get in touch with us.
Please check our Fee schedule to find out the currency conversion fee applicable for the currency exchange transactions.
Exchange rates can fluctuate between the date you made the transaction and the date itâs actually processed by the merchant to your account, please note that changes in the exchange rates will be applied immediately and without notice.
The rate applied to a transaction will be shown in the Curve app. 
If you use the Go Back in Time feature in relation to a foreign currency transaction, itâs possible that a different exchange rate to the one used for the original transaction will apply.
If the merchant subsequently refunds the foreign transaction payment, the exchange rate used will be the one at the date the transaction was settled, not when the refund is settled.
You can contact us at support@curve.com for details of the exchange rate for any transaction.
You can also find the exchange rate that was applied to your transaction in your Curve app.
Weâll not be responsible to you if youâre charged fees or lose any money if you ask the merchant or any other third party to make the currency conversion.
Whoâs responsible for losses on your Curve card or account?

When youâll be responsible.
Youâre responsible for all losses where:


youâve acted fraudulently,


you deliberately failed to keep your device, account details or your Curve card and account security details safe.


If you donât tell us as soon as you realise that your card is lost or stolen, when you think or suspect that someone else knows your security details, or there have been unauthorised transactions on your Curve card, youâll have to pay up to EUR 50 (or its equivalent in your home currency) of the losses.
When weâll be responsible. 
We'll always try to process your payments correctly and on time, but sometimes things go wrong.

If they do, weâll refund you any money youâve lost as a result of:


any unauthorised transaction which youâve promptly reported (and within 13 months of the transaction), provided youâve not acted fraudulently or carelessly,


our mistakes, or


transactions authorised by us after you locked your card (but only to the amount of the original authorisation).


We may also refund you where youâve used your Curve card to make a payment in the European Economic Area (EEA) without knowing the exact amount beforehand (e.g.
when hiring a car) and the final amount is much higher than you reasonably would have expected.
Just drop us a line through the app or at support@curve.com as soon as you notice it but not later than&nbsp.
13 months after the date of the transaction, and provide us with any further information we need to look into this.
Weâll then make a decision either to refund the transaction or give you reasons for rejecting your request.
What can I not use my Curve account and Curve card for?
We know most customers will but you must use your Curve account and card responsibly.
You canât use them:


for anything thatâs against the law (e.g.
fraud) or is harmful or disrespectful to others, including any form of abuse of us or our staff,


in breach of these Terms,


in a way that might harm our ability to provide our services or may harm our software, systems or hardware,


in a way that your payment card issuer, a card network, our acquirer and/ or payment processor, would see as an abuse of the payments system,


to pay for adult entertainment, gambling, cryptocurrencies, money orders (except wire transfers) and travellersâ cheques from non-financial institutions,


for âcash recyclingâ, which means using your Curve card to make an ATM withdrawal and using the cash to repay the payment card used for the withdrawal in order to receive rewards on the payment card or your Curve card,


to create one or more Curve account(s) without our permission attempt to âdouble dipâ or to do anything during the course of a dispute to receive funds from us and your bank or payment card issuer for the same transaction,


to make transactions which are not allowed by the issuer of your linked payment card e.g.
cash advances or transactions for investment purposes.
Check your payment cardâs terms to see whatâs allowed.


Money owed to Curve
In the event you owe Curve money either for fees or transactions that you have made using Curve, or missed subscription fees, we may immediately charge such amounts to any of your payment cards.
We reserve the right to collect the amount of your debt to Curve by using any payments received to your Account.
We may also recover amounts you owe us through legal means, including, without limitation, through the use of a debt collection agency.
CURVE FEATURES
Go back in time
This allows you to change the payment card you used to pay for certain transactions after they were made.
Check out which transactions this is possible for in the Curve app (note that we can change this list and restrict customers from using this feature where we have a good reason to do so).
Be aware your card issuer may charge a fee for this, which weâre not responsible for.
Curve Rewards
From time to time, we offer our customers promotional offers with select retailers which you can choose to participate in if you wish.
We call this Curve Rewards.
Our Curve Rewards Supplemental Terms are here.
The terms specific to individual offers will be presented to you at the time you select the offer.
Provided that you comply with the terms of the offers you choose to take part in, we will pay to your Curve Cash card an amount in accordance with those offers. 
The funds paid by us to your Curve Cash card for any Curve Rewards offers will be held as e-money and safeguarded as required by Lithuanian law.
These funds are available for you to spend when you select the Curve Cash card as a funding source for your Curve card.
Please note that you cannot use your Curve Cash card to withdraw cash and it cannot be used by you to pay any fees to Curve.
If you want to withdraw funds from your Curve Cash card, you can get in touch with us.

Curve Cash

Sometimes we offer our customers cashback in the form of points for using their Curve account and card â we call this Curve Cash.
You can check out the current Curve Cash Terms&nbsp.
on our website.
We change this every now and then but you can keep a tab on this through our website.
Curve Cash is different to Curve Rewards.
With Curve Cash, youâll receive Curve Cash Points, which we add to your Curve Cash card.
However, Curve Cash Points have no cash value and are not deemed to be e-money or any other equivalent of a fiat currency (unlike Curve Rewards).
Your Curve Cash Points cannot be used to withdraw cash or otherwise be redeemed for cash.
You cannot use Curve Cash Points to pay for any fees due to Curve.
When you use your Curve Cash card for a transaction, Curve will convert your Curve Cash Points to e-money (our little gift to you!) to the value of the transaction.
You will still be charged any fees that may be applicable to a transaction when these Points are used.
If there are not enough Curve Cash Points on your Curve Cash card, the transaction will be declined.
Please note that if your Curve Cash card holds Curve Cash Points in addition to other funds (for example, from Curve Rewards) then those other funds will be used first and your Curve Cash Points will only be converted to e-money and used when there are no other or insufficient other funds to complete a transaction.
Curve Cash Points expire 6 months from the date they are added to your Curve Cash card.
If your Account is closed either by you or by Curve, you will not be able to redeem the value of your Curve Cash Points.
Using the Curve app to access accounts with other service providers
You can also access your accounts with other service providers and initiate payments from those accounts.
We call these Account Information Service (AIS) and Payment Initiation Service (PIS).
When you use our AIS to view information about an account you hold with another provider, or use our PIS to initiate a payment from an account you hold with another provider to initiate a transaction, you must authorise us to access that account and/ or make a payment.
We wonât store any of the sensitive payment data you provide to give that authorisation.
We will consider that you gave us consent and authorised us to initiate payments or view information from those accounts when you choose in your Curve app the certain service and filled in requested information.
Open Banking permissions
We may provide you access through the Curve app to a third party AIS and PIS provider - to check whether this service is available in your country - please check here.
These services will allow you to obtain financial information from your online bank or third party payment account (account information services) and to make online payments directly from your third party payment account (payment initiation services).
You will need to sign up to the third party AIS and PIS providerâs terms and conditions during the sign up process and provide them your details in order to create an account on their system and to access your data or execute payments.
We have no responsibility for the products and services provided to you by or through the AIS and PIS third party provider and will not be liable to you for any harm, damage or loss arising from your use of the products and services provided to you by or through the third party AIS and PIS provider.  
The terms and conditions that are connected to your third party payment account apply to the payment accounts that you access through the third party AIS and PIS provider will remain in effect and are not amended by these terms and conditions. 
Curve is not responsible for the information that you receive from the third party payment account provider or third party AIS and PIS provider. 
CLOSING &amp.
SUSPENDING ACCOUNTS
When can we block, suspend or close your account?

Blocking.
Weâll block your account if we have reasonable concerns about your accountâs security or suspect fraud, money laundering or where law or regulation requires us to.

Suspension and closure.
We may immediately suspend or close your account for a number of reasons including where:


you use Curve in a way that these Terms donât allow,


you donât provide us information weâve asked for or information youâve provided is false or misleading,


we determine you have breached our Fair Use Policy,


your behaviour towards us makes it difficult to deal with you (e.g.
you insult our staff),


youâve broken these Terms in a serious or persistent way and you havenât put the matter right within a reasonable time of us asking you to,


weâre required to by law or regulation,


youâre declared bankrupt,


we can verify that you have died.


Weâll give you at least 2 monthsâ notice if we want to close your account for any other reason, unless we are prohibited by law from doing so.
How can you close your account?
By accepting these Terms you agree that Curve will start implementing them before the end of the 14 days âcooling offâ period.
You can cancel your account at any time by emailing us at support@curve.com or contacting us in the app.
Youâll get a refund of any subscription fees youâve paid if you change your mind within the first 14 days of signing up (the âcooling offâ period).
You will be charged pro rata if you have used any of the Curve services (including receiving a card).
If youâre a Curve Metal customer, youâll need to give us 1 monthsâ notice before you can close your account.
If you cancel or downgrade your Curve Metal account in the first six months after subscription - you will also be charged a Curve Metal card fee to cover the cost of ordering and delivering the metal card.
If you cancel after the first six months have elapsed - this cost is on us.
On closing your account, you still need to pay us any fees you owe us or any transactions that have not yet completed.
Youâll also need to make sure you cancel any outgoing payments you donât want to pay anymore.
If there is a balance on your Curve account, this will be redeemed to an underlying cardâs bank account - once we complete our checks (if needed).
If any balance is still remaining on your account when your account is closed you can request to have these funds returned to a bank account in your name, subject to our checks.
You forfeit your rights on these funds if you do not claim these funds within 6 years from the date your account was closed.
During this period your funds will be kept safe.

OTHER IMPORTANT LEGAL STUFF
Our liability
We are liable for proper execution of your payment transactions.
Weâll not be responsible for any money youâve lost as a result of:


a merchant or ATM provider refusing to accept your Curve card,


us suspending or closing your account in accordance with these Terms,


Curve implementing a legal or regulatory requirement,


unforeseeable events outside our control, where the consequences would have been unavoidable despite our best efforts,


goods or services that you purchase using your Curve card,


loss or corruption of data unless caused by our wilful wrongdoing,


our compliance with applicable laws.


Weâre also not responsible for any charges you have to pay to third parties, like your payment card issuers or payment account service providers, for using the Curve account and services.
If we breach our Terms with you, weâll only be responsible for losses that could have been foreseen at the time we entered into these Terms and are directly related to the event in question.
Weâll do all we reasonably can to make sure that our services are not interrupted and are accessible at a reasonable speed.
However, we canât promise that this will always be the case e.g.
where we rely on third parties to process payments.
Nothing in these Terms will stop us being responsible to you, if we act fraudulently, we act with a very significant degree of carelessness, or weâre at fault and the law does not allow us to exclude or limit our liability.
We will not be liable to you in respect of any losses you or any third party may suffer in connection with the use of Curveâs service - app, account or Curve card as a result of our actions which were not a foreseeable consequence of our actions.
Changes to these Terms
Because these Terms will continue till you or we end them, we may need to change these Terms every now and then.
If we make changes that are clearly in your favour, weâll tell you once weâve made them.
Otherwise, weâll give you 2 monthsâ notice before the change will come into effect - so you can easily end these Terms if you donât agree with the changes.
Any such changes will only of course be made if they are reasonable.
Weâll assume youâre happy with the change unless you tell us otherwise. 
We may amend these Terms to reflect changes:


to the law or regulatory requirements,


to the way we manage your Curve account as a result of changes in technology and changes to the Curve system that we use,


in the cost of providing your account and other Curve services,


to our existing products and services,


and anything else that we currently canât predict.


Weâll assume youâre happy with the changes unless you tell us otherwise. 
We may not be able to give you 2 monthsâ notice before changes take effect if they are due to reasons outside our control.
If so, you will always have 2 months from when they take effect to cancel your account free of charge.
Our contract with you

Personal to you.
Only you and we have any rights under these Terms.
These Terms are personal to you and you canât transfer any rights or obligations under them to anyone else.

Transfer.
We can transfer any of our rights and obligations under the Terms to comply with a legal or regulatory requirement and we reasonably think that a transfer would not have a significantly negative effect on your rights.

Severability.
If for any reason a part of these Terms becomes invalid or unenforceable, we both agree that the invalid or unenforceable parts can be removed and that the rest of the Terms will still be enforceable.

Waiver.
If you fail to keep to any of your obligations and we donât take action against you (immediately or ever), we can still take action at a later date.
Our intellectual property
Curve owns all the intellectual property in the Curve products and services or has a license to use them, e.g.
Curve app, Curve website, Curve logo and card designs.
You agree you won't use Curve's intellectual property, except to use Curveâs products.
Also, you agree you wonât reverse engineer any of Curveâs products (that is try to reproduce them after a detailed examination of their composition).
Lithuania law applies
Lithuania law will decide any legal questions about this agreement, and about our dealings with you with a view to entering into it.
If you are living in another EEA country when this agreement starts, Lithuania law will still apply, but will not act to deprive you of any mandatory protections that would have been afforded to you in that country.
In addition, the competent authorities of that country will have jurisdiction to hear any claims in relation to this agreement, but you can still bring a claim against us in the competent authorities of Lithuania if you want to.
Your Data
By agreeing these terms, you also agree to us using your information to make and receive payments on your account, and any other lawful grounds that Curve has to use your information.
If youâre no longer happy for us to use your information, weâll have to close your account.
We may keep your personal data and use it where we have lawful grounds to do so.
For example, any identity verification information we need to maintain for regulatory reasons (please refer to our Privacy Policy).Fees ScheduleSubscription FeeTo provide you with the benefits and services associated with your Curve cardmetalâ¬14.99 per month or â¬150 per yearblackâ¬9.99 per monthblueâ¬0

Currency Conversion Fee - for purchases and ATM withdrawals you make over the weekend or UK bank holidaysTo cover the cost of enabling you to make purchases and withdraw cash in a currency different from the currency of your payment card.
Weâll use the weekend exchange rate for purchases and cash withdrawals you make when the foreign currency markets are closed in the UK (typically weekends and bank holidays).
The weekend rate is the rate at the time the markets closed.
In case of withdrawals or purchases over the weekend where the currency of the selected Payment Card is different to the currency of the spend, as the Forex markets are closed, we take the rate of last days the market were open (in most cases Friday :23:59 GMT) and apply a surcharge.
If there is a currency conversion and the currency of the selected payment card and the currency of the transaction are both in one of GBP, USD or EUR, the rate will be increased by 0.5%.
In any other case, that is if either the currency of your transaction or the currency of the selected Payment Card is any of our other supported currencies, the rate will be increased by up to 1.5%.

âPlease note that this is not a limit per credit card, but a cumulative for all âcredit card withdrawals using your Curve card in a calendar month.â This fee will be in addition to any of the other fees mentioned above.
Note: Our platform uses third-party systems to identify whether the payment card âis a credit card.
If you believe your card has been incorrectly defined âyou should contact us and we may ask you for information so we can investigate.
When fees are only stated in EUR, and you are a customer resident in any other EEA countries, you will be charged in your local currency equivalent which is calculated in the same way as the currency conversion discussed above.
