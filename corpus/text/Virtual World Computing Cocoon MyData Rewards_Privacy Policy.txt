Cocoon provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information we receive from you when you use the Cocoon products or the Cocoon website (http://www.getcocoon.com).
Together, we refer to the My Data Rewards program, the Cocoon browser and website, and any of our services as "Cocoon Properties".
This Privacy Policy applies only to information that is provided to us through Cocoon Properties.
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time.
We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Cocoon website.


Information We Collect

You may voluntarily provide us with information, including:
Your name, email address, age, profile name, profile photo, height, weight, occupation, personal interests, third party social networking service user name, and a password that you create to register to use the Service; Information you provide when you contact us (for example, regarding support or employment opportunities).
and Any other information you voluntarily provide us with in registering and using the Service. We automatically collect other information about you, including: An identifier that is unique to the device on which you install the App and some device identifiers may be persistent device identifiers, as well as certain software and hardware information about your device; Your Internet Protocol (IP) address.
Domain name of your Internet service provider; Your geographic location; The Service pages that you visit and the date and time of your visits; Aggregated information that cannot be used to specifically identify you when you visit or use the Service.
and Prior to your installation of My Data Rewards, we may have already collected information about the other apps that you have used via our Advertising Partners or other Third Parties.

We may collect information about you from:
 third party social networking services;
commercially available sources;
our affiliates.
and
our third party business partners. We may combine any of the information we collect from or about you and use it in the manner described in this Privacy Policy. We may supplement any of the information we collect from or about you with other information.
Your direct feedback and comments are valuable, especially when combined with information automatically gathered about how you use Cocoon Properties.
To that end, Cocoon collects key information that helps us improve the product and to deliver the Cocoon rewards service.
Some of this information may be personal information about you (e.g., your email address, sites you visit).
We may also collect personal information in ways that donât involve Cocoon products and services â for instance, if you send us an email with your phone number in it.
We also collect information about your use of Cocoon Properties and the configuration of your system.
While this information is collected anonymously, it may still be possible to associate the collected information with you (e.g., through heuristics or in combination with third-party data about you).
However, it is our policy not to make such associations, and to make it difficult to determine such associations.

If you don't want us to collect this information, you have two options:
 For periods during which you do not want information collected, open a browser window in Private or Incognito Mode, which can be accessed from the Cocoon toolbar or the menu on Windows and from the File menu on Mac.
We never collect usage data from a window while it is in Incognito Mode.
Browsing in Incognito Mode may result in you not accruing Cocoon rewards for your activity (e.g.
searching or shopping).
 Remove Cocoon from your system.

Among the kinds of information we collect, without limitation, are the following.
 Which Cocoon Properties features you use and how often (for instance, how often you use the privacy or incognito mode) The amount of time that Cocoon Properties run and the amount of time they are active Cocoon Properties crashes and associated conditions around the time of the crash What youâve selected for certain Cocoon Properties preferences and options (for instance, whether or not you run Cocoon in full-screen mode) Which other Internet browsers run on your system, and which browser is set as the default browser Your screen resolution, operating system version, CPU and memory configuration of your machine, and other configuration information The number of tabs you have open (but not the sites you have open in those tabs)
If you open a window in "Privacy" or "Incognito" mode, no data from that window will be collected or sent to Cocoon, and all data from that window including history and cache generated by activity in that window will be deleted as soon as you close that window.

Information Collection, Use and Disclosure
 Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our services, features, and content. Your Personal Information.
When you communicate with us or use Cocoon Properties, we may collect personal information about you.
For instance, if you email us requesting support, youâll provide us with your email address so we can respond to you.
Personal Information can also include, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, IP address, or home address.
(We might not ask you for all or any of these things, but you might provide them to us without our asking â for instance, in an email to us.) We use your Personal Information to provide the Services and to respond to your requests for support. Pseudonymous Information.
We also collect other information that you provide or that is provided to us about you when using Cocoon Properties (e.g., without limitation, what search engine(s) you use, and your individual preferences, your interest data when signing up for our mobile apps, etc.) ("Pseudonymous Information").
We may also collect Pseudonymous Information about your age, gender, and city or zip code when you log into the product or even if you've just downloaded the product, but have yet to register.
This information on its own generally isnât enough to identify you specifically.
All this information is considered Pseudonymous Information.

How We Use Your Information.
 Aggregating Information.
We may aggregate the Pseudonymous Information we collect with similar information collected from other Cocoon Users to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of Cocoon Properties, and to analyze and understand how Cocoon Properties are used.
We may also use information you provide without aggregating it to serve you specifically.
for instance, to deliver a product to you according to your preferences or restrictions. Demographic Profiling.
We might also use non-aggregated information for development or demographic profiling purposes, but any such use would not be personally identifiable.
For instance, we might combine the information Facebook sends us about your age, gender and ZIP code with the data Cocoon sends us about your usage habits to find out more about which groups of people use specific Browser features.
As an example, we might do this to get a sense of how many people aged 18-21 use the incognito feature, but not who those people actually are. Newsletters and Marketing.
We also may use your Personal Information to contact you with Cocoon newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you, either generally or in your capacity as a Cocoon.com member.
If you decide at any time you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or contact us as explaining in Your Data Protection Rights section below. Log Data.
When you visit the Cocoon Web Sites (like www.GetCocoon.com), whether youâre using Cocoon or as a non-registered user just visiting, our servers automatically record information your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data").
This is different from the information Cocoon will send included in the "Please Read This Carefully" section at the top of this Policy.
here, weâre talking about information thatâs automatically collected by our web server in order to show you pages on the Cocoon Web Sites.
This data is collected whether or not you use Cocoon, but only when you visit our website.
This Log Data may include information such as your computerâs Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, the web page you were visiting before you came to our Sites, pages of our Sites that you visit, the time spent on those pages, the information you search for on our Sites, access times and dates, and other statistics.
We use this information to monitor and analyze the use of the Sites and the Service and for the Sitesâ technical administration, to increase our Sitesâ functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitorsâ needs.
We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Sites meet the criteria required to process their requests.

Opt-Out
 Certain advertising networks and exchanges may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance (âDAAâ) AdChoices Program and may display an Advertising Option Icon for interest-based ads.
You can learn more about the DAA AdChoices Program here: http://www.youradchoices.com.
In addition, certain advertising networks and exchanges may participate in the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI).
The NAI has developed a tool that allows consumers to opt-out of targeted advertising delivered by NAI membersâ ad networks.

Please refer to instructions provided by your mobile service provider or the manufacturer of your device to learn how to adjust your mobile device and mobile browser settings. If you do not want our mobile applications to collect any information from you, you should uninstall the application using the standard uninstall procedures that may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network where you obtained the mobile application.

Cookies
 Like many websites, we may use "cookies" to collect information.
A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computerâs hard disk for record-keeping purposes.
We use cookies for two purposes.
First, we may use persistent cookies to authorize you and ensure that only approved Cocoon.com members may use the service.
Second, we may use session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Sites, to better understand how you interact with the Sites, and to monitor aggregate usage by Cocoon Users and web traffic routing on the Sites.
Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Sites and Service and then close your browser.
We have no third-party advertisers on our Sites today.
You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from any websites you visit.
If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Sites or all functionality of the Services.
To opt-out of certain cookies and for more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices and/or http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp .

Information Sharing and Disclosure
 Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement.
Cocoon cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law.
We may disclose information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties that we believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal processes (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Cocoon or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical or legally actionable.
We may also transfer your Personal Information to third-party service providers that assist us with carrying out the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy.
Lastly, we may disclose your Personal Information for any other purpose to which you Consent.

Business Transfers
 In the event Cocoon (or any of its affiliates) goes through a business transition, such as a merger, consolidation, restructuring, acquisition by another company, sale or assignment of rights or assets or a portion thereof, or other company change, we may transfer usersâ information, including Personal Information, and other business data in connection with that business transition (e.g., to a subsequent owner, co-owner, or operator of Cocoon, or any affiliates and trusted agents, service providers, or partners thereof), including during the course of any due diligence process.

Security
 Cocoon is very concerned with safeguarding your information.
We employ appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access.
Cocoon uses physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards, including advanced firewall and password protection for our databases to help protect the security of information.
For example, we restrict access to your information to employees that need to know that information in order to operate, develop, or improve our services.
However, as you probably know, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.
Therefore, although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.

Retention
 We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

Your Data Protection Rights

Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others.
Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy.
When we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint.
We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.

Our Policy Toward Children

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at privacy@getcocoon.com.
