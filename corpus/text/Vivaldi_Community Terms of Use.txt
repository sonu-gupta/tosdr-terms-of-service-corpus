At Vivaldi Technologies AS (âVivaldiâ), we try to keep things as simple and easy as possible, but since this is a legal document, itâs a bit longer than we would like it to be.
Itâs important that you read this carefully and understand the Terms of Use.
Vivaldi wishes to ensure that you receive information about any development or updates of the services as well as Vivaldi Browser and will therefore send you such information to the email address you registered your account with.
You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking on âunsubscribeâ link at the bottom of each email or visit https://vivaldi.com/newsletter/unsubscribe/.

Be fully responsible for all activities that occur under your account and any other action taken in connection with the account

Spam and bulk content

Your account should not be used to:


Distribute spam or unsolicited commercial content.
Post content with the sole purpose of driving traffic and increasing the search rankings of another website, product or service.
Post duplicate content (content that has been previously posted on another blog) for the purpose of backlinking.
Occasionally, duplicate content can be posted as a guest post.
Please mention that clearly in the blog.
Post content that is clipped or incomplete with the sole purpose of linking to the full article on another website.
We consider this to be backlinking.
Post content to promote bounty campaigns to inflate rankings for specific posts, accounts, businesses, or products.

Repeatedly post comments or alternative interactions under blogs to promote products.
If a post contains affiliate links, you must clearly disclose this.
For instance, with language such as: âThis post includes affiliate links.
I may receive compensation if you purchase products or services from the different links provided in this article.

It is prohibited to use Vivaldi Community services to send:

content which violates the CAN-SPAM Act or other anti-spam laws;
unauthorized content via open, third-party servers.
or to distribute the email addresses of any person without their consent

Automation of the Vivaldi Community services interface is also not allowed.
This means that you cannot send, delete or filter content in a manner that misleads or deceives users.
When a user marks some content as spam, it increases the likelihood that future content that you send will also be classified as spam by the spam filter that we use and run locally.


Malware

You will not use Vivaldi Community services to knowingly transmit or upload any material that contains viruses, trojan horses, worms, time bombs, cancelbots, or any other harmful or deleterious programs.
In addition, you will not distribute content that harms or interferes with the operation of networks, servers or other infrastructure belonging to Vivaldi or others.

Donât use Vivaldi Community services to trick, mislead or deceive other users into sharing information under false pretenses.
Donât phish for usersâ data, such as login information, passwords, financial details or identification numbers, or use Vivaldi Mail as part of a scheme to defraud others.





You agree to not do the following:

Harass other members of the community.
Upload/publish illegal content or other material that you donât have rights to publish/distribute.
Upload/publish content or material that is obscene, defamatory, vulgar, sexually oriented, hateful, harassing or threatening.

Create Vivaldi accounts by automated means, or buy Vivaldi accounts from, sell or re-sell them to, or trade them with others.

Inactive account policy
Vivaldi.netâs inactive account policy
We encourage people to actively log in and use Vivaldi.net when they register an account.
To keep your account active, be sure to log in at least every 6 months.
Accounts and their contents may be permanently removed due to prolonged inactivity.
How does Vivaldi.net determine inactivity?
Inactivity is based on a combination of participating in community activities (in forum.vivaldi.net or in vivaldi.net blogs), logging in, syncing browser data or using vivaldi.net email service.
Therefore, unconfirmed or mass-produced accounts without virtual practice in any of these community activities are also subject to permanent removal at any time.
Please note that you may not be able to tell whether an account is currently inactive, as not all signs of account activity are publicly visible.
 
Child safety
Vivaldi has a zero-tolerance policy against child sexual abuse imagery.
If we become aware of such content, we will report it to the Norwegian Police Department, as required by law.
We may also take disciplinary action, including termination, against the Vivaldi Mail accounts of those involved.

You will respect copyright laws in your use of Vivaldi Community services and will not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, including patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary rights.
You are also not allowed to encourage or induce others to violate intellectual property rights.
