This helps us understand how well the site is performing and whether it needs sprucing up.
But we go an extra step: we cloak your identity by anonymizing the data.
That way, we only learn the fact that someone visited the site, not who it was.
Google explains their Privacy Policy &amp.
Terms in detail, but you can simply opt out of Google Analytics altogether if you wish.
If you write to us, we'll keep your email address on file to communicate with you.
We wonât share it with third parties unless theyâve been hired to help complete our services to you.
If you have additional questions, no problem.
Just write or call us and weâll be happy to answer!
