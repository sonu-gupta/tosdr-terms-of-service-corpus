You must disclose to insurers via us, before the terms of the insurance contract are finalised with insurers, all information which is known to you (or which ought to be known to you based on reasonable enquiries) in the ordinary course of your business and which is material to the risk.
Such disclosure must also be reasonable clear and accessible and you must respond fully to any requests for information made by insurers.
Information is material if it would influence the judgment of a prudent insurer (not necessarily the insurer in question) in establishing the premium or determining whether to underwrite the risk.
If there is any doubt as to whether the information is material, it must be disclosed to insurers.Policy DocumentationWe will endeavour ensure your policy documents are issued promptly.
You should read all insurance policy documents sent to you.

We do not guarantee the solvency of any insurer we place business with.
We do not monitor insurer solvency on an ongoing basis, and shall not be liable for losses suffered by you in the event of the insolvency of an insurer.
