This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including any third party websites, services and applications (âThird Party Servicesâ) that you elect to access through the Services or to individuals that we do not manage or employ.
While we attempt to facilitate access only to those Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services.
We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access.
 What Information Do We Collect?  The information we gather enables us to provide and improve the Services, and to create new Services.
In connection with certain aspects of the Services, we may request, collect and/or display some of your information.
We collect the following types of information from our users.

 Some features of the Services allow you to provide content to the Services, such as images of written homework questions and queries submitted to the Services.
All content submitted by you to the Services may be retained by us indefinitely unless you request that we delete it.

This information is not made public.
However, we do at times share this information, including your Personal Information, with our partners, affiliates, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct business to process this information on our behalf and at our instruction, and as otherwise specified below in this Privacy Policy.

 Generally, the Services automatically collect usage information, such as the number and frequency of visitors to the Services as well as location (at the city and state level).
We may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure.


Information Collected Using Cookies:

 Cookies are pieces of text that may be provided to your computer through your web browser when you access a website.
Your browser stores cookies in a manner associated with each website you visit.
We use cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you visit the Services and otherwise use the Services through the Internet.

 Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are.
As noted, however, we do use cookies to identify that your web browser has accessed aspects of the Services and may associate that information with your Account if you have one.

 Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways.
We strongly recommend that you leave cookies active, because they enable you to take advantage of the most attractive features of the Services.

 This Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties.
We do not control when or how third parties place cookies on your computer.
For example, third party websites to which a link points may set cookies on your computer.


Legacy Socratic Website:

 Our Website previously permitted the creation of user accounts tied to a userâs email address and the public exchange of content among users on the Website.
For example, a user could post a homework question and other users would provide an answer.
While the Website no longer has logged in functionality, if you previously used the Services through a username, we may continue to display your public-facing user profile and posts on the Website unless you ask us to delete it.
We also store the email address you provided for your account for purposes of responding to any questions or concerns you might have regarding the activity under your username.
Additionally, you may occasionally receive email and other communications from us for purposes important to the Services.
We will not directly reveal user email addresses to other users.
