If you do not want to be bound by our Terms your only option is not to visit, view or otherwise use the services of Ballotpedia.
You understand, agree and acknowledge that these Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you and Ballotpedia and that your use of Ballotpedia shall indicate your conclusive acceptance of this agreement.

Any of the trademarks, service marks, collective marks, design rights or similar rights that are mentioned, used or cited in the articles of the Ballotpedia encyclopedia are the property of their respective owners.
Their use here does not imply that you may use them for any other purpose other than for the same or a similar informational use as contemplated by the original authors of these Ballotpedia articles under the GFDL licensing scheme.
Unless otherwise stated Ballotpedia and Lucy Burns Institute sites are neither endorsed by nor affiliated with any of the holders of any such rights and as such Ballotpedia cannot grant any rights to use any otherwise protected materials.

If the court of law having jurisdiction, rules that any provision of the agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the Terms and the remaining Terms will continue to be valid.

and cannot be responsible for any violations of such laws, should you link to this domain or use, reproduce, or republish the information contained herein.

9.
Legal statements
There is absolutely no assurance that any statement contained in an article touching on legal matters is true, correct or precise.
Law varies from place to place and it evolves over time â sometimes quickly.
Even if a statement made about the law is accurate, it may only be accurate in the jurisdiction of the person posting the information.
as well, the law may have changed, been modified or overturned by subsequent development since the entry was made on Ballotpedia.

The legal information provided on Ballotpedia is, at best, of a general nature and cannot substitute for the advice of a licensed professional, i.e., by a competent authority with specialised knowledge who can apply it to the particular circumstances of your case.
Please contact a local bar association, law society or similar association of jurists in your legal jurisdiction to obtain a referral to a competent legal professional if you do not have other means of contacting an attorney-at-law, lawyer, civil law notary, barrister or solicitor.
Neither the individual contributors, system operators, developers, or sponsors of Ballotpedia nor anyone else connected to Ballotpedia can take any responsibility for the results or consequences of any attempt to use or adopt any of the information or disinformation presented on this web site.

Nothing on Ballotpedia or any project of Lucy Burns Institute should be construed as an attempt to offer or render a legal opinion or otherwise engage in the practice of law.

10.
Reader Emails, Phone Numbers, and Addresses
Ballotpedia encourages you to sign up to receive its email updates and text message alerts.
When you submit your email addresses, phone numbers, and addresses, that data will only be used by Ballotpedia.
Ballotpedia will not sell your information.
If you no longer want to receive communications from Ballotpedia or would like your information removed from the system, such requests will be honored within one business day.

11.
Entire Agreement
You understand and agree that the above Terms constitute the entire general agreement between you and Ballotpedia.
You may be subject to additional Terms and conditions when you use, purchase or access other services, affiliate services or third-party content or material.

12.
Changes to the Terms
Ballotpedia reserves the right to modify these Terms from time to time at our sole discretion and without any notice.
Changes to our Terms become effective on the date they are posted and your continued use of Ballotpedia after any changes to Terms will signify your agreement to be bound by them.
