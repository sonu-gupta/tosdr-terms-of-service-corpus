About us
This website and/or mobile app is operated by Entertainment One UK Limited, a company registered in England and Wales, with company number 02989602, and whose registered office is at 45 Warren Street, London, W1T 6AG, UK (eOne, we, us).
We are committed to protecting your privacy.
This privacy policy (Privacy Policy) tells you how we collect, store, process and use your/your childrenâs personal information when you use this website and/or mobile app (the Services).
It also provides you with details about your rights in relation to your/your childrenâs personal information.
You should read this Privacy Policy in conjunction with our Terms of Use
Our legal status is that of a âdata controllerâ and in this capacity we will securely store and process your/your childrenâs personal information which you/your children have provided to us or which we otherwise collect.
Data controller is a legal term used in EU legislation to signify the person who controls what to do with any given personal information.
We are registered as a data controller with the Information Commissionerâs Office (registration number Z9919769).
Children
The Services are designed partly for children.
Therefore we are aware that we must be extra cautious when processing personal information.
Most of our Services contain a childrenâs section (the âChildrenâs Areaâ) and a separate parentsâ (or guardiansâ) section (the âGrown-Up Areaâ).
In the Childrenâs Area, children mainly participate only by playing games, reading e-books and/or watching videos.
We generally do not offer any place in the Childrenâs Area where a child can sign up or enter personal information themselves.
Typically, the only part of the Services where anyone can enter personal information directly is the Grown-Up Area.
Accordingly, in most cases, we do not anticipate that we will be collecting personal information directly from any children.
We anticipate and assume that we will be collecting personal information only from parents or guardians.
If you are under the age of 13, you may only use the Services and provide personal information if you have the consent of, and are supervised by, a parent or guardian.
If we believe a child using the Services is under 13 we will not process any personal information of that child without the consent of the parent or guardian.
If the user is 13 or over we will only collect and process personal information as the long as we believe the user understands what is involved.

In almost every case the legal basis will be one of the following:
â¢ Consent: For example, where you have provided your consent to receive certain marketing from us.
You can withdraw your consent at any time, including by clicking on the âunsubscribeâ link at the bottom of any marketing email we send you.
â¢ Our legitimate business interests: Where it is necessary for us to understand our customers, promote our services and operate effectively as a provider of childrenâs content and related services, provided in each case that this is done in a legitimate way which does not unduly affect your or your childâs privacy and other rights.
â¢ Compliance with law: Where we are subject to a legal obligation and need to use your personal information in order to comply with that obligation.
Where we store your personal information
The personal information that we collect may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (the âEEAâ), including countries, which have less strict, or no data protection laws, when compared to those in Europe.
Whenever we transfer your/your childâs personal information as described in the paragraph above, we will take steps which are reasonably necessary to ensure that adequate safeguards are in place to protect such personal information and to make sure it is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.
In these cases, we rely on approved data transfer mechanisms (such as the EU âStandard Contractual Clausesâ and the EU-US âPrivacy Shieldâ) to ensure your information is subject to adequate safeguards in the recipient country.

If a third party acquires all (or substantially all) of our business and/or assets, we may disclose your/your childrenâs personal information to that third party in connection with the acquisition.
We may also disclose your/your childrenâs personal information where we are required to do so by applicable law, by a governmental body or by a law enforcement agency.â¨â¨We may also disclose personal information to protect the rights, property or safety of us or our users, or others, and in order to enforce or apply our terms and conditions (this includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction) or where we are required to do so by applicable law, by a governmental body or by a law enforcement agency.
