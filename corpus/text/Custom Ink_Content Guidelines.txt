 Statement of Principles:
Custom Ink believes in the power of custom apparel and accessories to bring groups and communities together, and we want to help our customers create products with designs that are meaningful and unifying.
Our customers have diverse viewpoints and perspectives, which are reflected in the designs they create, and we believe that we all must be tolerant of those with different views.
In rare cases, however, a design proposed by a customer may be offensive or threatening to others who see the design.
In such cases, we use the following guidelines to balance our customersâ design goals with the standards and expectations of the Custom Ink community and the public.
When a design does not meet our Content Guidelines, we will make every effort to work with the customer to try to create an alternate design that complies with the guidelines below. Content Guidelines:
Custom Ink's Content Guidelines provide guidance for customers in designing custom products.
Our Content Guidelines use a sliding scale from ânoâ to âgoâ to account for the range of potential designs, so we can work with customers to create a design that meets these standards.
The descriptions under each category are not meant to be exhaustive, and the ultimate decision on whether or not to approve a design will always rest with Custom Ink's Content Guidelines team.
Custom Ink regularly reviews these policies and updates them as appropriate. NO â Custom Ink will not print designs that:
