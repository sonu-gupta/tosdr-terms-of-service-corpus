Updated April 1, 2018 Global Data Protection Policy of Jehovahâs Witnesses The worldwide religious organization of Jehovahâs Witnesses (âreligious organizationâ) respects individualsâ rights of privacy and of protection of personal data.
The religious organization recognizes the necessity of open and frank communication and of the collection of personal and sensitive personal data in order to administer to the needs of individual Jehovahâs Witnesses and to accomplish its religious and charitable activity, as well as the corresponding necessity to maintain confidentiality and ensure that information is adequately protected.
