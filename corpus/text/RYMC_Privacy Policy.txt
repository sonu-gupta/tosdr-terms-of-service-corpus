I don't allow comments or uploads of any kind, and your information isn't tracked in any way beyond standard server logs (IP address at best, which is cleared often).
I am not a lawyer and you should confirm for yourself if you find yourself concerned over this.
Cookies
Some parts of the world care about this, so here it is: no cookies are recorded on this page by me.
I have no need for cookies for any functionality on this site that's been built by me, so you're good to go there.
Terms and Copyright
Unless otherwise noted, all the content on here is copyright me, Ryan McGrath.
I post my personal work and writings here, so this is hopefully straightforward.
If you find that I've violated your copyright or trademark in any way, I encourage you to email me using the address at the top of this page, whereupon I'll do my best to resolve the matter quickly.
