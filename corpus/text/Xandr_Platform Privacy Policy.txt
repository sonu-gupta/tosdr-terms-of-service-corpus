Introduction to the Xandr Platform


Xandr provides a digital advertising technology Platform and related services that connect buyers of advertising inventory (âadvertisersâ) with sellers of advertising inventory (âpublishersâ).
In this Privacy Policy, we refer to our buyers and sellers collectively as âclientsâ.
Websites, mobile apps and publishers of other internet-connected digital media properties such as internet-connected TVs (each a âDigital Propertyâ and collectively âDigital Propertiesâ) use the Platform to sell ad space on those properties.
Advertisers or companies on the advertiserâs behalf, use the Platform to purchase that ad space in the most efficient way possible.
The Platform also allows Digital Properties and advertisers to do other things, like measure the effectiveness of their ads, help prevent malware or other bad activity, and similar functions designed to make the buying and selling of ad space seamless, efficient, and effective.
Our clients collect and use data on the Platform in different ways.
They may bring their own data to the Platform, collect data via the Platform, or remove their data from the Platform.
Our references to our Platform in this policy only refer to Xandrâs own Platform and systems and do not include the technology or systems of clients or partners that use or integrate with us.
They are bound by our policies when they use our Platform.

Cookies and other online tracking technology. When you first visit a Digital Property and where allowed by your browser, we assign a random unique identifier (an âAppNexus IDâ, or âXandr IDâ) to your browser or device, which allows the Platform to automatically recognize your browser or device the next time it visits another Digital Property that has integrated our technology.&nbsp.
This allows our clients and partners to sync their own unique identifiers against this ID so that they can use their own data on the Platform that they may have associated with you (collectively âDigital Identifiersâ).
The Platform uses cookies, beacons, pixels, tags, mobile SDKs, and similar technologies to collect this information.

Opt Out of Interest-Based Advertising



Web Browsers


You can visit privacycenter.xandr.com to opt out of having the Platform used to select ads for your browser based on your online web browsing behavior.
When you opt out, an opt out cookie (from adnxs.com) will be stored in your web browser.
The Platform will know the choice you have made when it sees your opt out cookie, and will apply your choice to all companies using the Platform.
If you block or delete the opt out cookie, your browser will not be opted out and will need to allow cookies from Xandr and renew your opt out choice.
To review your opt in status or learn more about interest-based advertising, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative opt out page, the DAAâs WebChoice tool or the DAACâs WebChoices tool.
Important things to note about the web browser opt out:



Blocked cookies
: The opt out cookie may not work if your browser is configured to block third-party cookies.


Deleting or protecting opt outs
: If you delete your cookies, you will need to opt out again.
There are browser plugins to help you preserve your opt out cookies.
For more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/PMC.


Only this browser
: The opt out only applies to the browser profile in which you set it.
For example, if you set the opt out while using Firefox, but then use Chrome, the opt out will not be active in Chrome.
To opt out in Chrome, you will need to repeat the opt out process.
This is because the cookies cannot be read between different browsers or browser profiles.


The opt out does not block or delete cookies
: It also does not prevent the use of cookies or other technologies for purposes other than selecting ads based on your interests as inferred by your online behavior.
If you opt out, data may still be collected about your web browsing activities and you will still see advertising.
Ads may be selected, for example, based on the content of the web page in which they are shown.
If you wish to block or delete cookies altogether, you can use web browser settings to do so.



Mobile Apps


Mobile device system software such as Apple iOS or Google Play Services provide mechanisms that allow users to opt out of the use of information about their usage of mobile apps to deliver targeted ads to their mobile device.
For more information, or to opt out using these mechanisms, consult your device settings (âOpt out of Personalized Adsâ on Android devices and âLimit Ad Trackingâ on iOS devices).
When Xandrâs technology encounters âLimit Ad Trackingâ signals they are respected.
Devices vary in where they include the setting to adjust, you can use the Network Advertising Initiativeâs mobile optout guide here.


Location Data


Most mobile devices offer you the ability to stop the collection of location information at any time by changing the preferences on your device.&nbsp.
You may also be able to stop the collection of location information by particular apps by adjusting the settings for individual apps or following the standard uninstall process to remove specific mobile apps from your device.&nbsp.
Note when location services have not been enabled in any of your apps, we may still infer data about your location based on your IP address.


Televisions


Your internet connected device (e.g.
a smart TV or a set- top box) may give you the ability to opt-out of the use of information for advertising purposes.&nbsp.
To determine if your Internet connected device has these options, please visit your deviceâs settings menu.
Xandr reads and applies industry opt out signals for connected televisions.

Access, Correction, and Deletion Rights

If you reside in certain jurisdictions, you may have the right to access the data about your devices, request the correction of inaccuracies you find in such data, and request the deletion of such data.
Note that because we do not collect information that directly identifies an individual (and prohibit clients from storing this information) on the Platform, it is generally not feasible for us to verify individualsâ identities to provide or correct data that is tied to their identities, so we are unable to process access, correction, and deletion requests for most consumers.
However, you may be able to exercise these rights for data held by our affiliates.
If you are interested in exercising any of these rights, please click here.
Note that you can delete your cookies at any time by using your browser settings.
You can also reset the advertising identifier in your mobile device at any time by using your platform setting referenced in Mobile Apps above.


We Donât Mind If You Exercise Your Data Rights


We are committed to providing you the controls over your personal data afforded to you by applicable data protection laws.
If you exercise any of these rights explained in our Privacy Policy, we will not disadvantage you.
You will not be denied or charged different prices or rates for goods or services or provided a different level or quality of goods or services.


Consumers Under 16 Years Old


As of the effective date of this policy, we do not have actual knowledge that we sell  or use personal data of consumers under 16 years of age for targeted or cross-contextual behavioral advertising (âsharingâ).
If we collect personal data that we know is from a child under 16 years old in the future, we will not âsellâ or âshareâ that information unless we receive affirmative permission, in compliance with applicable data protection laws, to do so.

We may ask for your permission to resume âsaleâ or sharingâ of your California PI at a later date, but we will wait at least 12 months before doing so.

Your Right to Opt-out of our Processing of your Sensitive California PI

You may also instruct us not to process your sensitive California PI by clicking here.
Once we receive your request, which is connected to our âsaleâ and âsharingâ opt-out process, we will not use your sensitive California PI except as requested by you or as otherwise permitted by California law, such as to review and respond to a data access, correction, or deletion request, to deliver non-personalized advertising, or to help ensure the security and integrity of our advertising platform.

Do Not Track Signals

Our advertising platform will honor the Global Privacy Control browser signal (GPC) for California consumers where the usersâ web browsers support this signal.
In particular, when a California consumer uses GPC to indicate that they do not want their California PI âsoldâ, âsharedâ, and/or tracked, Xandr will not process on our platform any California PI sourced from that consumerâs web browser for any âsaleâ or âsharingâ purposes, so long as the GPC opt-out signal remains present and readable by Xandr.
Xandr does not currently honor any other âdo not trackâ browser-based signals.

Authorized Agents

You may designate an authorized agent to submit requests on your behalf.
Your agent will need a valid power of attorney or written permission signed by you.

Virginia Consumer Privacy Rights


 In addition to the other rights discussed in this policy, if you are a Virginia consumer, as defined by the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (âVCDPAâ), you have the right to: (i) request access to your personal data (as defined by the VCDPA) and request additional details about our information practices, (ii) request deletion of your personal data, (iii) opt-out of the âsaleâ and âsharingâ of your personal data, and (iv) to not be discriminated against for exercising any of your rights under the VCDPA.&nbsp.
Your options regarding the personal data we collect or receive about you are described below.
For more information regarding the personal data we collect, use, and share, please review the preceding sections of this policy.

Your Right To Access, Correct, and Delete, Information Collected And Shared 

Subject to certain exceptions, Virginia consumers have the right to request from Xandr:

The specific pieces of personal data that weâve collected about you;
The correction of inaccuracies you find in the personal data that weâve collected.
and
The deletion of the personal data weâve collected about you.

To exercise your right to request the disclosure, correction, or deletion of your personal data that we collect, click here.
These requests for disclosure are generally free.&nbsp.
However, it is important to note that, because we do not collect information that directly identifies an individual (and prohibit clients from storing this information) on the Platform, it is generally not feasible for us to verify individualsâ identities to provide or correct data that is tied to their identities, so we are unable to process access, correction, and deletion requests for most consumers.&nbsp.
Further, we may retain your personal data even after receipt of a verified deletion request in situations when that information is necessary for us to: provide you with a good or service that you requested.
perform a contract we entered into with you.
maintain the functionality or security of our systems.
comply with or exercise rights provided by the law.
or use the information internally in ways that are compatible with the context in which you provided the information to us, or that are reasonably aligned with your expectations based on your relationship with us.

Your Right to Ask Us Not to Sell Your Personal Data or Serve You Targeted Ads

As noted earlier in this policy, Xandr uses your personal data to facilitate the delivery of targeted advertising, as defined by the VCDPA, to you.
You can always opt-out of the serving of targeted advertising by Xandr and also tell us not to âsellâ your personal data by clicking here.
Once we receive your request, we will not âsellâ your personal data or use your personal data for targeted advertising, unless you later allow us to do so.

Sensitive Personal Data Processing

The VCDPA requires data controllers to obtain Virginia consumersâ consent prior to processing their sensitive personal data (as defined by the VCDPA).
Because our Platform facilitates the delivery of advertising on third party websites and apps and we do not interact directly with you, we will not process your sensitive personal data where Xandr is considered is an independent controller of such data.
Rather, we will only process your sensitive personal data where our clients or data providers (as applicable) have first obtained such consent from you.

Other Important Information Regarding Your Rights Under the VCDPA

Residents of Virginia have the right to opt-out of profiling done in furtherance of decisions that produce âlegal or similarly significant effectsâ, as defined by the VCDPA.
As Xandr does not conduct this type of profiling, we do not offer profiling opt-outs to Virginia residents.
If you would like to make sales, targeted advertising, sensitive personal data use, and profiling elections (as applicable) with our clients and data providers, you must make your request directly to those Xandr clients and data providers, based on information and procedures that they supply.


Information for Residents of European Countries


If you are located in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland (the âEuropean Countriesâ), you have certain rights and protections under applicable law regarding the processing of your âpersonal dataâ as defined under applicable law.
Some of the Platform Data that Xandr maintains in its Platform may constitute âpersonal dataâ under these laws.

Role of Xandr as a Controller or Processor

If you are located in one of the European Countries, Xandr may act a âcontrollerâ as defined under applicable law when processing your personal data.
Xandr may also act as a âprocessorâ as defined under applicable law to the extent that it processes your personal data on behalf of and at the instruction of another party, for example a Xandr client.

Legal Basis for Processing

Xandrâs legal basis for processing your personal data depends upon the specific context in which we collect or use it.
We normally rely on our legitimate interests to collect and use personal data, except where our interests are overridden by your data-protection interests or your fundamental rights and freedoms.
Our legitimate interests are described in greater detail in the âHow We Use the Information We Collectâ section of this policy.
These legitimate interests include the operation of our Platform and business and the provision of our online advertising technology services to our clients as required by our agreements with them.
In some cases, we may rely on your consent which is obtained for us by the operator of the Digital Properties that use our technology or use technology that interacts with our Platform.
Where we rely on consent to process your personal data, we will obtain such consent in compliance with applicable laws.
Where you have given your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.
Additionally, we may have a legal obligation to process personal data.

Your Rights

If you are located in one of the European Countries, you may be entitled to exercise certain data-subject rights available under applicable laws.
These rights may include the right to request access to personal data we hold about you.
You may also have the right to object to, or request that we restrict, processing of your personal data.
You may also have the right to ask that your personal data be corrected, erased, or transferred to another party.
If you would like to exercise any of these rights, you may do so as explained in the Your Choices and Rights section above.

Data Transfers

When Xandr transfers your personal data to group companies or third-party service providers outside of the European Countries, we ensure that appropriate protections are in place under European data protection legislation (which includes Model Clauses).&nbsp.
For example, in order to ensure that your personal data is adequately protected when transferred outside of the European Countries, Xandr has entered into inter-company âmodel clauseâ agreements and other adequacy arrangements with other various entities located outside the European Countries with whom we share your information.
A copy of such agreements is available on request.

IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework

If you are located in one of the European Countries and visiting a Digital Property, we are registered as a vendor with, support and encourage our clients to use the IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework (the âIndustry Frameworkâ) to provide you with dynamic transparency into and choice about the various third parties our clients use to serve you ads, including ourselves.
When you visit a Digital Property, the Industry Framework is designed to allow a Digital Property the means to choose which vendors they wish to allow to access your device and process your personal data and provide dynamic transparency and choice to you about each of these vendors (either an opportunity for you to consent to the vendor or opt-out of data processing by the vendor depending on that vendorâs legal basis and processing activities).

Questions or Complaints

If you are in one of the European Countries and have a question or concern about how we process personal data you can contact our Data Protection Officer here.
If we are not able to resolve your issue, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the data privacy authority where you reside.
