Contact Login Get started  Terms and Conditions 
 The Terms and Conditions The following are the Terms and Conditions (the "Agreement") which govern your access and use of our online platform through which counseling may be provided (collectively the "Platform").
This website is owned and operated by Compile, Inc.
d.b.a.
BetterHelp.
The Platform may be provided or be accessible via multiple websites or applications whether owned and/or operated by us or by third parties, including, without limitation, the website betterhelp.com and its related apps.
By accessing or using the Platform, you are entering into this Agreement.
You should read this Agreement carefully before starting to use the Platform.
If you do not agree to be bound to any term of this Agreement, you must not access the Platform.
When the terms "we", "us", "our" or similar are used in this Agreement, they refer to any company that owns and operates the Platform (the "Company").

 The Counselors and Counselor Services The Platform may be used to connect you with a Counselor who will provide services to you through the Platform (âCounselor Servicesâ).
We require every Counselor providing Counselor Services on the Platform to be an accredited, trained, and experienced licensed psychologist (PhD / PsyD), licensed marriage and family therapist (LMFT), licensed clinical social worker (LCSW), licensed professional counselor (LPC), or similar applicable recognized professional certification based on their state and/or jurisdiction.
Counselors must have a relevant academic degree in their field, at least 3 years of experience, at least 1,000 hours of hands-on experience, and have to be qualified and certified by their respective professional board after successfully completing the necessary education, exams, training and practice requirements as applicable.
The Counselors are independent providers who are neither our employees nor agents nor representatives.
The Platformâs role is limited to enabling the Counselor Services while the Counselor Services themselves are the responsibility of the Counselor who provides them.
If you feel the Counselor Services provided by the Counselor do not fit your needs or expectations, you may change to a different Counselor who provides services through the Platform.
While we hope the Counselor Services are beneficial to you, you understand, agree and acknowledge that they may not be the appropriate solution for everyoneâs needs and that they may not be appropriate for every particular situation and/or may not be a complete substitute for a face-to-face examination and/or care in every particular situation.
IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT SUICIDE OR IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING HARMING YOURSELF OR OTHERS OR IF YOU FEEL THAT ANY OTHER PERSON MAY BE IN ANY DANGER OR IF YOU HAVE ANY MEDICAL EMERGENCY, YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY CALL THE EMERGENCY SERVICE NUMBER (911 IN THE US) AND NOTIFY THE RELEVANT AUTHORITIES.
