NixNet DNSIn short:


Haproxy TCP/HTTP logs are disabled.
No IP addresses are collected.
Unbound debug logs are enabled (verbosity: 1).
Query amounts coming specifically from the DNS-over-TLS server arenât counted.
Website/DNS-over-HTTPS gatewayâs NGINX logs are disabled.

To elaborate on Unboundâs verbosity, if you have it installed, you can run man unbound.conf, search verbosity and read it yourself.
More human-readably .

Level 0 only outputs errors
Level 1 gives high-level operational information (debug logs)
Level 2 gives detailed debug logs
Level 3 shows the admin what queries are going through Unbound
Level 4 gives lower-level algorithm information
Level 5 logs client information

Thereâs no warranty, no uptime assurance, etc.
so I recommend using multiple resolvers.
that also improves privacy because the DNS queries are spread across multiple providers.

You can see Unbound's configuration file on Gitea.
That's what I'm using in production.
