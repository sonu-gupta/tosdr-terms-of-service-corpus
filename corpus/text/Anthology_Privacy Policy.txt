Who will have access to your personal dataThis section is to explain who, within Anthology Inc., will have access to your data.
Your Personal Data will only be seen or used by our employees or contractors who have a legitimate business need to access your Personal Data for the purposes set out in this privacy policy.
We take your privacy seriously and have implemented appropriate physical, technical and organizational security measures designed to secure your Personal Data against accidental loss, destruction or damage and unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure.

Who else might we share your personal data withThis section will inform you of who we share your Personal Data with and why.
Except as explained in this privacy policy, we will not share your Personal Data without your consent unless required to do so by law.
We may share your Personal Data with any member of our group which means our subsidiaries and our ultimate holding company.
This is to ensure efficiency and so we can provide the best service we can to you.

They have access to Personal Data needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.

We may also pass Aggregated Anonymous Data on the usage of our site (e.g., we might disclose the median ages of visitors to our site, or the numbers of visitors to our site that come from different geographic areas) to third parties, but this will not include information that can be used to identify you personally.
If a business transfer or change of business ownership takes place or is envisaged, we may transfer your Personal Data to the new owner (or a prospective new owner).
If this happens, you will be informed of this transfer following the completion of such transfer or change of business ownership.

How do we protect your personal data?This section explains how we keep your Personal Data safe and where it will be held.
We take your privacy seriously and are committed to maintaining the privacy and security of the Personal Data you provide to us, and the choices you have regarding our collection and use of your Personal Data.
We follow strict security procedures as to how your Personal Data is stored and used, and who sees it, to help stop any unauthorized person getting hold of it.
Once we have received your Personal Data, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.
Anthology NY and Anthology MO have taken actions to make transactions secure for members on our sites and transaction pages.
Login, electronic commerce, and administrative activity are transmitted over an industry standard Secure Socket Layer (âSSLâ).
For Anthology MO products only, all commerce transactions encrypt your Personal Data including name, address, and credit card number to prevent unauthorized access as the information travels over the internet.
Anthology MO Customers can elect to have site activity data transmitted securely by adding full site SSL certification as an additional service.
For Anthology MO products and services which require commerce transactions.
Anthology MO takes the responsibility of your cardholder data seriously and maintains compliance with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS) by meeting all security requirements to help ensure commerce-based transaction data is protected.
Anthology MO is certified compliant as a Level One Service Provider by a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA), authorized by the PCI Security Standards Council.
Our processes, procedures, network configuration, and overall environment conform to all of the security guidelines as defined in the PCI DSS standard and are annually verified by an external auditor.
This Level One compliance, the highest level of PCI DSS compliance, helps ensure your e-commerce transaction data is securely protected, transmitted, and stored by Anthology MO.
As part of our policy, datacenters hosting the site must maintain their own annual SSAE 16 audit.
Upon a Customerâs request, Anthology MO will provide the current attestation of compliance for PCI DSS as well as a certified SSAE 16, or equivalent review.
The attestation and certified SSAE 16 are completed by an external audit firm, on behalf of the datacenter used for our services.
Strong passwords are required for each login, and they are stored in a format that cannot be read by administrators or employees.
Multiple failed logins or lost login requests are challenged by reCaptcha.
An administrative rights system restricts authenticated but unauthorized access to Customer Data and Personal Data.
Certain Anthology NY products use Federated Authentication.
If applicable, the product will connect to Customersâ authentication systems in order to identify and credential users.
This means that the Customer logs in using their campus username and password.
The centerpiece of each method is a secure transmission of a unique identifier for a user upon a successful granting of credentials.
Some of the supported protocols also allow for the passing of additional attributes from a directory or other campus system.
Certain Anthology NY products make it easier to work with Google APIs, specifically, Google Drive.
If applicable and provided by the Customer, you can connect to Google Drive in order to copy over individual files for use within their coursework.
Anthology NY does not access data within Google Drive except when explicitly directed by the Customer on the individualâs behalf.
Any files that are copied from Google Drive within the Anthology NY platform remains hosted until deleted by an authorized party, or until the Customer terminates this service.
Unfortunately, the transmission of your Personal Data via the internet is not completely secure and although we do our best to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to us over the internet and you acknowledge that any transmission is at your own risk.

How long do we keep your personal data?This section explains the length of time that we will retain your Personal Data.
We will keep your Personal Data for no longer than necessary, for the purposes we have set out above.
We will retain your information for as long as needed in order to provide the relevant goods or services to you or perform any contract we have with you and for a limited period afterwards in order to deal with any queries or complaints.
Any third parties that we engage will keep your data stored on their systems for as long as is necessary to provide the relevant services to you or us.
If we end our relationship with any third party providers, we will make sure that they securely delete or return your Personal Data to us.
We may retain Personal Data about you for statistical purposes (for example, to help us better advertise our services).
Where data is retained for statistical purposes it will always be anonymized, meaning that you will not be identifiable from that data.

California Residents: Your RightsThis section only applies to you if you are a California resident and we process your Personal Data.
If that is the case, you have certain additional rights in relation to your Personal Data under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), Cal.
Civ.
Code Â§ 1798.100 et seq.
If the CCPA applies to you, you have the right to request that we:

disclose or provide copies to you, no more than twice in a 12-month period, the Personal Data about you that we have collected, used, or disclosed during the preceding 12 months.
or
delete the Personal Data we hold about you, but please note:
if we are providing services to you and you ask us to delete Personal Data we hold about you then we may be unable to continue providing those services to you;
we may not be required to delete your Personal Data if it is necessary to:
complete any transaction for which it was provided;
detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity.
or prosecute those responsible for that activity;
exercise any right provided to us by law;
comply with a legal obligation.
or
otherwise use your Personal Data internally in a lawful manner compatible with the context in which you provided it.





To exercise your rights under the CCPA, if applicable, please contact us at the address, email address or phone number listed in Section 13 of this Policy.
If you make a request pursuant to your rights under the CCPA, we will attempt to verify your identity by asking you to confirm information we already have on file for you, such as an email address, phone number, account identifier, or password.
If you choose to exercise your rights under the CCPA, you have the right not to be treated differently from any other individual whose Personal Data we process.
As discussed above, we do not sell your Personal Data, so we do not offer an opt-out to the sale of Personal Data.

EEA Residents: Your RightsThis section only applies to you if we process your data while you are in the EEA.
It explains that you have a number of rights in relation to your Personal Data under the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (âGDPRâ).
However, the additional rights only apply when we process your Personal Data while you reside within the EEA.
CMC UK is registered as a data controller with the Information Commissioner's Office and our registration number is ZA294962.
There are circumstances in which your rights may not apply.
For example, if we process your Personal Data while you are present in the United States, we may not have to comply with EU regulations and so your rights may not apply.
Essentially, the additional rights will only be active once you return to reside within the EEA and we continue to process your Personal Data.
If the additional rights do apply, you have the right to request that we:

provide you with a copy of the information we hold about you;
update any of your Personal Data if it is inaccurate or out of date;
delete the Personal Data we hold about you - if we are providing services to you and you ask us to delete Personal Data we hold about you then we may be unable to continue providing those services to you;
restrict the way in which we process your Personal Data;
stop processing your data if you have valid objections to such processing.
and
transfer your Personal Data to a third party.

For more information on your rights and how to use them, or if you would like to make any of the requests set out above, please contact us using the details provided in this section.
We will respond to all such requests within the time period required by law.
As explained in the section on Marketing Communications above, even if you consented to the processing of your Personal Data for marketing purposes (by checking the relevant box or by requesting information about services), you have the right to ask us to stop processing your Personal Data for such purposes.
You can exercise this right at any time by contacting us at dpo@anthology.com.
In providing services to you, you understand that we may transfer your information to different locations around the world.
For example, information that is collected within the European Economic Area (EEA) may be transferred to destinations outside of the EEA for the purposes described in this policy.

For users resident in the EEA, where your Personal Data is transferred from the EEA to a recipient outside the EEA in a country not recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of protection for Personal Data, such transfer shall be covered by a framework recognized by the relevant authorities or courts as providing an adequate level of protection for Personal Data, including, but not limited to, Standard Contractual Clauses (the agreement in the form annexed to the European Commission's decision of February 5, 2010 on Standard Contractual Clauses for the transfer of Personal Data to processors established in third countries which can be found here).
If you are unsatisfied with our response to any data protection issues you raise with us or our DPO, you have the right to make a complaint to your national data protection authority.
For UK residents, after 31 December 2020, GDPR will no longer directly apply to you.
The UK will adopt the principles of GDPR into its national law (âUK GDPRâ).
Under UK GDPR, you have materially the same rights as data subject in the EEA whilst you reside in the UK.
Where your Personal Data is transferred from the UK to a recipient outside the UK in a country not recognized by the ICO as providing an adequate level of protection for Personal Data, such transfer shall be covered by a framework recognized by the ICO or courts as providing an adequate level of protection for Personal Data, including, but not limited to, Standard Contractual Clauses described above.
