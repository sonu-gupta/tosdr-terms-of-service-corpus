Flash Cookies We may, in certain situations, use Adobe Flash Player to deliver special content, such as video clips or animation.

Flash cookies are stored on your device, but they are managed through an interface different from the one provided by your web browser.

Please be aware that if you disable or reject Flash cookies for the Twitch Service, you may not be able to access certain features, such as video content or services that require you to sign in.

In some circumstances, we may work with third parties to provide services on the Twitch Service.
For example, developers of Extensions that are used by broadcasters on their Twitch channels may set cookies to operate those Extensions and remember your user settings and preferences, e.g., format, position, etc., of the Extension.
In addition, third-party advertisers and other organizations may use their own cookies to collect information about your activities on the Twitch Services websites and/or the advertisements you have clicked on.
This information may be used by them to serve advertisements that they believe are most likely to be of interest to you based on content you have viewed.
Third-party advertisers may also use this information to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements.
We do not control these cookies.
To disable or reject third-party cookies, please refer to the relevant third partyâs website.
For Extensions in particular, we encourage you to visit an Extensionâs detail pages to review any privacy policy posted by the relevant developer, which may include additional information on their cookie practices.
