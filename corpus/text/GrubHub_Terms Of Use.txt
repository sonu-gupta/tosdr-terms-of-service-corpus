You may order food through the Platform to be delivered from particular restaurants, including their authorized licensees and franchisees, or other purveyors of food in cities throughout the United States and other territories where Grubhub provides such Services (collectively, the âRestaurantsâ).
Grubhub is not a restaurant or food preparation entity.
The Restaurants available on our Platform operate independently of Grubhub.
Restaurants are required to comply with federal, state, and local laws, rules, regulations, and standards pertaining to the preparation, sale, and marketing of food, including, without limitation, food preparation and safety and menu disclosure.
Grubhub is not liable or responsible for Restaurants' food preparation or safety and does not verify their compliance with all applicable laws.

In such jurisdictions, if you place an order that includes any alcoholic beverage, you represent and warrant that you are at least 21 years of age.
Upon delivery or pickup, as applicable, you shall present a government-issued identification card, evidencing your age, consistent with applicable legal requirements.

If you do not comply with these terms, you agree that the alcoholic beverage(s) will not be released to you, you may forfeit the cost of such beverages, and you may be responsible for restocking fees.PAYMENT AND OUR CREDIT POLICYCertain features of the Platform, including, without limitation, the placing or receipt of orders, may require you to make certain payments, including commissions or other fees.
When paid by you, these payments are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by Grubhub.
Grubhub, in its sole discretion, may offer credits or refunds on a case-by-case basis including, by way of example, in the event of an error with your order or in the amounts you were charged.
Grubhub will charge, and you authorize Grubhub to charge, the payment method you specify at the time of purchase.
If you pay any amounts with a credit card, Grubhub may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to your purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has credit available for your intended purchase.
In the event Grubhub advances payment for any of your orders placed via the Platform (e.g., if you sign up for a corporate account), Grubhub may separately send you invoices for payment of those advanced amounts.
In the event that you fail to pay such invoices within thirty (30) days of the date of such invoice (the âPayment Due Dateâ), you grant Grubhub the right, but not the obligation, to charge the credit card you provide with your Account at any time after any Payment Due Date, unless prohibited by law.
Please note, you are unable to complete checkout with only gift card information.
In all events, you are required to provide another form of payment to submit an order, even if this payment method is not charged.
Also, if you are a campus user and you opt to pay for a purchase with your stored-value card, on certain campuses, (i) Grubhub will charge such purchase to your stored-value card and will charge any applicable fees to either your credit card or other payment on file with us, and (ii) you agree that Grubhub may be unable to refund a purchase to your stored-value card and may, in its discretion, provide a refund through an alternative method.

Grubhub may also, in its sole discretion, make Perks or other promotional offers with different features and different rates available to any or all of our users.
