         Can I buy postage with Bitcoin? How to mail and ship with USPS, UPS, and FedEx using cryptocurrency.
If you have some Bitcoin and want to send a package, you canât just walk into the post office and
expect to pay with Bitcoin.
However, when you ship with Helena Express, thatâs exactly what you can do!
We accept Bitcoin, Etherium, Dogecoin, and a ton of other cryptocurrencies.
If youâre in the Helena
Montana area, just schedule a pickup with us.
Weâll come to you and ship your stuff,
and you can pay with cryptocurrency, cash, card, and more.
We can ship your packages via USPS, UPS,
or FedEx, and we charge you the same no matter how you choose to pay.
