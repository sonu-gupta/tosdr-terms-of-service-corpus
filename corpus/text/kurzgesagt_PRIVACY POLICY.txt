Data protection is a particularly high priority for the management of the In a nutshell â kurzgesagt GmbH (âKGSâ).
The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a data subject shall always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to KGS.
By means of this data protection declaration, our enterprise would like to inform the general public of the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process.
The legal standards require comprehensive transparency regarding the processing of personal data.
Only if the processing is comprehensible to you as the data subject, you are sufficiently informed about the meaning, purpose and scope of the data processing.
Below we therefore inform you in detail about the way your data is handled when using this website and your rights regarding your personal data.
Should you have any further questions regarding data protection, please do not hesitate to contact us by e-mail at dataprotection@kurzgesagt.org.

General information on data processing


The use of the websites of KGS is generally possible without any indication of personal data.
however, if a data subject wants to use special enterprise services via our website, processing of personal data could become necessary (e.g.
contact form, newsletter subscription).
If the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no statutory basis for such processing, we generally obtain consent from the data subject.
Please note that links and features on our website may take you to other websites which are not operated by us but by third parties (e.g.
shop, blog, patreons).
Such links are either clearly marked by us or are recognizable by an obvious change in the address line of your web browser.
We are not responsible or liable for compliance with the respective data protection regulations and safe handling of your personal data on these websites operated by third parties.


Processing during the use of the website


The website of KGS collects a series of general data and information when a data subject or automated system calls up the website.
This general data and information are stored in the server log files.
The following information is recorded and stored until it is automatically deleted:

the browser types and versions used,
the operating system used by the accessing system,
the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers),
the sub-websites,
the date and time of access to the Internet site,
an Internet protocol address (IP address),
the Internet service provider of the accessing system, and
any other similar data and information that may be used in the event of attacks on our information technology systems.

When using these general data and information, KGS does not draw any conclusions about the data subject.
The mentioned data will be processed by us for the following purposes:

deliver the content of our website correctly,
optimize the content of our website as well as its advertisement,
ensure the long-term viability of our information technology systems and website technology,
provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal prosecution in case of a cyber-attack, and
guarantee the smooth running of our shop system,

The legal basis for data processing is mainly Art.
6 (1) (1) (f) GDPR.
Our legitimate interest follows from the aforementioned purposes of data collection.
Furthermore, Art.
6 (1) (1) (b) GDPR forms the statutory basis for our shop system, as in that case processing is also necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract.
Therefore, KGS analyses anonymously collected data and information statistically, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process.
The anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.
We do not combine this personal data with other data sources.
Disclosure only takes place if it is necessary for the operation of our website, e.g.
by storing it with our host provider.
A transfer to a third country or to an international organization is not intended.


Processing by using individual services via our website


Various services are available on our website, where we collect personal data from you if you decide to use them.


Contact form / Contact us by e-mail


If you use the contact form on our website or send us an e-mail, we will process the personal data you provide us.
This information is transmitted by your browser or e-mail client and processed in our IT systems.
The processing of this personal data is necessary to answer your request.
In addition, your IP address and the date and time of the contact request will be stored.
The processing of your personal data serves to answer your request and to prevent abuse of the contact form and to guarantee the security of our IT systems.
These processing operations are lawful because the reply to your request and the protection of our IT systems represent legitimate interests within the meaning of Art.
6 (1) (1) (f) GDPR.
If a contract is concluded after you have contacted us, the processing is also legal pursuant to Art.
6 (1) (1) (b) GDPR.
The personal data will be processed as long as necessary to respond to your request.
Should your request lead to a later conclusion of the contract, processing will take place as long as this is necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures or to fulfil the contract.
We do not merge your personal data with other data sources.
Your personal data will not be disclosed to third parties.
A transfer to a third country or to an international organization is not intended.
You are not obliged to provide your personal data, but it is not possible to use the contact form or send an e-mail without providing it.


Newsletter


If you have explicitly given your consent according to Art.
6 (1) (1) (a) GDPR, we will use your e-mail address to send you our newsletter on a regular basis.
The input mask used for this purpose determines what personal data are transmitted, as well as when the newsletter is subscribed.
KGS informs its customers and business partners regularly by means of a newsletter about enterprise offers.
The enterpriseâs newsletter may only be received by the data subject if (1) the data subject has a valid e-mail address and (2) the data subject properly subscribes for the newsletter mailing.
A confirmation e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address registered by a data subject for the first time for newsletter mailing, for legal reasons, in the so called double opt-in procedure.
This confirmation e-mail is used to prove whether the owner of the e-mail address as the data subject is authorized to receive the newsletter.
During the registration for the newsletter, we also store the IP address of the computer system assigned by the internet service provider (ISP) and used by the data subject at the time of the registration, as well as the date and time of the registration.
The collection of this data is necessary in order to understand the (possible) misuse of the e-mail address of a data subject at a later date, and it therefore serves the aim of the legal protection of the controller.
The personal data collected as part of a registration for the newsletter will only be used to send our newsletter.
In addition, subscribers to the newsletter may be informed by e-mail, as long as this is necessary for the operation of the newsletter service or a registration in question, as this could be the case in the event of modifications to the newsletter offer, or in the event of a change in technical circumstances.
There will be no transfer of personal data collected by the newsletter service to third parties.
The subscription to our newsletter may be terminated or unsubscribed by the data subject at any time.
The consent to the storage of personal data, which the data subject has given for the newsletter mailing, may be revoked at any time free of charge.
For the purpose of revocation of consent, a corresponding link is found at the bottom of each newsletter.
It is also possible to unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time directly on our website, or to communicate this to us in a different way, e.g.
by e-mail or mail.


Applications and the application procedures


We collect and process the personal data of applicants for the purpose of the processing of the application procedure.
The processing may also be carried out electronically.
This is the case, in particular, if an applicant submits corresponding application documents by e-mail or by means of a web form on the website to us.
If we conclude an employment contract with an applicant, the submitted data will be stored for the purpose of processing the employment relationship in compliance with legal requirements.
If no employment contract is concluded with the applicant by us, the application documents will be automatically erased six (6) months after notification of the refusal decision, provided that the applicant has not given consent for a longer storage of the application documents and no other legitimate interests of us are opposed to the erasure.
These processing operations are lawful because the reply to your application represent legitimate interests within the meaning of Art.
6 (1) (1) (f) GDPR.
If a contract is concluded after you have contacted us, the processing is also legal pursuant to Art.
6 (1) (1) (b) GDPR.
Other legitimate interest in this relation is, e.g.
a burden of proof in a procedure under the General Equal Treatment Act (AGG).

Google Analytics


For the purpose of demand-oriented design and continuous optimization of our website, we use Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google Inc.
(https://www.google.de/intl/de/about) (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.

The information generated by the Cookie about your use of this website such as

Browser type/version,
operating system used,
referrer URL (the previously visited page),
host name of the accessing computer (IP address) and
time of the server request

are transferred from your browser to a Google server in the USA and stored on Google servers.
Google Analytics is used for statistical purposes of our website, to evaluate them for the purpose of optimizing our offer for you and to further develop our offer and in particular our website.
Data transmission to the USA is no longer based on the former EU-US Data Protection Shield which is why we ask you for your explicit consent to transfer your personal data to the USA or we make use of the Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) in place with our US partners or store data on servers located within the EU.
If your browser does not support Google Analytics or you deactivate this function, no data transfer takes place.
The pseudonymized user profiles are deleted after 14 months.
The information is used to evaluate the use of the website, to compile reports on the website activities and to provide further services associated with the use of the website and the Internet for the purposes of market research and demand-oriented design of these websites.

Google Web Fonts


When visiting our website, so-called web fonts are downloaded for the uniform display of fonts.
This content is provided by Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (âGoogleâ).
When accessing our website, your browser loads the required web fonts into your browser cache to display texts and fonts correctly.
To do this, the browser you are using must connect to Googleâs servers.
This gives Google knowledge that our website has been accessed via your IP address.
Google Web Fonts are used for the purpose of uniform and appealing presentation of our website.
Data transmission to the USA is no longer based on the former EU-US Data Protection Shield which is why we ask you for your explicit consent to transfer your personal data to the USA or we make use of the Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) in place with our US partners or store data on servers located within the EU.
If your browser does not support web fonts or you deactivate this function, no data transfer takes place.
For more information about Google Web Fonts, visit https://developers.google.com/fonts/.
You can find Googleâs privacy policy at https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/.


Google reCAPTCHA


On our website we are using Google reCAPTCHA (âreCAPTCHAâ).
This content is provided by Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (âGoogleâ).
reCAPTCHA is a free service that protects our website from spam and abuse.
It uses advanced risk analysis techniques to tell humans and bots apart.
With the new API, a significant number of our valid human users will pass the reCAPTCHA challenge without having to solve a CAPTCHA.
reCAPTCHA is used to prevent abuse of the contact form and to guarantee the security of our IT systems of our website.
Data transmission to the USA is no longer based on the former EU-US Data Protection Shield which is why we ask you for your explicit consent to transfer your personal data to the USA or we make use of the Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) in place with our US partners or store data on servers located within the EU.

You can find Googleâs privacy policy at https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/.


Newsletter-Tracking


The newsletter of KGS contains so-called tracking pixels.
A tracking pixel is a miniature graphic embedded in such e-mails, which are sent in HTML format to enable log file recording and analysis.
This allows a statistical analysis of the success or failure of online marketing campaigns.
Based on the embedded tracking pixel, KGS may see if and when an e-mail was opened by a data subject, and which links in the e-mail were called up by data subjects.
Such personal data collected in the tracking pixels contained in the newsletters are stored and analyzed by us in order to optimize the shipping of the newsletter, as well as to adapt the content of future newsletters even better to the interests of the data subject.
The legal basis is Art.
6 (1) (1) (a) GDPR.
These personal data will not be passed on to third parties.
Data subjects are at any time entitled to revoke the respective separate declaration of consent issued by means of the double-opt-in procedure.
After a revocation, these personal data will be deleted by us.
KGS automatically regards a withdrawal from the receipt of the newsletter as a revocation.


Integration of social media


On the basis of Art.
6 (1) (1) (a) GDPR we use the social networks YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Patreon, Reddit and BÄhance in order to make our website better known and to interact with our target groups.
Responsibility for the data protection-compliant operation of these services is guaranteed by the respective provider.
We integrate these services exclusively via a link so that visitors to our website have the best possible control over their personal data.
These social networks are operated exclusively by third parties, some of whom have their register office outside the E.U.
or the EEA â there may therefore be no adequate level of data protection in accordance with the GDPR.
The browser plug-ins and links on our website are identified by logos or other references.
When you visit our website, which contains such a browser plug-in, a connection is automatically established between your device (browser) and the servers of the respective social network.
This forwards the information that you have visited our website to the social network.
If you are logged in to the social network via your personal user account or during your visit to our website, your visit to our website will be assigned to your account.
By interacting with browser plug-ins or links, e.g.
by pressing a âlikeâ button or leaving a comment, this information is transmitted to the respective social network and stored there.
The allocation of the data to your account can therefore be prevented on the one hand by logging out of your account (of the respective social network) before visiting our website.
On the other hand, you can also completely prevent the loading of the respective plug-ins with an add-on for your browser, e.g.
with the script blocker âNoScriptâ (http://noscript.net/).
The purpose and scope of data collection through social networks as well as the further processing and use of your data and your rights and setting options for the protection of your privacy can be found in the respective data protection information of the operators:

Routine erasure and blocking of personal data


We process and store the personal data of the data subject only for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of storage, or as far as this is granted by the European legislator or other legislators in laws or regulations to which the controller is subject to.
The criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period.
After expiration of that period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long as it is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or the initiation of a contract.
If the storage purpose is not applicable, or if a storage period prescribed by the European legislator or another competent legislator expires, the personal data are routinely blocked or erased in accordance with legal requirements.


Profiling / Automatic decision-making


As a responsible company, we do not use profiling or automatic decision-making.


Data Security


We use the most common SSL (Secure Socket Layer) method in connection with the highest level of encryption supported by your browser.
Usually this is a 256 bit encryption.
If your browser does not support 256-bit encryption, we use 128-bit v3 technology instead.
Whether a single page of our website is transmitted in encrypted form is indicated by the closed display of the key or lock symbol in the lower status bar of your browser.
As the controller, KGS has implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed through this website.
However, Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute protection may not be guaranteed.
For this reason, every data subject is free to transfer personal data to us via alternative means, e.g.
by telephone.


Changes of Terms and Conditions


This Privacy Policy is effective as of October 2020 and may need to be amended as our websites, apps and offerings evolve or as a result of changes in legal or regulatory requirements.
