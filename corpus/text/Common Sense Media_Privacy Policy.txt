What happens when my kid registers for your site?

We support the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and other frameworks like the EU General Data Protection Regulation and the so-called UK GDPR (together, the GDPR), which endorse the protection of children and their data.
Our goal is to minimize the information gathered from and disseminated about kids while permitting them active participation with the trustworthy information, education, and independent voice for which we are known.&nbsp.
Under COPPA in the United States, children for these purposes are considered to be individuals under the age of 13.
This age range may vary in other countries and regions.
Where consent is required or recommended for a particular purpose or practice, we aim to get parental consent for youth in accordance with the age designated by the country they are in.
 
For teens 13 and over, once an account is created (with parental consent as needed) we take extra steps to limit information collected and protect privacy, as described in this policy.
For children under 13, we have especially strict limitations about what personal information can be collected and viewed about kids and how and when they can be contacted.
Please see our Children's Privacy Policy for additional information pertaining to our policies relating to the use of the services by children under 13.
For logged in teens and children non-Necessary cookies are turned off.

What rights do parents have? 
If you are a parent of a younger user, and we need your consent to certain processing of your childâs personal information, if you:

believe your child is participating in an activity on the Site that uses their personal information without the parental consent required by law.
and/or 
no longer wish for your child to participate as a member of the Site, 

we will delete your childâs Profile, and any parental contact information we may hold, on request.
 
If you are a parent based in the EEA+, and you wish to exercise the rights described above: you can do so through our Privacy Requests Portal.
If you are a parent based outside the EEA+, and you wish to exercise the rights described above: please contact us through the Privacy Requests Portal.

What rights do Californians have? 
We offer Californians and all users certain rights to their personal information, including the right to access, correct, delete, and port data.
Our privacy policy and our Children's Privacy policy explain how we collect, use, and share information.
As discussed further below, we are not in the business of selling your personal information.

What rights do Individuals in the EEA+ have? 

Individuals in the EEA+ have certain rights in respect of their personal data, including the right to certain disclosures about how it is processed, and the right to access, correct and delete it.
See our EEA+ Privacy Policy for additional details. 

How do you get consent from parents of younger EEA+ users? 
If parental consent is required in respect of any processing of a younger EEA+ userâs Personal Data, that User must provide their parentâs email address.
We use that email address to contact the Userâs parent to ask for their consent to the relevant processing â we also explain to the parent: 

what Personal Data we collect about their child; 
how we use it and why.
and
how the parent can revoke their consent and/or ask that we delete their childâs Profile and their Personal Data. 

If at this stage, the parent gives us their consent, we will carry out the processing.
If not, we wonât.

Do you give anyone my personal information?

We are not in the business of renting or selling your personal data.
We do not share or disclose your personal data without your prior written consent, except as follows:

to provide to our third-party vendors who assist us with operating, maintaining, and improving our services by providing us with services, such as donation processing, email delivery, information technology services, marketing Common Sense content, features, and products, and other similar services, and who receive your data for the limited purposes of providing us with such services;

to provide credit for Digital Literacy Citizenship Training (for educators);
to fulfill a request you have made (such as entering a promotion);
and to comply with the law, legal process, respond to an emergency, or protect our rights.

B.
How We Use Information Collected Through Digital Citizenship Quizzes

Quizzes provided by Common Sense Education are available at the end of each lesson in the Digital Citizenship Curriculum.
Each quiz includes 4-6 questions that have varied formats: multiple choice, drag and drop to complete a sentence, and drag and drop sorting.
The quiz is autograded and students can see their results immediately.
The quizzes are intended to assess student understanding after the teacher has completed the corresponding lesson.
Common Sense quiz reports (for the entire class and individual student) are only accessible to a teacher who is authenticated with Google Classroom and who requests specific quiz reports on specified students authenticated with Google Classroom.
Common Sense works with the following third party service providers to provide Google Classroom integrated quizzes through the Digital Citizenship curriculum:


Learning Locker
 Learning Locker is a Learning Record Store (LRS) database-driven application and analytics tool designed specifically for the learning sector.
Common Sense uses Learning Locker to store, sort and share data as recorded using the xAPI specification from Google Classroom.
Learning Locker may collect and store the following information including, but not limited to: Google User ID, quiz_id, quiz name, start time, start date, quiz completion, stop time, stop date, quiz duration, quiz questions, alphanumeric answers, quiz grade, and quiz ranking.
Please read Learning Lockerâs privacy policy for more information.



Google Classroom
 Google Classroom is a free web service developed by Google and part of the G Suite for Education to help schools streamline the process of sharing files between teachers and students.
Students using Google Classroom can view assignments, submit homework, and receive grades from teachers to help them stay on track and organized.
The G Suite for Education core services are the heart of Googleâs educational offering to schools.
The core services include Gmail, Calendar, Classroom, Contacts, Drive, Docs, Groups, Sheets, Sites, Slides, Talk/Hangouts and Vault.
Please read Google Classroomâs privacy policy for more information.
 The Google Classroom service provides Common Sense with a Google Classroom authenticated teacherâs class roster of student Google IDs.
Only authenticated teachers can access student first and last names associated with Google IDs for quiz reporting purposes.
Common Sense requests authorization from teachers to access their Google Classroom class roster of student Google IDs in order to combine all the specified student Google IDs present in the class roster with their respective Common Sense quiz submission data and quiz grades in order to generate class and individual student quiz reports for teachers.
All quiz reports are generated on-demand by the Google Classroom authenticated teacher and are not stored or retained by Common Sense.
When a teacher requests a "class roster" or individual âstudentâ quiz report, Common Sense loads the teacherâs specified Google IDs from our third-party service provider Learning Locker and matches student IDs with Google Classroom to create and display a class roster quiz report for the entire class, or individual student report to produce a Google Classroom listing that includes student names paired with quiz scores.
Common Sense and our third-party service providers do not store or retain any class or individual student report data.

Purpose limitation.
We will only use your Personal Data for the purposes for which we collected it as listed above, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.&nbsp.
If we need to use your Personal Data for an unrelated purpose, we will update this Privacy Policy and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.
Please note that we may process your Personal Data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law (including the GDPR).

What happens when you do not provide necessary Personal Data or you withdraw consent? Where we 

need

 to process your Personal Data either to comply with law, or to perform the terms of a contract we have with you and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you.&nbsp.
Similarly, if we rely on your consent to process your Personal Data, you are entitled to withdraw your consent, but if you do, we may not be able to provide certain services or features to you.&nbsp.
We will keep you informed of when your access to service or features depends on your consent. 

Our newsletters.
EEA+ Users who are Adult Members, and other EEA+ Users over the age of 18, can opt-in to receiving our newsletters.
Please note, however, that you may continue to receive âservice-relatedâ and other non-marketing emails from us, including notices of any updates to our Terms of Use or this Policy.

How do you get consent from parents of younger users when you are required to do so? If parental consent is required in respect of any processing of a younger Userâs Personal Data, that User must provide their parentâs email address.
We use that email address to contact the Userâs parent to ask for their consent to the relevant processing â we also explain to the parent: 

what Personal Data we collect about their child; 
how we use it and why.
and 
how the parent can revoke their consent and/or ask that we delete their childâs Profile and their Personal Data. 

If at this stage, the parent gives us their consent, we will carry out the processing.
If not, we wonât.

What rights do EEA+ parents have?  If you are a parent of a younger EEA+ User, and we need your consent to certain processing of your childâs Personal Data, if you:

believe your child is participating in an activity on the Site that uses their Personal Data without the parental consent required by law.
and/or 
no longer wish for your child to participate as a member of the Site, 

we will delete your childâs Profile, and any parental contact information we may hold, on request.
If you wish to exercise these rights, you can do so through our Privacy Requests Portal.

Payment and Donation Processing. As noted above, your Payment Data and Donation Data is provided directly to Payment Services via their Payment Service Pages that we direct you to.
When processing payments and donations on our behalf, Payment Services typically act as our âprocessorâ in respect of EEA+ Usersâ Payment Data and Donation Data â essentially, this means that they only process your Payment Data and Donation Data for this limited purpose.
However, Payment Services may also have their own legal and regulatory obligations that might require them to use your Payment Data and Donation Data for their own compliance-related purposes (e.g., security and fraud prevention) â THIS POLICY DOES NOT ADDRESS PAYMENT SERVICESâ PROCESSING OF PAYMENT DATA AND DONATION DATA FOR SUCH INDEPENDENTLY-DETERMINED PURPOSES, WHICH WILL BE SUBJECT TO THAT PAYMENT SERVICE'S PRIVACY POLICY RATHER THAN THIS POLICY.

Personal Data from Third Party Sources.
In addition to the Personal Data that we collect directly from you we also collect certain of your Personal Data from the following categories of third party:  

Social Media sites / Single Sign-On providers â we may receive certain Identity Data, Contact Data, and Service Personalisation Data relating to Educator Members who register for, and access their Profile using, a Social Networking or Single Sign-On Service.
Fundraising Tools â we derive or receive Donor Analysis Data from certain commercial- and publicly-available sources, which we use to enrich the profiles of our current and prospective donors (example of such data sources are the iWaves PROscores, WealthX CoreLogic, VeriGift, Larkspur Data databases).


International transfers.
We are headquartered in the United States.
The Personal Data that we collect from and about you will be stored and processed in the United States and may be stored and processed in other countries outside of the EEA+.
However, it is our policy to ensure that adequate contractual or other safeguards are applied to Personal Data transferred outside of the EEA+ where required by the GDPR.
If you have questions about the safeguards applied to your Personal Data, you may contact us at Contact Support.
