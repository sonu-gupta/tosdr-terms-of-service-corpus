Privacy Notice for Data Subjects This Privacy Notice (âPrivacy Noticeâ) is intended for anyone who wishes to review, modify, restrict or take ownership of the information that FullContact might have on them, as well as understand how FullContact uses that information.
Additional information for FullContact Users can be found in the Privacy Policy. Overview FullContactâs core purpose is to make relationships better.
In todayâs fast-paced and multi-layered world, keeping up with everyone you know both online and offline can prove daunting.
Discovering, building, and cultivating authentic relationships with the people that matter most to you, both personally and professionally, is hard with our data scattered and fragmented all over the digital world.
Most of us also expect the companies that we interact with to treat us like humans and know who we are as a person, not cogs in some machine.
Sometimes, having the right information at the right time makes all the difference.
You can think of FullContact as the âphone bookâ for the modern digital world.
We do our best to bring together contact information from a variety of public sources (such as is available on the Internet through a simple Google Search) and combine it with contact information that our users contribute (similar to Wikipedia).
We couple that with powerful tools for individuals and companies to manage their contacts.
We aim to have the most complete, accurate, and up-to-date record we can for each person in our âphone bookâ (also known as the âFullContact Databaseâ).
The types of information we may keep track of include contact elements such as name, address, phone number, email, social profiles, and device IDs.
We often also have professional information (such as organizational affiliations, job titles, and skills) as well as personal information (such as interests, relationships, and basic demographic data like age, gender, and location).
In many cases we may also find associated profile photos.
All of this information is intended to help the people and companies you interact with to know you better and be able to develop true and meaningful relationships with you.
Based on the information someone already has on you, they might look you up in our system and get back some additional information.
The information in our system also helps the people and companies you interact with to clean up their own âaddress booksâ so that they donât have information about you scattered across multiple systems and devices and so that they donât connect with you multiple times, through different channels, with information that is entirely irrelevant to you.
We help our people and companies to gather their existing information into clean contact records for each individual they know.
We also allow people or companies to search in our system for individuals who meet certain criteria.
For example, a professional whoâs trying to find an expert in their field can use our Services to find the right person.
Similarly, an organization could search for the most appropriate audience for their offerings.
In all cases, our goal is to help people and companies make better, more valuable connections.
We recognize, however, that not everyone is comfortable sharing their contact information with others.
For this reason, anyone can take ownership of their information in our system at any time here: Own Your Personal Data.
Actually, we hope that you do choose to take ownership of your information and help keep our âphone bookâ as accurate and up-to-date as possible.
It is only through the contributions of people like you that we can provide this valuable service to you and everyone else.
Our dream is to have everyone owning their data, fully controlling where it flows, and seeing better relationships in return.
We may ask in time for your consent to use that data but as of right now we shall keep our âbooks openâ and you can restrict processing of some parts or all of your data.
Period.
Please reach out at any time with any ideas on how we can serve you better.
Own Your Personal Data Your Rights Anyone, in any country across the world, may access, rectify, or restrict their Personal Data within FullContact Database at any time by visiting Own Your Personal Data.
Please note that we may ask you to verify your identity before taking action on your request.
If you ask us to erase your data, we may still have to retain certain data about you to ensure that your Personal Data does not re-enter our system and protect your rights.
Specifically, we will mark your Personal Data as âhiddenâ and ârestrict processingâ such that your data is no longer used or made available to anyone. California Privacy Rights Californiaâs âShine the Lightâ law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses that share customer personal information with third parties for the third partiesâ direct marketing purposes to respond to requests from California customers asking about the businessesâ practices related to such information-sharing.
Alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose a customerâs personal information to third parties for the third partiesâ direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information-sharing.
We have such a policy in place.
As described in Section 8.2 of the Privacy Policy, you can opt-out of our sharing of your personal information with anyone (including with third parties for the third partiesâ direct marketing purposes) by clicking on the âOwn Your Personal Dataâ in that section of our Privacy Policy and choosing to âDo Not Shareâ.
To find out more about your opt-out rights, please contact us at the address listed in Section 11 of the Privacy Policy.
Please note that under California law businesses are only required to respond to a customer making such a request once during any calendar year. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Individuals in the EU may exercise any of the rights described in this section by using the applicable functionality in our Services or by contacting us directly.
If you reside outside of the European Union, you may have similar rights under your local laws.
The purpose for processing, categories of Personal Data concerned, and categories of recipients of Personal Data are described in the âOverviewâ section above.
Our lawful basis for processing is our legitimate interest in providing contact management services to our Users, enabling them to better connect and build their relationships with you.
Personal Data will be retained as long as necessary to serve that purpose or until you decide it is not in your best interest to keep your information in the FullContact Database.
You have the right to object to the processing of your Personal Data at any time.
If you have taken ownership of your data by following the necessary steps at (Own Your Personal Data) or by contacting us directly, we may ask for your explicit permission to share certain of your Personal Data.
If you choose to give permission to share certain information, then our lawful basis for processing is your Consent.
You have the right to withdraw your Consent at any time.
You also have the right of portability for any data that you have provided us.
You have the right to request from us access to and rectification or erasure of Personal Data or restriction of processing.
You may exercise these rights at (Own Your Personal Data) or by contacting us directly.
Requests for erasure can not be met because erasing your Personal Data would not achieve the desired result of your Personal Data not being in our system: we receive data continuously and would likely have your Personal Data in our system again quickly.
Instead, we will mark your Personal Data as âhiddenâ and ârestrict processingâ such that your data is no longer used in providing our service and is no longer made available to anyone.
You have the right to request the sources of your Personal Data.
You may do so by contacting us as indicated in the âContact Usâ section below.
Please note that to protect the rights of other data subjects, we may only be able to provide you with the general categories of sources.
We may transfer, store, and process your information within our family of companies or with service providers based in the United States.
FullContact complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S.
Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States, respectively.
You have the right to lodge a complaint with your applicable supervising authority. How to Contact Us If you have any questions or complaints about this Privacy Notice, please contact us at: privacy@fullcontact.com

 HOW WE USE PERSONAL DATA
We primarily use, store, and process Personal Data to provide, understand, improve, and develop our Services, create and maintain a trusted and safer environment, and comply with our legal obligations.
We also use Personal Data for the following purposes:

2.1 Provide, Maintain, and Support the Services

Using Personal Data we collect, we are able to deliver the Services to you and honor our Terms of Use.
We need to use Personal Data you provide to facilitate the creation of and secure your Account on our network, identify you as a User in our system, provide improved administration and quality of experience of our Site and Services, send email, call, or send SMS text messages to you to verify ownership of the email address or phone number provided when your Account was created, send you Service, support or maintenance messages, updates, security alerts, and Account notifications.
Your Personal Data may also be used for the detection and prevention of fraud, spam, abuse, and other harmful activity, and for any purpose you authorize at the time of collection.
Additionally, to provide you technical support, we may need to review your Account and the contents of your Account to identify, research, troubleshoot, and resolve any issues that you report to us or that we otherwise become aware of.

2.2 Improve, Personalize, and Develop Services

We use Personal Data we collect to improve and personalize the Services and to develop new ones.
For example, we use Personal Data to troubleshoot and protect against errors.
perform data analysis and testing.
conduct research and surveys.
and develop new features and Services.

2.3 Provide, Personalize, Measure, and Improve our Advertising and Marketing

We may process Personal Data for marketing purposes including offering you products or Services that may be of interest to you (such as information about FullContact Services or partner campaigns and other third party services).
We may also administer referral programs, rewards, surveys, sweepstakes, contests, newsletters, or other promotional activities or events sponsored or managed by FullContact or its third party partners.
You can opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us by following the unsubscribe instructions included in our marketing communications or changing your notification settings within your FullContact Account.

2.4 Combine Contacts for Identity Resolution &amp.
Verification Services

Certain categories of Personal Data may be combined to build more complete contact records of individuals (âCompleted Contact Dataâ).
Completed Contact Data reside in the FullContact Database and may be processed for the following purposes in connection with providing Identity Resolution and Verification Services:

 Grouping contacts and contact elements into unique individuals to create Completed Contact Data.
Generating and returning a unique identifier for an individual and associated Completed Contact Data
Linking (or âmatchingâ) input contact records to Completed Contact Data for purposes of identifying an individual, searching for an individual, and/or linking to other contact records (such as those submitted by 3rd-parties) associated with the same individual.
Deduplicating a set of input contact records based on unique individuals
Inferring linkages between and/or deduplicating existing Completed Contact Data
Verifying the accuracy and recency of contact elements contained within input contact records

For example, someone may search or lookup a Contact by name and email address.
FullContact connects the name and email with a Completed Contact Data within the FullContact Database for one of the reasons above.
No additional Contact Data beyond the unique identifier are returned to the User submitting the search.

2.5 Combine Contacts for Contact Enrichment Services

Certain categories of Personal Data may be made available to our customers and partners in connection with providing Enrichment Services.
Contact enrichment is often combined with Identity Resolution so that, for example, a User is able to match a Contact that they possess to our Completed Contact Data, and receive back a subset of the contact information from the relevant Completed Contact Data for that individual and/or other contacts records linked to the same individual.
For example, we may return an individualâs name to support features such as caller ID.
Other examples of data that may be returned by our Enrichment Services include: social handles, hashed identifiers, basic demographic information, profile photos, consumer interests, and professional information such as business emails, organizational affiliation and job title.
See our developer docs for a list of currently available enrichment data.

2.6 Creation of Deidentified, Aggregate, or Anonymous Information

We may create Deidentified Information, Aggregate Information, or Anonymous Information records from Personal Data by excluding certain private data in a manner that makes the data not personally identifiable.
We use this Deidentified Information, Aggregate Information, or Anonymous Information to analyze request and usage patterns so that we may enhance the content of our Services and improve Site navigation.
FullContact reserves the right to use Deidentified Information, Aggregate Information, and Anonymous Information for any purpose, including providing Services to our Users, and disclose Deidentified Information, Aggregate Information, and Anonymous Information to third parties in its sole discretion, including (but not limited to) regulatory compliance, industry and market analysis, demographic profiling, modeling, marketing and advertising, and other business purposes.

This Terms of Use is subject to occasional revision, and if we make any substantial changes, we may notify you by sending you an e-mail to the last e-mail address you provided to us (if any) or by prominently posting notice of the changes on our Site.
Any changes to this Terms of Use will be effective upon the earlier of thirty (30) calendar days following our dispatch of an e-mail notice to you (if applicable) or thirty (30) calendar days following our posting of notice of the changes on our Site.
These changes will be effective immediately for new users of our Site, Services, or FullContact Data.
You are responsible for providing us with your most current e-mail address.
In the event that the last e-mail address that you have provided us is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you the notice described above, our dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice of the changes described in the notice.
Continued use of our Site, Services, or FullContact Data following notice of such changes shall indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of such changes.

Arbitration Agreement and Jury Trial Waiver, Class Action Waiver, And Forum Selection Clause.
All controversies, disputes, demands, counts, claims, or causes of action between you and FullContact arising out of, under, or related in any way to this Terms of Use or our privacy practices, shall exclusively be settled through binding arbitration.

Arbitration shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state arbitration law.
The arbitration shall be conducted before one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes from the American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ).
As modified by this Terms of Use, and unless agreed upon by the parties in writing, the arbitration will be governed by the AAAâs Commercial Arbitration Rules and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively âRules and Proceduresâ).
You are thus GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights under this contract EXCEPT for matters that may be taken to small claims court.
Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury.
You are entitled to a FAIR HEARING, BUT the arbitration procedures are SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT.
Arbitrator decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT.
You and FullContact must abide by the following rules: (a) for any claim that could otherwise be brought in small claims court, the arbitration shall be conducted solely based on written submissions and, if the arbitrator deems it appropriate, a telephonic hearing.
(b) if the claim exceeds what can be recovered in a small claims court, the arbitration shall be conducted solely based on written submissions or a telephonic hearing, unless the arbitrator deems a face-to-face hearing is appropriate, in which case one should be held at a location agreed to by you and FullContact, and if the parties cannot agree on a location for the hearing, the arbitrator will determine a location for the proceedings which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances.
(c) the arbitratorâs ruling is binding and not merely advisory.
(d) ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR FULLCONTACT MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIESâ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
(e) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSONâS CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.
(f) in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to costs of litigation, FullContact will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation.
(g) FullContact also reserves the right in its sole and exclusive discretion to assume responsibility for all of the costs of the arbitration.
(h) the arbitrator shall honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law.
(i) a decision by the arbitrator (including any finding of fact or conclusion of law) against either you or FullContact shall be confidential unless otherwise required to be disclosed by law or by any administrative body and may not be collaterally used against either of them in existing or subsequent litigation or arbitration involving any other person/FullContact customer.
and (j) each side pays its own attorneysâ fees and expenses unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid its feesâ and litigation expenses.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or FullContact may bring an individual action in small claims court.
In addition, if you are a user outside of the United States, the Privacy Policy (Dispute Resolution for Users Outside of the United States), and not this arbitration provision, shall apply to any disputes related to privacy.
Further, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other partyâs patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret shall not be subject to this arbitration provision.
Such claims shall be exclusively brought (unless such courts do not have personal jurisdiction in the dispute) in the state or federal courts located in Denver County, Colorado.
Additionally, notwithstanding this arbitration provision, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before such courts in order to maintain the status quo pending the arbitratorâs ruling, and hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.
A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to arbitrate.
With the exception of subparts (d) and (e) in the paragraph above (prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis), if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein.
If, however, either subpart (d) or (e) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor FullContact shall be entitled to arbitration.
In the event this arbitration provision is held unenforceable by a court, or in the event AAA refuses to arbitrate the dispute, all controversies, disputes, demands, counts, claims, or causes of action between you and FullContact shall be exclusively brought in the state or federal courts located in Denver County, Colorado.
For more information on AAA, its Rules and Procedures, and how to file an arbitration claim, you may call AAA at 800-778-7879 or visit the AAA website at https://www.adr.org.



Choice of Law.
The Terms of Use is made under and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Colorado, consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, without giving effect to any principles that provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction.

Entire Agreement.
Unless you later enter into any other agreements with FullContact regarding the Site, Services, or FullContact, this Terms of Use is the complete and exclusive agreement between you and FullContact regarding your access to and use of the Site, Services, or FullContact Data.
Except as provided above, this Terms of Use supersede any prior agreement or proposal, oral or written, and any other communications between you and FullContact relating to your use of the Site, Services, or FullContact Data.
Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Terms of Use shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.
The section titles in this Terms of Use are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
The word including means including without limitation.
If any provision of this Terms of Use is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of this Terms of Use will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.
FullContact will not be liable for any delay or non-performance of its obligations under this Terms of Use due to any cause beyond its control.
Your relationship to FullContact is that of an independent contractor, and neither party is an agent or partner of the other.
This Terms of Use, and your rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without FullContactâs prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void.
The terms of this Terms of Use shall be binding upon assignees.
There are no third party beneficiaries of this Terms of Use.

Data Restrictions.
Developer will not, and will require any and all third parties to which it provides any FullContact Data from the Service or the API (âData Recipientsâ) to not, use such FullContact Data for the purposes of cookie tracking, ad exchanges, ad networks, data brokerages, sending electronic communications (including email) in violation of applicable law, or any other activity or purpose identified as prohibited by FullContact in any communication sent to Developer.
If FullContact informs Developer that a specified activity or purpose is prohibited, Developer will ensure that any and all Data Recipients immediately cease processing of any such FullContact Data for the prohibited activity or purpose.
If Developer is not subject to the laws based on the EU General Data Protection Regulation ((EU) 2016/679) or Swiss Federal Data Protection law, Developer hereby agrees to either: (i) certify its compliance with the EU-U.S.
and Swiss-U.S.

Under what conditions are FullContact products &amp.
services GDPR compliant? FullContact data products and services are GDPR compliant.
For our data-products, the customer must execute a Data Processing Addendum (DPA).
A Private Plan is also an option available for additional privacy protection, so no private data is ever stored in our data co-op and use of 3rd party sub-processors, with the exception of Amazon Web Services (AWS), is restricted. 8.
What client personal data is covered under the GDPR? Only personal data of EEA data subjects is covered under GDPR.
However, because it is often difficult to determine whether or not personal data belongs to an EU data subject, for Clients on the Private Plan, FullContact treats all client personal data as if it falls under GDPR. 9.
Does a Client on the Private Plan contribute to the data co-op? No, the Private Plan (which is currently required for GDPR compliance) does not allow for participation in the data co-op. 10.
Can a client be on the Private Plan and also opt-in to using Insights Bundles? All Insights Bundles are available to customers on the Private Plan.
This includes Affinities, Social, Demographic, Location, Email Hash, Employment History, Key People, Individual, Professional, Finance, Household, Purchases, Lifestyle, and Shopping Habits. 11.
What does FullContact do with the personal data that a Client submits (e.g., a query to the FullContact API)? Clients send client personal data (such as one or more personal identifiers) to FullContact when making an API request or providing a customer file for matching.
API queries are logged in order to honor our contractual obligations related to fair billing.
However, the log files of Private Plan clients record only the minimum query fields necessary for billing purposes and any client personal data is secured by encryption. 12.
How does FullContact comply with the GDPR requirement for a processor to provide a list of sub-processors? We do not use any sub-processors for Clients who have executed a DPA, except for FullContactâs hosting provider, Amazon Web Services, with all relevant AWS data centers used by FullContact being located in the United States of America.
