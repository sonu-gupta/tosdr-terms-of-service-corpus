## INTEREST BASED
ADVERTISING We may directly or through a third party vendor use non-personally identifiable information in
connection with our own or our vendorsâ information to display or deliver targeted advertising to you on our Site
and to manage our advertising on other sites.
Cookies, clickstream data, web beacons and other similar technologies
may be used to collect information in order to provide personalized advertising.
For example, if you are searching
for information on a particular product, we or our vendors may cause an advertisement to appear on other websites
you view with information on that product.
This form of advertising, sometimes called âinterest based advertising,â
is based on anonymous information and not on any personal information.
As a result, we and our vendors know your
interests, but do not personally identify you in connection with the delivery of that specific ad.
We believe that
such advertising is helpful because you will see advertisements that are relevant to your interests.
However, if you
would like to opt-out of these interest-based advertisements, please follow the opt-out process described below
under âInterest Based Advertising Opt-Out.â ## COOKIES We may place small data files on your device or device hard
drive known as âcookiesâ or a similar type of file (such as clear gifs, web beacons, tags, etc.) for the purpose of
facilitating and enhancing your communication and interaction with the Site.
Many websites use cookies for these
purposes.
Cookies are also used to collect general usage and volume statistical information.
We use this information
internally, to help us maintain and enhance the efficiency and usefulness of the Site.
We may also use and place
cookies on your device from our third party service providers in connection with the Site, such as an analytics
provider that helps us manage and analyze Site usage.
We also use session ID cookies and persistent cookies.
A
session ID cookie expires when you close your browser.
Our persistent cookies may remain active on your device for
up to 1-3 years (depending upon the purpose of the cookie) or until you delete them manually.
We set a persistent
cookie to enable us to track and target the interests of users to enhance the services we provide.

similar items are not used by us to automatically retrieve personal information from your device without your
knowledge.
If you do not wish to receive cookies or want to restrict them or flush them from your device, you may do
so by changing the settings on your computer or browser accordingly, in which case you may still use our Site, but
it may interfere with some of its functionality.
## CLICKSTREAM DATA As you use the Internet, a trail of electronic
information is left at each website you visit.
This information, which is sometimes referred to as âclickstream

browsing software you use and the address of the website from which you linked to the Site.

contain any personal data.

as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce our agreements.

previously collected so that it can no longer be used for personal identification and/or anonymize or aggregate your
personal information.

unauthorized acts of third parties.
