 Jobs with eSafety 


 Website accessibility eSafety is committed to ensuring our website information is accessible to everyone.
How can we help?
Accessibility is really important to us.
Please get in touch through our contact us form if you have any issues using the site.
We would like to hear your suggestions on how we can make our content more accessible and inclusive.
Why is accessibility and inclusiveness important?
Everyone has the right to information and services that are easy to access and inclusive of all Australians. 
We aim to ensure our information and services are easy to access and inclusive of everyone, including people with disability, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, Lesbian, gay, bi, trans, queer and/or intersex people, and people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. 
We are committed to improving the accessibility and inclusiveness of our website and understand this involves ongoing consultation and improvement. 
How have we made our website more accessible?
We worked with accessibility experts throughout the design and development of the eSafety website. 
We are committed to constantly improving the accessibility of our website and are working toward Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA compliance. 
Writing style and structure
We have tried to ensure the information on our website is easy to understand and uses inclusive language and terms. 
We have also carefully structured our web pages to ensure that information is easy to find and accessible to people using screen readers and assistive technologies. 
We are committed to ongoing audience research and consultation with key community and representative groups. 
Screen readers
We have developed all pages with a clear distinction between content and design.
This is so screen readers and other accessible browsers can read the site properly. 
Every page starts with a skip link â 'Skip to main content'.
We have tested our pages with a screen reader to ensure alternative text descriptions make sense. 
Browsers and devices
This website works with modern web browsers.
It is fully responsive and automatically adjusts to fit the size and type of device being used to access it â for example, mobiles, tablets and computers. 
Resizing text
You can resize the text on this website.
To zoom in, hold down the Control key (or the Command key on Apple computers) then press the + key.
To zoom out, hold down the Control or Command key then press the - key.
Contrast and colours
We have tested our colour contrasts to ensure they are appropriate for people who have vision impairment. 
Documents&nbsp.
Documents on this website are available in PDF, or Portable Document Format, and DOC (or DOCX) files.
Adobe Acrobat Reader is a popular and free application and browser extension to view PDFs.
This is available as a free download from the Adobe website.
The Accessibility Resource Centre at Adobe provides a number of free tools that can help people who use speech readers to read the content of PDF documents. 
DOC (or DOCX) files are word processing documents, most commonly created and opened in Microsoft Word.
Microsoft also offers a Word Viewer as a free download. 
Some mobile devices may require third-party apps (such as mobile versions of Acrobat Reader) to open or view DOC and PDF files. 
Video
Where possible, we have included closed-captioned and text versions of video.
We are in the process of improving the accessibility of our video content. 
Additional accessibility features

We have included a pause button for rotating carousal images in case you find them distracting â a cookie will remember this for future visits.
We have tested that the site can be tabbed through without the use of a mouse.
 Further assistance If we can assist you in any other way to access our information, please contact us.
If you are deaf or have a hearing or speech impairment, you can contact us through the National Relay Service:

Teletypewriter (TTY) users phone 133 677 and connect to 1800 880 176.
