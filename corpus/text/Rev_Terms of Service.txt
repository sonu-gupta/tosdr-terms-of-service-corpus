Â§1, et seq, that the arbitrator committed errors of law that are material and prejudicial.
The appeal shall be determined upon the written documents submitted by the parties, with no oral argument.
After the appellate rights described in this Section 13(i) have been exercised or waived, the parties shall have no further right to challenge the award.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Customer and Rev may seek injunctive relief and any other equitable remedies from any court of competent jurisdiction to protect such partyâs intellectual property rights, whether in aid of, pending or independently of the resolution of any dispute pursuant to the arbitration procedures set forth in this Section 11(j).
Class and Collective Action Waivers.&nbsp.
Customer and Rev mutually agree that by entering into this Agreement and agreeing to the arbitration provisions set forth herein, both waive their right to have any dispute or claim brought, heard or arbitrated as a class action and/or collective action, and an arbitrator will not have any authority to hear or arbitrate any class and/or collective (âClass Action Waiverâ).&nbsp.
Notwithstanding any other clause contained in the arbitration provision set forth in Section 11(j) or the AAA rules, any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.
The Class Action Waiver will be severable from the arbitration agreement in this Agreement in any case in which (1) the dispute is filed as a class and/or collective action and (2) there is a final judicial determination that all or part of the Class Action Waiver is invalid, unenforceable, unconscionable, void or voidable.
In such case, the class and/or collective action to that extent must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the portion of the Class Action Waiver that is enforceable shall be enforced in arbitration.
No Waiver.
The failure of either party to require strict performance by the other party of any provision hereof shall not affect the full right to require such performance at any time thereafter, nor shall the waiver by either party of a breach of any provision hereof be taken or held to be a waiver of the provision itself.
Any waiver of the provisions of this Agreement, or of any breach or default hereunder, must be set forth in a written instrument signed by the party against which such waiver is to be enforced.
Force Majeure.
Neither party shall be liable for any failure to perform under this Agreement to the extent due to any act of God, fire, casualty, flood, war, strike, lock out, failure of public utilities, injunction or any act, exercise, assertion or requirement of any governmental authority, epidemic, destruction of production facilities, insurrection or any other cause beyond the reasonable control of the party invoking this provision.
