Before registering on the Application, each User must carefully read this End User License Agreement (âEULAâ) as well as the General Terms and Conditions and the rules regarding the Privacy Policy.
The General Terms and Conditions form an integral part of this EULA.
Use of the Yuka App assumes that the User has accepted this entire EULA, including the General Terms and Conditions.
Such acceptance is deemed to be as valid as the Userâs handwritten signature.
The EULA and its appendices are written in French, English and Spanish.
In case of divergence of interpretation, only the French version shall prevail.
Contact email: team@yuka.ioDefinitionsThe following terms have the definitions given:

App: the application Yuka and all of its pages and screens.

Database: the database of products used in the App.

Service: evaluation and recommendation services for food and cosmetic products.

Feature: the digital content or service that can be purchased or subscribed to through an in-app purchase in the App, corresponding to the âmemberâ version or âpremiumâ version.

Publisher: the artificial or natural person responsible for publishing the App and for its content.

User: the mobile device user using the App.

Client: refers to the mobile device user purchasing a Feature in the App.

Store: refers to the online application downloading platform used by the Publisher to publish the App, and used by the User to download the App, namely the Google Play Store and Apple Store.

Score: refers to the overall score obtained by applying the evaluation method developed by the Publisher.PurposeThe main purpose of the App is to inform consumers about the ingredients of commonly sold food and cosmetic products.
The App offers a scoring and recommendation system that analyzes information provided by the products' makers.
The App is published by the company Yuca, which is totally independent.
Yuca has no contractual or financial ties of any kind with the producers and or distributors of the products evaluated by the application.Scoring methodThe food scoring method used by the App includes the following factors:

nutritional balance (60%)
presence of food additives (30%)
whether the product is organic (10%)

For nutritional balance, the scoring method is based on Nutri-Score, a nutritional quality information system for food products developed by SantÃ© Publique France (www.santepubliquefrance.fr).
ï»¿For salt and chocolate, the rating method takes into account additional specific criteria, differentiating from a qualitative or environmental point of view: the extraction or processing method for salt.
the cocoa content and type of fat for chocolate.
The cosmetics scoring method is based on analyzing all of the product's ingredients.
The application evaluates the level of health risk of the ingredients that make up the products.
On the other hand, the application does not evaluate their effectiveness.
Each ingredient is assigned a science-based risk level.
For risk levels have been defined: High (red), moderate (orange), low (yellow), and no risk (green).

The Score assigned by the App constitutes an opinion based on the information present on the product. The terms âexcellentâ, âgoodâ, âpoorâ, and âbadâ apply only to the product's Score under the scoring method developed by the Publisher, as shown in the App.
The terms âhigh riskâ, âmoderate riskâ, âlow riskâ, and âno riskâ apply only to the Publisher's opinion about the corresponding ingredient based on the scientific sources analyzed.
These adjectives do not refer to the product itself or its intrinsic qualities.Premium versionThe App offers the in-app purchase of a Premium version that includes the following Features:


âOfflineâ mode: Allows the services offered by the application to be used without an Internet connection.
This feature does not cover all of the products referenced in the database, only some of them (the most commonly scanned ones).
the âSearchâ feature: Allows the User to search the database of referenced products using keywords (product name, brand, etc.), without needing to scan the product to search for it.
the âFood Preferencesâ feature: Allows the User to customize the app based on their own food preferences.
The App highlights unwanted ingredients in the nutritional facts and recommendations that take those preferences into account.
DatabaseYuca does not guarantee that the Database and the exact composition of the analyzed products are totally reliable.
Yuca does not itself analyze the exact composition of the products.
The information provided by the application relays the data provided by the products' makers.
Composition or detection errors may exist.
It is therefore best to check the packaging and report any errors through the App.
Yuca does not guarantee full detection of the ingredients.
This is because the ingredients present on the packaging may differ from those listed in the App or that the detection of those ingredients has failed.
The User must therefore always check the packaging to be safe.
The Appâs features are not medical advice under any circumstances.Account in the AppCreating an accountA User who creates an account in the App can access it by logging in using the details provided at the time they register and using systems such as third-party social media login buttons.

They are encouraged to use complex passwords.
If a password is forgotten, they can choose a new one.
This password ensures the privacy of the information contained in their account, and the user should therefore refrain from giving or sending it to a third party.

The User alone is responsible for choosing a purchasing a Feature.
