California Do Not Sell My Info

The California Consumer Protection Act (âCCPAâ) requires us to disclose categories of personal information sold to third parties and how to opt-out of sale.
The CCPA defines personal information to include online identifiers, including IP address, cookies IDs, and mobile IDs.
The law also defines a âsaleâ to include simply making data available to third parties.&nbsp.
Because we let advertising and analytics providers collect IP addresses, cookie IDs, mobile IDs through our sites and apps when you use our online services, but do not âsellâ any other types of personal information, we provide our âDo Not Sell My Infoâ disclosures in this section.
Other information related to your rights under the CCPA is contained in the California Rights section of this statement.

We may collect information automatically about users when they visit our site.
This may include details about the userâs browser type and installed extensions, operating system, access times, language, IP address, and referring URLs, along with other similar data.

Cookies are small text files placed on your device to store data that can be recalled by a web server in the same domain that placed the cookie.
The text in a cookie often consists of a string of numbers and letters that uniquely identifies your device, but it can contain other information as well.
We use web beacons (also called single-pixel gifs), for example, to deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage of our site and tell if an email has been opened and acted upon.

Cookie Controls.
Many web browsers accept cookies by default.
Users can usually change their browser's settings to reject and/or to remove many cookies.
Please note also that choosing to reject or remove cookies may prevent certain features or services of our site from working properly.
Since cookie opt-out preferences are also stored in a cookie in a browser, please also note that deleting cookies, using a different browser, or buying a new computer, may require renewal of opt-out choices.
Do Not Track.
Do Not Track (DNT) is a technology which allows users to tell sites they visit that they donât want to be tracked.
It does this by including a special header with each request the browser sends.
Where possible without breaking the functionality of our site, we try to honor Do Not Track headers by attempting to serve only third-party services which themselves promise to honor Do Not Track.
However, because not all our necessary third-party service providers honor Do Not Track and because implementations may change from time to time, we cannot guarantee that we will always be successful in all cases.
While we and others give users the choices described in this policy, there are many ways through which web browser signals and other similar mechanisms can indicate user choice to disable tracking, and we may not be aware of nor honor every such mechanism.
Mobile advertising ID controls.
iOS and Android operating systems provide options to limit tracking and/or reset the advertising IDs.
Email web beacons.
Most email clients have settings which allow you prevent the automatic downloading of images, which will disable web beacons in the email messages you read.
