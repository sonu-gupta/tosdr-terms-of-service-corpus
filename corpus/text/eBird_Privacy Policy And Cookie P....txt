Citizen Science
Our citizen-science projects are designed to benefit the entire scientific research community, which in turn benefits the larger public.
Therefore, if you participate in any Cornell Lab citizen-science projects, you grant the Cornell Lab and its collaborators, permission to use your contributions in any way to further this goal.
We will do our best us to protect your data and your privacy to the extent that it does not impede scientific research.
We ask you to grant us these broad permissions because they allow us to change the legal details by which we keep the data available.
this is important because the legal environment can change and we need to be able to respond without obtaining permission from every single contributor.
eBird includes several ways that you can manage your preferences in terms of how your name appears, and what functionality you would like to appear for other eBird users.
You can adjust that information from My eBird Preferences.
When you submit records to eBird, you authorize us to have our team of regional editors contact you about questions they may have about your observations.
This helps us maintain a high level of data quality so we can use these data for scientific and conservation purposes.
This is limited to official volunteers who help with data quality. Find out more about this process click here. 
Sensitive species
Because a primary goal of eBird is to maintain a universally accessible, centralized database of bird observations, the bird observations you submit are available to all eBird users (eBirders), scientists, and others who are interested in examining the distribution, abundance, and trends of bird species.
eBirders are able to view their personal observations and the observations of others, so please be aware that your observations of sensitive species and their locations will be available to other eBird users.
Taxa on our Sensitive Species list, which can be global or customized by region and date range, are automatically protected so that specific location information is not available to the public but can be used by scientists working to protect those species. See eBirdâs Sensitive Species policy for more information.
When you upload photos, videos, sounds, and other rich media to eBird and the Macaulay Library at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, you also agree to the eBird Media Licensing Agreement.
You must not contribute data to the Cornell Lab that you do not own.
For example, do not submit photos from Flickr or other third party services if you do not hold copyright of those photos.

We also use cloud data hosting service providers in the United States to host the information we collect, and we use technical measures and industry best practices to secure your data.
While we implement safeguards designed to protect your information, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that data, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others.

How long we keep information

How long we keep information we collect about you depends on the type of information, as described in further detail below.

Account information: We retain your account information for as long as your account is active and a reasonable period thereafter in case you decide to re-activate the Services.
We also retain some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations, and to continue to develop and improve our Services.

Information you share on the Services: If your account is deactivated or disabled, some of your information and the content you have provided will remain in order to allow your team members or other users to make full use of the Services.
For example, we continue to display the bird sightings you reported to others users.

Marketing information: If you have elected to receive marketing emails from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences for a reasonable period of time from the date you last expressed interest in our Services, such as when you last opened an email from us.

Below, we describe the tools and processes for making these requests.
You can exercise some of the choices by logging into the Services and using settings available within the Services or your account.
Where the Services are administered for you by an administrator, you may need to contact your administrator to assist with your requests first.
For all other requests, you may contact us as provided in the Contact Us section below to request assistance.

Your request and choices may be limited in certain cases: for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal information about another person, or if you ask to delete information which we or your administrator are permitted by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep.
If you have unresolved concerns, you may have the right to complain to a data protection authority in the country where you live, where you work or where you feel your rights were infringed.

Access and update your information: Our Services give you the ability to access and update certain information about you from within the Service.
For example, you can update your profile information within your profile settings and modify content that contains information about you using the editing tools associated with that content.

If you can deactivate your own account, that setting is available to you in your account settings.
Otherwise, please contact us.
Your information remains visible to other Service users based on your past participation within the Services.
For more information on how to delete your information, see below.

Delete your information: The ability to delete your information is dependent on the Service you used.

If you wish to delete your information in our Services, please contact us, as provided below.
Please note, however, that we may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes, to complete transactions or to comply with our legal obligations.

Request that we stop using your information: In some cases, you may ask us to stop accessing, storing, using and otherwise processing your information where you believe we donât have the appropriate rights to do so.
For example, if you believe a Services account was created for you without your permission or you are no longer an active user, you can request that we delete your account as provided in this policy.
 Where you gave us consent to use your information for a limited purpose, you can contact us to withdraw that consent, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place at the time.
You can also opt out of our use of your information for marketing purposes by contacting us, as provided below.
When you make such requests, we may need time to investigate and facilitate your request.
If there is delay or dispute as to whether we have the right to continue using your information, we will restrict any further use of your information until the request is honored or the dispute is resolved.
