âPersonal Informationâ is information associated with an identifiable individual or household.
Personal Information does not include information about a business or aggregated anonymous information that cannot be associated with a specific individual.
âAlterra Mountain Companyâ, âweâ, âusâ or âourâ refers to Alterra Mountain Company its subsidiaries and certain of its affiliates.
We have an international presence and maintains offices and facilities in multiple jurisdictions throughout the United States and Canada.

This Policy does not apply to information about Alterra Mountain Companyâs employees or to information that is not Personal Information.

PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW IT IS USED

Alterra Mountain Company collects Personal Information during the course of operating our mountain resort adventure, resort hospitality, and real estate businesses.
We use this information to provide you with the best possible service and to meet our reasonable business needs.


(a) We collect your personal information when you purchase a product or service or enroll in a program


When you purchase a product or service, make a reservation or enroll in a program, we collect Personal Information in order to process the transaction and administer the purchase or program.
We may also send you information relating to your purchase, reservation or program.
For example, if you make a reservation at one of our resort locations, we may send you information about the activities, events or offers taking place at the resort around the time of your visit.
The information we may collect and use for these purposes includes but is not limited to your:

name and contact information to identify and communicate with you
payment card information to process transactions
age and/or birth date to ensure appropriate product pricing and know more about who is enjoying our products and services
gender to verify your identity, provide appropriate services, such as rental equipment, and know more about who is enjoying our products and services
biometric data when this information is necessary in connection with the product, service, program or activity that you have requested (for example, we may need gender, height and weight to provide you with appropriate rental equipment)
medical information, such as allergies or medical conditions that we need to be aware if you are participating in lessons or other programs, or if you have dietary restrictions
facial photograph to identify you as a guest
status as the parent or guardian of a minor guest, if applicable
experience preferences (such as, preferred lodging room type)
geographic location to locate ski school participants or other guests who have elected to utilize on-mountain tracking technology while on our mountains, including our Apps that offer on-mountain tracking
transaction history to manage your purchases and reservations and to learn more about how you interact with our products

In some cases you may provide us with Personal Information relating to a family member or another individual.
By providing us with Personal Information relating to an individual other than yourself, you represent that you have their consent to provide us with their Personal Information for the purposes described in this Policy.


(b) We collect your Personal Information when you visit our resorts, use our pass products and tickets, and download and use our web applications (âAppsâ)


When you purchase or use our pass products and tickets, we may collect information regarding your geographic location, activities and purchases while you are at Alterra Mountain Company resorts.
Our pass products and tickets use either handheld scanner or RFID (radio frequency identification) technology.
Through the use of this technology, we may be able to collect limited information regarding your location at the resort, including the lifts that you ride, and depending on whether you have a payment card linked to your pass product, other commercial transactions that you complete at one of our retail or restaurant location.
We use this information to understand how our guests use our resorts and to understand your personal preferences.
Depending on your marketing preferences, we may also use your Personal Information to send you offers, invitations or promotions relating to our resorts, products, services or programs that we believe may be of interest to you.
For example, we may monitor your commercial transactions or browsing habits on our websites or at our resort destinations which may influence the personalized special offers and promotions that we send to you.
Some of our pass products grant you access to ski resorts that are not owned or operated by Alterra Mountain Company (each a âPass Product Resortâ).
When you visit a Pass Product Resort, the Pass Product Resort will scan or otherwise record your attendance at that resort destination using RFID technology (radio frequency identification), handheld scanners, or another method which allows the Pass Product Resort and us to record your usage activity of the product.
Both Alterra Mountain Company and the Pass Product Resort may collect additional information from you depending on your transaction activity at the resort destination.
We may also share your Personal Information with a Pass Product Resort(s) to administer your pass product, better understand how you use our products, and learn about how we can improve the guest experience.
Also, when you transact directly with a Pass Product Resort, that resortâs privacy policy will apply.
For example, if you book lodging accommodations or a ski school lesson directly with a Pass Product Resort, that resortâs privacy policy will apply to that transaction.
Several of our resorts use GPS tracking technology in connection with their ski and ride school programs in order to track and locate students on the mountain.
The GPS tracking technology is owned and operated by a third-party service provider which may be provided certain information to provide the tracking service and to operate the websites on which you and/or your family members can track their day on the mountain.
Some of our resorts and products have Apps available for download to your mobile device.
The download, installation and use of our Apps will allow you convenient access to great experiences our resorts have to offer, including the ability to purchase pass products, lift tickets, track and share your performance, create a profile, create social groups with whom you can share information, access mountain wayfinding, weather and lift info, and receive in-App notifications (collectively, the âApps Servicesâ).
If you access our Apps, we may be able to collect your Personal Information, including your geographic location, activities, and purchase history.
We may also associate the information collected through your use of the Apps to your customer profile, including your pass product and pass scan data.
The Apps automatically collect detailed location and navigation information, in the form of GPS signals from the mobile device on which you have installed and activated the App (âApp Location Informationâ).
Whenever you open, use or interact with the App Services, we use your App Location Information (e.g., latitude and longitude) to tailor the App Services experience to your current location.
We also use your App Location Information to provide certain App Services, including to send you notifications of friends, events, or other relevant information that are near to you.
If you have âbackground locationâ turned on, the Apps may, from time to time, tell us about your deviceâs location even if you are not directly interacting with the App.
We may use various technologies to determine your App Location Information, such as location services of the applicable operating system or browser, GPS, Bluetooth, i-Beacon, RFID, and sensor data from your devices, along with nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers, and other technologies to determine your mobile devicesâ approximate location.
The Apps may also share your App Location Information on a map or by communicating your distance and general direction to other users.
You should only share your App Location Information with those that you trust.
You understand that the nature of location-based services is such that your App Location Information is available to you and other users, and that we cannot control what you or other users, who receive this information when using the App or the App Services, will do with it.
If you do not wish for the Apps to track your App Location Information, you should turn off the App Location Information tracking feature in the App settings menu.
If you turn off the App Location Information feature, some features of the App and App Services cannot be provided without using this standard technology.
For example, the App Services use your location and route information to create a detailed location history of your journeys made when using the App and App Services.
The Apps use this history to offer the App Services to you, to improve the quality of the App Services it offers to you and to all of its users and to improve the accuracy of its mapping and navigation data.
You may be able to take part in certain activities within our App Services that let you communicate or share information not just with us, but also with other users.
These include:

sending private or group messages or content to other users
chatting with other users
sharing performance metrics, such as your total days skied, vertical feet skied, and number of chairlift rides
sharing your skill-level, home mountain, and/or personal preferences
sharing photos or drawings with other users.

We record and store archives of this data on servers to provide these features as well as to protect our rights and property in connection with our App Services and you acknowledge and agree to our storage of this data.
At certain of our resort destinations we may use video surveillance for the safety and security of our guests, employees and property.
We will retain video recordings for as long as reasonably necessary for these purposes.
Our resorts may also use live stream webcams in outdoor public areas either on mountain or in the base village area.
These live web cam feeds can be accessed by anyone via an internet connection.


(c) We collect your Personal Information when you submit an inquiry, complete a guest survey, or provide feedback


We may collect your name, contact information and comments or questions when you submit an inquiry or comment, or otherwise provide us with feedback about our business.
We may also collection information related to your experience at one of our mountain destinations or using our products or services in a guest satisfaction survey.
These surveys may include optional questions regarding your income, race/ethnicity, or gender which, if answered, help us to learn more about our customers and how we can improve our business and public engagement in snow sports.
We may use this information to respond to your question and to improve our business, products, services and programs.


(d) We collect your Personal Information when you participate in a marketing initiative or create an online account


If you choose to create an online account profile, we may collect your name, contact information, age, gender, birth date, personal image, username and password and other information that you choose to provide (such as your preferences).
We may also collect your name, contact information, age and/or date of birth if you decide to participate in a marketing initiative such as a contest, sweepstakes or other promotion.
In some cases we may also ask you specific questions about your preferences or for feedback on our business, products, services and programs.
We use this information to administer the promotion, including contacting and announcing winners (where applicable), to improve our business, products, services and programs, and for marketing initiatives, such as offers or promotions relating to our resorts, products, services, or programs that we believe may be of interest to you, depending on your marketing preferences.


(e) We collect your Personal Information when you call our call center or we call you


We may record calls into and out of our call centers for the purposes of maintaining accurate records and for quality assurance and training purposes.
