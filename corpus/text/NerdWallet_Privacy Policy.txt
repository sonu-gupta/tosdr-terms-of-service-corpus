We may collect information directly from you when you use our Services â for example, when you register to become a member, when you request to prequalify for a third-party credit card or loan product, when you request your TransUnion credit report and/or score, when you link your third-party financial accounts, when you transfer money, or when you fill out calculators, forms or other fields on our Site.
In such cases, we may ask you to provide us with one or more of the following pieces of information:

Please note: We do not store your Social Security number, nor do we store your third-party financial account ID or passwords.
