Disclosures, Sharing and Onward Transfers of Your Information

Who does SailPoint share my Personal Information with?

We may disclose your Personal Information to the following categories of recipients:

to our group companies, Affiliates, third party services providers and partners who provide data processing services to us (for example, to support the delivery of, provide functionality on, or help to enhance the security of our Website, Applications, Third Party Services or Services), or who otherwise process Personal Information for purposes that are described in this Privacy Statement or otherwise notified to you when we collect your Personal Information;
to your employer or hiring entity, if you participated in training or received certification through your employer or hiring entity;
to the third parties that provide the Third Party Services for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement and each third partyâs privacy statement;
to any competent law enforcement body, regulatory, government agency, court or other third party where we believe disclosure is necessary (i) as a matter of applicable law or regulation, (ii) to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights and property, or (iii) to protect your rights, property or safety or those of any other person;
to an actual or potential buyer (and its agents and advisers) in connection with any actual or proposed purchase, merger or acquisition of assets or any part of our business.
and
to any other person with your consent to the disclosure.



Finally, we also share aggregated, anonymized or statistical information about you (and your use of our Websites, Services and Applications) with others for a variety of purposes, including to improve our products and services.&nbsp.
Such information is not Personal Information and is not subject to the restrictions set forth in this Privacy Statement.

International data transfers

Your Personal Information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident.
These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective).
Specifically, our Website and Application servers are located in the United States, and our third party service providers and partners operate around the world.
This means that when we collect your Personal Information we may process it in any of these countries.
However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your Personal Information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Statement.

Privacy Shield

Where Personal Information originates from the European Economic Area or Switzerland and is transferred to the United States, SailPoint agrees to comply with the EU-U.S.
and Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield Frameworks, respectively.
SailPoint makes an affirmative commitment to adhere to EU-U.S.
and Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield Principles (the âPrivacy Shield Principlesâ).
The U.S.
subsidiaries of SailPoint Technologies, Inc., as listed here, also adhere to the EU-U.S.
and Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield Principles.
With respect to such Personal Information, to the extent of any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Statement and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles govern.
More information on the EU-U.S.
and Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield programs can be found at https://www.privacyshield.gov.
In the context of an onward transfer, SailPoint has responsibility for processing Personal Information it receives under Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf.
Where required by Privacy Shield, we enter into written agreements with those third-party agents and service providers requiring them to provide the same level of protection Privacy Shield requires and limiting their use of the data to the specified services provided on our behalf.
We take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that third-party agents and service providers process EEA and Swiss Personal Information in accordance with our Privacy Shield obligations and to stop and remediate any unauthorized processing.
Under certain circumstances, we may remain liable for the acts of our third party agents or service providers who perform services on our behalf for their handling of EEA or Swiss Personal Data that we transfer to them.
On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) issued a judgment which made the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework no longer a valid mechanism to comply with EU data protection requirements when transferring personal data from the European Union to the United States.
Following the CJEUâs decision, the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner also concluded that the Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield no longer provides a valid mechanism for the transfer of personal data from Switzerland to the United States.
However, SailPoint continues to honor its commitments under the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework, along with reliance on alternative mechanisms to legitimize international personal data transfers from the European Union or Switzerland to the United States, such as by implementing standard contractual clauses. Legal basis for processing Personal Information (EEA and Swiss visitors only)
If you are a User or Visitor from the European Economic Area or Switzerland, our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Information described above will depend on the Personal Information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
However, we will normally collect Personal Information from you only (i) where we need the Personal Information to perform a contract with you, (ii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests (e.g., responding to your requests and enquiries via our SailBot tool) and not overridden by your rights, or (iii) where we have your consent to do so.
If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your Personal Information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the âContact Informationâ heading below [Contact Information]. Security
Wherever your Personal Information may be held within SailPoint or on its behalf, SailPoint takes reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the Personal Information that you share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure.
SailPoint trains its employees on data handling practices.
In addition, SailPoint and its business partners enter into confidentiality agreements which require that care and precautions be taken to prevent loss, misuse, or disclosure of your Personal Information.
However, while we attempt to ensure the integrity and security of Personal Information, please note that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.
Therefore, although SailPoint complies with its legal obligations in respect of the security of your personal data we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Data retention
We retain Personal Information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your Personal Information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your Personal Information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. Your data protection rights and choices

If you wish to make a request to access, correct, update or delete your Personal Information, you can do so at any time by contacting us using the contact details provided under the âContact Informationâ heading below [Contact Information].&nbsp.
If you are a California resident, see below for additional information.

You have the right to opt-out of marketing communications we send you at any time.
You can exercise this right by clicking on the âunsubscribeâ or âopt-outâ link in the marketing e-mails we send you.
To opt-out of other forms of marketing (such as postal marketing or telemarketing), then please contact us using the contact details provided under the âContact Informationâ heading below [Contact Information].



If you are a resident of the European Economic Area or Switzerland, you can also:

object to processing of your Personal Information, ask us to restrict processing of your Personal Information or request portability of your Personal Information.
Again, you can exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details provided under the âContact Informationâ heading below [Contact Information].
Similarly, if we have collected and process your Personal Information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time.
Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your Personal Information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your Personal Information.
For more information, please contact your local data protection authority.



We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws. California Residentsâ Rights
If you are a California resident whose information is covered by the California Consumer Privacy Act (the âCCPAâ), you may have certain rights regarding Personal Information we may have collected about you, as described in this below.&nbsp.

Those rights include (a) the right to access specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about you in the 12 months prior to receipt of a verified request, and (b) the right to know about the categories of Personal Information we collected about you, the categories of sources from which that information was collected, the purpose for collection, and/or the categories of Personal Information we have shared with third parties and the categories of those third parties, all within the 12 months preceding your verified request.&nbsp.

You may also have the right to request deletion of Personal Information we have collected about you that is covered by the CCPA, subject to various exceptions in the CCPA.&nbsp.

These rights to access, know about, or delete Personal Information do not apply to Personal Information we may have collected in the course of certain business-to-business transactions or in the human resources context, consistent with the CCPA.
 
We do not sell the Personal Information of California residents.

Submitting CCPA requests 

You may submit a request for Personal Information consistent with this section by emailing us at privacy@sailpoint.com or 1-877-378-1220.
Depending on the nature of your request, we may ask you for information that we already have on file to verify your request and identity. 
Please note that you may designate an agent to submit requests on your behalf.&nbsp.
Any such agent will have to verify their identity and we will require separate verifiable confirmation from you that you have authorized the agent to act on your behalf.
 

Non-discrimination

We are committed to complying with the law.
If you exercise any of the rights explained in this Privacy Statement, we will continue to treat you fairly.


We are a CCPA Service Provider


SailPoint primarily operates as a âservice provider,â as that term is defined in the CCPA, for its customers.&nbsp.
This means SailPoint primarily collects and/or processes Personal Information on behalf of its customers, for customersâ business purposes, pursuant to written agreements.&nbsp.
As a service provider, we do not use, disclose or retain Personal Information collected in its capacity as a service provider other than is necessary to perform the services for its customers as described in their agreements.&nbsp.

If we receive a request to access,
know about, or delete Personal Information we have collected in our capacity as
a service provider, we will inform the requestor that we will not be responding
because we are a service provider, and recommend you place your request
directly to the business.&nbsp.
 Privacy Policies of Third Party Services and Third Party Websites
Our Website, Applications, and Third Party Services may contain or reference links to non-SailPoint websites (including the websites of the providers of Third Party Services).
SailPoint has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies (if any), or practices of any third party website or any link contained in a third party website.

The collection, use and retention of your data by such third parties is governed solely by such third partiesâ respective privacy policies, and SailPoint has no control over how such third parties use your data. Updates to the Privacy Statement
SailPoint may amend this Privacy Statement from time to time by posting a revised Privacy Statement on our Website.
If SailPoint makes material changes to this Privacy Statement, SailPoint will endeavor to notify you of such changes (e.g., by email or an alert on any Website for a period of time).
However, regularly reviewing this page is the best method to ensure you are always aware of the information SailPoint collects, how it is used and under what circumstances.
You can see when this Privacy Statement was last updated by checking the âlast updatedâ date displayed at the top of this Privacy Statement. Childrenâs Personal Information Policy
SailPoint does not knowingly solicit or sell any Personal Information from children under the age of 16.
