IMPORTANT: PLEASE CAREFULLY READ THE FOLLOWING VISA SOLUTION TERMS OF SERVICE ("TERMS").
YOU HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO ALL OF THESE TERMS IF YOU HAVE REGISTERED IN THE VISA SOLUTION OR ACTIVATED A CARD FOR THE VISA SOLUTION.
THESE TERMS REPLACE ALL PRIOR TERMS IN RESPECT TO THE VISA SOLUTION.
1.
The Visa Solution
The Visa Solution is operated by Visa U.S.A.
Inc.
(âVisaâ).
Contact information for Visa is included under Contact Us below.
As used in these Terms, the term "Visa Solution" shall mean all of the following: all Visa Click to Pay and/or Visa Checkout features, functionality and services, now available or added in the future, whether branded as Visa Click to Pay, Visa Checkout or a different name, and whether available through the Visa Solution website or mobile site as operated as a domain or subdomain ("Website") or through an application or functionality offered by an issuing bank or payment institution, merchant, or other third party (collectively, "Services").
the logos, designs, text, images, videos, graphics, software and other content and materials of Visa or its licensors available through the Visa Solution, and the selection and arrangement thereof (collectively, "Content").
and Visa's hardware, software and networks associated with making the Visa Solution available to you (collectively, the "Visa Solution System").

The Visa Solution offers you (i) the ability to store payment account and other related information such as e-mail address, mobile phone number, and billing and shipping addresses ("Card Details") for your Visa credit, debit and reloadable prepaid cards and other cards or payment methods that Visa has decided are eligible to be used with the Visa Solution ("Eligible Cards").
and (ii) the ability to use the Visa Solution to share your Card Details with merchants, or other third parties, that display the Click to Pay icon where Visa is accepted or that display the Visa Checkout mark, to allow them to process a transaction.
Visa may automatically update certain Card Details such as card number and expiration date, as provided by the financial institution or other entity which issued your Eligible Card(s) (âIssuerâ).
Your Issuer may provide additional information about your Eligible Card(s), such as the availability of rewards points, installments options, and other Eligible Card(s) benefits.
If so, we present this information to you in the Visa Solution as-is, as received from the Issuer of your Eligible Card.
If you have any questions about this information, please contact your Issuer.&nbsp.
Where applicable, Visa will process your information to determine if you are eligible for these options or benefits, and to display these to you.
When you use the Visa Solution, we will transmit your Card Details to the merchant, or other applicable third party, in order to allow them to process the transaction.
Visa may generate a numerical surrogate of your Visa Eligible Card payment account number (a token) to be used in order to help protect your Eligible Cards.
You agree that the merchant or other applicable third party can transmit information about the transaction to the applicable network for your Eligible Card and that your transaction will be paid for using the Eligible Card you have selected.
You acknowledge that the Card Details stored or provided through use of the Visa Solution are provided by you or, in certain jurisdictions, on your behalf by your Issuer or a merchant or third party, and contain personal financial information.
You may only use Eligible Cards in connection with the Visa Solution if your Issuer regards you as the cardholder or authorized user and your name is shown on the Eligible Card.
You acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the Card Details and other information you store with the Visa Solution or provide through use of the Visa Solution.
You must only use valid email addresses and phone numbers owned or controlled by you.
Although Visa may perform certain validation checks for Card Details for Visa cards, Visa is not responsible for the accuracy of Card Details or the other information you provide, including whether Card Details are current and up-to-date.

The Visa Solution is not a bank or payment account and does not offer any credit to you or a merchant.
Any transaction that you make using the Visa Solution will be reflected in the account which relates to the Eligible Card you use for the transaction.
Payment of that account is solely a matter between you and the Issuer of the Eligible Card.
2.
Important Notice About Your Transactions
WHILE THE VISA SOLUTION HELPS FACILITATE THE TRANSACTION, VISA IS NOT A PARTY TO THE TRANSACTION AND THE PAYMENT TO OR FROM A MERCHANT IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE VISA SOLUTION, INCLUDING THE PURCHASE OR RETURN OF GOODS OR SERVICES, IS SOLELY BETWEEN YOU AND THE MERCHANT.
IF YOU REQUIRE A REFUND OR REVERSAL OF ANY TRANSACTION COMPLETED USING THE VISA SOLUTION, YOU MUST CONTACT THE APPLICABLE MERCHANT AND/OR THE ISSUER OF THE ELIGIBLE CARD YOU USED FOR THE TRANSACTION.
PLEASE REMEMBER THAT VISA IS NOT A PARTY TO THE TRANSACTION, AND THUS VISA IS NOT ABLE TO RESOLVE ANY SUCH ISSUES THAT YOU MAY HAVE WITH THE TRANSACTION.
IF YOU HAVE A DISPUTE WITH A MERCHANT ABOUT A TRANSACTION MADE IN CONNECTION WITH THE VISA SOLUTION, YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR SETTLING THE DISPUTE DIRECTLY WITH THE MERCHANT OR VIA YOUR ISSUER.
DUE TO HOW THE VISA SOLUTION FUNCTIONS, VISA IS NOT A PARTY TO THE TRANSACTION.

3.
Service Terms
The Visa Solution may not be available to all Eligible Cards.
Furthermore, Visa may, in its sole discretion, remove Eligible Cards from the Visa Solution or prevent Eligible Cards from being activated for the Visa Solution, and Visa may also revise at any time the eligibility of specific or general credit, debit and reloadable prepaid cards and other cards or payment methods that constitute Eligible Cards.
4.

(i) residents of one of the following jurisdictions: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China (mainland and Hong Kong), Colombia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, Poland, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, or the United States (including its territories), as each jurisdiction is made available (the "Eligible Jurisdictions");

If your new location is not an Eligible Jurisdiction, you can re-register when the Visa Solution becomes available in your new location.

5.
Registration and Security
If you choose to register in or activate an Eligible Card for the Visa Solution, you agree to provide us with true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself and update us if there are changes to the information.
To the fullest extent permissible by applicable law, you acknowledge and agree that Visa will have no liability associated with or arising from your failure to maintain accurate information with Visa, including your failure to receive important information and updates about the Visa Solution.
If Visa has reasonable grounds to suspect that any information you provided to us is untrue, inaccurate or incomplete, Visa may suspend or terminate your registration in or use of the Visa Solution and refuse any and all current or future use of the Visa Solution (or any portion thereof) by you.
As a part of your registration, you are required to establish a username and in some markets may be required to establish a password.
These pieces of data are used to authenticate you when you use the Visa Solution.
If you are required to establish a password, for your protection, you should choose a password that is unique to the Visa Solution, and memorize your username and password and not keep notation of your password on or with your personal computer, tablet, mobile device or other device used to access the Visa Solution.
You are responsible for protecting the confidentiality of your username and password(s), if any.
In addition, if you choose to be remembered on your device or browser, or link your use of the Visa Solution with a digital wallet, on one or more device(s), you are responsible for protecting the safety of and access to such device(s).
It is important that you do so since we are not responsible for any losses you incur as a result of unauthorized use of your Eligible Card and, depending on the circumstances, your Issuer may hold you responsible for unauthorized use of your Eligible Card account.
You agree to notify Visa immediately of any unauthorized use of your username, password, if applicable, or Eligible Card in the Visa Solution, or if your device(s) on which youâve chosen to be remembered, or linked your use of the Visa Solution with a digital wallet, has been lost or stolen or otherwise suffered unauthorized access, or any other actual or potential security breach relating to your use of the Visa Solution.
Visa reserves the right to remove your Eligible Cards from, or suspend or terminate your use of, the Visa Solution and/or, if you have a password, require you to change your password, if Visa believes it is no longer secure.
You are responsible for use of your Eligible Cards in the Visa Solution and for ensuring that use of or access to the Visa Solution complies fully with these Terms.
You acknowledge that Visa may send a one-time passcode to your email and/or mobile phone to verify it's you when you use the Visa Solution.
We regularly review the security measures for the Visa Solution.
However, we cannot guarantee that information you transmit via the Internet is entirely secure.
6.
Cardholder Agreements
These Terms do not amend or otherwise modify any agreement with your Issuer in respect of an Eligible Card ("Cardholder Agreement").
In the event of any inconsistency between these Terms and your Cardholder Agreement, these Terms govern as to the relationship between you and Visa solely with respect to the Visa Solution, and your Cardholder Agreement with your Issuer governs the relationship between you and your Issuer.
You are responsible for ensuring that your use of the Visa Solution complies with any Cardholder Agreement.

h.
Dispute Resolution &amp.
Governing Law.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, you and Visa agree that:


(1.) if you are a resident of an Eligible Jurisdiction other than those in (2.) below, the following governing law and arbitration provision applies:

THIS SECTION CONTAINS AN ARBITRATION PROVISION.
PLEASE READ THIS PROVISION CAREFULLY.
IT PROVIDES THAT ANY CLAIM RELATING TO THE VISA SOLUTION OR THESE TERMS SHALL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION.
IN ARBITRATION NEITHER YOU NOR VISA WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN COURT, OR TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL ON THE CLAIMS.
CLAIMS MAY BE ARBITRATED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.
PRE-HEARING DISCOVERY RIGHTS AND POST-HEARING APPEAL RIGHTS WILL BE LIMITED, BUT THE ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS PERMITTED UNDER THESE TERMS.

Any dispute, cause of action, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the Visa Solution or these Terms, including the formation, interpretation, breach, performance, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity of these Terms, the validity and enforcement of this provision, and the determination of the scope or applicability of the agreement to arbitrate (referred to in this section h(1) as a "Dispute") that can be subject to arbitration, shall be resolved exclusively pursuant to the process and arbitration clause set out in this section.
Any Disputes between you and Visa shall be resolved through binding arbitration.
except that, if you are a US resident, you may assert claims in small claims court (if your claims qualify).
This arbitration clause only applies to Disputes with Visa regarding the Visa Solution.
If you have a dispute with your Eligible Card Issuer you must resolve that dispute with your Issuer.

Any arbitration between you and Visa shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures if you reside in the United States and JAMSâ International Arbitration Rules if you reside outside the United States, to the extent that those rules do not conflict with this provision.
You may obtain a copy of these rules by contacting JAMS at 1-800-352-5267, by writing to JAMS at 620 Eighth Avenue, 34th Floor, New York, NY 10018 or online at www.jamsadr.com or www.jamsinternational.com/.

ANY CLAIM SHALL BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.
THIS MEANS THAT BOTH YOU AND VISA ARE PROHIBITED FROM JOINING OR CONSOLIDATING CLAIMS IN ARBITRATION BY OR AGAINST OTHERS UNLESS BOTH YOU AND VISA AGREE OTHERWISE IN WRITING, AND YOU AND VISA ARE PROHIBITED FROM ARBITRATING ANY CLAIMS AS A REPRESENTATIVE OR MEMBER OF A CLASS.
BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND VISA ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
The arbitration will take place before one arbitrator.
The arbitration shall (i) be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration.
and (ii) not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties.
Residents of the Eligible Jurisdictions in the Middle East shall arbitrate in the Dubai International Financial Centre unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties.
The arbitrator will be mutually agreed upon by you and Visa.
If you and Visa cannot agree on an arbitrator, the arbitrator will be appointed according to JAMS procedures.
If for any reason a Dispute proceeds in court rather than in arbitration you and Visa both waive any right to a jury trial.
You may elect to hire an attorney, but are not required to do so.
Each party will be responsible for its own attorney fees and costs, unless awarded by the arbitrator under applicable law.
The party that initiates the arbitration will pay the filing fee (unless otherwise dictated by JAMS due to a finding of hardship).
Visa will advance all other administration, case management and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration, through payment directly to JAMS.
At the end of the arbitration, the fees paid by Visa may be allocated between you and Visa at the direction of the arbitrator in compliance with JAMS procedures.
All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision.
Any decision of the arbitrator shall be final.
Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.
Visaâs liability is limited as described in Section 13 above, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.
These Terms and the rights of the parties hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware exclusive of conflict or choice of law rules.
If the arbitration provision in this section is found to be unenforceable, or the waiver of class action rights is found to be unenforceable for any reason in a case in which class action allegations have been made, then the governing law and forum selection provisions described in (2.) below shall apply.
The remainder of this section applies to US residents:
The arbitrator cannot award punitive or exemplary damages, except as may be required by statute, or any pre-award interest.
nor may the arbitrator award any incidental, indirect or consequential damages, including damages for lost profits or harm suffered by third parties.
Any relief afforded cannot affect other Visa Solution users.
The parties acknowledge that these Terms evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce.
Notwithstanding the provision in the preceding paragraph with respect to applicable substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the Terms and this section shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C., Secs.
1-16).

(2.) if you are a resident of (i) Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Dominican Republic or an Eligible Jurisdiction in Europe, (ii) any Eligible Jurisdiction in which the arbitration provision in paragraph (1.) above is found to be unenforceable, or (iii) any other Eligible Jurisdiction where the waiver of class action rights is found to be unenforceable for any reason in a case in which class action allegations have been made, then the following shall apply: (x) any disputes, claims or causes of action arising out of or in connection with these Terms or the Visa Solution will be governed by and construed under the laws of the Eligible Jurisdiction of your residence.
and (y) any disputes, claims or causes of action arising out of or in connection with these Terms or the Visa Solution shall be resolved within the competent civil courts residing within such Eligible Jurisdiction.
Any mandatory consumer protection law remains applicable.



i.
Assignment.
You may not assign these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Visa's prior written consent.
Visa reserves the right to assign these Terms, and the rights and obligations hereunder, to any third party without notice to or consent from you.
Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will be binding on, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable against you and your respective successors and assigns.
You may terminate your use of the Visa Solution at any time, including if you are not happy with our assignment of these Terms.
