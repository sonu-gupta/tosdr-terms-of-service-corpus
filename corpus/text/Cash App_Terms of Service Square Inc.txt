If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 18, any Dispute, to the extent arising out or of connection with the Payment Services, may only be resolved in accordance with Section 38 of the Payment Terms.
