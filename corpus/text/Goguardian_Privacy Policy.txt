Data Controller vs.
Processor.
Our Legal Bases for Using Your Information
Under applicable law, GoGuardian is considered the "data controller" of information from or about our Website visitors.
In other words, GoGuardian is responsible for deciding how to collect, use, share, and disclose this information.
The laws of some jurisdictions such as the laws of the European Union ("EU") require companies to tell you about about the legal ground that they rely on for using, sharing, or disclosing your information.
To the extent those laws apply, our legal grounds are as follows:



Contractual Commitments:
 We may use, share, or disclose information to honor our contractual commitments to you.
For example, to comply with our Website Terms, which you accept by browsing our otherwise using our Website.


With Your Consent:
 Where required by law, and in some other cases, we use, share, or disclose information on the basis of your consent.


Legitimate Interests:
 In many cases, we use, share, or disclose information on the ground that it furthers our legitimate business interests in ways that are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the affected individuals, such as customer service, certain promotional activities, analyzing and improving our business, providing security for our Website, preventing fraud, and managing legal issues.


Legal Compliance:
 We need to use, share, and disclose information in certain ways to comply with our legal obligations.

How Long We Keep Information
We generally retain information for so long as it may be relevant to the purposes above.
To dispose of any personal information, we may anonymize it, delete it or take other appropriate steps.
Information may persist in copies made for backup and business continuity purposes for an additional time period of time.
How We Protect Your Information
GoGuardian takes the security and privacy of your data very seriously.
For these reasons, GoGuardian has implemented various technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to protect your information.
These safeguards vary depending on the sensitivity of the information at issue.
GoGuardian is committed to preventing unauthorized access to our systems and data, and will investigate any possible occurrence.
In the event of a breach of personal data, GoGuardian will comply with all relevant breach laws.
Your Choices
In addition to the rights and choices identified below with respect to specific jurisdictions, you have certain rights and choices with respect to your information such as:

At this time, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals.

We will consider all of your requests and provide our response within the time period stated by applicable law.
Please note, however, that certain information may be exempt from such requests in some circumstances, which may include needing to continue processing your information for our legitimate interests or to comply with a legal obligation.

 Effective January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act (âCCPAâ) requires us to provide you with information about how we collect, use, and share your âpersonal informationâ (as defined in the CCPA).
We describe the categories of information we collect, our business purposes for collecting such information, the sources and uses of such information and the entities to which we share such information through this Website Privacy Policy.



CCPA Rights:
 Specifically, if you are a California resident and consistent with California law, you (or your authorized agent acting on behalf of you) may annually request that we:

If you would like additional information regarding your legal rights under California law or would like to exercise any of them, please contact us at privacy@goguardian.com


No Sale of Personal Information:
 The CCPA sets forth certain obligations for businesses that âsellâ personal information.
