WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE DO YieldLift is an advertising exchange.
YieldLift is an advertising exchange, a web-based service that enables websites, apps and advertisers to market, sell and buy digital ad space.
YieldLift helps demand side platforms, advertising agencies and brands (âDemand Partnersâ) buy digital ad space and helps ad networks, website and app publishers (âPublishersâ) generate revenue by selling available ad space.
The decision to sell or purchase ad space between Publishers and Demand Partners happens through an automated, software-based process called "real-time bidding" where multiple advertisers bid on places to show their ads.
Our technology supports real-time bidding.
The entities that work with YieldLift may have their own policies that govern how they collect, use, and share data, and may differ from YieldLiftâs policies.
Below weâve listed the entities we work with (with links to their privacy policies) as of the date indicated at the top of this notice.
Please review these policies, and those of the websites and apps you visit and use, to become familiar with their data practices and to learn about any data collection, sharing and use choices that you may have.

HOW AND WHY WE PROCESS PERSONAL DATA We pass along information for advertising purposes.
If you visit a Publisher that works with YieldLift, and the Publisher sends out a request to show an ad, we pass along that request to Demand Partners.
The request typically includes information about the ad environment that helps Demand Partners decide whether or not to serve an ad.
Some of this information (for example, your IP address) may identify a particular computer or device and may be considered personal information under some data privacy laws, including the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (âPIPEDAâ), the California Consumer Privacy Act (âCCPAâ), the California Online Privacy Protection Act (âCalOPPAâ) and the European Unionâs General Data Protection Regulation (âGDPRâ).
YieldLift uses and discloses information for our commercial and business purposes, as identified in the CCPA, which include:

Providing our services, including enabling Publishers and Demand Partners to sell and buy digital advertising inventory.
Other business purposes, including:

Providing advertising or marketing services;
Auditing related to our interactions with you;
Legal compliance;
Detecting and protecting against security incidents, fraud, and illegal activity;
Debugging;
Performing services (for us or our service providers) such as account servicing and analytics;
Internal operations;
Activities to maintain and improve our services.
and
Other one-time uses.



YieldLift does not retain any personal information.

We facilitate the exchange of information for ad buying and placement purposes.

YieldLift does not build user profiles of any kind.

 We process your data based under the following legal bases under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): 


Legitimate Interests: We may process your data when it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests, which are to facilitate data exchange for advertising purposes.

Performance of a Contract: Where we have entered into a contract with a partner, we may process personal information to fulfill the terms of our contract.

Legal Obligations: We may disclose your information where we are legally required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena (including in response to public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements).


Vital Interests: We may disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved 
 2.1.
Pixels When you visit a Publisher that works with YieldLift, we may place a tracking pixel on your browser in order to monitor the performance of an ad.
The information we receive from the pixel counts impressions and other information about the ad.
We do not monitor you or your behavior using this pixel.

A pixel is a small bit of HTML code which is loaded when a user visits a website or opens an email.
With a tracking pixel, we enable our Demand Partners to access information about whether an ad was viewed or clicked on.
 3.0.
TYPES OF DATA WE PROCESS YieldLift facilitates information exchange.
To sell ad space, Publishers may pass information to Demand Partners and other entities through YieldLiftâs technology.
For example, when you visit a website or app and a Publisher working with YieldLift sends us a request to show you an ad, we pass along certain information about the ad space, you and your device to Demand Partners to help inform their decision to serve an ad.

YieldLift does not retain personal information or apply automated decision-making tools to this information, which typically includes: 

Bid Request Data (or âbidstream dataâ), advertising bid request in a specified format, such as oRTB (e.g., adID, DealID, cookie ID, geolocation, website/app, user agent string, device type, carrier name, campaign ID).
User Session Data (or âclickstream dataâ): The end-userâs âjourneyâ on a website or app collected by a server (e.g., IP address, referring URL, exit URL, actions taken, cookie preferences, device information).

Data passed through, not accessed, by YieldLift from its partners may also include: 

Cross-Device Data (or âDevice Graph Dataâ): Data that displays the relationship between various device identifiers to an individual or household, often used for better retargeting and frequency capping.
Unique online identifiers (e.g.
IP address, cookies, mobile advertising identifiers such as Apple IDFA and Android Advertising ID)
Information about your browsing behavior on a Publisherâs website or app (e.g.
domain or app store URL or bundle ID, category code associated with website or app, referring website address, date/time of visit, âclick throughâ data) 
Ad reporting or delivery data (e.g.
size/type of ad, ad impressions, location/format of ad, data about interactions with the ad)
Precise location data (if you have enabled location services on your device)
Interest segments (i.e.
inferred information on the behavior or likely interests associated with you)
Retargeting data (i.e.
data indicating previous interest in a product or website)
Information that may be anonymized or pseudonymized includes, but is not limited to, clickstream data, search history, analytics, hardware/software type, page views, serving domains, internet service provider, and demographic information.

Other data that can be passed in the request from Publisher to Demand Partner to inform the ad-buying decision (which can include health or financial-related information).
