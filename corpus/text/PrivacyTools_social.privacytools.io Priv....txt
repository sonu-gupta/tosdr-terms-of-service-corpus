Other licenses you apply to content you submit, such as Creative Commons licenses, may continue after your content is removed.
Those licenses may give others, or the company itself, the right to share your content through the forum again.
Others who receive content you submit to the service may violate the terms on which you license your content.
You agree that the company will not be liable to you for those violations or their consequences.

You accept all risk of using the service and content on the service.
