         Colophon  Or, how this site is made.
 Privacy
I also use Adobe Fonts for one of the typefaces on the site (see below), and Adobe tracks font usage.
If you find a type-face that has some of the same character as Cronos Pro, shoot me an email.
I will seriously consider replacing it if I find something I like equally well.
I loathe Adobeâs approach to font licensing and to privacy.
Otherwise, there is zero trackingâââof any sortâââon this site.
Implementation
I built this version of the site with Eleventy.
You can find the entirety of the implementation (and indeed the entire history of the implementation) on GitHub.
Iâm using it with the following plugins:



typeset: my own implementation of a plugin for typeset, heavily inspired by eleventy-plugin-typeset.



markdown-it plugins:


abbreviations
anchor
definition list
footnote
implicit-figures
superscript




spacewell: a little tool I built a few years ago to insert hair spaces around em dashes and thin spaces with non-breaking spans around number-separating en dashes.
the source is colocated with the rest of the site.


Typography
Perhaps my favorite part of web design, and also the part with which I spend the most part fussing. Context
Typeface Body text
Sabon, designed by Jan Tschichold in the mid-1960s as a Garamond revival.
In my opinion, the most beautiful Garamond in existence.

Headings
Cronos, designed by Robert Slimbach in 1996.
A nice contrast to Sabon with its digital-era roots.
The typeface Iâve been using on my site the longest at this point! Licensed via Adobe Fonts.1 Code
Hack, designed by Chris Simpkins in 2015 as an extension of the Deja Vu/Bitstream Vera lineage.

Inspiration
While working on this design, I took more-or-less-direct inspiration in a variety of ways from some of my favorite current or previous designs around the web:


Tim Brown


Ethan Marcotte


Trent Walton


Craig Modâââa truly wonderful site, but I actually loved the previous design iteration even more.


Jen Simmonsâââas with Modâs current site, I really like what sheâs doing on her site nowâââitâs all sorts of fun layout-wiseâââbut itâs quite distinct from what she was doing when I was stealing ideas from her late in 2018!


Reda Lemeden


Jason Santa Mariaâââfrom whom, if I recall, I originally got the idea of a versioned website.

Longtime readers may recall (and new readers may be curious about) my deep frustrations with this situation.
Nothing there has changedâââbut I ended up paying for Adobeâs Lightroom package when I picked back up photography, and it comes bundled.
So here we are.
