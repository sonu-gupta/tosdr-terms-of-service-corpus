Issues that May Occur


Reversals and Chargebacks

If you receive a payment that is later refunded or invalidated for any reason, you are responsible for the full amount of the payment sent to you plus any fees (including any applicable chargeback fee described below).
 Whenever a transaction is reversed, Wise will refund or reverse the transaction from your Wise Account in the same currency as the original transaction.
 If your Wise Account balance for a particular currency is insufficient to cover the amount of a refund or reversal, Wise will perform a currency conversion in order to refund or reverse the transaction, subject to the exchange rate being offered by Wise in the applicable currencies at that time.
 For details about what happens if your Wise Account balance becomes negative, please see Negative Account Balances below.
Payments that are reversed
Payments to you may be invalidated and reversed by Wise if:

Our investigation of a bank reversal (sometimes known as an ACH return) finds that the transaction was fraudulent.
Wise sent the payment to you in error.
The payment was unauthorized.
You received the payment for activities that violated this Customer Agreement, the Acceptable Use Policy, or any other agreement between you and Wise.

When you receive a payment, you are liable to Wise for the full amount of the payment sent to you plus any fees if the payment is later invalidated for any reason.

Chargeback Fees

If you receive a debit or credit card-funded payment through your Wise Account and you (or a third party) pursue a chargeback for the transaction with the card issuer, then Wise may assess you with a chargeback fee (for facilitating the chargeback process) and will remove the charged back funds from your Borderless account including funds held in a Jar.

Negative Account Balances

If your Wise Account balance becomes negative for any reason, including on account of a Reversal or Chargeback, that negative balance represents an amount you owe to Wise and you promise to repay the negative balance immediately without any notice from us.
Wise may deduct amounts owed from money you upload or money you receive into your Wise Account including funds held in a Jar..
If you manage your balance in your Wise Account in multiple currencies, and the balance in one of the currencies becomes negative for any reason, Wise may set off the negative balance by using value you maintain in a different currency.
 Wise will perform a currency conversion to do this, which will be subject to the exchange rate being offered by Wise in the applicable currencies at that time.
We may send you reminders or take such other reasonable actions to recover the negative balance from you, for example, we may use a debt collection service or take further legal actions.
 In order to recover negative account balances from you, we may convert the amount you owe us into U.S dollars.

Error Resolution

You must make sure that the information you provide to us when you send or withdraw money, or convert currency, is accurate.
Once a transaction is processed, it cannot be reversed (except where, and to the extent, required by applicable law) and, except as expressly set forth in this Customer Agreement, we will not be liable in any way for any loss you suffer as a result of a transaction being carried out in accordance with your instructions (or a third party acting on your behalf).
If you believe there to be an error in connection with a transaction or other problem, then you should notify Wise Support through our Help Center or 1-888-908-3833 as soon as possible, but no later than 180 days of the date we disclosed to you that a transaction has been completed.
When you do, please tell us as much of the following information as possible: (1) your name and address.
(2) the error or problem with the transaction, and why you believe it is an error or problem.
(3) the name of the recipient, and if you know it, telephone number or address.
(4) the dollar amount of the transfer.
and (5) the transfer number.

You paid an incorrect amount for your currency conversion order;
Wise made a computational error, such as a miscalculation of the amount the recipient received;
The amount stated in the currency conversion order receipt was not made available to the recipient, unless the problem was caused by extraordinary circumstances outside our control;
Funds were available to the recipient later than the date of availability that was disclosed to you on the currency conversion order receipt or were not delivered, unless, extraordinary circumstances outside our control caused the delay, and we could not reasonably anticipate those circumstances, or delays resulted from fraud screenings, or were caused by requirements of the Office of Foreign Assets Controls or similar requirements, or the transfer was made with fraudulent intent.
and
The list of Transfers on our Website does not reflect a Transfer that you made.
and
You did not receive any confirmation of your Transfer, such as information required to determine if a Transfer occurred.

We will inform you of our determination within three (3) Business Days after completing our investigation.
If we decide that there was no Error, we will send you a written explanation.
You may ask for copies of any documents we used in our investigation.
If we determine that an error has occurred, we will offer you the option of obtaining a refund or making available to the designated recipient the funds necessary to resolve the error.
Please note that we are only required to refund fees where we failed to make funds available to the recipient by the date of availability we specified, unless you provided incorrect or insufficient information to us, in which case we are not required to refund fees.

If we decide to do this, we will credit your Borderless Account within ten (10) Business Days for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have the use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation.

You receiving more than the correct amount to which you were entitled, then we will debit your Wise Account for the difference between what you actually received and what you should have received.
