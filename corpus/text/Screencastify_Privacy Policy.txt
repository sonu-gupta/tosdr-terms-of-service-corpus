âStudent Privacy NoticeScreencastify takes the privacy of Students very seriously.
This site and the Services are intended for general audiences and are not intended for use by Users under the age of 18, provided however, that Students, including Student under the age of 13, may use the Services for educational purposes at the invitation and direction of their School or School Representative.
Other than Students who are using the Services at the direction of their School, we do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13.
The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and its rules (collectively, "COPPA") require us to inform parents and legal guardians (âparentsâ) about our practices for collecting, using, and disclosing personal information from Students under the age of 13.
In accordance with COPPA, a School or School Representative may act as the agent of the parent or legal guardian of a Student and provide consent on behalf of the parent for Screencastifyâs collection, use and disclosure of the Studentâs information so long as such collection, use and disclosure are solely related to the Studentâs use of the Services for educational purposes.
By enrolling a Student to use the Services, the School provides such consent to us to use, collect and share Student information as needed to provide the Services and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Please contact us at privacy@screencastify.com if you believe we have inadvertently collected information from a child under 13 that is not at the direction of their School so that we may delete their information as soon as possible.
How we collect, use and share information regarding Students is identified in the applicable sections of the Privacy Policy, however, in some cases, Schools may have the option to further limit the collection of Student data.
We do not ever sell, rent or license Student information or use it for purposes other than as needed to provide the Services.
Parents of Students have certain rights with respect to their Studentâs data, including the right to review, update or delete Student information, as well as prohibit our sharing of Student information with third parties.
Parents can exercise these rights by contacting the Studentâs School or School Representative.
The School or School Representative should submit these requests on the parentâs behalf by emailing support@screencastify.com.
Unless such a request is made, we will continue collect, use and share Student information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
A list of third parties with whom we share Student information (as needed to provide the Services) is provided above under âWho do we Share Your Information With?â.
Additionally, Screencastify has taken and upholds the Student Privacy Pledge per the terms consistent on studentprivacypledge.org.

Despite our security measures, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal information.
In the unlikely event of an unauthorized disclosure of your data we will notify you (either directly or through your School or School Representative) in accordance with our legal or contractual requirements.
âVideos Recorded with ScreencastifyAny video you create with Screencastify belongs to you, subject to your compliance with Screencastifyâs Terms of Use.
You control where your recordings are stored.
When you choose to store your recordings on a third party service, they will be transferred to the respective remote service.
