Nor is easyfeedback liable for the survey achieving the success desired by the customer or the number of survey participants desired by the customer.
(4) If a case of force majeure occurs, easyfeedback is not responsible for the resulting delay or impossibility of the services.
Force majeure is defined as all unforeseeable events or events that â even if they were foreseeable â are beyond the control of easyfeedback and whose effects on the fulfillment of the contract cannot be prevented by the reasonable efforts of both parties to the contract.
(5) The customer shall indemnify easyfeedback against all claims asserted against easyfeedback by third parties due to the infringement of their rights or due to legal violations resulting from the illegal or improper use of the service.
In this regard, the customer also assumes the costs of legal defense, in particular all attorneyâs fees and court costs.

(1) The right of easyfeedback to terminate the contract for good cause remains unaffected.
(2) Terminations must be made in writing to be effective.
(3) Active disruptions or threats to the service due to actions by the user will result in immediate termination without notice.
In this case, easyfeedback reserves the right to assert claims for damages against the user.
