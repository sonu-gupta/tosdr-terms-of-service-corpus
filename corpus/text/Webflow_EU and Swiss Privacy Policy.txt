Welcome to the Webflow, Inc., (hereinafter, âWebflow,â âCompany,â âus,â âour,â or âweâ) EU &amp.
Swiss Privacy Policy (the âPolicyâ).

This Policy governs our information-handling practices as applicable to residents in the United Kingdom ("UK"), European Union (âEUâ), European Economic Area (âEEAâ), and Switzerland (collectively, the âData Subjectsâ) that are visiting our website, www.webflow.com, and the other websites under the webflow.com domain (collectively, the âSitesâ), or are customers who use our SaaS product, web design software, tools, and related services (together with the Sites, the âServiceâ). 
This Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect Data Subjectsâ information as part of the Service in accordance with data-protection laws in the UK, EU, EEA, and Switzerland (collectively the âData Protection Lawsâ).
Any discussion of your use of the Service in this Policy is meant to include your visits and other interactions with the Sites and Services, whether or not you are a user of Webflowâs SaaS product.

Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Policy have the meaning given them in our Terms of Service or Global Privacy Policy.
By accessing and using the Service, you signify your acceptance to the terms of this Policy.
If you do not agree with or you are not comfortable with any aspect of this Policy, our Global Policy or the Terms of Service, you should immediately discontinue access or use of our Services.
In the event of a conflict between the Global Privacy Policy and this Policy, this Policy supersedes the Global Privacy Policy. Hi there Welcome to Webflowâs EU &amp.
Swiss Privacy Policy! In these boxes, youâll find our plain-English version of the policy.
It isnât legally binding, so please use this it only as an aid.
This version of our Privacy Policy covers how we collect, use, disclose, and protect the data of those in the United Kingdom (UK), European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA), and Switzerland.
It takes precedence over the Global Privacy Policy if there are any conflicts between the two.

As per usual with these sorts of things, your use of Webflow means you agree to these policies and terms.
If you donât agree, you shouldnât use our service. 1.
Our relationship to you In order for you to understand Webflowâs data protection obligations and your rights to your Personal Information under this Policy, it is important that you identify which relationship(s) you have with Webflow.

A âUserâ is an individual providing personal data to us via our website or other services, products or platforms, such as by signing up for our newsletter or making an account and posting on the Forums.
Webflow is in a âdata controllerâ relationship with Users.
A âCustomerâ is a specific type of User that has engaged us to act as an agent (or, as a âData Processorâ) by obtaining our Services.
Webflow is in a âdata processorâ relationship with Customers.

Webflow does not have a direct relationship with Customersâ End Users.
A âCustomer End Userâ is an individual that provides their Personal Information to our Customers.
We do not control the purposes nor the means by which this Personal Information is collected, and we are not in a direct relationship with Customer End Users.
For details about how Personal Information about Customer End Users is handled, please review our Customersâ privacy policies instead of this one, and contact them for further information.

Hereinafter we may refer to Customers and Users collectively as âyou.â  Basically...
This is the bit where we define our relationship to you.

If youâve given us some personal information, such as by subscribing to our newsletter or joining our forum, then youâre a âUserâ of Webflow and weâre a âData Controllerâ of your account information, such as your name and email address.

If you use Webflow, then youâre a âCustomerâ and Webflow is a âData Processorâ for you.

A âCustomer End Userâ is someone who provides their personal information to our Customers.
We have no direct relationship with them. 
Note that these categories are not mutually exclusive â you might be all three! 2.
Notice Webflow provides notice to you through posted privacy policies and may provide additional "just-in-time" disclosures about the data collection, use, and sharing practices of specific Services.
The Global Privacy Policy generally describes our privacy practices, while this Policy is specific to Users and Customers located in the UK, EU, EEA, and Switzerland while using our Services.
This Policy describes how we process Personal Information from the UK, EU, EEA, and Switzerland in accordance with Privacy Shield and applicable data protection law.

As a data processor, Webflow is not able to provide notice to or obtain consent from Customer End Users.
To the extent required by law, Webflow supports Customersâ data-protection compliance efforts, but it is up to the Customer to ensure the appropriate data protection safeguards are in place before processing Personal Information from Customer End Users.
 Basically...
We use our privacy policies and other âjust-in-timeâ methods (like cookie notifications and popups) to let you know about how we gather, use, and share data.

Obviously, we canât do that for the visitors of any websites you create and host on Webflow, so itâs up to you/your clients to make sure youâre informing your website visitors about how youâre handling their data. 3.
Collection of Personal Information As described in the Global Privacy Policy, Webflow collects various types of Personal Information about you while you are using the Services.

This means that your posts are available to the public and may appear in search engines or other publicly available platforms, and may be âcrawledâ or searched by third parties.
Your public posts can also be read, collected, or used by others to send you unsolicited messages.
Be careful when posting on public parts of our Services and do not post any information that you are not comfortable sharing publicly.
 Basically...
We collect various kinds of personal information while youâre using Webflow, and all of that data is protected by the policies outlined here.
Anonymized info is, naturally, not considered personal.

Any info you post or share on our blog or forum becomes public and crawlable by search engines and other bots, because thatâs how the internet works. 4.

Credit card or payment processors
Cloud storage providers
Customer support tools
Product development tools
IT and security service providers, and
Marketing or analytics tools 

Each service provider is vetted and bound by contractual obligations that are equivalent to the provision of this Policy or more stringent.
See the âAccountability for Onward Transfersâ section below for more information about our agreements with third parties. Basically...
We handle most of the data processing required for you to use Webflow ourselves, but we do use a few third-party services to handle things like payments, file storage, and analytics.
All those services abide by policies like ours.
More on that in the âAccountability for onward transfersâ section below. 7.
Retention We are committed to keeping your Personal Information secure on our Services.
We limit our storage of your Personal Information to the amount of time necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we collected the Personal Information, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting obligations, or to resolve disputes.
Although retention laws and requirements vary by jurisdiction, we have some standard retention periods for parts of your Personal Information which are described below:  

Contact information collected for marketing purposes, such as your name and email address, is retained on an ongoing basis until you unsubscribe from our marketing communications.
Thereafter we will add your contact information to our suppression list indefinitely to respect your unsubscribe request.
Browser interaction data, such as cookies and trackers, is kept for a period of up to one year from expiry of the cookie or date of collection.
Product analytics data is kept for up to 5 years, and automatically deleted on an ongoing basis.

If you have questions about retention periods that apply to any other data, please contact us at privacy@webflow.com. Basically...
Weâre dedicated to keeping your personal info safe.
Thatâs why we only store your data as long as itâs necessary to fulfill the purpose it was collected for.
This varies by data type and jurisdiction, but two of the most important are:


Your marketing contact info: which we keep for as long as you use the platform, or until you ask us to remove it

Your interaction data: which we keep no longer than a year from the date of collection, or from the cookieâs expiration date

Product usage data: which we keep for up to 5 years

âCause nobody likes a stale cookie. 8.
International transfers Webflow uses approved data transfer mechanisms to transfer your Personal Information in and out of the United States and other jurisdictions.
We rely on European Commissionâapproved Standard Contractual Clauses as a legal mechanism where required for any data transfers from the U.S.
to a country outside the UK, EU, EEA, or Switzerland to the extent that any such transfers occur.

In relation to transfers of Personal Information to the U.S., Webflow receives Personal Information pursuant to Standard Contractual Clauses and other data transfer mechanisms.
Webflow also has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework (hereinafter, the âFrameworkâ or âPrivacy Shieldâ) as set forth by the U.S.
Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, disclosure, and retention of Personal Information transferred from the UK, EU, EEA, and Switzerland to the United States.
We recognize that the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled in July 2020 that a certification under the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework no longer can serve as the basis by which entities subject to the GDPR export Personal Information to countries whose laws have not been recognized by the European Commission as providing a high level of protection for the information.
 As affected customers who relied only on our Privacy Shield certification transition to the use of Standard Contractual Clauses and other methods for transferring Personal Information to Webflow under the GDPR, Webflow will continue to honor our obligation to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such information.
This EU &amp.
Swiss Privacy Policy and the Webflow Global Privacy Policy describe Webflowâs privacy practices.
In the event there is a conflict between the terms in the Global Privacy Policy and this Policy, this Policy shall govern for any conflicts related to UK, EU, EEA, or Swiss data subjects.
To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/. Basically...
We welcome the use of Standard Contractual Clauses and other approved data transfer mechanisms to transfer your personal data between jurisdictions. 9.
Accountability for onward transfer Webflow complies with the Privacy Shield Accountability for Onward Transfer Principle for all onward transfers of Personal Information from the UK, EU, EEA, and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.
Webflow contractually obligates third-party agents or service providers to provide the same level of protection as required by the Privacy Shield Framework and under the Data Protection Laws.
In addition, we limit and specify the purpose(s) for processing your Personal Information consistent with any notice provided to you and your consent.

Upon request by the United States Department of Commerce, Webflow will provide a summary or representative copy of the relevant privacy provisions of its agreement with a third-party agent.
In certain situations, Webflow may be required to disclose your Personal Information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, to comply with a judicial proceeding or court order, or as otherwise required by law. Basically...
We use contractual protections and other safeguards when it comes to transferring your personal information to the United States, and require that third parties we work with do so as well. 10.
Security We are committed to protecting the security of your Personal Information by using reasonable and appropriate physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards.
Please refer to Section 6 of the Global Privacy Policy for more detailed information about our security safeguards. Basically...
We care about the security of your personal info.
You can read more about our safeguards in section 6 of our Global Privacy Policy. 11.

Transactional communications about your account or our Services are not considered âdirect marketingâ communications.

When we rely on legitimate interest, we will only send you information about our Services that are similar to those which were the subject of a previous sale or negotiations of a sale to you.
