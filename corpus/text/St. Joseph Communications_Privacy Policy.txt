 Privacy Policy
St.
Joseph Communicationsâ Privacy Policy has been developed as an extension of our commitment to combine the highest-quality products and services with the highest level of integrity in dealing with our clients.
The Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect, use, and safeguard the personal information you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our products and services and receiving news and related content through our online properties.
It reflects our commitment to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of the personal information entrusted to us by our clients.
This Policy will be continuously assessed against new technologies, business practices, and client needs.
The Policy applies to all current and prospective clients of St.
Joseph Communications and/or our subsidiaries and/or affiliates (collectively âSt.
Josephâ), as well as to users of our online properties.
COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
St.
Joseph has organized its business into three strategic platforms: Content, Print, and Media.
Each of our platforms collects personal information from clients where such information is required for the provision of a particular product or service.
Content and Print
Our Content and Print platforms collect personal information that may include an individualâs name, address (postal and/or e-mail), telephone number as well as banking, financial, credit card and/or credit information.
As agents involved in data processing, variable imaging, and direct mailing, we may also obtain personal information from third parties such as our clients, list owners, and other media owners.
Typically, the personal information is provided to us with specific instructions on how it is to be used.
We make all reasonable efforts to ensure that such personal information is used only for the purposes stipulated and that it is subject to strict terms of confidentiality.
Media
Our Media platform may collect personal information through surveys, questionnaires, and other means.
In addition to name, address (postal and/or e-mail), telephone number, and transaction information, we may collect demographic information (i.e., age, gender, income, occupation, and education) and opinions of subscribers, or potential subscribers, to our magazines and other print properties.
For more details, please visit our Magazine websites.
Modes of Collection
St.
Joseph collects personal information about clients through various applications and order forms, including credit applications, surveys and questionnaires, face-to-face interactions, and our online properties.
For certain transactions, we may obtain personal information about a client from third parties, such as consumer reporting agencies.
USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
St.
Joseph Communications uses the personal information we collect to provide clients with our products and services, manage our business, and comply with regulatory and industry requirements.
More specifically, we use personal information to create and maintain client accounts, communicate with our clients, supply clients with our products and services, and provide them with information about existing or new products and services that we believe would be of value to them.
We may also use information about client interests and preferences, as well as feedback we receive from surveys, to improve our products and customer service.
St.
Joseph makes all reasonable efforts to ensure that information is used responsibly, and only for its intended purposes.
