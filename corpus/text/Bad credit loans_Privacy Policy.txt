These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings. How do we collect your personal information? We collect your personal information, for example, when you:

Create an account
Request a loan
Provide information on our forms
Navigate to or use our website
Communicate with us
Request a loan through a different website in our network

We may also obtain information about you from third parties, including credit bureaus, affiliates, or other companies. Why canât you limit all sharing at the time you submit a loan request? You cannot limit all sharing at the time you submit a loan request because to connect you with a lender we need to share your information with our network of lenders and other networks of lenders so the lenders in these networks can choose whether to offer you a loan or market their loans to you.
However, you can contact us at any time after you submit your loan request to limit all sharing.
