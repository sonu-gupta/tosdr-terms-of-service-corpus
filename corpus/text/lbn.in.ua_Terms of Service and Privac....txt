lbn.in.ua only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site where the comment was left. Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information Certain visitors to lbn.in.ua websites choose to interact with lbn.in.ua in ways that require lbn.in.ua to gather personally-identifying information.

You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of lbn.in.ua may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy. Ads Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies.
These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer.
