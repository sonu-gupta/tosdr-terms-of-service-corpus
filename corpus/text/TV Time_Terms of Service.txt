DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND GOVERNING LAWTHIS SECTION APPLIES TO ALL USERS OF THE SERVICE TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWABLE BY LAW.
BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS YOU EXPLICITLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST WNI.
This section includes an arbitration agreement and an agreement that all claims will be brought only in an individual capacity (and not as a class action or other representative proceeding).
Please read it carefully.
You may opt out of the arbitration agreement by following the opt out procedure described below.Informal Process FirstYou agree that in the event of any dispute between you and WNI, you will first contact WNI and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the dispute before resorting to more formal means of resolution, including without limitation any court action.Arbitration AgreementAfter the informal dispute resolution process any remaining dispute, controversy, or claim (collectively, "Claim") relating in any way to your use of WNI's services and/or products, including the Service, or relating in any way to the communications between you and WNI or any other user of the Service, will be finally resolved by binding arbitration.
This mandatory arbitration agreement applies equally to you and WNI.
However, this arbitration agreement does not (a) govern any Claim by WNI for infringement of its intellectual property or access to the Service that is unauthorized or exceeds authorization granted in these Terms or (b) bar you from making use of applicable small claims court procedures in appropriate cases.
If you are an individual you may opt out of this arbitration agreement within thirty (30) days of the first of the date you access or use this Service by following the procedure described below.
Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.
There is no judge or jury in arbitration.
Instead, the dispute is resolve by a neutral arbitrator.
Court review of an arbitration award is limited.
Except to the extent the parties agree otherwise, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.
You agree that the U.S.
Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and WNI are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.
This arbitration provision will survive any termination of these Terms.
If you wish to begin an arbitration proceeding, after following the informal dispute resolution procedure, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to Whip Networks, Inc., 1841 Centinela Ave., Santa Monica, CA 90404.
The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules including, if you are an individual, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes.
If you are not an individual or have used the Service on behalf of an entity, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will not be used.
The AAA's rules are available at http://www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
The number of arbitrators will be one.
You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.
The arbitration will be conducted in the English language.
Massachusetts law will apply.
Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules.
If you are an individual and have not accessed or used the Service on behalf of an entity, we will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous, and we will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.
The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or formation of this arbitration agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this arbitration agreement is void or voidable.
However, the preceding sentence will not apply to the "Class Action Waiver" section below.
Opt-Out of Arbitration

If you do not want to arbitrate disputes with WNI and you are an individual, you may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending an email to support@tvtime.com within thirty (30) days of the first of the date you access or use the Service after these Terms are made effective.

Class Action Waiver

Any Claim must be brought in the respective party's individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, multiple plaintiff, or similar proceeding ("Class Action").
The parties expressly waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any forum.
If the Claim is subject to arbitration, the arbitrator will not have authority to combine or aggregate similar claims or conduct any Class Action nor make an award to any person or entity not a party to the arbitration.
Any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.
The parties understand that any right to litigate in court, to have a judge or jury decide their case, or to be a party to a class or representative action, is waived, and that any claims must be decided individually, through arbitration.


If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement, if otherwise effective, will be null and void.
The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.
If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and WNI each waive any right to a jury trial.
Venue and Governing LawThese Terms shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles.
except that aspects of the Service that are accessed from France may also be subject to the Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2000 on certain legal aspects of information society services transposed into French law by the Law Number 2004-575 of 21 June 2004 regarding confidence in the digital economy.
Except as otherwise provided in these Terms, you and WNI may litigate in the courts of Los Angeles, California to compel arbitration, stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
Any Dispute not subject to arbitration (other than claims proceeding in any small claims court), or where no election to arbitrate has been made, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the County of Los Angeles, California, and you and WNI agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.XV.
CHANGES TO TERMSWe are constantly updating the Service, and that means we reserve the right to update these Terms for any reason.
If we make changes that are material, we will attempt to notify you, including by updating the "LAST MODIFIED" date at the top of these Terms.
However, it is your sole responsibility to review the Terms from time to time to view any such changes.
If you continue to use the Service, you signify your agreement to our revisions to these Terms.
If you disagree with any of our changes, you should discontinue your use of the Service.XVI.
TERMINATIONWe reserve the right to change, suspend or discontinue (temporarily or permanently) the Service at any time, with or without cause, and may not be able to provide you with prior notice of such changes, suspension or discontinuation.
We may also change, restrict or terminate your access to the Service any time, with or without cause.
We are not liable to you or to any third party for any changes, suspension, or restriction to, or termination of the Service.
If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using the Service.
All provisions of these Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including without limitation ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.
Our rights under these Terms will survive any termination of these Terms.XVII.
GENERAL TERMSIf any part of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion of the Terms will be construed consistent with applicable law, and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect.
Any failure on the part of WNI to enforce any provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of our right to enforce such provision.
We may assign or delegate these Terms and/or our Privacy Policy, in whole or in part, to any person or entity at any time with or without your consent.
You may not assign or delegate any rights or obligations under the Terms or Privacy Policy without our prior written consent, and any unauthorized assignment and delegation by you is void.
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ THESE TERMS, UNDERSTAND THE TERMS, AND WILL BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS.
YOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THESE TERMS TOGETHER WITH THE PRIVACY POLICY REPRESENT THE COMPLETE AND EXCLUSIVE STATEMENT OF THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN US AND THAT IT SUPERSEDES ANY PROPOSAL OR PRIOR AGREEMENT ORAL OR WRITTEN, AND ANY OTHER COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN US RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT.XVIII.
