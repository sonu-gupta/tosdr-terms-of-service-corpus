For the transmission to our subsidiaries/partner it can happen, that a appropriateness resolution by the EU commission in accordance with Art.
45 Abs.
1, 3 DS-GVO does not exist.
This means that the EU commission has not yet positively determined that the level of data protection in a given country meets the data protection standards of the European Union based on the DS-GVO.
Appropriate guarantees such as company-internal and from a supervisory authority approved data protection provisions, for example, or standard EU contracts exist.
Possible particular risks, which cannot be excluded in conjunction with the transfer of data, are:

Your personal information can possibly be processed beyond the actual purpose for which it was submitted, for example for additional promotional purposes
Furthermore, the possibility exists that you will not be able to sustainably enforce or impose your data protection rights, such as your right to information, correction, deletion or data transferability (see point 3)

in the event that a transfer is legally required and this is permittable by law and necessary for contractual settlement.

For a transfer of data outside of the European Union, the high level of European data protection does not apply.
For a transfer it can happen that no appropriateness resolution in accordance with Art.

Possible risks that may not be completely avoidable in conjunction with the transfer of data are:

Your personal data may possibly be processed above and beyond the intended purpose.
