Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration (PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.)

Agreement to Arbitrate

This Section entitled âDispute Resolution by Binding Arbitrationâ is referred to in these Terms of Service as the âArbitration Agreement.â You agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Gfycat, whether relating to these Terms of Service (including any alleged breach thereof), the Services, any advertising, any aspect of the relationship between us, or otherwise, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify.
Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf.
You agree that, by entering into this Terms of Service, you and Gfycat are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.
Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury.
The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.

Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief

YOU AND GFYCAT AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.
UNLESS BOTH YOU AND GFYCAT AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSONâS OR PARTYâS CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING.
ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTYâS INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).

Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution

Gfycat is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customerâs satisfaction by emailing customer support at (contact at gfycat dot com.
If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (âNoticeâ).
The Notice to Gfycat should be sent to [943 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94103, Attn: Legal] (âNotice Addressâ).
The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (b) set forth the specific relief sought.
If Gfycat and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Gfycat may commence an arbitration proceeding.
During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Gfycat or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Gfycat is entitled.

Arbitration Procedures

Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Associationâs (âAAAâ) rules and procedures, including the AAAâs Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (collectively, the âAAA Rulesâ), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.
For information on the AAA, please visit its website, http://www.adr.org.
Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAAâs consumer arbitration page, http://www.adr.org/consumer_arbitration.
If there is any inconsistency between the AAA Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, the terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration.
The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms of Service as a court would.
All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement.
Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under the Terms of Service and applicable law.
Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.
Unless Gfycat and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances.
If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination shall be made by AAA.
If your claim is for $10,000 or less, Gfycat agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.
If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
Costs of Arbitration
Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the âArbitration Feesâ) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement.
If the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, at your request, Gfycat will pay all Arbitration Fees.
If the value of relief sought is more than $75,000 and you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, Gfycat will pay your portion of such fees.
In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Gfycat will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.
Finally, if the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, Gfycat will pay reasonable attorneysâ fees should you prevail.
Gfycat will not seek attorneysâ fees from you.
But, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 in relief, the payment of attorneysâ fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.

Confidentiality

All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.

Severability

If a court decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement other than the section entitled âProhibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Reliefâ above is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified.
If a court decides that any of the provisions of the section entitled âProhibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Reliefâ above is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void.
The remainder of the Terms of Service will continue to apply.

Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement

Notwithstanding any provision in this Terms of Service to the contrary, Gfycat agrees that if it makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a user of the Services, you may reject any such change by sending Gfycat written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above.
By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement.

Termination

You agree that Gfycat, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your account (or any part thereof) or use of the Service and remove and discard any content within the Service, for any reason, including, without limitation, for lack of use or if Gfycat believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms of Service.
