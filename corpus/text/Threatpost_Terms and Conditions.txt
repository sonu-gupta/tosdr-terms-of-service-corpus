Acceptance of Terms
Threatpost provides our Internet site and the content, products and services offered on or through this site (collectively, the âServicesâ), to you subject to the following Terms of Service (âTOSâ).
Your use of the Services in whole or in part constitutes your binding acceptance of these TOS.
If you do not agree to these TOS, you should not use the Services.
Some Services may be subject to additional posted rules, policies and terms.
When you use those Services, you and Threatpost shall be subject to those additional conditions, which are incorporated by reference into these TOS (and, consequently, form part of your agreement with us).
Because we may modify all or any part of these TOS from time to time without notice to you, you should check back often so you are aware of your current rights and responsibilities.
Your continued use of a given Service after changes to the TOS have been published on that Service constitutes your binding acceptance of the updated TOS.
If at any time the TOS are no longer acceptable to you, you should immediately cease all use of the Services.
Description of Services
The Services include a combination of content that we create and that other third party content suppliers create.
In addition, some Services provide you and other users with an opportunity to submit, post, display, transmit and/or exchange information, ideas, opinions, photographs, images, video, creative works or other information, messages, transmissions or material to us or others on or through that Service (collectively, the âPostingsâ).
We adhere to high journalistic standards, and use every reasonable effort to provide informative and relevant content as part of the Services.
However, in using the Services, you may be exposed to content that you find offensive, indecent, objectionable or that is inaccurate and you bear all risks associated with using that content.
You understand that the Services are provided by Threatpost âAS ISâ, as further described in Section 15 of these TOS, and that Threatpost does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of any content available on or through the Services.
In this regard, you acknowledge that you may not rely on any of this content, whether created by or submitted to Threatpost, including, but not limited to, product reviews, white papers, product descriptions, or Postings on any bulletin board, chat, news group, community, discussion forum or other feedback section of the Services (collectively, the âForumsâ).
You understand that from time to time, you may communicate with, receive communications from, or otherwise participate in or use the services or obtain goods and services of or from, third parties (e.g., advertisers) as a result of your use of the Services.
All such communication, interaction and participation is strictly and solely between you and such third party and Threatpost shall not be responsible or liable to you in any way in connection with these activities or transactions (including, but not limited to, any representations, warranties, covenants, contracts or other terms or conditions that may exist between you and the third party, or any goods or services you may purchase or obtain from any third party).
In particular, the appearance or availability of links to third party sites on or through the Services does not constitute an endorsement by Threatpost with respect to the content, advertising, products, or other materials available on or from such sites.
You further understand and agree that the Services may include certain communications from Threatpost(such as administrative messages and certain newsletters), and that these communications are considered part of the Service and you may not be able to opt out of receiving them.
Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance the current Services shall be subject to the TOS.
Finally, you are responsible for obtaining access to the Services and that access may involve third party fees (such as Internet service provider or airtime charges).
You are responsible for those fees, including those fees associated with the display or delivery of advertisements.
In addition, you must provide and are responsible for all equipment necessary to access the Services.
