Introduction
This privacy notice applies only to the information we collect on the LiveRamp.com website.
The purpose of the notice is to ensure visitors to the LiveRamp.com website understand what data we collect, and why.
More information on privacy considerations regarding LiveRampâs services can be found here.
If you are visiting this site from outside of the United States, where applicable we invite you to visit the website specific to your region, as that content may better fit LiveRampâs local offerings.
The privacy notice of those websites may also differ from the policy governing LiveRamp.com.

LiveRamp overview
LiveRamp is a data connectivity platform.
Our technology sits between consumers and brands that advertise online: our services ensure any data connected across the internet for the purpose of digital advertising prioritizes consumer privacy at all times.
Like an armored car for data, we keep information safe and secure, allowing for companies and consumers alike to enjoy the benefits of more relevant online advertising while maintaining privacy and the trust our industry and the public has placed in us.

Our service allows websites which rely on digital advertising to keep your experience free of charge and personalized, versus disrupting your browsing experience with ads irrelevant to your interests.


The information you provide to companies as you shop and interact online is used to provide you with free experiences across the internet, from the searches you perform to articles you read.
Examples of these companies include social networks like Facebook and Twitter, online retailers, news websites, etc.
Many of these companies are LiveRamp customers that use our platform as part of their data connectivity and privacy strategy.
LiveRamp uses a number of techniques, including hashing and encryption, to protect the data which flows through our platform and ensure information using our products is not stored in a personally identifiable form in our system.
Purposes of the LiveRamp.com website
LiveRamp.com provides several broad services, including:

Education and communication about our products, services, recent company news, and general information about LiveRamp and its culture, as well as educational resources about the industry in which we operate.
This includes the opportunity for you to learn more about our offerings, such as by downloading white papers and e-books, signing up for our events, and reading the content on our marketing blog.
In some cases, you may choose to provide LiveRamp with personally identifiable information (PII) â for example, when registering for an event or joining our mailing list.
LiveRampâs products are developed for use by businesses rather than consumers, and our website content generally assumes an audience familiar with our industry.
However, we put people first when developing products to ensure any movement of data across the Internet for the purpose of digital advertising considers consumer privacy a priority at all times.

Response to consumer comments or concerns, as well as receipt of Opt Out requests and data Subject Access Requests as provided for under US laws or regulations.
Advertisement of career opportunities at LiveRamp, through our Careers page.
Communication of information pertinent to LiveRamp investors, through our Investor Relations page.

What information LiveRamp.com collects
Information collected automatically
Cookies
Cookies are small, unique text files that a website sends to your computer (or another internet-connected device) to identify the device visiting the site.
The cookie is stored on your browser.
Cookies contain information that allows us to improve site functionality and security.
We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them).
1st-party cookies are cookies set by the website owner, while 3rd-party cookies are cookies set by parties other than the website owner.
LiveRamp, Inc.
is the owner of LiveRamp.com and uses both 1st- and 3rd-party cookies on this site.
LiveRamp and its service providers may also place cookies on your browser when you open an email you receive from LiveRamp.
These cookies include information that allows LiveRamp to provide a more customized LiveRamp.com experience.
They may be used to tailor ad content on our site, on sites you may visit in the future, and to understand aggregate-level information such as traffic patterns to LiveRampâs website or engagement metrics, such as open rates, with email marketing campaigns.
If you choose to provide personally identifiable information in the course of your interaction with LiveRamp.com, or if you visit the website from a link in an email LiveRamp has sent you, your interactions with the website, including past interactions, may be connected to your email address or the information you provide.
Other than these cases, cookies are not linked to personally identifiable information.
In the course of placing cookies, LiveRamp may also collect data such as your browser type, your operating system, web pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, and other clickstream data.
LiveRampâs 1st-party cookies on this site are distinct from cookies LiveRamp uses elsewhere to facilitate its products and services.
a fuller description of these cookies can be found in our services privacy policy.
Additionally, emails we send to you may contain a bit of code known as a âweb beacon.â This code helps us understand the time and date that you have opened an email and when you have used a link within the email to visit a website, allowing us to collect analytics about our traffic, customize our services, and send you ads about our services.
You can disable our web beacons by turning images âoffâ in your email client (e.g., Outlook, Outlook Express).
Please see your email client for more information.
To Opt Out of LiveRamp marketing emails altogether, click the unsubscribe link in the body of the email.
We may also use cookies to automatically collect information about your computer when you visit our LiveRamp.com, and automatically store it in log files.
This may include the type of browser software you use, the operating system you are running, the website that referred you, and your Internet Protocol (âIPâ) address.
This information relates to a device, not the individual using it.
We do not connect this information to other data which would personally identify you.
Your browser may permit you to reject or delete cookies, but this may prevent proper working of our website.
Different browsers handle cookies in different ways.
For instance, to prevent LiveRamp.com from setting both 1st and 3rd party cookies on Googleâs Chrome browser:

Go to chrome://settings/cookies
Under âSites that can never use cookies,â add [*.]liveramp.com

Select the option âAll cookies, on this site onlyâ
Click âAddâ

You may find the following links helpful in understanding how your specific browser handles cookies:

Safari
Firefox
Chrome
Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge
Opera

Metadata Metadata describes other data.
For instance, if the unique text contained in a cookie is considered âdata,â âmetadataâ would include things like:

When was the cookie first seen? When was it last seen?
What IP address is associated with the cookie? Based on the IP address, in which country is the device located?
What is the type of browser the cookie is placed on?

As mentioned above, along with cookies and web beacons LiveRamp and its service providers may collect these types of metadata about devices visiting our website.
This information may be used for general site maintenance and to ensure its proper function, as well as for analytics â for example, to understand changes in website traffic over time.
LiveRamp does not use this information to create identifiers for specific devices that visit our site.
If you are accessing the website from a corporate network, your IP address may be recognized as belonging to your employer.
We, or service providers acting on our behalf, may use this information to gauge interest in LiveRamp from certain industries or certain firms at an aggregate (non-personally identifiable) level.
Personally identifiable information (PII) you provide to us
PII includes information that directly identifies a specific, known individual â for example, your name, phone number, email, or postal address.
When you interact with LiveRamp, you may identify yourself using PII â for example, when verifying your identity for a Subject Access Request under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) applicable to California residents, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applicable within the EU, and other nations with equivalent regulation, or other regulatory framework, emailing us with general questions about our business, or asking for more information on how LiveRampâs services can assist you.
The only PII collected on this website is what you choose to provide to us.
PII collected for the purposes of Opting Out of LiveRamp or performing Subject Access Requests will only be used to honor those requests.
LiveRamp may share or store this information with trusted service providers, solely contracted to assist in these requests.
If you reach out to us at consumercare@liveramp.com, your email address and the content of your email will be accessible to our Consumer Care team.
Depending on your comment or request, the Consumer Care team may also ask for the jurisdiction in which you reside to determine whether certain laws and regulations apply to your situation.
If necessary, the content of your email may be shared with additional individuals within LiveRamp in order to best answer your questions or concerns.
Very rarely, your email address itself may be shared with the appropriate LiveRamp personnel if answering your request to LiveRamp depends on doing so.
Where PII is provided in a commercial inquiry to LiveRamp, we may share that information with vendors with whom LiveRamp has contracted to assist with customer relationship management, marketing, and related uses.
You may Opt Out of any marketing communications you receive from us.
in such cases, we may maintain your contact information in order to remain aware of, and honor, your previous Opt Out request.
How LiveRamp shares information collected from LiveRamp.com
Sharing with service providers
We may use third party service providers for network, security, email, hosting, and other services.
Suppliers and service providers are required by contract to keep confidential the information received on our behalf, and may not use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for us.
Sharing for legal purposes
Under certain circumstances personal data may be subject to disclosure pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders.
Disclosure may also occur when we believe in good faith that it is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request or to any other third party with your prior consent to do so.
If we are ever legally compelled to disclose your personal data to a third party, we will notify you with the contact information we have unless doing so would violate the law or a court order.
Sharing with our insurance provider
We may disclose your personal data to our insurers and/or professional advisers insofar as reasonably necessary for the purposes of obtaining or maintaining insurance coverage, managing risks, obtaining professional advice, or the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, whether in court proceedings or in an administrative or out-of-court procedure.
Sharing in the event of a corporate/enterprise transition
If we ever go through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personal data and non-personal data will likely be among the assets transferred.
You will be notified in advance by email where possible, and we will post a prominent notice on our website.
We will require an acquiring company or merger agreement to uphold the material terms of this privacy statement, including honoring requests for account deletion.
Sharing aggregate information, and sharing with partners
We may share with partners, prospects, clients, or our industry certain aggregate information which does not pertain to specific individuals (e.g., the number of attendees at our events).
In circumstances related to event marketing, with your explicit consent, we may share personally identifiable information such as your name, postal address, and email address with sponsorship partners.
For instance, if LiveRamp holds an event sponsored by one of our partners, our terms governing event attendance may allow us to share signup information with the sponsor.
Other important information
Childrenâs privacy
We do not knowingly collect personal data about children.
Our websites and systems are not designed for use by individuals under the age of 18, and in particular are not designed for children under the age of 13.
If we learn we have collected or obtained personal data of someone under 13, we will delete that information from our database.
If you believe that this has occurred, please contact us at consumercare@liveramp.com.
Security
We take the security of our data and clientsâ information seriously.
We always take what we believe are reasonable precautions to protect against unauthorized access to our systems and to prevent data from being disclosed to unauthorized parties.
We, and service providers operating on our behalf who may use data collected on this site, follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.
Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security.
Data transfers
Where business needs exist, LiveRamp intends to transfer, process, and/or store personal data outside the U.S.
and EU.
However, your personal data will not be transferred unless a valid transfer mechanism is in place legitimizing such a transfer.
In the case referred to in Article 46,47, or the second paragraph of Article 49(1), this will typically involve EU model clauses or the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework.
Read about the safeguards afforded by the EU model clauses.

Update: The European Court of Justice invalidated Privacy Shield on July 16, 2020 as a transfer mechanism between the EU and US companies.
LiveRamp is utilizing EU model clauses, also known as standard contractual clauses, as our current method of transfer until new guidance becomes available, as recommended by the ICO and FDPIC â UK and Switzerland data protection authorities, respectively.
Links to third-party sites
Our website includes links to other websites whose privacy practices may differ from those of LiveRamp.
If you submit personal data to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies.
We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any website you visit.
Blog and live chat
Our website offers publicly accessible blogs, which may be shared on certain social media entities including Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn using embedded functionality of those entities on LiveRamp.com.
Social media entitiesâ collection and treatment of data, including the potential placement of 3rd-party cookies or the visibility of LiveRamp blog content you choose to share, is governed by those entitiesâ respective privacy policies.
Additionally, in our webinars or other events we may choose to offer live chat or question &amp.
answer features.
You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.
Changes to this policy
This Privacy Policy was last updated on November 9, 2020.
We will provide notice for 30 days whenever this Privacy Policy is changed in a material way.
We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.
Opt Out choices
LiveRamp distinguishes between data collected to facilitate its services, and data collected while visiting our website.
Opt Out functionality for the former may be found here.
Given a lack of industry consensus and standardization, LiveRamp.com does not respond to browser âDo Not Trackâ (DNT) signals.
