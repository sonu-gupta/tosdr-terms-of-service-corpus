 Crayon, Inc.
Terms of Service Last Updated: July 2020
These Terms of Service (the âAgreementâ) are entered into by and between the âCustomerâ listed on the Authorization Form attached hereto as Exhibit A (âAuthorization Formâ) and Crayon, Inc.
(âCrayonâ) on the effective date, as listed on the Authorization Form (âEffective Dateâ).
This Agreement governs Customerâs access to and use of the websites and other online products and services (collectively, the âServicesâ) provided by Crayon and described in the Authorization Form.
The primary functionality of the Services is to provide Customer with analysis and aggregation of data about certain companies that Customer wishes to monitor (the âTargetsâ) and to provide Customer, and its Authorized Users (as defined below) with actionable insights.
The data made available by Crayon through the Services is publicly available information about the Targets (referred to in this Agreement as âThird Party Materialsâ).
Crayon does not control the actual content of the Third Party Materials to which the Services provide access and therefore takes no responsibility in relation to the Third Party Materials.
âAuthorized Usersâ means individual users authorized by Customer to use the Services, including accessing Customerâs account on the Services, and who Customer has supplied user identifications and passwords to, which may include Customer and its employees, consultants, contractors, agents, or other designees.

1.
Authorized User Accounts and Account Security. Customer controls whom it designates as an Authorized User, but agrees not to permit any person who it knows or should know is an employee or agent of a Crayon competitor to be an Authorized User.
Customer will maintain and require its Authorized Users to maintain reasonable security of its and their credentials and promptly notify Crayon if it discovers or suspects that someone has used its or their usernames or passwords without authorization.
Customer and each Authorized Userâs username and password is personal and may not be shared with any third parties.
Customer is responsible for all activities that occur regarding its credentials or otherwise under its account and for the actions and omissions of its Authorized Users with respect to the Services.

2.
User Content. Customer and its Authorized Users may create, post, store, send and share content, including messages, comments, text, photos, videos, and other materials (collectively, âUser Contentâ).
Customer and its Authorized Usersâ search history on the Services is also User Content.
Authorized Users will typically add User Content to the Services in order to enhance the experience of other Authorized Users.
Common examples of User Content include commenting on insights, uploading Customer-generated insights, and synthesizing insights into Customer summaries and positions such as battlecards.
Customer and its Authorized Users may not create, post, store, send or share any User Content that violates this Agreement or for which it does not have all the rights necessary to grant Crayon the license described herein. &nbsp.
Except for the license Customer grants below, Customer retains all rights in and to its User Content, as between Customer and Crayon.
Customer grants Crayon solely to the extent necessary for Crayon to provide the Services to Customer a nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, and fully-paid license during the Term to use, publish and display (within the instance of the Crayon Services accessible only to Customer and its Authorized Users) the User Content and any name or username provided in connection with the User Content.
When Customer posts or otherwise shares User Content on or through the Services, Crayon will not disclose the User Content to any third parties except (a) as necessary for Crayon to provide, or improve, the Services and only to those third parties that have agreed to comply with substantially similar non-disclosure obligations provided for herein, (b) to comply with applicable law or if required by any governmental entity or (c) to enforce its rights under this Agreement.
Customer also grants Crayon the right to use its name and logo on Crayonâs website and its marketing materials to identify Customer as a customer of Crayon.
Customer and its Authorized Users may not create, post, store, send or share any User Content that:

Is unlawful, libelous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, indecent, lewd, suggestive, harassing, threatening, invasive of privacy or publicity rights, abusive, inflammatory or fraudulent;
Would constitute, encourage or provide instructions for a criminal offense, violate the rights of any party or otherwise create liability or violate any local, state, national or international law;
Customer knows or should know may infringe any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other intellectual or proprietary right of any party;
Impersonates, or misrepresents their affiliation with, any person or entity;
Contains any unsolicited promotions, political campaigning, advertising or solicitations;
Contains any private or personal information of a third party without such third partyâs consent;
Contains any viruses, corrupted data or other harmful, disruptive or destructive files or content.
or
Is, in Crayonâs reasonable judgment, objectionable or that restricts or inhibits any other person from using or enjoying the Services, or that may expose Crayon or others to any harm or liability of any type.

In addition, although Crayon has no obligation to screen, edit or monitor User Content, it may delete or remove User Content at any time and for any reason.
3.
Prohibited Conduct. Customer is solely responsible for its and its Authorized Usersâ conduct while accessing or using the Services.
In connection with its and their use of the Services, Customer and its Authorized Users will not violate any applicable law, contract to which Customer is bound, or the intellectual property, privacy or other rights of any third party.
Without limiting the foregoing, Customer and its Authorized Users will not:

Use or attempt to use another Authorized Userâs account without authorization from that Authorized User and Crayon;
Knowingly use the Services in any manner that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect or inhibit other users from fully enjoying the Services or that could damage, disable, overburden or impair the functioning of the Services in any manner;

The subscription period shall be as specified in the Authorization Form (each, a âSubscription Periodâ).
Unless otherwise specified in the Authorization Form, each Subscription Period will automatically renew on its expiration date for a subsequent Subscription Period of the same duration and at the then current Subscription Fees (as defined below) unless Customer elects not to renew the applicable Subscription by notifying Crayon in writing at least thirty (30) days prior to the renewal date.
The initial Subscription Period and any renewals exercised by Customer shall be referred to herein (individually and collectively) as the âTerm.â Customer may cancel the Services during a Subscription Period, but Customer will not be relieved of the obligation to pay fees for the committed Subscription Period nor refunded any fees for any such voluntary cancellation.

5.

Customer will pay Crayon the Subscription Fees and other amounts specified in the applicable Authorization Form (including any one-time set up fees).
Customer will pay each of Crayonâs invoices within thirty (30) days after its receipt of the invoice by the payment method indicated in the applicable Authorization Form provided that if Customer has a bona fide dispute regarding any amount invoiced hereunder, Customer may, upon written notice to Crayon, withhold payment of the disputed amount (but shall pay the undisputed portion of the invoice) pending resolution of the dispute.
The parties agree to work together expeditiously to resolve any such dispute.
All Subscription Fees are exclusive of taxes and Customer will pay to Crayon all applicable taxes on the Services that Crayon is legally obligated or allowed to collect from Customer (other than taxes on Crayonâs income).
Any Subscription Fees not paid when due will bear interest at the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the maximum rate permitted by applicable usury law, whichever is less, computed and compounded daily from the date due until the date paid.
Further, in the event of any action by Crayon to collect any amount not paid when due, Customer will pay or reimburse Crayonâs costs of collection (including, without limitation, any reasonable attorneysâ fees and court costs).

6.

Processing of Personal Information and User Content.
By accessing or using the Services, Customer and its Authorized Users consent to the processing, transfer and storage of information about it and its Authorized Users (âUser Informationâ) in and to the United States and other countries.

For purposes of this Section, personal information shall mean any information that identifies, relates to, describes, references, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer, household, or device.

14.
Dispute Resolution.
Binding Arbitration. Except for small claims disputes in which a party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county of its billing address or disputes in which such party seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, Customer and Crayon waive their rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement or our Services resolved in court.
Instead, all disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Services will be resolved through confidential binding arbitration held in Boston, Massachusetts in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (âRulesâ) of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (âJAMSâ), which are available on the JAMS website and hereby incorporated by reference.

Customer and Crayon each agree that this Agreement affects interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 15 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.
Â§ 1, et seq.
(the âFAAâ), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.
As limited by the FAA, this Agreement and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court.
provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by this Agreement.
The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individualâs claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.
Customer and Crayon each agree that for any arbitration Customer initiates, it will pay the filing fee and Crayon will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs.
For any arbitration initiated by Crayon, Crayon will pay all JAMS fees and costs.
Customer and Crayon each agree that the state or federal courts of the State of Massachusetts and the United States sitting in Boston, Massachusetts have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.

15.
Governing Law and Venue. This Agreement will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of Massachusetts, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of Massachusetts or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
Any dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court will be resolved in the state or federal courts of Massachusetts and the United States, respectively, sitting in Boston, Massachusetts.

16.
Support. Customer may contact Crayon by phone Monday-Friday between 9 AM EST - 5 PM EST at 857-990-4800 or by email at support@crayon.co for technical support for the Services.

17.
Export Compliance. All or part of the Services may be subject to U.S.
export control and economic sanctions laws (âExport Controlsâ).
Customer agrees to abide by all Export Controls as they relate to its and its Authorized Usersâ access and use of the Services.

18.
Termination. This Agreement and its Authorization Formâs term may be terminated by either party (a) if the other party materially breaches a material term of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after receiving written notice of such breach from the other party, or (b) immediately upon written notice, if the other party makes any assignment for the benefit of creditors, or a receiver, trustee in bankruptcy or similar officer is appointed to take charge of any or all of the other partyâs property, or the other party seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors arrangement, composition or comparable proceeding or such a proceeding is instituted against the other party and is not dismissed within ninety (90) days, or the other party becomes insolvent or, without a successor, dissolves, liquidates or otherwise fails to operate in the ordinary course.

19.
Severability. If any provision or part of a provision of this Agreement is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from this Agreement and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
20.
Miscellaneous. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Customer and Crayon relating to the subject matter hereof, superseding all prior agreements, representations, warranties, promises or conditions (if any) in connection therewith, whether oral or written.
No modification, amendment, supplement to, or waiver of this Agreement or any of its provisions shall be binding upon the parties hereto unless made in writing and duly signed by both parties.
Neither this Agreement nor any part hereof may be assigned (whether by operation of law or otherwise) by either party without the other partyâs prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), and any such assignment will be void.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party may assign this Agreement to any successor in the event of a merger, sale or other disposition of a majority of its assets upon written notice to the other party, provided that Customer may not assign this Agreement if such assignee is a competitor of Crayon.
This Agreement will be binding upon the partiesâ respective successors and assigns.
This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, by facsimile or otherwise, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
Any rights or obligations set forth in this Agreement which by their nature are intended to survive, shall survive termination hereof. &nbsp.
The failure of either party to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.
The section titles in this Agreement are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
Except as otherwise provided herein, this Agreement is intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity.
