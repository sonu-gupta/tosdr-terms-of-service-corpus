EdX also indirectly collects usage information about your visit to the edX Site, as explained in the section below titled Cookies and Tracking Technologies.
EdX does not itself collect or store financial account numbers or identification issued by a governmental entity, employer, or other authority.
Instead, if you choose to make a purchase on the edX Site, for example a Verified Certificate, you will be directed to edXâs third-party payment processor and edXâs third-party ID verification service provider.
If you do not wish to submit the required authentication or payment information, then you will not be able to obtain a certificate via the edX Site.
EdX requires your Personal Information limited circumstances when you:

To the extent that edX associates the information that edX collects directly or indirectly with an individual (for example, you), the association is based on Personal Information in your account profile.


You may voluntarily choose to share additional Personal Information on the edX Site, for example:

in your edX account profile (and you may display a limited or full profile to other edX Site users);
in applying for financial assistance.
or
when participating in a course, forum, webinar, or other interactive experience on the edX Site (noting that in some cases, this information is shared with a third party that provides tools or other assistance for the edX Site or a course).

EdX encourages you to use discretion before voluntarily sharing additional Personal Information on the edX Site.
(If you later choose to delete your edX account, deletion of your Personal Information will be subject to the process and limits outlined below.)
 Members do not receive your Personal Information unless and until you enroll in a course.
If you enroll in a course, the Member that offers the course will receive Personal Information from your edX account profile plus the information that edX collects about your activity and performance in the course in which you enrolled.Cookies And Tracking Technologies on the edX SiteLike many companies, edX uses Cookies and other common Tracking Technologies on the edX Site and in email communications to help edX better understand your use and needs of the edX Site, current and future edX-related products and services, and how edX and Members can improve.
For example:

based on your cookie settings, edX tracks information indicating, among other things, which pages of the edX Site were visited, the order in which they were visited, when they were visited, and which hyperlinks and other user interface controls were used;
edX may log the IP address, operating system, and browser software (including mobile use and device type when you use edX native mobile apps) you used when accessing the edX Site, and edX may be able to determine from an IP address your Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of your point of connectivity.
and
edX may track and collect information from emails that edX sends to you, for example whether you opened the email or clicked on any links from the email.

EdX also partners with third parties to help us track and understand your activity on the edX Site, how you interact with edXâs social media, and how you find or may be referred to the edX Site.
Individual Members may separately use Tracking Technologies within their courses and email communications to understand your activity within a course and how you find or may be referred to a course on the edX Site.
EdX and Members use Cookies and other Tracking Technologies for the following purposes:

when necessary for system administration, security, and integrity to ensure the edX Site works properly for you.
Without these technologies, the edX Site may not function correctly;
to enable analytics, performance and functionality, to help edX and Members gather information about how visitors use the edX Site and monitor edX Site performance, and to enhance your experience by recognizing and remembering whether you have visited the edX Site before and may have any personal preferences.
and
to support marketing by enabling edX and Members to deliver content relevant to your interests on the edX Site and third-party sites based on how you interact with edX or Member advertisements or content.
EdX and Members use âfirst-partyâ cookies, which means cookies served by edX or an individual Member, and also âthird-partyâ cookies, which means cookies served by third parties that help edX and Members track this information.

You have some options for managing Cookies and other Tracking Technologies.
These include:


Modifying your browser settings: You should be able to control how and whether your web browser accepts Cookies by adjusting its privacy and security settings.
The âhelpâ feature of the menu bar on most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new Cookies, how to receive notification of new Cookies, and how to disable existing Cookies.
If you reject edXâs Cookies, many functions and conveniences of the edX Site may not work properly.

Opting-out of certain third-party tracking and advertising: Some of the third parties used by edX or a Member for Cookies and Tracking Technologies offer the ability to opt-out from their tracking by following processes described on their websites.
A list of some such third parties is maintained and available at the edX learner Help Center and includes, for some, links to applicable opt-out processes.
Neither edX nor any Member is responsible for the effectiveness of any third-party opt-out options.
