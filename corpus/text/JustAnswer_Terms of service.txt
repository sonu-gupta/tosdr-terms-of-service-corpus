B.
The Website


5.
JustAnswer Is a Venue.
Third-Party Content
The JustAnswer Site is a venue for informational and educational purposes, owned and operated by JustAnswer, that exists solely to broker relationships between Experts and potential Customers of those Experts who are interested in purchasing their Expert services.
JustAnswer is not in the business of providing or selling information or education that is within any Expertâs area of Expertise.
Users of the Site, not JustAnswer, provide the content in Posts (defined below).
The Experts determine which questions to answer.
Experts are not employees or agents of JustAnswer but are independent service providers using the Site to sell their Expert knowledge to Customers and, as such, together with Customers, are simply Users of the Site.
JustAnswer is not involved in the conversations between Customers and Experts and does not refer Customers to or endorse or recommend particular Experts.
You understand and acknowledge that JustAnswer cannot and does not edit, modify, filter, screen, monitor, endorse or guarantee the content of Posts.
JustAnswer shall not be liable for any acts or omissions of Experts, content in Posts or the ability of Experts to answer questions.
We cannot ensure that an Expert will complete a transaction.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, JustAnswer reserves the right, but is not obligated, to refuse to post or to remove any content and/or remove any Userâs access to the Site.

EMERGENCY QUESTIONS AND CRISIS SITUATIONS (particularly regarding medical or mental health issues) should not be directed to the Site and should, instead be directed immediately by telephone or in-person to qualified professionals (e.g.
in the U.S., call 911).
The Site is not the appropriate venue to deal with such situations.






6.
Posts Are Not Private or Confidential.
Anonymity
The Site is an Internet-based forum.
Information and materials submitted in the content of your questions, answers, requests for information, responses, profiles, signatures, qualifications, comments, and posts in the Expert Forum and other places where Users communicate on the Site (collectively "Posts") is not private or confidential, nor is it protected by attorney-client, doctor-patient, or any other privilege, and it may be read, collected, and used by others.
 For example, search engines may index your questions, answers, and other Posts to allow them to appear in search engine results (e.g.
if someone does a search on google.com or another search engine, your questions, answers, and other Posts on JustAnswer.com that relate to the search may appear in the search results list).
To help protect your privacy, use an anonymous user name and do not include information regarding your identity or contact information in your Posts.






7.
Verification.
No Reliance on the Term âExpertâ
Every Expert on the Site has had at least one credential relevant to the category in which they are answering questions verified by a third-party verification service, unless the Expert is answering questions in a category that is still being tested by JustAnswer in "Beta" (indicated by the "Beta" graphic after the category name on the category's landing page and/or the URL beginning with www.justanswer.com/...).
Details regarding the credential(s) verified for each verified Expert can be found by clicking the "Whatâs This" link next to the "Verified" logo associated with each Expert.
Other information about an Expert, not shown as verified, has been provided by the Expert but has not been verified.
Use of the term "Expert" by JustAnswer and on the Site is only meant to describe Users who answer questions on the Site, and not to guarantee any particular level of expertise of these Experts.
Regarding the verification process, JustAnswer contracts with third-party service providers to perform the verifications described above.
JustAnswer does not itself verify the credentials of the Experts.
The results of the verifications are only as accurate as the information provided to and by the third-party verification services, as of the time of the providing of information to and by the third-party verification services.
JustAnswer makes effort to verify, including using a third-party identity verification service, but cannot warrant or guarantee an Expert's purported identity.
user identification on the Internet is difficult.
For these reasons, JustAnswer cannot and does not represent, warrant or guarantee the truthfulness or accuracy of the credentials or identities of Users and information provided by Users including Experts.
You acknowledge that JustAnswer will not be liable for any loss or damages caused by your reliance on any information or content contained in Posts.





8.
Information Not Advice.
No Client-Professional Relationship

Answers of Experts on the Site are provided by Experts and are to be used by Customers for general information purposes only, not as a substitute for in-person evaluation or specific professional (medical, legal, veterinary, tax, financial, etc.) advice. For example, Experts in the Legal category will provide only general information about the law, and will not provide legal advice nor propose a specific course of action for a Customer.
By answering questions, Experts do not intend to form, and do not form attorney-client or doctor-patient relationships with Users of the Site.
The laws, regulations, other governing authorities, standards, practices and procedures that apply to your particular question may differ depending on your location and information typically discovered through in-person evaluations or visits.
Experts in some categories may be licensed, certified, educated, employed by or have experience in only particular jurisdictions.

No professional-client relationships shall be formed on the Site. Communications on this Site are not confidential and shall not be the subject of any associated privileges.
Communications on this Site are limited, as described above, do not involve in-person evaluations or visits, and do not include safeguards and procedures typical of in-person evaluations and visits.

Dispute Resolution

If you are an Expert (as defined in the Expert Agreement) with a dispute, claim or controversy of any sort and of any nature (collectively, âdisputeâ) against JustAnswer in your capacity as an Expert, then the arbitration agreement in the Expert Agreement applies instead of this one.
If your dispute with JustAnswer is made in your capacity as User who is not an Expert, then the following dispute resolution provisions apply.


This Section D.21 may be referred to as the partiesâ âDispute Resolution Agreement.â If you have a dispute with JustAnswer or if JustAnswer has a dispute with you and such dispute cannot be resolved informally, such dispute will be resolved on an individual basis in accordance with the provisions set forth below:

(a)Informal Resolution.
Prior to initiating mediation or arbitration, the party with a grievance must:
 (i) Notify the other party, in writing, of the facts of the dispute and all damages claimed.
Such a writing must be sent to the Userâs email address on file with JustAnswer, or JustAnswer LLC, P.O.
Box 29045, San Francisco, CA 94129 or legal@justanswer.com, whichever is applicable (âDispute Notificationâ).

(ii) The party receiving the Dispute Notification has thirty (30) days from receipt of the Dispute Notification to respond.
(iii) The other party then has 15 days to reply to the response.
 (b)Mediation..
If the dispute is not resolved informally, either party may make a demand for mediation, with the other partyâs consent, by filing a: (i) Request for AAA Online Mediation for Claims under $10,000 with the American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ).
or (ii) Request for Mediation with the AAA.
To file a request for mediation for a claim under $10,000, you must go to the following website: http://services.adr.org/eroom/faces/welcome_and_steps.jspx.
If that link does not work, please contact legal@justanswer.com at JustAnswer for updated information.
If you are requesting mediation for a claim that is worth $10,000 or more, you must go to the following website to file such a claim: https://www.adr.org/aaa/faces/services/disputeresolutionservices/.
If that link does not work, please contact legal@justanswer.com at JustAnswer for updated information.
If either party requests mediation and both parties consent to mediation, the costs of mediation will be borne equally by the parties.


(c) ARBITRATION.
ANY DISPUTE NOT RESOLVED INFORMALLY OR THROUGH MEDIATION SHALL BE RESOLVED BY FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION SO LONG AS SUCH DISPUTES ARISE IN ANY WAY OUT OF THESE TERMS, ANY TRANSACTION WITH JUSTANSWER, YOUR USE OF THE SITE AND/OR ANY JUSTANSWER SERVICE, OR ANY AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND JUSTANSWER.
THE ARBITRATION PROVISION EXTENDS TO DISPUTES UNDER THE TELEPHONE CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT (âTCPAâ).



YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT, BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, THAT THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTION AGREEMENT IS MADE IN THE COURSE OF INTERSTATE COMMERCE.
AND THAT THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT, 9 U.S.C.
Â§1 ET.
SEQ.
(THE âFAAâ) AND NOT STATE LAW GOVERNS THE INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCMENT OF THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTION AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE ARBITRABILITY OF DISPUTES, WHICH SHALL BE DECIDED BY THE ARBITRATOR.
THIS CHOICE OF LAW PROVISION APPLIES ONLY TO THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTION AGREEMENT, AND NOT TO THE REST OF THIS AGREEMENT OR TERMS.


YOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU AND JUSTANSWER ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY REGARDING ANY DISPUTE.
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE ARBITRATORâS DECISION WILL BE BINDING AND MAY BE ENTERED AS A JUDGMENT IN ANY COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION.


Arbitration Procedures: Disputes shall be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with the arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ) pursuant to its Consumer Arbitration Rules, as modified by the terms in this Dispute Resolution Agreement.
Copies of these rules can be obtained at the AAAâs website (www.adr.org) or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.
Either party can initiate a demand for arbitration.
Each party will be responsible for its own costs, including paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules.
The award rendered by the arbitrator may include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneysâ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses.
In the event of any inconsistency between this Dispute Resolution Agreement and the applicable rules of the AAA, this Dispute Resolution Agreement shall govern.

Consent to Jurisdiction in California: The parties agree that the arbitration will be conducted in San Francisco, California unless you and JustAnswer agree otherwise.

(d) CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
YOU AND JUSTANSWER EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT: 

(i) ANY ARBITRATION PROCEEDING WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.


(ii)YOU EXPRESSLY WAIVE YOUR ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, MASS, COLLECTIVE, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.


(iii)THERE SHALL BE NO CLASS CLAIMS, CONSOLIDATION, OR JOINDER ALLOWED IN ANY ARBITRATION BETWEEN THE PARTIES.
(iv) IF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IS FOUND INAPPLICABLE TO YOUR DISPUTE WITH JUSTANSWER, THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER WILL CONTINUE TO APPLY IN LITIGATION.
AND (v) YOU AGREE THAT THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF OUR CONTRACT AND THESE TERMS AND THAT IT MAY NOT BE SEVERED.
THE ARBITRATOR SHALL NOT CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS OF DIFFERENT USERS INTO ONE PROCEEDING, NOR SHALL THE ARBITRATOR HAVE THE POWER TO HEAR ARBITRATION AS A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.
SIMILARLY, ANY CLAIMS COVERED BY THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTION AGREEMENT THAT JUSTANSWER MAY HAVE AGAINST USER MAY NOT BE BROUGHT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION PROCEEDING.


(e) Survivability.
Right to Consult.

For those Users who have become Experts, nothing in this Agreement supersedes the terms of the Expert Agreement, and in the event of a conflict between this Agreement (or later versions of this Agreement) and the Expert Agreement, the terms of the Expert Agreement shall prevail.
If there is a conflict between an oral or written representation of any JustAnswer employee or agent and the Terms (other than modifications to the Terms executed in writing by the CEO or authorized-in-fact representative of JustAnswer), the Terms will prevail.
To the extent the Terms are in conflict or inconsistent with one another, this Agreement and the Privacy Policy will prevail over other Terms of the Site.

JustAnswerâs failure to exercise or enforce any of the Terms shall not constitute a waiver of JustAnswerâs right to exercise or enforce the Terms as to the same or another instance.

You agree that JustAnswer may assign the Terms to any other entity of its choosing, with or without notice to you.

E.
Additional Services


You may be presented with an offer for services outside of the Siteâs standard question-and-answer platform (âAdditional Servicesâ).

JustAnswer is only a venue which facilitates communication between Experts and potential Users of Additional Services.
It does not provide any of the substance or content of any Additional Service initiated through JustAnswerâs platform.

JustAnswer will in no way be liable for any acts or omissions of Experts in performing Additional Services (or any services) for you.

Additional Services may be: (1) âInformation Only;â or (2) âBeyond Information Only.â âInformation Onlyâ Additional Services are those additional services outside the Siteâs standard question-and-answer platform and may be conducted off the Site (either by phone, chat, email, remote desktop or any other third-party tool) but remain for general informational services only.
Additional Services that are âBeyond Information Onlyâ facilitate Usersâ exchange of services that are more than informational and that could potentially evolve into a professional relationship.
Charges for Additional Services will be described in the particular offer.
Any amounts a Customer pays for Additional Services are divided into two distinct and equal parts: (i) JustAnswerâs fee for enabling the request, offer and/or fulfillment of Additional Services and related services (âAdditional Site Access Benefitsâ).
and (ii) the Expertâs fee for the specific Additional Service provided to the User.
By accepting these Terms of Service, Experts agree that any charges to Customers for Additional Services will be divided into these two distinct and equal parts.
JustAnswer does not share in any Expertâs fee.
JustAnswerâs payment structures take into consideration fee sharing restrictions under various professional ethics rules.
Once you accept an offer for Additional Services, your payment method on file, if any, will be automatically charged the Additional Services amount.
If you have already asked a question, received a response and have not yet rated the Expert, if you then proceed to accept such Expertâs offer of Additional Services, you will be deemed to have accepted the response as if you had given such Expert a â5â rating (See Section 9, Rating the Expert, above).

23.
Special Provisions Relating to Remote Desktop Users


If you agree to accept Remote Desktop services (whether such services are Information Only or Beyond Information Only) from an Expert, you understand and agree that by accepting such offer for services, you are agreeing to give the Expert full access to and control over your computer (including permission to download and use software on your computer, gather system data, modify settings, etc.) for computer diagnosis, service and repair.
You agree that any third-party software acquired, installed or used during the Remote Desktop session, by you or by the Expert, will be licensed to you, and that any terms of use relating to the third-party software are agreed to by you, that JustAnswer may record via video the Remote Desktop Session for internal purposes, and that you will not use the Expertâs services to do anything unlawful.

Additional Services that are âBeyond Information Onlyâ in the Legal, Medical, Accounting, Health, Pet, and Large Animal categories facilitate Legal, Medical, Accounting, Health, Pet, and Large Animal Category Usersâ exchange of services that are more than informational and that could potentially evolve into a professional relationship.
