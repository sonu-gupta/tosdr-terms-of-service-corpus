The place of arbitration shall be in New York County, New York.
A single arbitrator shall be appointed by agreement between the parties or, failing such agreement, by the AAA.
The parties hereto agree that each party will only be permitted to bring claims against the other party only on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action or proceeding.
Unless both parties agree in writing otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate or join more than one personâs or partyâs claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a consolidated, representative, or class proceeding.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek interim or temporary injunctive relief in any court of appropriate jurisdiction with respect to any alleged breach of such partyâs intellectual property or proprietary rights.
If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then this arbitration provision shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.
