We provide this Privacy Policy to help you understand how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your information that we access in order to provide our âServicesâ.
When we say Services in this Privacy Policy, we mean our websites located at http://www.wps.com, http://note.wps.com/ and other websites operated by us through which our Services are provided (âSitesâ), our mobile device applications (âAppsâ), and our software products available for use via the Apps or via installation on windows personal computers (collectively, the âProductsâ).
This Privacy Policy applies to only those websites, products, services and applications included within the âServicesâ and does not apply to any third-party websites, products, services or applications, even if they are accessible through our Services.

Any information that is collected via our Services is covered by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected.
We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time in accordance with the law.
If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you of such changes by posting them on our websites or by sending you emails or other notifications, and we will update the Last Updated Date above to indicate when such changes became effective.
What Information We Collect about You
Your information is the data relating to you, which can be used to identify you directly or indirectly.
We collect and process your information to provide and improve our Services for you, to administer your use of our Services, and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our Services.
We will be transparent about the collection and use of your information so that you can make informed decisions.
You are not required to provide us with the information that we have requested, but if you choose not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our Products and Services or to respond to any queries you may have.
We collect the following information about you:
Basic Subscription Information.
If you create an account in connection with your use of any of the Services (âAccountâ or âWPS IDâ), either through our Sites or when you download and install our Products, weâll collect certain information about you, such as your name, email address, postal address, phone number and credit card information (âPIIâ).
If you create an Account using your login credentials from one of your accounts with certain third-party social networking services such as Google, Facebook or Twitter (each, an âSNS Accountâ), weâll be able to access and collect your name and email address and other PII that your privacy settings on the SNS Account permit us to access.
If you create an Account, we may also collect other information that is not considered PII because it cannot be used by itself to identify you.
Information Collected Using Cookies and Other Web Technologies.
Like many website owners and operators, we use automated data collection tools such as Cookies and Web Beacons to collect certain information.
âCookiesâ are small text files that are placed on your hard drive by a Web server when you access our Services.
We may use both session Cookies and persistent Cookies to identify that youâve logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our Services.
We may also use Cookies to monitor aggregate usage and Web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services.
Unlike persistent Cookies, session Cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser.
Although most browsers automatically accept Cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting Cookies.
Please note, however, that if you donât accept Cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services.
Some third-party services providers that we engage (including third-party advertisers) may also place their own Cookies on your hard drive on the basis of related arrangement.
Please note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of Cookies but not use of Cookies by such third parties.
âWeb Beaconsâ (also known as Web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our Services for several purposes, including to deliver or communicate with Cookies, to track and measure the performance of our Services, to monitor how many visitors view our Services, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising.
Unlike Cookies which are stored on the userâs hard drive, Web Beacons are typically embedded invisibly on Web pages (or in an e-mail).
At the same time, our Services may include third-party tracking tools without limitation to individual cookies, APIs (application programming interface) and SDKs (software development kit) which belong to part of the third-party services providers on behalf of WPS to collect and analyze technical data from you.
WPS or aforementioned third-party services providers on behalf of WPS collect such data not to identify any specific individuality or personality of yours but to understand how you access and use the Services at general manner.

Information Related to Use of the Services.
Our servers automatically record certain data about how a person uses our Services (âLog Dataâ), including that of both Account holders and non-Account holders (either, a âUserâ).

We use Log Data to administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) Log Data to improve, customize and enhance our Services by expanding and tailoring features and functionalities of our Services to our Usersâ needs and preferences.
We may use a personâs IP address to generate aggregate, non-identifying data about where our Services are used.
