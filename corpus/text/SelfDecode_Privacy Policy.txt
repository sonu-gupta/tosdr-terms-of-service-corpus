Your privacy is a top priority to SelfDecode.
We recognize how important it is to keep your information secure and confidential.
Privacy matters for your information, and in particular your Genetic Information. 
Our goal at SelfDecode is to create an environment where you can learn about your genetic makeup, easily discover information relevant to your genetics and lifestyle, and connect with other people on the same journey.
We aim to create tools that you can use to identify genetic variations of interest to you.
We also aim to provide information that you can consider when thinking about how to respond to those variants of interest.&nbsp.
In order for us to provide you with the services described above we need to analyze files that contain data about your genetic variations.
With this in mind please take the time to read through our Terms of Service.
This Privacy Policy describes the types of information we collect and describes how we use, maintain, protect, and disclose the data that we collect from you.
We are committed to protecting your information through our compliance with this Privacy Policy.
By accessing or using our Services, you accept our practices described in this Privacy Policy.
If you do not agree with our practices and policies, you can choose not to access or use our Services.

Except as otherwise described in this Policy, we do not share your Genetic Information or Self-Reported Information with third parties without your consent.
SelfDecode will use information that we collect about you or that you provide to us only as described in this Privacy Policy:
To provide and improve our Services.
We primarily use your information to present and provide our Services to you.
This includes the following:


providing you appropriate search results and personalized content;


processing your purchases;


verifying your identity;


recognizing you when you return to our Services;


providing you notices about your account;


notifying you about updates or changes to our Services or any services we offer or provide through it.

to perform quality control and quality improvement activities;

and

With your consent for the Services.
With your consent, as described in our Platform Consent, we do the following:


store the Genetic Information you upload;


provide you SelfDecode Insights;


In the following two subsections, we describe how we use your Genetic Information and Self-Reported Information in particular:
Genetic Information.
When you upload your Genetic Information, SelfDecode stores it.
When you choose to receive SelfDecode Insights, SelfDecode will use certain portions of your Genetic Information to produce your SelfDecode Insights.
For the SelfDecode Product(s) you purchase, you allow SelfDecode to use certain portion(s) of your Genetic Information to deliver the genetic interpretations offered by our Product(s) to you and improve them over time.
Your Genetic Information may be combined with that of other users as âAggregated Genetic Information.â Aggregated Genetic Information does not include any data that would reasonably permit someone to identify you individually.
SelfDecode may use Aggregated Genetic Information for its internal business purposes, such as to improve our products, data quality and laboratory processes.
Aggregated Genetic Information may also be used for our promotional purposes.
This could include describing users of our Services in general terms (e.g., â50% of our users are maleâ or âon average our users have 2% Neanderthal DNAâ).
Self-Reported Information.
Many traits are also influenced by non-genetic factors, as discussed in our Terms of Service and Platform Consent.
Your Self-Reported Information may be combined with your Genetic Information to improve interpretations of your Genetic Information, including SelfDecode Insights.
Some Products may require this information for purposes of interpreting your Genetic Information, but it is up to you to provide this information.
If you do not provide this information, you may not be able to purchase or use certain SelfDecode Products. When Do We Share Your Information? We will access your Genetic Information and relevant Account Information and Self-Reported Information only after you have authorized us to do so as part of subscribing to SelfDecode and purchasing a SelfDecode Product on the SelfDecode Platform.
We use the Genetic Information needed to offer you SelfDecode Product(s) and improve them over time.
We do the following:


maintain the confidentiality and security of the Genetic Information, Account Information and Self-Reported Information.
and


use the Genetic Information, Account Information and Self-Reported Information only for the specific purposes that you have authorized.


We may disclose Account Information, Self-Reported Information and information about your usage of our Services other than your Genetic Information only in the following circumstances:


To contractors, service providers and other third party vendors we use to support our business (such as for payment processing), and who are bound by contractual obligations to keep personal information confidential and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them.


If we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of SelfDecode, our users or others.
This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.


We may also disclose your personal information, including your Genetic Information:


To comply with law, a valid court order, a judicial proceeding, subpoenas, warrants, bankruptcy proceedings, or in connection with any legal process, provided that we will not disclose your Genetic Information without a valid subpoena or search warrant specific to your Genetic Information.
If we are required to disclose your information, we will do our best to provide you with notice in advance, unless we are prohibited by law from doing so.


To enforce or apply our Terms of Service and other agreements.


To a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution or other sale or transfer of some or all of SelfDecodeâs assets, in which information held by SelfDecode about our users is among the assets transferred.
This Privacy Policy would continue to apply to information collected while it was in place.


We may publicly share descriptive statistics about Aggregated Genetic Information, de-identified and aggregated Self-Reported Information, and usage of our Services.
Other than as described above, we will never provide your information to anyone for any purpose under any circumstances. What Choices Do You Have About How We Use and Share Your Information? We strive to provide you with choices about the information you provide to us.
We have the following mechanisms to give you the following controls over your information:
Tracking Technologies and âDo Not Track.â You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent.
If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of our website may not be accessible or not function in the proper way.
SelfDecode relies on third party ad networks to deliver relevant advertising messages on our behalf.
Because we do not deliver or track online ads we currently do not âlistenâ or respond to your selection of the âDo Not Trackâ option provided by your browser.
Advertising Networks.
We work with advertising service providers that collect non-personally identifying information from you when you visit the Site and other websites, in order to show ads for our Services that we think may be of interest to you after you visit our Services.
If you do not wish to receive our personalized ads, you can visit the opt-out pages of the Network Advertising Initiative (https://www.networkadvertising.org) or the Digital Advertising Alliance (http://www.aboutads.info) to learn about how to opt out of receiving personalized ads from their member companies.
Google Analytics.
SelfDecode works with Google Analytics to better understand our audience and users, to improve our marketing campaigns, and to enhance our services.
You can learn more about Google Analyticsâ privacy choices or opt out at any time.
Promotional Offers from SelfDecode.
If you do not wish to have your contact information used by SelfDecode to promote our Services, you can opt-out by changing your account settings.
You may not be able to opt out of receiving certain Service-related emails, such as communications about orders, billing, account creation, registration and policy updates.
If we have sent you a promotional email or other informational email not related to your order or account, the email will have an âunsubscribeâ feature that will allow you to opt-out of receiving future email distributions.
SelfDecode Insights.
SelfDecode interprets your Genetic Information to produce SelfDecode Insights when you request to receive that feature in your SelfDecode Account.
If you do not wish to have SelfDecode Insights produced for you, do not request to receive this feature or products related to it.
You do not need to receive your SelfDecode Insights in order to use other parts of the SelfDecode Platform.
Sharing Genetic Information with Others.
It is your choice to decide whether and with whom to share your Genetic Information and Insights.
This Privacy Policy focuses on how SelfDecode handles your Genetic Information to protect your privacy.
However, you may also choose to share your Genetic Information and Insights with others yourself.
You should be careful about doing so.
Please see our Platform Consent for further discussion. How Do You Access, Correct or Remove Your Information? In General.
You may contact Customer Support to request access to, correct or remove any personal information that you have provided to us.
We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.
Information that has already been de-identified and/or aggregated (including Aggregated Genetic Information) may not be retrievable or traced back for correction or removal from any database.
Account Closure.
You may also close your SelfDecode Account through your Account Settings.
If you close your SelfDecode Account, you will no longer have access through the Site or Services to your Genetic Information.
After closure of your account you will not be able to purchase any SelfDecode Products from the SelfDecode Platform without creating a new account and uploading your genetic file again.
After you close your SelfDecode Account, we retain some Account Information in your account related to your purchase history.
This enables us to provide you ongoing support regarding your prior purchases, and is also necessary for accounting, audit and compliance purposes.
We may also retain backup copies and archival files of your information to satisfy our state and federal legal obligations or regulatory requirements.
However, we will not share your information with any Partner or third party, except for information that has already been shared with your consent. How Do We Keep Your Information Secure? We limit access to your information to SelfDecodeâs employees and contractors who we believe need access to it to provide Services to you or to do their jobs.
In addition, we put in place industry standard physical, technical, and procedural safeguards designed to secure your Account Information, Self-Reported Information, Genetic Information and any other personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration and disclosure.
The transmission of information via the internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
We continue to evaluate and identify improved security techniques to protect your personal information.
However, we cannot guarantee that your information will not be accessed, altered or lost through a breach of any of our physical and electronic safeguards.  Changes to Our Privacy Policy We post any changes we make to our Privacy Policy on this page.
If we make material changes to how we treat our usersâ personal information, we will notify you by email to the email address specified in your account.
You are responsible for ensuring we have an up-to-date, active and deliverable email address for you.
You are also responsible for visiting our Services and this Privacy Policy from time to time to check for any changes.
All changes are effective immediately when we post them, and they apply to all access to and use of the Services from that point onward.
If you use our Services after we make changes to our Privacy Policy, you acknowledge and agree to the current version of the Privacy Policy. Questions or Comments To ask questions or comment about this Privacy Policy and our privacy practices, you may contact SelfDecode Customer Support.
