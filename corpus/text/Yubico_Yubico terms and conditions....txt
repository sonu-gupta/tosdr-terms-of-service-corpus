Choice of Law and Venue
If you are a U.S.
resident that has acquired Products as a Consumer Purchaser, Exhibit A (âAgreement to Arbitrate â U.S.
Consumer Purchaserâ) applies.
If you are not a U.S.
resident Consumer Purchaser, this Agreement shall be deemed to have been made in, and shall be construed pursuant to the laws of: (i) the State of California, U.S.A.
if you obtained the Products from Yubico, Inc..
and (ii) Sweden if you obtained the Products from Yubico AB.
In either event, the choice of law shall be without regard to the conflict of laws provisions thereof.
Furthermore, both parties consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal and State courts located in Santa Clara County in the State of California when California law applies and the courts located in Sweden, with Stockholm District Court as the court of first instance, when the laws of Sweden apply.


Other
The terms and conditions set forth or referenced herein constitute the entire understanding and agreement between you and Yubico and supersede all prior representations and agreements with respect to the subject matter herein.
This Agreement, including all rights and licenses granted herein, is not assignable, transferable or sub-licensable by you and any attempt to do so shall be null and void.
Any notice, report, approval or consent required or permitted hereunder must be in writing.
The waiver by Yubico of a breach of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach of this Agreement.
nor shall any delay by Yubico to exercise any right under this Agreement operate as a waiver of any such right.
If any provision of this Agreement shall be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect.
The parties agree that a material breach of this Agreement adversely affecting Yubicoâs proprietary or intellectual property rights in the Products, including the Software, would cause irreparable injury to Yubico and its Affiliates for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and that Yubico therefore shall be entitled to preliminary and permanent injunctive relief (without the requirement to post a bond) to address such a breach, in addition to any other remedies it may have hereunder or at law.

Exhibit A
Agreement to Arbitrate â U.S.
Consumer Purchaser.

(a) General:

If you are a U.S.
resident that has acquired Products as a Consumer Purchaser, you and Yubico agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Software (collectively, âDisputesâ) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a partyâs copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (the action described in the foregoing clause (ii), an âIP Protection Actionâ).
Without limiting the preceding sentence, you will also have the right to litigate any other Dispute if you provide Yubico with written notice of your desire to do so by email to legal@yubico.com within 30 days following the date you first purchase or obtain the Software (such notice, an âArbitration Opt-out Noticeâ).
If you donât provide Yubico with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice within the 30-day period, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any Dispute except as expressly set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above.
The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action or, if you timely provide Client with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, will be the state and federal courts located in the Northern District of California and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.
Unless you timely provide Client with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, you acknowledge and agree that you and Yubico are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding.
Further, unless both you and Yubico otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one personâs claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.
If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section will be deemed void.
Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this Section will survive any termination of this Agreement.

(b) Arbitration Rules:

The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the âAAA Rulesâ) then in effect, except as modified by this Section.
(The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/Rules or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.

(c) Arbitration Process:

A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules.
(The AAA provides a general Demand for Arbitration and a separate Demand for Arbitration for California residents).
The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAAâs roster of arbitrators.
If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.

(d) Arbitration Location and Procedure:

Unless you and Yubico otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.
If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and Yubico submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary.
If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.

(e) Arbitratorâs Decision:

The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules.
The arbitratorâs decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award.
Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
The arbitratorâs award of damages must be consistent with the terms of Section 8 (âLimitation of Liabilityâ) as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable.
The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimantâs individual claim.
If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneysâ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law.
Yubico will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneysâ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.

(f) Fees:

Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules.
However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Yubico will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
