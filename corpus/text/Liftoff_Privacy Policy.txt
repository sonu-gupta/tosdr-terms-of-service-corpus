Information that Site Visitors provide to us via the Site


A.

This information includes:

Generic geographic location consisting of IP address and explicit geographical categorization such as country or zip code and then granular latitude and longitude coordinates (please note that this is subject to the capability of the advertising exchange that we use, and so this data is not always collected by us)
Carrier

Android ID or Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA)

i.
Our Privacy Principles


Liftoffâs systems aggregate events/data at granularities that cover many users, as opposed to a specific user, unless the user consents.
For instance: users with iPhone X's in San Francisco have clicked on ads in app A 100 times and installed app B 50 times. 
Liftoff does not tie together events/data across apps in a user-specific way, without the user's consent.
For instance: we do not track that a person did X in app A and also Y in app B from a different publisher, if the person opts-out of interest-based advertising.
Instead, Liftoff only ties events/data from a given specific user within the context of a given app.
E.g.
user with app-local ID 123 installed app A, then finished the tutorial, then made a purchase.
This allows Liftoff to understand the conversion rates from one event to another within an app, but not track the activities of a user across different apps. 


Liftoff does not record or store personal information that the user cannot easily revoke, such as email address, physical address, photographs or phone number to personalize our advertising.
Liftoff relies upon device IDs to uniquely identify a user, and Liftoff solely relies upon the userâs consent in allowing Liftoff to access this information.
Liftoff does not export per-user data outside of Liftoff, except for validation purposes to a company that already has access to that data


C.
