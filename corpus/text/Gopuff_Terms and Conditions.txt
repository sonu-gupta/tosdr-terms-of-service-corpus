Dispute Resolution â Arbitration, No Class Actions.
ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SERVICES WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION, RATHER THAN IN COURT, except that you may assert claims in small
claims court if your claims qualify.
The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration Law apply to this Agreement.

If you do not want to arbitrate disputes with Gopuff and you are an individual, you may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending an email to our customer support team at support@gopuff.com within 30 days of the earlier of the day you first access or use the App and the day you first receive any of the Services.

If you intend to seek arbitration you must first send written notice to Gopuff of your intent to arbitrate (âNoticeâ).
The Notice to gopuff should be sent by any of the following means: (i) electronic mail to support@gopuff.com
.

THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.
HOWEVER, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT (INCLUDING INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF OR STATUTORY DAMAGES),
AND MUST FOLLOW THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT AS A COURT WOULD.

If you intend to seek arbitration you must first send written notice to GoPuffâs Customer Service Center of your intent to arbitrate (âNoticeâ).
The Notice to GoPuff should be sent by any of the following means: (i) electronic mail to
support@gopuff.com.
or (ii) sending the Notice by U.S.
Postal Service certified mail to our registered agent Corporation Service Company, 2711 Centreville Road, Suite 400, Wilmington, DE 19808.
The Notice must (x)
describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.
and (y) set forth the specific relief sought.
If we do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the notice is received, you or GoPuff may commence an arbitration proceeding.
The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ) under its rules as modified by this Agreement, including the AAAâs Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes.
The AAAâs rules are available
at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
The number of arbitrators shall be one.
All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this arbitration clause, but the arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement.
Payment of all
filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAAâs rules.
We will reimburse all AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees paid by you for claims totaling less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator determines that either
the substance of your claim or the relief sought is improper or not warranted, as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), in which case the payment of all such fees shall be governed by the AAA Rules.
In such case,
you agree to reimburse GoPuff for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.
GoPuff will not seek attorneysâ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claim or the
relief sought is improper or not warranted.
You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.
The arbitration will be conducted
in the English language.
Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating
to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or formation of this arbitration agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this arbitration agreement is void or voidable.
However, the preceding sentence
shall not apply to the paragraph below.

WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.
Further, you agree that the arbitrator may not consolidate proceedings or more than one personâs
claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding, and that if this specific proviso is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration clause shall be null and void.
If for any reason a claim
proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.
We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court for injunctive relief, including to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.

Applicable Law, Venue, and Jurisdiction.
 By using any Service, you agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal Law, and the Laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, without regard to principles of conflict of Laws,
will govern this Agreement and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and GoPuff.

Miscellaneous.
This Agreement may not be modified by you except by a writing executed by the duly-authorized representatives of GoPuff.
This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and will be binding upon each partyâs successors
and assigns.
GoPuffâs failure to enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision.
This Agreement and the licenses granted hereunder may be assigned by GoPuff but may not be assigned by you
without the prior express written consent of GoPuff.
If any provision hereof is or becomes, at any time or for any reason, unenforceable or invalid, no other provision hereof will be affected thereby and the remaining provisions will continue with the
same effect as if such unenforceable or invalid provisions will not have been inserted herein.
provided that the ability of either party to obtain substantially the bargained-for performance of the other will not have thereby been impaired.
It is expressly
understood that in the event either party on any occasion fails to perform any term hereof and the other party does not enforce that term, the failure to enforce on any occasion will not constitute a waiver of any term and will not prevent enforcement
on any other occasion.
Nothing contained in this Agreement will be deemed to constitute either party as the agent or representative of the other party or both parties as joint venturers or partners for any purpose.
In the event that either party is prevented
from performing, or is unable to perform, any of its obligations under this Agreement due to any cause beyond the reasonable control of the party invoking this provision, the affected partyâs performance will be extended for the period of delay
or inability to perform due to such occurrence.
The headings and captions contained herein will not be considered to be part of this Agreement but are for convenience only.
You and GoPuff agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
Sale of Goods will not apply to the interpretation or construction of this Agreement.
Your use of the Services may also be subject to other local, state, national, or international Laws.

Sponsor reserves the right to modify these T&Cs at any time, without notice to you,
so it is important to check the T&Cs periodically.
 These T&Cs do not alter in any way the terms or conditions of any other agreement you may have with Sponsor for other products or services.
Participation in the Program and/or redemption
of Rewards is considered acceptance of these T&Cs, the Privacy Policy, Sponsorâs End-User License and Terms of Service (the âEnd-User Licenseâ), and all other applicable operating rules, policies, and/or procedures that may
be published or modified by us from time to time on the Site or the App, each of which is incorporated by reference.
In the event of any conflict between these T&Cs and the End-User License, the End-User License shall control.
Sponsor may, in its sole and absolute discretion, cancel, change, suspend or modify any aspect of the Program and/or any Reward at any time, including the availability of any Reward, without notice. Your
continued access to or participation in the Program following any such changes or modifications confirms your acceptance of these T&Cs and such changes or modifications.
If you do not agree with these T&Cs, you must stop accessing and participating
in the Program. 

PROGRAM PERIOD:  This Program will continue until terminated, suspended, modified, and/or converted to another program by Sponsor, as determined by Sponsor in its sole discretion.

ELIGIBILITY:&nbsp.
To be eligible for the Program, you must have a valid customer account with Sponsor, have a physical address located within a valid Sponsor delivery zone, and be eligible to make purchases and receive services from
Sponsor.
The Program is not targeted towards, nor intended for use by, anyone under the age of eighteen (18).
If you are under eighteen (18), you may access and participate in the Program only under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees
to be bound by the terms of these T&Cs.
To enroll in the Program, you must create a valid customer account with Sponsor and make a valid purchase from the Site or the App.
Creation of a customer account may require that you provide the following information:
telephone number, e-mail address, physical address, and payment information.
Once you have a customer account, you are automatically enrolled in the Program and start earning Puff Points just by ordering.
You must provide true, accurate and complete information
as required, and you must keep your account information up to date at all times.
You may not create an account using another personâs name or information, including e-mail address and/or telephone number.
You are solely responsible for the activity
that occurs on your account and for keeping your account password secure.
You may never use another personâs account or registration information for the Program without permission.
You must notify us immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized
use of your account.
You should never publish, distribute or post login information for your account.
The Program is provided to individuals only.
Corporations, associations or other groups may not participate in the Program.
It is fraudulent for any
individual or company, association, or group to direct, encourage, or allow individuals to use a single account for the purpose of accumulating points for combined use.

EARNING POINTS:  Once you become a Member, you can begin earning Program points (âPuff Pointsâ) by purchasing items on the App or the Site.
The Rewards that are available to you through the Program are based on
the number of Puff Points that you earn.
Each product that is available on the App and the Site is assigned a point value, determined in Sponsorâs sole discretion.
Delivery fees, tips, taxes, and other charges do not count towards earning Puff Points.
Accrued Puff Points do not expire, as long as you have an active customer account with Sponsor.
Complete details and descriptions of eligible Program activities, how to earn Puff Points in the Program, Puff Point values for each product, and Puff Points needed to redeem Rewards will be available on the Site and the App.
Note that eligible activities
and the Puff Point values for products and activities are subject to change at any time in Sponsorâs sole discretion, but no change will be considered effective until such changes have been published on the Site and App.
You expressly agree that Sponsor shall not be responsible for the loss of any Points and/or Rewards that can be obtained through the Program, regardless of monetary value, in the event there is any catastrophic data or server error, criminal act, vandalism,
cyber-attack or other events which make it impossible for Sponsor to determine the number of Puff Point totals for any account or accounts.
Sponsor reserves the right to suspend, terminate, revalue or modify, without liability, or notice to Members, all or part of the Puff Points value structure and offers and any merchandise or service.
 Subject to the terms hereof, Sponsor reserves
the right to adjudicate all Puff Points discrepancies in its sole discretion, and the Members agree to abide with any such adjudication.
Purchases made before the Program begins or after Program ends will not be eligible.
Puff Points will be posted to your account upon completion of eligible orders.
Once posted to your account, all Puff Points will be immediately available for redemption.
Sponsor may freeze or eliminate Memberâs account if fraudulent activity is suspected and/or if purchases are not directly related to Memberâs own purchasing activity.
There are no participation or membership fees associated with the Program.
Puff Points accrued in connection with the Program are promotional, have no cash value and cannot be redeemed for cash.
If you terminate or otherwise delete your Sponsor customer
account, all Puff Points earned prior to such termination shall be deemed void, and you will not have the ability to redeem those Puff Points for Rewards.

POINTS REDEMPTION:  Puff Points may be redeemed for Rewards listed on the Site and App.
Rewards are available only while supplies last, and quantities may be limited.
 Sponsor may change at any time, and from time to time, the
available Rewards without notice.
 Member will not be able to redeem Puff Points for a Reward if Member has insufficient Puff Points for such Reward.
 Any items received as a result of redemption of Puff Points may not be exchanged or returned
for cash or credit.
Members can choose to redeem Rewards for which they have accumulated a sufficient number of Puff Points, or they can continue making purchases to continue accumulating Puff Points in order to redeem Rewards for which a greater number of Puff Points is
required.
You may only redeem one (1) Reward at a time.
When a Reward is redeemed, it becomes active on the Memberâs account.
Each active Reward must be used before another Reward can be redeemed.
If an active Reward is not used within the time
period indicated by Sponsor, it will expire and be deemed void.

REWARD CONDITIONS: The Program and/or the Rewards are void where prohibited by law.
 If a Reward becomes unavailable, Sponsor may substitute a prize of equal or greater value.
 Rewards are not redeemable for cash.
 Rewards
may be taxable, depending on the value of the item and the federal, state, and local tax laws applicable to Member.
 Members are solely responsible for reporting such items on their tax returns and paying any associated tax liability.
 Your
Puff Points and Rewards are personal to you and may not be sold, transferred, or assigned to or shared with, family, friends or other third parties or used by you for any commercial purpose.
Sponsor makes no warranty in any respect as to any Rewards,
merchandise or service available within the Program. 

CHANGES.
TERMINATION:&nbsp.
Sponsor may, in its sole and absolute discretion, cancel, change, suspend, or modify any aspect of your Program account, the Program, Puff Points, and/or any Reward at any time, including the availability of
any Reward, without notice.
 Sponsor may, in its sole and absolute discretion, terminate or suspend any Memberâs participation in the Program for breach of these T&Cs, or for taking any actions that are inconsistent with the intent of these
T&Cs.
 If you violate any of the provisions contained in these T&Cs, Sponsor reserves the right to issue you a warning regarding the violation or immediately terminate or suspend any accounts you have created using the Program.
You agree
that Sponsor need not provide you notice before terminating or suspending your account.
Sponsor reserves the right at its sole discretion to prohibit any Member from participating in any aspect of the Program, if Sponsor deems or suspects that such Member
has engaged in or has attempted to engage in any of the following: (a) acting in violation of these T&Cs.
(b) damaging, tampering with or corrupting the operation of the Program, Site or App.
(c) acting with intent to annoy, harass or abuse any other
person.
(d) any inappropriate, uncooperative, disruptive, fraudulent, potentially fraudulent, or unusual behavior or activity.
or (e) activity deemed in the sole discretion of Sponsor to be generally inconsistent with the intended operation of the Program.
 Any decision Sponsor makes relating to termination or suspension of any Memberâs participation in the Program shall be final and binding in all respects.
Sponsor shall be the sole determiner in cases of suspected abuse, fraud, or breach of
these T&Cs or intent of these T&Cs.

RELEASE: By participating in the Program, Members release Sponsor, its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, suppliers, advertising and promotions agencies and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents from any and
all liability for any loss, harm, damages, cost or expense, including, without limitation, property damages, personal injury and/or death, arising out of or in any way connected to the Program and/or the use of any Rewards. 

INDEMNIFICATION:  Members agree to indemnify, defend and hold Sponsor and its representatives and agents harmless from and against any and all third party claims, demands, liabilities, costs or expenses, including attorneyâs
fees and costs, arising from, or related to any breach by Member of any of these T&Cs or any violation by Member of applicable law. 

GOVERNING LAW:  The Program and these T&Cs are governed by federal law and, to the extent state law applies, the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, without any reference to its choice of law provisions.
 You may not
assign your rights or obligations under these T&Cs to any other person or entity.
YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING ANY CLAIMS 
arising from or relating to these Terms 
ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. 

SEVERABILITY. If any provision or part of a provision of these T&Cs is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these T&Cs and does not affect the validity and enforceability
of any remaining provisions.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION â ARBITRATION.
NO CLASS ACTIONS. ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE PROGRAM OR THESE T&CS WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION, RATHER THAN IN COURT, except that you may assert claims
in small claims court if your claims qualify.
The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to these T&Cs.
If you do not want to arbitrate disputes with Sponsor and you are an individual, you may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending an e-mail to our customer support team at support@gopuff.com within thirty (30) days of the earlier of (i) the day
you first access or use the Site or the App and (ii) the day you first earn Puff Points under the Program.
THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.
HOWEVER, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT (INCLUDING INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF OR STATUTORY DAMAGES)
AND MUST FOLLOW THE TERMS OF THESE T&CS AS A COURT WOULD.
If you intend to seek arbitration you must first send written notice to Sponsorâs Customer Service Center of your intent to arbitrate (âNoticeâ).
The Notice to Sponsor should be sent by any of the following means: (i) electronic
mail to support@gopuff.com or (ii) sending the Notice by U.S.
Postal Service certified mail to our registered agent Corporation Service Company, 2711 Centreville Road, Suite 400, Wilmington, DE 19808.
The Notice must (x) describe the nature and basis
of the claim or dispute and (y) set forth the specific relief sought.
If we do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the notice is received, you or Sponsor may commence an arbitration proceeding.
The arbitration will
be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ) under its rules, as modified by this Agreement, including the AAAâs Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes.
The AAAâs rules are available at www.adr.org
or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
The number of arbitrators shall be one.
All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this arbitration clause, but the arbitrator is bound by the terms of these T&Cs.
Payment of all filing, administration
and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAAâs rules.
We will reimburse all AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees paid by you for claims totaling less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator determines that either the substance of your claim
or the relief sought is improper or not warranted, as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), in which case the payment of all such fees shall be governed by the AAA Rules.
In such case, you agree to reimburse Sponsor
for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.
Sponsor will not seek attorneysâ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claim or the relief sought is improper or
not warranted.
You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.
The arbitration will be conducted in the English language.
Judgment
on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability,
unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or formation of this arbitration agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this arbitration agreement is void or voidable.
However, the preceding sentence shall not apply to the paragraph
below.
WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.
Further, you agree that the arbitrator may not consolidate proceedings or more than one personâs
claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding, and that if this specific proviso is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration clause shall be null and void.
If for any reason a claim
proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.
We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court for injunctive relief, including to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you hereby agree that: (i) any and all disputes, claims and causes of action arising out of or connected with this Program or any Points or Rewards shall be resolved individually, without resort to any
form of class action.
(ii) any and all claims, judgments and awards shall be limited to actual out-of-pocket costs incurred, including costs associated with participating in this Program, but in no event attorneysâ fees.
and (iii) under no circumstances
will you or anyone else be permitted to obtain awards for, and you hereby waive all rights to claim, punitive, incidental and consequential damages and any other damages, other than for actual out-of-pocket expenses.
In addition, you hereby waive any
and all rights to have damages multiplied or otherwise increased.

OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. 

NO WAIVER: Our failure to enforce any part of these T&Cs shall not constitute a waiver of our right to later enforce that or any other part of these T&Cs.
Waiver of compliance in any particular instance does not mean that we will
waive compliance in the future.
In order for any waiver of compliance with these T&Cs to be binding, we must provide you with written notice of such waiver through one of our authorized representatives.
