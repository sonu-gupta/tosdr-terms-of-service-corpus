Instructions on cancellations

Right of Cancellation

You have the right to cancel this contract within 100 days without providing a reason.
The cancellation period will expire after 100 days, starting from the day you, or the recipient, received the order in its entirety.
To exercise the right of cancellation, you must inform us (skatedeluxe GmbH, Am Heuberg 25, 37308 Schimberg, Germany, phone number: +49 3641 79 97 250, e-mail address: service.en@skatedeluxe.com) of your decision to withdraw from this contract by means of an unequivocal statement (e.g.

You may use the attached withdrawal form template, but it is not obligatory.

To meet the cancellation deadline, it is sufficient if you communicate your intentions to exercise your right of revocation before the cancellation period has expired.

Effects of Cancellation

The reimbursement will be carried out using the same means of payment used for the initial transaction unless expressly agreed otherwise.

We may withhold reimbursement until we have received the goods back or you have supplied evidence of having sent back the goods, whichever happens first.
