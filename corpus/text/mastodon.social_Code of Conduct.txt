Cross-posting from Mastodon to other platforms is fully permitted.
Cross-posting into Mastodon from another platform is permitted under the following terms:


The posts do not include platform-specific references, e.g.
talking about "here" meaning Twitter, or including text from other non-Mastodon users verbatim (e.g.
cross-posted quote tweets)
The account is at least semi-regularly monitored by the author, so that interactions from Mastodon users are not ignored
The account being cross-posted is owned by the same person.
