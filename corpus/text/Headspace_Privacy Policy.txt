Cookie-Based Marketing Opt-Out
Like most companies, we partner with third parties, such as Facebook and Google, to manage our marketing of Headspace on other platforms, where such advertising is based on your past visits to our Products.
These third party partners may use technologies, such as cookies, to gather information about your activities on the Products to deliver such advertising to you when you visit their platforms.
For instance, if you visit www.headspace.com, a cookie may be attached to your browser in the form of the Facebook Pixel that allows Headspace to deliver advertising to you on the Facebook platform.
You can opt-out of the above-referenced cookie-based retargeting by visiting the Headspace Cookie Policy and clicking âopt-out of marketing / analytics cookiesâ at the bottom of the page.
Doing so will erase all current marketing cookies and disable the placement of future marketing cookies.
We do NOT use cookies so that third parties can serve ads to you about their own products or services.
We do NOT sell or rent your personal information to any third parties for their own advertising or marketing purposes.
