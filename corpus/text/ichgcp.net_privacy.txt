WHAT IS A COOKIE?

A cookie is a small file that can be placed on your device that allows us to recognise and remember you.
It is sent to your browser and stored on your computerâs hard drive or tablet or mobile device.
When you visit our sites, we may collect information from you automatically through cookies or similar technology.
 

HOW DO WE USE COOKIES?

Advertising â cookies that are used to collect information about your visit to our site, the content you have viewed, the links you have followed and information about your browser, device, and your IP address.
Cookies are a key part of how we deliver advertising on our sites.
Among other uses, they allow us to show more relevant advertising to people who visit ferates.com by showing you adverts that are based on your browsing patterns and the way you have interacted with our site.
We can then show you adverts which we believe may interest you.
The advertising techniques we use do not collect information such as your name, email
address, postal address, or phone number.
We sometimes use information such as your IP
address and browser type and sometimes share some limited aspects of this with third parties for advertising purposes.
We may also share online data collected through cookies and similar technology with our advertising partners.
This means that when you are on another website, you may be shown advertising based on your browsing patterns on other sites that we have obtained from our advertising partners.
Online retargeting is another form of online advertising that allows us and some of our advertising partners to show you advertising based on your browsing patterns and interactions with other sites.
The use of cookies may mean that when you are on another site, you may be shown advertising based on what you have looked at on ferates.com.
For example, if you have visited the website of an online clothes shop, you may start seeing adverts from that same shopping site displaying special offers or showing you the products, you were browsing.
This allows companies to advertise to you if you leave their website without making a purchase.
