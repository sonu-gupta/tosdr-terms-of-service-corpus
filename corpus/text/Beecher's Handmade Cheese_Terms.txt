Dispute Resolution.
Binding Arbitration
Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Sugar Mountain and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of arbitration by following the instructions set forth below.
No class or representative actions or arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration agreement.
In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial.

No Representative Actions.
You and Sugar Mountain agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms, the Sites or a Product is personal to you and Sugar Mountain and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.

Arbitration of Disputes.
Except for small claims disputes in which you or Sugar Mountain seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county of your billing address or disputes in which you or Sugar Mountain seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, you and Sugar Mountain waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms, the Sites or a Product resolved in court.
Instead, for any dispute that you have against Sugar Mountain or relating in any way to the Sites or a Product, you agree to first contact Sugar Mountain and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim (âNoticeâ) to Sugar Mountain by email at ccustomerlove@beecherscheese.com with âClaim Resolutionâ in the subject line.
The Notice must (a) include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number.
(b) describe the nature and basis of the claim.
and (c) set forth the specific relief sought.
Our notice to you will be similar in form to that described above.
If you and Sugar Mountain cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after such Notice is received, then either party may submit the dispute to binding arbitration administered by JAMS or, under the limited circumstances set forth above, in court.
All disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator.
Arbitration proceedings will be held in King County, Washington or may be conducted telephonically or via video conference for disputes alleging damages less than S10,000, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (âJAMS Rulesâ).
The most recent version of the JAMS Rules is available on the JAMS website and is hereby incorporated by reference.
You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive your opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason.

You and Sugar Mountain agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 13 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.
Â§ 1, et seq.
(the âFAAâ), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.
As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability.
The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individualâs claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.

The arbitrator, Sugar Mountain, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including all information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the dispute(s) therein.
The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary.
The duty of confidentiality does not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.

You and Sugar Mountain agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee and Sugar Mountain will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs.
For any arbitration initiated by Sugar Mountain, Sugar Mountain will pay all JAMS fees and costs.
You and Sugar Mountain agree that the state or federal courts of the State of Washington and the United States sitting in King County, Washington have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.

Any claim arising out of or related to these Terms, the Sites or a Product must be filed within one year after such claim arose.
otherwise, the claim is permanently barred, which means that you and Sugar Mountain will not have the right to assert the claim.

You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section 13 by sending a written opt-out notice to Sugar Mountain by email at customerlove@beecherscheese.com with âArbitration Opt-outâ in the subject line.
In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration.
By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve disputes in accordance with Section 14.

If any portion of this Section 13 is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms.
(b) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section 13 or the partiesâ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Section 13.
and (c) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.
Further, if any part of this Section 13 is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section 13 will be enforceable.

14.
Governing Law and Venue
Any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms, the Sites or a Product will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of Washington, except to the extent preempted by U.S.
federal law, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of Washington or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
Any dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court will be resolved in the state or federal courts of Washington and the United States, respectively, sitting in King County, Washington.
