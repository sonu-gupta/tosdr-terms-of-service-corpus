Governing Law and Arbitration.
No Class ActionThese Terms and Conditions, its subject matter and Duolingoâs and your respective rights under these Terms and Conditions, as well as and any claim, cause of action or dispute (âclaimâ) arising out of or related to these Terms and Conditions, shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, United States of America, excluding the conflict of law provisions of that or any other jurisdiction, regardless of your country of origin or where you access the Service.
ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OR THE SERVICE WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION, RATHER THAN IN COURT, except for Duolingoâs right to seek injunctive relief as set forth below.
Unless otherwise expressly required by applicable law, each party shall bear its own attorneysâ fees without regard to which party is deemed the prevailing party in the arbitration proceeding.
If you do not want to arbitrate disputes with Duolingo and you are an individual, you may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending an email to legal@duolingo.com within 30 days of the day you first access or use the Service.
If you intend to seek arbitration you must first send written notice to Duolingoâs Administration Office of your intent to arbitrate (âNoticeâ).
The Notice to Duolingo should be sent by any of the following means: (i) electronic mail to legal@duolingo.com.
or (ii) sending the Notice by U.S.
Postal Service certified mail to Duolingo, Inc., Attention: Legal, 5900 Penn Ave.
Pittsburgh, PA 15206.
The Notice must (x) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.
and (y) set forth the specific relief sought.
and (z) set forth your name, address and contact information.
If we intend to seek arbitration against you, we will send any notice of dispute to you at the contact information we have for you.
The arbitration will be conducted before a neutral single arbitrator in the County of Allegheny in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, whose decision will be final and binding, and the arbitral proceedings will be governed by JAMS under its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the âJAMS Rulesâ) as modified by these Terms and Conditions.
The JAMS Rules are available at www.jamsadr.com.
All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this arbitration clause, but the arbitrator is bound by the terms of these Terms and Conditions.
If you initiate arbitration, your arbitration fees will be limited to the filing fee set forth in the JAMS Rules.
We will reimburse all other JAMS filing, administration and arbitrator fees paid by you, unless the arbitrator determines that the arbitration was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, in which case the payment of all such fees shall be governed by the JAMS Rules.
The arbitration will be conducted in the English language.
Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
For any claim where the potential award is reasonably likely to be $10,000 or less, either you or Duolingo may elect to have the dispute resolved through non-appearance-based arbitration.
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, YOU AND DUOLINGO EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDING WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.
If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, YOU AND DUOLINGO EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.
If a court of competent jurisdiction finds the foregoing arbitration provisions invalid or inapplicable, you and Duolingo agree that all claims arising out of or related to these Terms and Conditions must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in the County of Allegheny in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and you and Duolingo each agree to submit to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating all such claims.
Notwithstanding the above, you agree that Duolingo shall still be allowed to apply for and obtain injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.

MiscellaneousThese Terms and Conditions constitute the entire agreement between Duolingo and you concerning the subject matter hereof.
In the event that any of the Terms and Conditions are held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provisions shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms and Conditions shall otherwise remain in full force and effect.
A waiver by Duolingo or you of any provision of these Terms and Conditions or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof.
