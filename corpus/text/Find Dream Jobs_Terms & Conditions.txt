Search Works Media, LLC ("we," "us," and "our") operates websites displaying job listings that we create (each a âSiteâ or collectively, the "Sites") and provide job and career related content.&nbsp.
By accessing and using the Sites, you agree to and accept these Terms &amp.
Conditions, as well as our Privacy Policy and any additional terms, conditions and policies published on our Sites (collectively, the âAgreementâ).&nbsp.
If you do not agree to and accept the terms of the Agreement in their entirety, you do not have permission to visit and/or use any of our Sites. 

Mandatory Arbitration.
These Terms &amp.
Conditions contain a mandatory arbitration provision, as detailed below, that requires you to arbitrate, individually, all disputes or claims that you may have with us, our parent, related parties, advertiser clients and marketing partners (collectively, âMarketing Partnersâ) who are third-party beneficiaries of the mandatory arbitration provision.&nbsp.
Thus, for example, if you provide prior express written consent to be contacted via telemarketing or SMS/text messaging, any claims that you may have regarding any telemarketing or SMS/text messages that you receive are subject to the mandatory arbitration provision.&nbsp.
The mandatory arbitration provision also waives your right to participate in a class action or multi-party arbitration.&nbsp.
There are two narrow exceptions to the mandatory arbitration provision: (1) you may opt-out by providing written notice of your decision to do so within thirty (30) days of the date that you first register on a Site.
and (2) you may opt-out by filing a claim in Small Claims Court provided the requirements described below are met.


How the Sites Work.  We and our search partners comb the Internet for job listings including those related to the parameters our users provide (âJob Listingsâ).&nbsp.
We also provide job and career related content that currently includes information on education, job searches, career advice, interviewing techniques and salaries and benefits.&nbsp.
We provide the Job Listings to our users in exchange for our users providing us with certain information about themselves that enables us to identify products and services that may interest them and sharing this information with our marketing partners.&nbsp.
Our marketing partners compensate us for connecting them with interested consumers.  
To qualify to get access to the Job Listings, youâll need to enter a valid e-mail address as well as your name, address, and date of birth.
Weâll also ask a series of survey questions relating to the type of job youâre looking for including your education and skills and may seek other information to help us narrow the Job Listings.&nbsp.
We may also ask other questions and use all of this information to tailor the products and/or services our marketing partners may offer you.&nbsp.
