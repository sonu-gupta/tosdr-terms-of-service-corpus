Liberty Wireless reserves the right to require a guarantor prior to offering any Services to Minors.
We may decline acceptance of your application at our discretion.
II.
Payment, Charges, Pre-Payment and Deposit In compliance with the applicable provisions of the Telecoms Competition Code and Media Code, Liberty Wireless may determine and impose Charges, fees, and any other billing and payment terms by providing prior notice to the Customer, such that any variation or revision of any of the terms set out above shall take effect as from the date determined by Liberty Wireless.
We will bill you monthly or more frequently if your usage exceeds or is likely to exceed your credit limit.
Please note that we do not store any personal card details.
If you update a card for a particular phone number, we are obligated to charge only from the newly added card and not the old one.
This does not include other phone numbers that the customer might have.
In the absence of fraud or manifest error, all our records concerning your usage and Charges are conclusive evidence of the accuracy and completeness of all matters stated.
Your bill will reflect the Charges based on the terms and conditions of the Services provided to you.
We may, at our discretion, authorize any entity within the Liberty Wireless Group of Companies to issue bills and collect payment of Charges on our behalf.
Unless otherwise stated, all Charges payable are exclusive of any stamp duty, value added, goods and services or similar taxes or duties and government charges (âTaxesâ).
You shall be solely liable and shall pay and indemnify Liberty Wireless in respect of all applicable Taxes.
If any deduction or withholding for or on account of Tax is imposed by Applicable Laws (or the laws of any jurisdiction outside Singapore) in respect of any payment due to us, such deduction or withholding shall be solely borne by you and the amount payable to us shall be increased by such amount so deducted or withheld as is necessary to ensure that we receive payment equal to the amount which we would have received in the absence of such deduction or withholding.
Without prejudice to the third Clause of the section entitled âPayment, Charges, Pre-Payment and Depositâ you will only be charged for the Services that you have subscribed to, ordered, used or as stipulated in accordance with the Agreement.
You must specify which Services under your bill you are making payment for if you have subscribed to more than one of the Services.
In the event you do not identify the Services for which payment has been made, we reserve the right to allocate or apply any payment you make towards any outstanding amount for any Services in such manner, priority, order and proportion, as we deem appropriate.
Your account balance is due on the due date as stated in our invoice (âDate of Billâ).
You are required to pay your bill by the Date of Bill.
If you choose to contest any Charges that you have paid, you have sixty (60) days to do so from the date on which the Charges were deducted or paid.
An administrative charge may be imposed for retrieving any record in relation to the disputed Charges.

Reasons why you are disputing the relevant Charges; and
The amount in dispute.

We shall respond to you in writing within thirty (30) days from the date we receive your notification of dispute.
Upon the resolution of dispute being in our favour, you have to pay the disputed amount immediately.
In such cases, we may claim from you any legal costs, interest and collection expenses incurred by us.

Refer the matter to the Small Claims Tribunal (SCT), if the matter is within the SCTâs jurisdiction;
Jointly submit the dispute to arbitration in Singapore.

We may, at our discretion, allow payment for Services to be made via credit card or debit card (Payment Method).
You must inform us immediately in writing if your credit card or debit card is lost, stolen, expired, terminated, or if you intend to terminate payment via credit card or debit card.

It is your responsibility to ensure that you keep us updated in the event of any material changes to your credit card details.

VIII.
Porting Users who are already subscribed to a post-paid service with another Mobile Services Provider (âDonor Operatorâ) can port-in their numbers to Circles.Life under the following conditions:



The number to be ported-in is under a post-paid offer with the Donor Operator;




The number to be ported-in is currently active and not suspended with the Donor Operator.

Users requesting a port-in will be given a temporary number to start availing Circles.Life services until the port-in is successfully processed.
The temporary number will be terminated after a successful port-in. If the owner of the number to be ported-in is a different person from the User, the identification details provided by the User to Circles.Life will not match the identification details registered with the Donor Operator.
In this scenario, the owner of the number will have to provide his/her NRIC/ID and complete an authorization form available for download on the Circles.Life app.
Post this, Circles.Life will help transfer the ownership of the number to be ported-in from the current owner of the number to the User by liasing with the Donor Operator.
The User will have to upload the aforementioned documents through the Circles.Life app in order to avail the port-in.
In particular, a port-in request with transfer of ownership cannot be submitted upon checkout when the User purchases his/her plan.
Circles.Life reserves the right to accept or reject the aforementioned documents at its discretion. Circles.Life reserves the right to correct the Donor Operator and reinitiate port-in in case the User indicated the wrong Donor Operator in the port-in request form. The Donor Operator may withhold the porting request due to outstanding balance or for reasons beyond the control of Circles.Life.
Under such scenarios a port-in may not be possible and Circles.Life does not bear any responsibility fo resulting inconvenience or personal losses. Please note that any cancellation of a port-in request after submission of the aforementioned request can be permitted only at the discretion of Circles.Life. New Users can initiate a port-in request at the time of ordering a new service with Circles.Life. Existing Circles.Life users can request to port-in numbers to Circles.Life service through the Circles.Life app. Circles.Life numbers are ineligible for port-in through Circles.Life.
In particular, mobile numbers part of the number ranges 8742xxxx or 8808xxxx are ineligible. If existing Circles.Life Users initiate a port-in request through Circles.Life for another number that prior to porting-in is with a Donor Operator, their current Circles.Life mobile numbers will be switched with the ported-in number.
The User will then forfeit ownership of the Circles.Life number that was assigned to him/her previously.
The Circles.Life number will be quarantined and will become available to be potentially sold to the general public after 90 calendar days. Any User that initiates a port-in request will be notified when the port-in is successfully processed. Circles.Life promotions applicable to the existing users and new port-in users will continue to apply after a successful port-in.
