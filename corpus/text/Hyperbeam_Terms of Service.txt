We each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services (collectively, âDisputesâ) will be resolved solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding.
You and Company agree that the U.S.
Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement, and that you and Company are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.
This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.

Exceptions. As limited exceptions to Section 21(a) above: (i) we both may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies.
and (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.

Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the âAAA Rulesâ) then in effect, except as modified by this Agreement.

Arbitration Costs. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules, and we wonât seek to recover the administration and arbitrator fees we are responsible for paying, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous.
If we prevail in arbitration weâll pay all of our attorneysâ fees and costs and wonât seek to recover them from you.
If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneysâ fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.

Injunctive and Declaratory Relief. Except as provided in Section 21(b) above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that partyâs individual claim.
To the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration.
The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.

Class Action Waiver. YOU AND COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
Further, if the partiesâ Dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another personâs claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.

Severability. With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 21(f) of this Agreement (âClass Action Waiverâ), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement will still apply.
