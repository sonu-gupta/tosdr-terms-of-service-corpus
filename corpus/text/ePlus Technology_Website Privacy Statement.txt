Cookie and similar technologies that collect Personal Data


Cookies

This website uses a technology called a "cookie".
A cookie is a small data file that a website can place on your computerâs hard drive, where your internet browser files are kept.
A cookie saves you the trouble of reentering certain information in some registration areas because cookies can be used to enable a site to ârememberâ information a visitor has previously inputted.
A cookie also helps deliver content user-specific information to you and track how sections of the website are used.
Cookies can be placed on your computer both by us and by third parties with whom we have a contractual relationship, such as web analytic services and advertising network services.
With most Internet browsers or other software, you can change your browser settings to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored.
Please check your browser instructions to learn more about these functions.
If you reject cookies, functionality of the site may be limited, and you may not be able to take advantage of many of the site's features.
Click here to see our website cookie policy. 
 

Web beacons

Our websites and emails use a technology known as web beacons (also known as an âaction tagâ or âclear GIF technologyâ) that allows the collection of web log information.
A web beacon is a tiny graphic on a web page or in an e-mail message designed to track pages viewed or messages opened.
Web log information is gathered when you visit one of our websites by the computer that hosts our website (called a "webserver").

Web beacons also help analyze the effectiveness of websites by measuring the number of visitors to a site or how many visitors clicked on key elements of a site.
 

Do Not Track

There are different ways you can prevent tracking of your online activity.
One of them is setting a preference in your browser that alerts websites you visit that you do not want them to collect certain information about you.
This is referred to as a Do-Not-Track (âDNTâ) signal.
Please note that currently our websites and web-based resources do not respond to these signals from web browsers.
At this time, there is no universally accepted standard for what a company should do when a DNT signal is detected.

 

Google Analytics

Google Analytics is used to help make our website work better and to help us understand what parts of the website are being utilized.
Google Analytics uses technical tools, such as first-party cookies and JavaScript code, to collect information about visitors.
Google Analytics service tracks visitors to the site who have JavaScript enabled.
Google Analytics anonymously tracks how visitors interact with a website, including where they came from and what they did on a site.
Google Analytics collects the information set forth above from users.
 
This information is used to administer and update the website, and we will also assess whether the visitors to the site match the expected site demographics and determine how key audiences are navigating the content.
 
First-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) will be used to report how your ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to this site.
 
A.
Opt-Out Provision:
Google analytics offers an opt-out provision for website visitors who do not want their data to be collected.
You can receive more information about this option here: http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.


B.
Google's Use of Data:
Google and its wholly owned subsidiaries may retain and use, subject to the terms of its Privacy Policy (located at http://www.google.com/privacy.html, or such other URL as Google may provide from time to time), information collected in your use of the Google Analytics Information Disclosures and Sharing.
 

Social Media Plugins

Our websites use Social Media Plugins to enable you to easily share information with others.
When you visit our websites, the operator of the social media plugin that is on our website can place a cookie on your computer that lets that operator recognize individuals on their website who have previously visited our sites.
If you have previously logged into the social media website while browsing on our website, social media plugins allows that social media website to receive directly identifiable information about you that shows you have visited our website.
The social media plugin collects this information for visitors who have logged into social networks, whether or not they specifically interact with the plugin on our website.
