In the second step, you will then automatically receive an e-mail with a confirmation or activation link, which you should also confirm or activate.
That way we ensure that the e-mail address entered on our website is, in fact, yours.
The collection and processing of the userâs e-mail address serves the purpose of delivering the newsletter.
The collection and processing of further personal data as part of the registration process serves the purpose of preventing the misuse of our newsletter or the e-mail addresses used.
In addition, the processing described above serves to enable us to prove that you have given us your consent.
The processing of cookie and measurement data serves the purpose of tracking the success and reach of our newsletter.
The legal basis for the processing of personal data that is required for the technical provision of the newsletter, as well as the processing of cookie and measurement data, is your consent according to art.
