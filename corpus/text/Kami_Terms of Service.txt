Waiver, Assignment and Severability Waiver by Kami of any default or breach by you of any provision contained in this Agreement does not constitute a waiver of any subsequent default or breach of the same or any other provision of this Agreement.
If any part of this Agreement shall be held invalid, illegal, in conflict with any law, or otherwise unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this Agreement will nevertheless remain in full force and effect.
You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any such attempt will be void.
