A âWeb beaconâ (also known as a pixel tag) is a transparent graphic image placed on a website, email, or advertisement that enables the monitoring of things such as user activity and site traffic, including the collection of data about the website and mobile application you were visiting before and after you came to our website or mobile application.

If you choose to use this function, we will collect your friendâs contact information.
We will automatically send your friend a one-time email with the information you specified or inviting your friend to visit the site.
We use this Personal Data you provide us as part of the âtell-a-friendâ functionality for the sole purposes of sending this one-time email. &nbsp.
How your Personal Data may be shared through online interactions In addition to the types of disclosures of Personal Data described separately in this Privacy Notice, we may share Personal Data online for the additional purposes as described in this section. &nbsp.
Third-party advertising and online behavioral advertising We may provide you with online advertisements for AbbVie products and services on third-party websites and mobile services that are tailored to you, which may be based on the Personal Data that you provide to us or to a third-party website that you are visiting, or on your browsing activity, purchases, or interests.
We may share some of your device information with our advertising service providers that we have obtained from cookies and other data-collection and tracking technologies based on your AbbVie Relationships.

Some AbbVie Relationships participate in online behavioral advertising (this is also sometimes called targeted advertising or interest-based advertising).
You can identify these sites by the âAdvertising Choicesâ link in the advertisement.&nbsp.
Our advertising network partners may place and use cookies on our websites and on other third-party sites to collect Personal Data about your activities in order to provide you with online advertisements that are based on your interests.
When an AbbVie online behavioral advertisement is delivered to you, you will see an âAd Choicesâ icon.
Clicking on the icon or link will take you to a website where you can manage or opt-out of the use of data about your browsing history that is used for the delivery of online behavioral advertisements.
If you opt-out, you may still see advertisements online, including advertisements from AbbVie that are based on other information (e.g., based on the content of the page being viewed rather than your prior clickstream activity).
In some cases, data may still be collected about your browsing activity by these third-party advertisers, but they will not use this data to deliver advertisements that are based on your past online browsing behavior.
You can also opt-out now by clicking here.
You may also opt out of certain online behavioral advertising on the Digital Advertising Alliance's consumer choice tool, and the Network Advertising Initiativeâs tool.
Some web browsers may transmit âdo-not-trackâ signals to web services with which your browser communicates.
As of the effective date of this Privacy Notice, an industry standard has not yet been established on how to respond to these signals.
therefore, AbbVie does not currently respond to these signals.
However, you can opt-out from advertisers that use your browsing history to deliver online behavioral advertisements via the mechanisms listed above. &nbsp.
Links to third-party sites and social media plug-ins This Privacy Notice only applies to AbbVie Relationships linked to this Privacy Notice and does not apply to third-party websites to which AbbVie Relationships may link, including links to outside websites or advertisements from third parties.
We encourage you to review the privacy statements provided by all third parties prior to providing them with Personal Data.
AbbVie Relationships may use social media plug-ins (e.g., the Facebook âLikeâ button and the âShare to Twitterâ button) to enable you to easily share information with others. When you visit our sites as part of an AbbVie Relationship, the operator of the social plug-in and integrated social media platforms can place a cookie on your device that enables that operator to receive your Personal Data that allow the operator to recognize individuals who have previously visited our sites.&nbsp.
If you are logged into the social media site (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) while browsing on our site, the social media plug-in allows that social media site to receive information that you have visited our site.
The social media plug-in also allows the social media site to share information about your activities on our site with other users of that social media site.
These sharing settings are managed by the social media site, and you should refer to those sitesâ privacy policies for information about their privacy and data-sharing practices.

However, certain AbbVie Relationships may require your consent to have your Personal Data shared with AbbVie to provide the service or to allow us to use and disclose your Personal Data to provide the AbbVie Relationships.
When you exercise your deletion right, you may lose access to certain aspects of AbbVie Relationships that require your Personal Data to perform the service.
Please see the Your privacy rights and choices&nbsp.
section if you or your authorized representative have questions or would like to make a request to exercise any of your rights described in this section.
After you make your request, we will use the information we have to verify your identify (and if applicable, your authorized agentâs identify), and to match the Personal Data we have collected about you, if any, to your verified identify.&nbsp.
Our verification process may include a request for additional information to confirm your identify or your authorized agentâs identify, or to obtain proof that you have given your authorized agent permission to act on your behalf.
If our verification process is successful, we will respond to your request within the time and in the manner required by applicable law.
If we cannot validate the identify of you and/or your authorized agent or obtain proof that you have given your authorized agent permission to act on your behalf, we will attempt to contact you to inform you.

The criteria used to determine our retention periods include (i) the length of time we have an ongoing Abbvie Relationship with you.
