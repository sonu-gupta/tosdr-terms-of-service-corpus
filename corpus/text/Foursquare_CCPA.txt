California Consumer Privacy RightsYou have certain choices regarding your personal information, as described below.


Access: You have the right to request, twice in a 12-month period, that we disclose to you the personal information we have collected, used, disclosed and sold about you during the past 12 months.

Deletion: You have the right to request that we delete certain personal information we have collected from you.

Opt-Out of Sale: You have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information.


How to Submit a Request. To submit an access or deletion request, please log into your Foursquare account or call us at (855)-505-8916.
To opt-out of the sale of your personal information, click here or email us at privacy@foursquare.com.
You must provide us with your device identifier, which we will use to fulfill your opt-out request.
If you do not know your device identifier, below are instructions on how to locate it.
We will not use the information you provide as part of your request for any purpose other than to fulfill your opt-out request.

If you use an iOS operating system, a third-party application is required to locate your Apple IDFA.
Please note that we do not control such third-party tools and are not responsible for their content, their privacy policies, or their use of your personal information.
If you use an Android operating system, open the Google Settings app on your Android device and select âAds.â Your Advertising Identifier should be listed at the bottom of the screen.

To submit a request as an authorized agent on behalf of a consumer, please send us a notarized power of attorney and/or other legal documentation.
Requests from agents that do not submit sufficient proof that they have been authorized by you to act on your behalf will be denied.
For questions or concerns about our privacy policies and practices, please contact us as described in the âContact Usâ section of our Enterprise Services Privacy Policy.

Verifying Requests. To help protect your privacy and maintain security, we will take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal information or complying with your request.
If you have an account with us, we are unable to fulfill your access or deletion requests at this time because there is no reasonable method by which we can verify your identity to the level of certainty required by California law.
The reason for this is that Foursquare historically has not linked IP addresses, device identifiers or other information collected through automated means to named actual persons unless the individual uses the Consumer Services.

Additional Information. If you choose to exercise any of your rights under the CCPA, you have the right to not receive discriminatory treatment by us.
To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may charge a reasonable fee to comply with your request.
