Updates to Terms of Use April 20, 2020

Overview

We have been working hard to upgrade our sites to meet your needs and make shopping more convenient to you.
We have added new services and conveniences for you and, as part of that process, we have also updated our Terms of Use.
The Terms of Use below apply and govern your access and use of all websites, online ordering services and mobile applications linking to or posting these Terms of Use.
What has changed?
- Our updated Terms of Use are consolidated to apply to the Albertsons family of grocery store banner websites and mobile applications and replace separate Terms previously associated with the websites/apps of individual grocery banners.
- Our updated Terms of Use are reorganized.
Part One of the updated Terms of Use applies to all visitors to our sites and apps including those who do not place orders.
Part Two provides information for site and app users who place orders for groceries, special order items and catering services.
- Our updated Terms of Use bring together a number of topics previously addressed in separate places, such as the special terms for placing orders through some of our websites and the terms for our various mobile applications.
Now in one place you can find:
Information clarifying the online ordering process.
the relative pricing between our physical stores and online.
new delivery and pickup service options, including options fulfilled by third parties, and delivery and service fees related to them.
use of coupons for online shopping.
and the benefits of loyalty program pricing.
Information detailing our new delivery and service fees.
Information about your rights and responsibilities when you access any of our websites or download and use our mobile apps.
- Our updated Terms of Use include an arbitration and waiver of rights provision that clearly sets out how to resolve any disputes that may arise.

Albertsons Companies Terms of Use
Last Updated: April 20, 2020
Welcome to the Albertsons family of grocery store websites and mobile applications.
Albertsons Companies, Inc.
directly and through one or more of its affiliates/subsidiaries (collectively, "Company", "we" and "us") operates stores across the United States under well-known "banners," including without limitation ACME, Albertsons, Jewel-Osco, Pavilions, Randalls, Safeway, Shaw's, Star Market, Tom Thumb, and Vons.
These Terms of Use (collectively, the "Terms") apply to all Company-branded websites, online services and mobile applications linking to or posting these Terms.
Each such website, online service and mobile application is referred to in these Terms individually as a "Site" and collectively as "Sites".
Additional terms and conditions applicable to specific components of certain Sites may also be posted to such Sites, such as the terms governing our prescription management services, which are incorporated herein by reference.
In such cases those additional terms and conditions, together with these Terms, govern your engagement with those components of such Sites.
These Terms appear as two parts:

Part One applies to all visitors to or users of any of our Sites.
Part Two applies only to visitors who use one of the following online ordering services: (i) the "Catering Order Service" used to order deli platters, custom cakes and bakery items or holiday meals for in-store pickup, which are referred to as "Special Order Items" in these Terms.
and (ii) the "Online Grocery Ordering Service" used to order groceries or other items for delivery from or pickup at one of our stores.
Note: Third party companies may also provide services such as selection and/or delivery of goods from our facilities.
These Terms do not apply to orders fulfilled by a third party or placed through a third party's site or app.
If you opt to use such a third party service, you will be subject to the terms and policies posted by that service provider and we are not responsible for the terms, policies, actions and inactions of that third party service provider.
As described further in Part Two, we may also transfer orders placed with us to a third party delivery operator.
If we transfer your order to a third party for delivery, your order will be subject to the terms, policies, actions or inactions of such third party upon transfer.

Any visitor to our Sites whose access or use is covered by Part One and/or Part Two of these Terms is referred to as "you" in these Terms.
If you are accessing or using any of our Sites on behalf of any person or entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to accept these Terms on behalf of such person or entity and all references to "you" in that context shall mean the person or entity on whose behalf you are accessing and/or using our Sites.
Please read these Terms carefully.
When you first register for an account ("Account") on one of the Sites, such as our just for UÂ® program or our Online Grocery Ordering Service, you will be prompted to "click" on a button on the applicable Site to agree to the most recently updated version of these Terms.
By doing so, you indicate that you have read, understand and agree to these Terms.
In all other circumstances, by accessing and/or using any of our Sites, you agree to be bound by the then-current version of these Terms, which may be updated from time to time.
If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the Sites.
These Terms apply exclusively to your access to and/or use of any of our Sites, and do not alter in any way the terms or conditions of any other agreement you may have with us.
Examples of other agreements that you may have with us are the terms and conditions of (i) our programs that provide an advertised discount on products to those who provide a loyalty card or registered telephone number (for example the Safeway Club Card, the Randalls Remarkable Card, which we will call "Company Loyalty Programs").
(ii) the individualized just for U program.
(iii) other rewards programs where rewards are available to customers based on their purchase behavior for eligible items (e.g., gas or grocery rewards, branded pre-paid credit cards or airline miles programs).
(iv) gift cards.
or (v) other non-merchandise purchases (e.g., money orders, lottery, stamps, etc.).

Please note that any dispute or claim related to these Terms or arising out of your access to and/or use of any of our Sites must be resolved by arbitration on an individual basis, and may not be arbitrated or otherwise pursued as a class action.

You Agree to Arbitrate Disputes and Will Not Be Part of a Class Action Against Us.
(a) Except for cases involving claims for public injunctive relief (as defined by law), you and Company agree that all controversies, claims, counterclaims, or other disputes arising between you and Company relating to these Terms or arising out of your access to or use of any of the Sites (each a "Claim") will be resolved through binding and final arbitration instead of through court proceedings.
This agreement to arbitrate means that each of you and Company waive your/its respective rights to a jury trial.
Any and all Claims shall be submitted for binding arbitration in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules &amp.
Procedures that are in effect at the time arbitration is initiated ("JAMS Rules").
You may, in arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise available to you under applicable federal, state or local laws, except as provided below in subsection (f) of this Section 24.
If you decide to initiate arbitration, you agree to pay an arbitration initiation fee of $250 (unless the fee is waived as discussed in subsection (b)(4) of this Section 24), and Company will pay the remainder of the arbitration initiation fee and all other costs of the arbitration proceeding, including the arbitrator's fees.
The arbitration will be held at a location in your hometown area unless you and Company both agree to another location or telephonic arbitration.
(b) For information on filing your Demand for Arbitration, you may contact JAMS toll free at (800) 352-5267.
To start an arbitration hereunder, you must do all of the following:
(1) Write a demand for arbitration (your "Demand for Arbitration").
Your Demand for Arbitration must include a description of the Claim and the amount of damages sought to be recovered, and you must attach a copy of all of these Terms (including this arbitration provision).
You can find a form of a demand for arbitration on the JAMS rules page at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-download/Opens a new window .
(2) Send one copy of your Demand for Arbitration to Company at: Albertsons Companies, Inc., 250 E.
Parkcenter Blvd., Boise, ID 83706 Attn: General Counsel.
(3) Send two copies of your Demand for Arbitration (with a copy of these Terms attached) and proof of service of your Demand for Arbitration on Company at the address noted in subsection (2) above (for example, a copy of a certified mail return receipt requested or a sworn statement of service by a non-party over 18 years of age) to the JAMS Resolution Center of your choice (JAMS Resolution Centers are listed at http://www.jamsadr.com/locations/Opens a new window )..
(4) Pay JAMS a $250.00 arbitration initiation fee, unless you are entitled to a waiver of the fee under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1284.3 or other applicable law.
(c) In the event Company elects to start an arbitration with you hereunder, Company must write a demand for arbitration and send two copies of it to JAMS and serve one copy of Company's Demand for Arbitration to you at the contact information that we have on file for you.
Company will pay all costs of the arbitration proceeding, including the arbitrator's fees, for any arbitration that Company commences.
(d) The arbitration will be heard and determined by a single, neutral arbitrator selected in accordance with JAMS Rules.
The arbitrator shall render an award in accordance with JAMS Rules.
In the arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator has no authority to make errors of law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator does so.
Any award may also be challenged if the arbitrator awards any relief that could not be awarded under the laws of the state in which the arbitration is held or in which the award is to be enforced.
Except for the foregoing, the arbitrator's decision in any such arbitration will be final and binding upon the parties and may be enforced in any federal or state court that has jurisdiction.
You and Company agree that the arbitration shall be kept confidential and that the existence of the proceeding and any element of it (including, without limitation, any pleadings, briefs or other documents submitted or exchanged and any testimony or other oral submissions and awards) will not be disclosed beyond the arbitration proceedings, except as may lawfully be required in judicial proceedings relating to the arbitration or by applicable disclosure rules and regulations of securities regulatory authorities or other governmental agencies.
(e) The terms of this Section 24 do not preclude you or Company from seeking action by federal, state, or local government agencies.
You and Company also have the right to bring qualifying claims in small claims court.
In addition, you and Company retain the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for public injunctive relief and/or provisional relief, including pre-arbitral attachments or preliminary injunctions, and any such request shall not be deemed incompatible with these Terms, nor a waiver of the right to have disputes submitted to arbitration as provided in these Terms.
(f) Neither you nor Company may act as a class representative, nor participate as a member of a class of claimants, with respect to any Claim.
Claims may not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis.
The arbitrator can decide only your and/or Company's individual Claims.
The arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated.
Accordingly, you and Company agree that the JAMS Class Action Procedures do not apply to Company's arbitration.
This arbitration provision and the procedures applicable to the arbitration contemplated by this provision are governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, notwithstanding any state law that may be applicable.
(g) A court may sever any portion of this Section 24 that it finds to be unenforceable, except for the prohibitions on any Claim being handled on a class or representative basis.
No waiver of any provision of this Section 24 will be effective or enforceable unless recorded in a writing signed by the party waiving such a right or requirement.
Such a waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of these Terms.
This Section 24 will survive the termination of your relationship with Company and any termination of your access to and/or use of all or any part of any of the Sites.
(h) Important: This Section 24 limits certain rights, including the right to maintain a court action, the right to a jury trial, the right to participate in any form of class or representative claim, the right to engage in discovery except as provided in the JAMS Rules, and the right to certain remedies and forms of relief.
Other rights that you or Company would have in court also may not be available in arbitration.

Questions or Concerns Regarding the Online Grocery Ordering Service, Catering Order Service or Your Account
Part Two -- Additional Terms Applicable to Users Who Place Online Orders
1.
Part Two Applies to Online Orders.
The terms and conditions in this Part Two apply to users who order groceries or other items (each, a "Product") from Company through the Online Grocery Ordering Service for delivery or pickup, where we offer such services.
The Online Grocery Ordering Service may be accessed online and/or through an applicable mobile App.
please note, however, that certain features available on our website for the Online Grocery Ordering Service may not be accessible via mobile App and vice-versa.
In addition, portions of this Part Two apply to users who order Special Order Items, such as deli platters, custom cakes and bakery items, or holiday meals, from certain stores that have implemented a separate Catering Order Service especially for Special Order items.
The terms and conditions in this Part Two do not apply to purchases you make as a shopper at any of our physical facilities and our in-store promotions, programs, and offers (e.g., Monopoly Game) may not be available to our Online Grocery Ordering Service customers.
In addition, you should know that from time to time, third parties may also offer order fulfillment services on your behalf or independently.
If you use any services provided by a third party, you will be subject to the terms and policies posted by that third party service provider and we are not responsible for the terms, policies, actions or inactions of that third party service provider.
For example, in some areas, Company may not fulfill certain types of orders (such as rush delivery) or may not maintain a fleet of delivery trucks.
In those cases, you may be transferred to a third party's website to place your order and receive delivery from such third party, or your order may be transferred to a third party for delivery after it has been picked and packed by our personnel.
In either case, once you access the third party's site to place your order or we transfer your order to a third party for delivery, your order will be subject to the terms, policies, actions or inactions of such third party.
Table of Contents 2.
You Must Be 18 Years Old or Older to Order.
You must be age 18 or older and a resident of the United States in order to use either the Online Grocery Ordering Service or the Catering Order Service.

You Must Create an Account for the Online Grocery Ordering Service.
To use the Online Grocery Ordering Service, you must set up an Account, as provided in Part One.
During the registration process, you may be asked to provide information (or confirm information that auto-fills) about your participation in Company Loyalty Programs, such as a whether you have a club card or telephone number you already use in-store to receive Product price discounts or accrue rewards program benefits.
If this information is provided during the registration process, any loyalty benefits that you may earn on orders placed online, such as rewards points that can be redeemed for gas or groceries, or discount offers based on your shopping behavior, typically will be available when using that Company Loyalty Program card or telephone number in-store and vice-versa.
If you are participating in an existing Company Loyalty Program at the time you register for an Account in the Online Grocery Ordering Service, but such information is not filled in, the Online Grocery Ordering Service will assign the Account a virtual Company Loyalty Program number.
This virtual Company Loyalty Program number will enable you to receive Product price discounts available to participants in Company Loyalty Programs if and when those discounts are provided through the Online Grocery Ordering Service.
However, other benefits that may be earned for orders placed online, such as rewards points ordinarily redeemable for grocery or gas rewards, will not be available when using your existing Company Loyalty Program number in-store.
In addition, in some areas, different Company banners will partner to deliver online orders.
In those cases, the pricing, rewards programs and discounts applicable to your order placed through the Online Grocery Ordering Service will be that of the Company banner fulfilling the order.
You may apply for the partnering banner's Company Loyalty Program for use with your Online Grocery Ordering Service Account.
For questions or assistance regarding Company Loyalty Programs when using the Online Grocery Ordering Service, contact Customer Support line toll-free at (877) 505-4040.

Table of Contents 5.
Placing an Order in the Online Grocery Ordering Service.
(a) You Must Make a Minimum Purchase.
The minimum purchase amount shown in the Online Grocery Ordering Service must be met to place an order.
The minimum purchase amount is shown as the "Subtotal of All Items" (which we refer to as the "Subtotal" of the order in this Part Two), and is the sum total of the order calculated from the quantities and online prices for the Products selected, but excluding all other charges and discounts, such as any applicable taxes, service or delivery fees, bag fees, bottle deposits, promotional discounts not reflected in the online prices for the Products, and in certain jurisdictions alcoholic beverages, tobacco and fluid dairy Products.
In addition, certain offers may specify a potentially different minimum purchase amount to receive a discount.
In those cases, the Subtotal of All Items, minus certain Products such as alcoholic beverages, tobacco and fluid dairy must equal the stated minimum, in order for you to receive the discount.
(b) We May Limit Quantities.
We reserve the right to limit the quantity of any particular Product ordered in our discretion, including without limitation, due to inventory control or other reasons.
Product availability is subject to the inventory on hand and may vary geographically or change without notice.
Please note that we reserve the right to source the Products from any of our facilities in any location (or the facilities of any of our affiliated companies in any location).
(c) You Agree to Pay for Your Order.
By submitting an order via the Online Grocery Ordering Service, you offer to purchase the Product(s) specified in your order.
We will send you an electronic confirmation that your order has been received and the offer accepted, subject to our final confirmation of Product availability and price.
however, we also reserve the right to cancel your order, in whole or in part, at any time in our sole discretion, and to refuse to provide delivery/pickup service for any order, in whole or in part.
Subject to the foregoing, if your order is accepted by Company, and not cancelled prior to delivery, Company will provide the Product(s) ordered in return for your payment and deliver the ordered Product(s) to the delivery address or pickup location you designate in your order, subject to the provisions of these Terms.
(d) We Accept Major Credit and Debit Cards and Certain Other Payment Methods.
You must select one of the payment methods identified in the Online Grocery Ordering Service and provide accurate and complete information in order for us to charge your payment method for orders you place.
By providing payment card information, you consent to and authorize storage of your card data (Name, Credit Card number, Expiration Date) for purposes of future online transactions, all transactions made via the Sites and the Company charging your selected payment method in the amount of each such transaction.
Order processing will not occur until authorized.
You represent and warrant to Company that your use of your selected payment method is authorized and legal.
It is your responsibility to promptly notify your bank, financial institution or other responsible party of any changes to your billing information, or the loss, theft, or unauthorized use of your payment method.
You are responsible for updating your payment information with Company whenever it is no longer current/accurate.
When processing credit card payments, we may run a temporary pre-authorization charge that will not be completed and will be removed from your card in accordance with the terms of your issuing bank.
Residents of Arizona with disabilities who use Electronic Benefit Transfer and need to use the Online Grocery Ordering Service because of their disability, may call our Customer Support line toll-free at (877) 505-4040 for assistance.
(e) Your Total at Checkout Is an Estimate.
The dollar amount displayed prior to order completion is only an estimate, based on Products selected and prices at the time of ordering, and estimated Product weights for certain Products in your order, as adjusted by some (but not all) potentially applicable additional charges and fees and potentially applicable discounts and other deductions (collectively, the "Estimated Total").
The actual amount that you will be charged for the order will be based on the prices, charges, fees, offers, promotions, programs, coupons, discounts, and deductions applicable to the order on the day and time that the order is sourced and processed, except for service and delivery fees, which will be set and included when the order is placed or modified (collectively, the "Final Total").
The Final Total cannot be determined until the day and time the order is sourced and processed for multiple reasons, including without limitation: (i) the availability of the Products selected and the need to substitute different priced Products cannot be confirmed until the day and time that they are prepared for delivery/pickup, (ii) Product weights and prices, as well as available promotions, may vary between the date you submit the order and the date and time that the order is prepared for delivery/pickup, and (iii) certain charges, such as any applicable taxes, bottle deposits, and bag charges, cannot be determined until the order is prepared for delivery/pickup.
In addition, even though we make an effort to describe and display our products and services accurately on the Sites, Products on the Site may be mispriced, described inaccurately, or unavailable and we may experience delay in updating information on the Sites and in our advertising on the Sites.
The Final Total that you will be charged for your order upon sourcing and processing likely will not equal exactly the Estimated Total.

(f) When the Final Total Is Due.
Your payment of the Final Total amount for each order, including all applicable fees, taxes, and charges, will be charged as part of the order sourcing and processing procedure, but in any event is due no later than when the order is delivered or picked up.
Company will charge the Final Total amount for the order to the payment method you selected during the order submission process.
You authorize Company to make and collect such payment and charge.
You acknowledge that if we cannot collect the charge for any reason, we may elect to turn the matter over to a collection agency.
(g) Changing or Canceling Your Order. Typically, you may cancel or change your order made on the Online Grocery Ordering Service up until the date and time noted in the Online Grocery Ordering Service. This ability may be suspended during times of high volume or for other reasons to facilitate the proper functioning of the Online Grocery Ordering Service and our business operations. All times listed are in the local time zone for your specified delivery/pickup location, regardless of the time zone you might be in when placing the order.
Note that any changes you may make to orders may affect whether your order continues to qualify for the same prices, discounts, promotions, or Promo Code Deals as your original order.
If your changed order will qualify for a Promo Code Deal that your original order did not and you are unable to enter the Promo Code during the Order Edit process, make a note of the Promo Code Deal(s) and call our Customer Support line toll-free at (877) 505-4040 after your order is delivered/picked up, if the discount has not been applied.
You may also change the delivery/pickup day and time after submitting your order, subject to order cut off times and the availability of your desired delivery/pickup time at the time you request a change. This ability may be suspended during times of high volume or for other reasons to facilitate the proper functioning of the Online Grocery Ordering Service and our business operations. Please note that changing your delivery/pickup date, if allowed, may affect Product prices and availability, as well as the availability of certain offers, discounts, and promotions.

Product Pricing, Fees and Other Charges.
(a) Prices, Fees and Other Charges.
(1) Online Prices.
Prices for Products you order for delivery or pickup through the Online Grocery Ordering Service generally are higher than the prices for such Products in our physical stores. Pricing may differ depending on the fulfillment method you select, e.g., delivery, pickup, rush delivery.
In addition, in some locations, order fulfillment and delivery may be provided by another of the Company's banners or an independent third party service provider that provides selection and/or delivery services to consumers.
In those cases, the availability, fees, and pricing of the partnering banner or of the independent third party service provider will apply to your order.
For Products sold by weight, a representative cost per unit may be used to calculate the Estimated Total.
The actual cost will be determined when the order is prepared for pickup or delivery and that cost will be reflected in the Final Total, which may be higher or lower than the estimate.
Products offered with a price discount for participants in Company Loyalty Programs (such as Safeway Club Card, Randalls Remarkable Card, etc.) online may differ from Products offered with such a price discount in our physical stores.
(2) Delivery Fees.
We charge a non-refundable delivery fee on all delivery orders through the Online Grocery Ordering Service, unless expressly stated with a particular order, which will be included in both the Estimated Total for your order and the Final Total charged for that order.
A delivery fee helps operate our fleet of trucks that transports your order from our facility to your delivery address.
From time to time we waive or provide discounts off our regular delivery fees for certain delivery times, which you may obtain by selecting such a delivery time.
We may also make other discounts available in certain locations via a Promo Code, in which case, you must enter the required Promo Code when you place your order and your order must meet any conditions of the offer, such as a minimum purchase amount.
Service fees still apply.
Promo Code offers for discounted or free delivery/pickup orders are not valid in Lake Powell.
In some locations, we may also offer a subscription to delivery services on a recurring monthly or annual fee-paid basis, which may reduce or eliminate delivery or delivery and service fees on individual orders.
The delivery fee does not constitute a tip to the delivery person.
