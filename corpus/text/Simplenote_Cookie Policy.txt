Our Privacy Policy explains our principles when it comes to the collection, processing, and storage of your information.
This policy specifically explains how we, our partners, and users of our services deploy cookies, as well as the options you have to control them.

What are cookies?
Cookies are small pieces of data, stored in text files, that are stored on your computer or other device when websites are loaded in a browser.
They are widely used to ârememberâ you and your preferences, either for a single visit (through a âsession cookieâ) or for multiple repeat visits (using a âpersistent cookieâ).
They ensure a consistent and efficient experience for visitors, and perform essential functions such as allowing users to register and remain logged in.
Cookies may be set by the site that you are visiting (known as âfirst party cookiesâ), or by third parties, such as those who serve content or provide advertising or analytics services on the website (âthird party cookiesâ).

Both websites and HTML emails may also contain other tracking technologies such as âweb beaconsâ or âpixels.â These are typically small transparent images that provide us with statistics, for similar purposes as cookies.
They are often used in conjunction with cookies, though they are not stored on your computer in the same way.
As a result, if you disable cookies, web beacons may still load, but their functionality will be restricted.

How we use cookies
We use cookies for a number of different purposes.
Some cookies are necessary for technical reasons.
some enable a personalized experience for both visitors and registered users.
and some allow the display of advertising from selected third party networks.
Some of these cookies may be set when a page is loaded, or when a visitor takes a particular action (clicking the âlikeâ or âfollowâ button on a post, for example).
Many of the cookies we use are only set if you are a registered WordPress.com user (so you donât have to log in every time, for example), while others are set whenever you visit one of our websites, irrespective of whether you have an account.
For more information on the choices you have about the cookies we use, please see the Controlling Cookies section below.

These are set by Automattic and trusted third party networks, and are generally persistent in nature.
Third Party / Embedded Content
Sites hosted on WordPress.com make use of different third party applications and services to enhance the experience of website visitors.
These include social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter (through the use of sharing buttons), or embedded content from Youtube and Vimeo.
As a result, cookies may be set by these third parties, and used by them to track your online activity.
We have no direct control over the information that is collected by these cookies.
User Sites
In addition to the cookies set on our own sites, we utilize cookies for our Site Stats feature.
This tallies the unique numbers of visitors to a site, as well as the number from specific geographic locations.
A visitor is counted when we see a user or browser for the first time in a given period.

Some of these cookies are set across our whole network, whereas some are specific to individual services (e.g.

Advertisements from Third Parties Through Automatticâs Ads Program
Our mission is to democratize publishing.
So that we can offer free access to create a website using WordPress.com, we show ads on some of our usersâ sites.
Our users may also choose to place ads on their site through our ads program.
Additionally, we also show ads from our ads program on some of our own websites (e.g.
longreads.com), and in emails.
We operate our ads program in partnership with third party vendors.
As part of the operation of our ads program, we use cookies to collect certain information.
Advertising cookies enable us and our partners to serve ads and to personalize those ads based on information like visits to our sites and other sites on the Internet.
Below is a representative list of our advertising program partners, along with information on the cookies that that each partner sets. The partners we work with change from time to time, and this is not an exhaustive list.

Controlling Cookies
Visitors may wish to restrict the use of cookies or completely prevent them from being set.
Most browsers provide for ways to control cookie behavior such as the length of time they are stored â either through built-in functionality or by utilizing third party plugins.
If you disable cookies, please be aware that some of the features of our service may not function correctly.
To find out more on how to manage and delete cookies, visit aboutcookies.org.
For more details on your choices regarding use of your web browsing activity for interest-based advertising you may visit the following sites:

networkadvertising.org
optout.aboutads.info 
youradchoices.com
youronlinechoices.eu

On a mobile device, you may also be to adjust your settings to limit tracking.
 
For example, you can opt out of Google Analytics by installing Googleâs opt-out browser add-on, or from Hotjar by using the Do Not Track header.
Our Internal Analytics Tool
In order to better understand how our services are used, we monitor certain user activities that take place within our products, including page views and clicks on any links used when managing a site via our dashboards.

We call each one of these actions an âevent.â Analytics events are attached to your WordPress.com account and are handled via a first party system that Automattic owns and maintains.
In general, we record the following data for each event: IP address, WordPress.com user ID and username, WordPress.com-connected site ID (for sites not hosted on WordPress.com), user agent, referring URL, timestamp of event, browser language, and country code.
We use this information to improve our products, make our marketing to you more relevant, personalize your experience, and for the other purposes described in our Privacy Policy.
You may opt out of our analytics program through your user settings.
By doing so, you wonât share information with our analytics tool about events or actions that happen after the opt-out, while logged in to your WordPress.com account.
Note that opting out does not disable the functionality of the actions we track â for example, if you publish a post, we will still have record of that (donât worry!), but for an event or action after you opt out, we will not have other data associated with that action or event in the analytics tool.


For our Simplenote Users:
 We use our first party analytics tool in Simplenote to help us better understand how Simplenote is used and improve the app for our users.
You may opt-out through your privacy settings in the app.
By doing so, you wonât share information with our analytics tool about events or actions that happen after the opt-out.
One more thingâFor Simplenote users who log onto Simplenote using their WordPress.com login, if youâd like to opt-out of our analytics tool on Simplenote, youâll also need to opt out on the Simplenote appânot on your WP.COM Account Privacy Settings.
Consent for Advertising Cookies on Our Sites
You may see a âcookie bannerâ on our websites and dashboards.
If you are visiting one of our sites from the EU, then we do not set, or allow our ad partners to set, cookies that are used to show you targeted ads before you click to accept.
When you consent in this manner, we and our advertising partners may set advertising cookies on the site you are visiting and on our other websites, dashboards, and services, which we use to show you advertisements about our various Automattic products.
Weâll display the banner to you periodically, just in case you change your mind.
Consent and Choices for Advertisements on Our Usersâ Sites Through Our Ads Program
You may see a âcookie bannerâ on our usersâ websites, particularly if you are in the European Union.
If so, then our ad program does not set, or allow our ad partners to set, cookies that are used to show you targeted ads before you accept.
When you consent in this manner, we and our advertising partners may set third party advertising cookies on our network in order to show you personalized ads.
Weâll display the banner to you periodically, just in case you change your mind.
* Please note this consent feature was implemented on May 22, 2018.
We set a cookie to help us understand how visitors engage with websites that participate in our ad program.
Visitors may opt out of our use of this information by visiting this link (the opt-out will be processed immediately with no confirmation step).
When you opt out, we replace the unique value for that cookie with an opt-out value.
The opt-out works across all websites in our ads program.
If you have opted out by accident, or wish to opt back in, you may do so by visiting this link.
Please note that this option is browser specific, and so if you use a different device or browser or clear your cookies, then you will need to repeat the process.
