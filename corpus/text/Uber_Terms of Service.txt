Terms of Use1.
Contractual RelationshipThese Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your access or use, from within the United States and its territories and possessions, of the applications, websites, content, products, and services (the "Services," as more fully defined below in Section 3) made available in the United States and its territories and possessions by Uber USA, LLC and its parents, subsidiaries, representatives, affiliates, officers and directors (collectively, "Uber").
PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY, AS THEY CONSTITUTE A LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND UBER.
In these Terms, the words "including" and "include" mean "including, but not limited to."
By accessing or using the Services, you confirm your agreement to be bound by these Terms.
If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use the Services.
These Terms expressly supersede prior agreements or arrangements with you regarding the use of the Services.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, these Terms do not supersede or otherwise impact the enforceability of any agreements you may have with Uber or its subsidiaries regarding driving, delivering and/or providing transportation and/or delivery services (e.g.
the Platform Access Agreement, the Technology Services Agreement and/or any similar agreements).
To the extent (but only to the extent) any agreement you may have with Uber regarding driving, delivering and/or providing transportation and/or delivery services conflicts with these Terms, those agreements (and not these Terms) will prevail.

Uber may immediately terminate these Terms or any Services with respect to you, or generally cease offering or deny access to the Services or any portion thereof, at any time for any reason.
IMPORTANT: PLEASE REVIEW THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT SET FORTH BELOW CAREFULLY, AS IT WILL REQUIRE YOU TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH UBER ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION.
BY ENTERING THIS AGREEMENT, YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND HAVE TAKEN TIME TO CONSIDER THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS IMPORTANT DECISION.
Supplemental terms may apply to certain Services, such as policies for a particular event, program, activity or promotion, and such supplemental terms will be disclosed to you in separate region-specific disclosures (e.g., a particular city webpage on Uber.com) or in connection with the applicable Service(s).
Supplemental terms are in addition to, and shall be deemed a part of, the Terms for the purposes of the applicable Service(s).
Supplemental terms shall prevail over these Terms in the event of a conflict with respect to the applicable Services.
Uber may amend the Terms from time to time.
Amendments will be effective upon Uber's posting of such updated Terms at this location or in the amended policies or supplemental terms on the applicable Service(s).
Your continued access or use of the Services after such posting confirms your consent to be bound by the Terms, as amended.
If Uber changes these Terms after the date you first agreed to the Terms (or to any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by providing Uber written notice of such rejection within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the "Effective" date above.
This written notice must be provided either (a) by mail or hand delivery to our registered agent for service of process, c/o Uber USA, LLC (the name and current contact information for the registered agent in each state are available online here), or (b) by email from the email address associated with your Account to: change-dr@uber.com.
In order to be effective, the notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to reject changes to these Terms.
By rejecting changes, you are agreeing that you will continue to be bound by the provisions of these Terms as of the date you first agreed to the Terms (or to any subsequent changes to these Terms).
Uberâs collection and use of personal information in connection with the Services is described in Uber's Privacy Statements located at https://www.uber.com/privacy/notice.2.
Arbitration AgreementBy agreeing to the Terms, you agree that you are required to resolve any claim that you may have against Uber on an individual basis in arbitration, as set forth in this Arbitration Agreement.
This will preclude you from bringing any class, collective, or representative action against Uber, and also preclude you from participating in or recovering relief under any current or future class, collective, consolidated, or representative action brought against Uber by someone else.Agreement to Binding Arbitration Between You and Uber.You and Uber agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to (a) these Terms or the existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, or (b) your access to or use of the Services at any time, whether before or after the date you agreed to the Terms, will be settled by binding arbitration between you and Uber, and not in a court of law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, where you allege claims of sexual assault or sexual harassment occurring in connection with your use of the Services, you may elect to bring those claims in a court of competent jurisdiction instead of arbitration.
Uber agrees to honor your election of forum with respect to your individual sexual assault or sexual harassment claim but in so doing does not waive the enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement as to any other provision (including, but not limited to, the waivers provided in the following paragraph, which will continue to apply in court and arbitration), controversy, claim or dispute.
You acknowledge and agree that you and Uber are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding.
Unless both you and Uber otherwise agree in writing, any arbitration will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, collective, consolidated, or representative proceeding.
However, you and Uber each retain the right to bring an individual action in small claims court and the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.Rules and Governing Law.The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with the AAAâs Consumer Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the "AAA Rules") then in effect, except as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.
The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.
The parties agree that the arbitrator ("Arbitrator"), and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.
The Arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether the Terms are unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel.
Notwithstanding any choice of law or other provision in the Terms, the parties agree and acknowledge that this Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.
Â§ 1 et seq.
("FAA"), will govern its interpretation and enforcement and proceedings pursuant thereto.
It is the intent of the parties that the FAA and AAA Rules shall preempt all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law.
If the FAA and AAA Rules are found to not apply to any issue that arises under this Arbitration Agreement or the enforcement thereof, then that issue shall be resolved under the laws of the state of California.Process.A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules.
(The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration - Consumer Arbitration Rules at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879).
The Arbitrator will be either (1) a retired judge or (2) an attorney specifically licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA's roster of consumer dispute arbitrators.
If the parties are unable to agree upon an Arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the Arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.Location and Procedure.Unless you and Uber otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.
If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Uber submit to the Arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the Arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary.
If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
Subject to the AAA Rules, the Arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.Arbitrator's Decision.The Arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules.
Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction to do so.
The Arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim.
An Arbitratorâs decision shall be final and binding on all parties.
An Arbitratorâs decision and judgment thereon shall have no precedential or collateral estoppel effect.
If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law.
Uber will not seek, and hereby waives all rights Uber may have under applicable law to recover attorneys' fees and expenses if Uber prevails in arbitration.Fees.Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules.
However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Uber will pay all such fees, unless the Arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).Changes.Notwithstanding the provisions in Section I above, regarding consent to be bound by amendments to these Terms, if Uber changes this Arbitration Agreement after the date you first agreed to the Terms (or to any subsequent changes to the Terms), you may reject any such change by providing Uber written notice of such rejection within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the "Effective" date above.
This written notice must be provided either (a) by mail or hand delivery to our registered agent for service of process, c/o Uber USA, LLC (the name and current contact information for the registered agent in each state are available online here), or (b) by email from the email address associated with your Account to: change-dr@uber.com.
In order to be effective, the notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to reject changes to this Arbitration Agreement.
By rejecting changes, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between you and Uber in accordance with the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first agreed to the Terms (or to any subsequent changes to the Terms).Severability and Survival.If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (1) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms.
(2) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement or the partiesâ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement.
and (3) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.3.

Any User Content provided by you remains your property.
However, by providing User Content to Uber, you grant Uber a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense, to use, copy, modify, create derivative works of, distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, and otherwise exploit in any manner such User Content in all formats and distribution channels now known or hereafter devised (including in connection with the Services and Uber's business and on third-party sites and services), without further notice to or consent from you, and without the requirement of payment to you or any other person or entity.
You represent and warrant that: (i) you either are the sole and exclusive owner of all User Content or you have all rights, licenses, consents and releases necessary to grant Uber the license to the User Content as set forth above.
and (ii) neither the User Content, nor your submission, uploading, publishing or otherwise making available of such User Content, nor Uber's use of the User Content as permitted herein will infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party's intellectual property or proprietary rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation.
You agree to not provide User Content that is defamatory, libelous, hateful, violent, obscene, pornographic, unlawful, or otherwise offensive, as determined by Uber in its sole discretion, whether or not such material may be protected by law.

Charges may include other applicable fees, tolls, and/or surcharges including a booking fee, municipal tolls, airport surcharges or processing fees for split payments.
Please visit www.uber.com/cities for further information on your particular location.
All Charges and payments will be enabled by Uber using the preferred payment method designated in your Account, after which you will receive a receipt by email.
If your primary Account payment method is determined to be expired, invalid or otherwise not able to be charged, you agree that Uber may use a secondary payment method in your Account, if available.
Charges paid by you are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by Uber.
As between you and Uber, Uber reserves the right to establish, remove and/or revise Charges for any or all services or goods obtained through the use of the Services at any time in Uber's sole discretion.
Further, you acknowledge and agree that Charges applicable in certain geographical areas may increase substantially during times of high demand.
Uber will use reasonable efforts to inform you of Charges that may apply, provided that you will be responsible for Charges incurred under your Account regardless of your awareness of such Charges or the amounts thereof.
Uber may from time to time provide certain users with promotional offers and discounts that may result in different amounts charged for the same or similar services or goods obtained through the use of the Services, and you agree that such promotional offers and discounts, unless also made available to you, shall have no bearing on your use of the Services or the Charges applied to you.
You may elect to cancel your request for Services at any time prior to the commencement of such Services, in which case you may be charged a cancellation fee on a Third Party Providerâs behalf.
After you have received services or goods obtained through the Service, you will have the opportunity to rate your experience and leave additional feedback.
Uber may use the proceeds of any Charges for any purpose, subject to any payment obligations it has agreed to with any Third Party Providers or other third parties.
In certain cases, with respect to Third Party Providers, Charges you incur will be owed directly to Third Party Providers, and Uber will collect payment of those charges from you, on the Third Party Providerâs behalf as their limited payment collection agent, and payment of the Charges shall be considered the same as payment made directly by you to the Third Party Provider.
In such cases, you retain the right to request lower Charges from a Third Party Provider for services or goods received by you from such Third Party Provider at the time you receive such services or goods, and Charges you incur will be owed to the Third Party Provider.
Uber will respond accordingly to any request from a Third Party Provider to modify the Charges for a particular service or good.
This payment structure is intended to fully compensate a Third Party Provider, if applicable, for the services or goods obtained in connection with your use of the Services.
In all other cases, Charges you incur will be owed and paid directly to Uber or its affiliates, where Uber is solely liable for any obligations to Third Party Providers.
In such cases, you retain the right to request lower Charges from Uber for services or goods received by you from a Third Party Provider at the time you receive such services or goods, and Uber will respond accordingly to any request from you to modify the Charges for a particular service or good.
Except with respect to taxicab transportation services requested through the Application, Uber does not designate any portion of your payment as a tip or gratuity to a Third Party Provider.
Any representation by Uber (on Uber's website, in the Application, or in Uber's marketing materials) to the effect that tipping is "voluntary," "not required," and/or "included" in the payments you make for services or goods provided is not intended to suggest that Uber provides any additional amounts, beyond those described above, to a Third Party Provider you may use.
You understand and agree that, while you are free to provide additional payment as a gratuity to any Third Party Provider who provides you with services or goods obtained through the Service, you are under no obligation to do so.
Gratuities are voluntary.Repair, Cleaning or Lost and Found Fees.You shall be responsible for the cost of repair for damage to, or necessary cleaning of, vehicles and property resulting from use of the Services under your Account in excess of normal "wear and tear" damages and necessary cleaning ("Repair or Cleaning").
In the event that a Repair or Cleaning request is verified by Uber in Uber's reasonable discretion, Uber reserves the right to facilitate payment for the reasonable cost of such Repair or Cleaning using your payment method designated in your Account.
Such amounts, as well as those pertaining to lost and found goods, will be transferred by Uber to a Third Party Provider, if applicable, and are non-refundable.
The amounts related to repair, cleaning or lost &amp.
found fees applicable in Puerto Rico may be found at https://www.uber.com/es-US/blog/puerto-rico/puerto-rico-terminos-y-condiciones/ and may be updated from time to time solely by Uber.6.

These provisions, and except as otherwise provided in Section 2 of these Terms, are only intended to specify the use of California law to interpret these Terms and the forum for disputes asserting a breach of these Terms, and these provisions shall not be interpreted as generally extending California law to you if you do not otherwise reside in California.
