What Cookies Do We Use And Why? Helpful Definitions

A cookieâs categorization â as a âfirst-partyâ or âthird-partyâ cookie â depends on who hosts the cookie and where the cookie is placed.


âFirst-party cookiesâ are set by the website that the visitor is accessing at the time (e.g.
cookies placed by Taboola on www.taboola.com).

âThird-party cookiesâ are set by a party that is not the owner of that website.




A âbrowser sessionâ begins when a visitor opens their Internet browser window, and it finishes when the visitor closes the browser window.
âSession cookiesâ allow a website to temporarily link a visitorâs actions during a unique browser session.
Once the visitor closes the browser, all session cookies are deleted.
âPersistent cookiesâ remain on a visitorâs device for the duration specified in the cookie.
