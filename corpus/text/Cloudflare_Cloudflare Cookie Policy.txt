 Cloudflare Cookie Policy

Last Updated: April 15, 2020


This Cloudflare Cookie Policy (âPolicyâ) outlines the general policy, practices, and types of cookies that Cloudflare, Inc.
(âCloudflare,â âwe,â âus,â or âourâ) may use to improve our Services and your experience when visiting our Websites.
For the purposes of this Policy, capitalized terms used but not defined in this Policy have the meanings given in our Privacy Policy.
 Our Websites and Services use cookies and other similar technologies (collectively in this Policy, "cookies"), in order to provide a better service to you, to help keep your account safe, and to generally improve our Websites and Services.
Cookies perform essential functions, such as ensuring a webpage loads correctly and securely.
They also help us provide you with a consistent and efficient experience.
For example, we may use cookies to remember which language you prefer, to remember that you are a repeat visitor so we can direct you to the appropriate part of our Websites, or to present you with services that are matched to your preferences.
Cookies are small pieces of text used to store information on web browsers.
They are used by many websites to store and receive identifiers and other information on devices, such as a handheld phone or computer.
You can learn more about cookies and their functions generally by visiting an information website such as allaboutcookies.org.
We also may include tracking pixels, which are small graphic images, in our marketing communications to determine engagement.
These cookies may be set by us or by third parties with whom we have partnered to assist in our marketing efforts.
We use four categories of cookies: Strictly Necessary, Functional, Performance, and Targeting.
Strictly Necessary cookies are required to deliver security and enable core site functionality and cannot be turned off.
You may view a complete list of cookies and change your cookie preferences by clicking on the âCookie Preferencesâ link in the footer of the Cloudflare homepage at cloudflare.com.

Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default, however, you may be able to delete cookies yourself through your browserâs cookie manager.
To do so, please follow the instructions provided by your web browser.
Please note that disabling cookies will reset your session, disable auto-login, and may adversely affect the availability and functionality of our Websites and the services we can provide to you.
Strictly Necessary Cookies.
Strictly Necessary cookies are essential to providing the Cloudflare Websites and Services to you and cannot be turned off.
They provide necessary security settings or help you use our Websitesâ features and Services as expected (including remembering your cookie consent preferences).
Cloudflare places Strictly Necessary cookies both on Cloudflare Websites as well as on our Customersâ websites.
For example, when you visit our Websites or our Customersâ websites, as part of our Services, we may place "_cfduid" cookies, bot detection cookies (such as "_cf_bm" and cookies for CAPTCHA), and a load balancing cookie (_cflb) on the computers of visitors to our Websites and of our End Users.
We do this in order to identify malicious visitors to our Websites and our Customersâ websites, to assist with web-traffic filtration, and to reduce the chance of blocking legitimate users.
You can learn more about these cookies here.
You cannot turn off Strictly Necessary cookies.
Functional Cookies.
Functional cookies allow us to remember choices you make about the kind of experience you want on our Websites and to provide you with a more personalized experience.
For example, a functional cookie is required to remember which language you prefer.
You may choose to opt out of these cookies, but if you do, various functions of the Websites or Services may be unavailable to you or may not work as intended.

Performance.
Performance cookies help us learn how you use our Websites to help improve their performance and design.
These cookies provide us with aggregated statistical information such as number of page visits, page load speeds, how long a user spends on a particular page, and the types of browsers or devices used to access our Websites.
For example, we may use cookies to understand what pages you browsed before submitting a sales request form.

Please note that TechTarget will not collect any data when a user is identified by IP address as being based in the EU or UK.

In addition, we also may include tracking pixels, which are small graphic images, in our email messages to determine whether the messages were opened and if the links were clicked.
If you do not want to receive tracking pixels in emails we send you, you will need to disable HTML images in your email client, but that may affect your ability to view images in other emails you receive.
