Customer agrees that email notification of a Personal Data Breach is sufficient.

Customer agrees that DigitalOcean may not notify Customer of security-related events that do not result in a Personal Data Breach.


7.6 Deletion and Return of Personal Data.

DigitalOcean shall further provide written responses (on a confidential basis) to all reasonable requests for information made by Customer, including responses to information security and audit questionnaires, that Customer (acting reasonably) considers necessary to confirm DigitalOcean's compliance with this DPA, provided that Customer shall not exercise this right more than once per year.


7.7.2 To the extent the Standard Contractual Clauses apply and the Customer reasonably argues and establishes that the above documentation and/or other third party audit reports are not sufficient to demonstrate compliance with the obligations laid down in this DPA, the Customer may execute an audit as outlined under Clause 8.9 of the Standard Contractual Clauses accordingly, provided that in such an event, the parties agree: (a) Customer is responsible for all costs and fees relating to such audit (including for time, cost and materials expended by DigitalOcean).
