Anti-corruption statement We are committed to preventing bribery and corruption and support national and international efforts to prevent them.
As a company registered in England and Wales we are primarily governed by the laws of that country, including the Bribery Act 2010, which applies to our conduct both domestically and internationally.
We will also uphold all laws relevant to countering bribery and corruption in all the jurisdictions in which we operate.
Our employees and those acting with our authority are bound by a Code of Conduct and policies which govern their behaviour.
This includes a requirement to observe and uphold our stance against bribery and corruption.
They may not use our business connections for their own benefit and must perform their roles with honesty and integrity in support of our anti-corruption policy.
They are not entitled to seek, receive or obtain, directly or indirectly, any gift or other reward which is intended to induce them to improperly perform their roles.
Equally they must not offer or make any bribes or facilitation payments on our behalf.
To further emphasise our strong commitment to anti-corruption, and in common with other companies within the Volkswagen Group, we actively promote the opportunity for our employees (and our business partners) to report any observed or known incidences within Bentley Motors Limited of corruption, fraud, or other potential criminal activity, through the VW Ombudsman process.
The Ombudsmen are lawyers externally assigned to support the VW organization, and are therefore independent and impartial in dealing with concerns which you may raise.
They are available as a confidential contact point for all employees and business partners willing to report possible evidence of such criminal activities relating to the Volkswagen Group or any of its Brand companies, including Bentley Motors Limited.
To contact Dr Buchert, call +49 / (0) 6105 / 92 13 55 or send an email to dr-buchert@dr-buchert.de
To contact Mr.
Rohrbach, call +49 / (0) 69 / 65 30 03 56 or send an email to rohrbach@ra-rohrbach.de
