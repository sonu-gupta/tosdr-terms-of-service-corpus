Some places donât allow the disclaimers in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you. Limitation of Liability WE DONâT EXCLUDE OR LIMIT OUR LIABILITY TO YOU WHERE IT WOULD BE ILLEGAL TO DO SOâTHIS INCLUDES ANY LIABILITY FOR DROPBOXâS OR ITS AFFILIATESâ FRAUD OR FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION IN PROVIDING THE SERVICES.

Letâs Try to Sort Things Out First. We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case.
Before filing a claim against Dropbox, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting dispute-notice@dropbox.com.
Weâll try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you via email.
If a dispute is not resolved within 15 days of submission, you or Dropbox may bring a formal proceeding.

Judicial Forum for Disputes. You and Dropbox agree that any judicial proceeding to resolve claims relating to these Terms or the Services will be brought in the federal or state courts of San Francisco County, California, subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions below.
Both you and Dropbox consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in such courts.
If you reside in a country (for example, a member state of the European Union) with laws that give consumers the right to bring disputes in their local courts, this paragraph doesnât affect those requirements.

IF YOUâRE A U.S.
RESIDENT, YOU ALSO AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS:


We Both Agree to Arbitrate. You and Dropbox agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms or the Services through final and binding arbitration by a single arbitrator, except as set forth under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below.
This includes disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this âMandatory Arbitration Provisionsâ section, including its enforceability, revocability, or validity.

Opt-out of Agreement to Arbitrate. You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by clicking here and submitting the opt-out form within 30 days of first registering your account.
However, if you agreed to a previous version of these Terms that allowed you to opt out of arbitration, your previous choice to opt out or not opt out remains binding.

Arbitration Procedures. The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes.
The arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or work, San Francisco (CA), or any other location we agree to.

Arbitration Fees and Incentives. The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees.
Dropbox will pay all arbitration fees for individual arbitration for claims less than $75,000.
If you receive an arbitration award that is more favorable than any offer we make to resolve the claim, we will pay you $1,000 in addition to the award.
Dropbox will not seek its attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.

Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate. Either you or Dropbox may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Francisco (CA) or any United States county where you live or work.
Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above.
If the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in San Francisco County, California to resolve your claim.


NO CLASS ACTIONS
.
You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action.
Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations arenât allowed.
If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this âMandatory Arbitration Provisionsâ section will be deemed void. Controlling Law These Terms will be governed by California law except for its conflicts of laws principles.
However, some countries (including those in the European Union) have laws that require agreements to be governed by the local laws of the consumer's country.
This paragraph doesnât override those laws. Entire Agreement These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Dropbox with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace any other prior or contemporaneous agreements, or terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter of these Terms.
These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights. Waiver, Severability &amp.
Assignment Dropboxâs failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later.
If a provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible.
You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any such attempt will be void.
Dropbox may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services. Modifications We may revise these Terms from time to time to better reflect:
(a) changes to the law,
(b) new regulatory requirements, or
(c) improvements or enhancements made to our Services.
If an update affects your use of the Services or your legal rights as a user of our Services, weâll notify you prior to the update's effective date by sending an email to the email address associated with your account or via an in-product notification.
These updated terms will be effective no less than 30 days from when we notify you.
If you donât agree to the updates we make, please cancel your account before they become effective.
Where applicable, weâll offer you a prorated refund based on the amounts you have prepaid for Services and your account cancellation date.
By continuing to use or access the Services after the updates come into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.
If your organization signed a Dropbox Business or Dropbox Enterprise Agreement with Dropbox, that Agreement may have modified the privacy policy below.
