12 Document History
 English, not Legalese Most Terms of Service and Privacy Policy documents are unreadable.
They are written by lawyers and for lawyers, and in our opinion are not very effective.

Because we believe in establishing long-term relationships with our customers, we decided to use plain English instead, to make our terms as clear as possible.

Please donât forget that we are real people: take a look at our about page to get to know us a little.
We are not perfect, but weâre trying our hardest, because we genuinely care about your success.

When you read Orr Group or "we" below, it refers to The Orr Group, LLC, its affiliates, and agents.

Should you have other questions or concerns about this document, please send us an e-mail at team@roll20.net.
 Using Roll20 means accepting these terms By accessing or using Roll20 in any way, whether you have created your own Roll20 account or are invited to view someoneâs private content on Roll20 (such as joining a game as a player), or are just browsing around, you agree to and are bound by the terms and conditions written in this document.

If you do not agree to all of the terms and conditions contained in this document, do not access Roll20.
 This is a living document This is a living document.

We donât amend this document for any particular customer, but if your changes apply to all of our customers, weâll be happy to update it for everyone.
Scroll to the bottom to see the history so far.
We will likely improve this document over time.
By continuing to use the site, you will implicitly accept the changes we make.
We will notify you of any material changes by posting the updated document to this site and updating the âDocument Historyâ section below.
Your access and use of Roll20 is always subject to the most current version of this document.
 Breach of Terms If you breach any of the terms and conditions in this document, your authorization to access or use Roll20 automatically terminates.
Any materials downloaded or printed from Roll20 in violation of the Terms of Service must be immediately destroyed.

We may block, restrict, disable, suspend or terminate your access to all or part of Roll20 at any time in our sole discretion, without prior notice or liability to you.

If you think we removed your access by mistake, let us know and weâll give you our reasoning.
We also have a quick way to restore access without losing any of your data.
 Support Support for Roll20 is provided via our Community Forums.
We also provide a Help and Documentation Site with guides and screencasts that provide instruction on performing common tasks.
 Access to your data What personal data do you collect and why? When you use Roll20, we may ask that you provide us with certain personally identifiable information so we can provide and support Roll20, which includes:
â¢	Name (including Display Name)
â¢	E-mail address

We do not collect Credit Card information directly.
See Who can see my credit card number? below.

We use return e-mail addresses to answer the e-mail we receive.
Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.
We may also collect information that your browser automatically sends when you visit the Roll20 site or when you use Roll20, such as your IP address, âcookie information, and the pages you visit.
We use this information to gather general statistics on your usage and for abuse prevention.
Your internet browser must be enabled to accept cookies from roll20.net in order for you to use Roll20.
Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether.
For more information about cookies, see the Unofficial Cookie FAQ at cookiecentral.com.
You can opt out of certain internet advertising through the Network Advertising Initiativeâs (NAI) Opt Out Tool (http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices) and in the EU at http://www.youronlinechoices.com/.
We, and third-party vendors acting on our behalf use web tools like first-party and third-party cookies, tracking pixels, and scripting techniques to gather and store anonymous analytics and statistics about the Roll20 and how it is being used so we can improve it.
 California Disclosures The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 ("CCPA") requires us to provide additional privacy-related information and rights to residents of California.
The section above What personal information do we collect and why? lists the categories of personal information we have collected and used from and about California residents in the preceding 12 months.

The section below How is my data shared? lists who we have shared personal information with in the preceding 12 months for the following purposes: 1) to provide and improve the Roll20 site and products.
2) to communicate with you for Roll20 support, including with helpdesk tickets.
3) for payment processing.
4) for security and compliance reasons, including monitoring forum posts, in-game chat logs, private messages and wish lists.
and 5) to meet our legal requirements.
The personal information we collect, use and share correspond with the following categories of personal information provided under the CCPA:

â¢	Identifiers including name, username, IP address, email address and account number.
â¢	Information that identifies or is capable of being associated with under the California Customer Records statute (Cal.
Civ.
Code Â§ 1798.80(e)).
â¢	Commercial information about Roll20 products purchased and Paizo products purchased (if you connect your Paizo account to Roll20).
â¢	Internet and network activity information.
and
â¢	Inferences drawn from any of your personal information collected reflecting your preferences and profile.

Subject to certain exceptions, California residents have the right to: (i) request access to your personal information.
and (ii) request deletion of your personal information.
If you want to exercise your CCPA rights, please visit our web form or contact us and include âCCPA Requestâ in the subject line of your email at:

Attn: Data Protection Officer Jeffrey Lamb team@roll20.net

We try to respond to all requests within 10 days.
To protect your privacy, we may need additional information so we can verify your identity before fulfilling your request.
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.
 Who can see my password? No-one.
We never store your password unencrypted, so no-one can read it.

It is your sole responsibility to keep your email, password and other sensitive information confidential.
If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security, you shall notify Orr Group immediately.

If you forget your password, we send you a secure link via email that lets you reset it.
 Who can see my credit card number? No-one at Orr Group.
We use the very trustworthy and secure Stripe payment service.
Read about their security measures on the Stripe Terms of Service (in short, they encrypt your credit card info using industry-standard practices).
 Our Commitment to Childrenâs Privacy Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important.
For that reason, minors in the US who are under 13 and minors in the EU who are under 16 cannot use Roll20.
If you are a minor, you can only use Roll20 with your parents or guardians.
We never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are minors.
If we learn that a minor has provided personal information to us without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information.
 How can I access or correct my information? You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by logging in to Roll20 and visiting the My Account page.
 Who can access my campaigns and other content? By default, all campaigns and other assets that you create or upload to Roll20 are private.
However, if you invite players to join your game, or choose to share your campaigns with other Roll20 users, then they will have access to view those specific campaigns and any assets used in those campaigns.
Any assets that you upload to the Roll20 Marketplace will also be made public under the license that you select when the asset is submitted.
 What are the guidelines Orr Group follows when accessing my data? â¢	We restrict who at Orr Group can access customer data on as needed basis.

â¢	We only do it in response to a customer support question, or to look at issues affecting the entire Roll20 application.

â¢	We only do it in order to debug and fix the issue.

â¢	We never make changes to anything unless explicitly requested by a user.

â¢	We never ever ever share what we see with other customers or the general public.

â¢	We might give access to US authorities if requested in writing.
Weâll try not to, but we donât have the resources to fight the government.
Weâll also keep the account owner informed as much as we can if this happens.
 How is my data protected from another customerâs data? All of our customersâ data resides in the same database.
We use software best practices to guarantee that only people who you designate as viewers of your data can access it.
In other words, we segment our customer data via software.
We do our best and are very confident weâre doing a good job at it, but, like every other web app that hosts their customers data on the same database, cannot guarantee that a sophisticated hacker cannot access other peopleâs data.
If you believe that your data is no longer secure, please contact us immediately.

 How is my data stored? Your personal information may be transferred, stored and processed in the United States or any other country where we or our service providers maintain facilities.

Your acceptance of the Privacy Policy creates your consent to the transfer, storage and processing of your personal information across countries and to and from the third parties with whom we share that personal information.
 How is my data shared? We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to others and have not done so in the past 12 months.
We share personal information with others only in the following ways: 1) if we are required by law, such as protect or rights and/or property, to prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing, and to protect the personal safety of users or the public.
2) with our third-party service providers to perform tasks on our behalf, including hosting, database, network, payment processing, and relate services to support Roll20.
and 3) if we sell all or part of our business, make a transfer pursuant to a merger, or are involved in a bankruptcy.
If we want to share your personal information for another purpose not covered by this Privacy Policy, then we will provide you with notice explaining this new sharing and obtain your consent (if applicable) prior to doing so.

 The rights granted to you constitute a license and not a transfer of title.

 Any Orr Group materials made available only upon payment of a fee may only be viewed, downloaded and printed subject to your payment of such fee.

 Who owns the IP of my campaigns and uploaded content? Orr Group does not claim intellectual property rights over campaigns or uploaded content on Roll20.

We leave it to each Roll20 user to decide who should own the IP of the materials created using their Roll20 account.

Content that you upload to the Roll20 Marketplace remains the IP of the original creator, and becomes subject to the additional terms found in the Marketplace End User Licese Agreement (EULA).

Orr Group does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of your user materials.

 Who owns the IP of the images and sounds that I include in my campaigns via the Art Library, Marketplace, and Jukebox tools? The tokens, map tiles, sounds, and other art assets that you include in your campaigns via the Art Library, Marketplace, and Jukebox tools are the intellectual property of the providers of the assets.
For more information on the assets included in Roll20, and their providers, see the Acknowledgements page and/or the individual asset page on the Marketplace.
We have licensed these assets to allow you to use them to create non-commercial works in a personal setting.
If you wish to re-distribute any campaigns you create on Roll20 that include assets from any of these providers outside of this intended purpose or outside of the Roll20 service, you must contact the provider(s) to license them directly.
Orr Group is not responsible for your use of the assets in any way that violates the rights of the providers.
In addition, assets included from the Roll20 Marketplace are subject to the additional terms in the Marketplace End User Licese Agreement (EULA).

Art that you include in your campaign via the web search and Jukebox features come from a variety of websites across the Internet.
We do our best to only include assets that can be used by you for non-commercial works in a personal setting, but the licensing of each asset may vary.
We provide a credit, including a clickable link, above each art asset so that you can see where it is from and under what license it is released.
You are solely responsible for any infringement of the rights of others that may occur by using these assets in your materials on Roll20.
 Reliability Do you guarantee that Roll20 will be accessible at all times? In short, we do not.
Like all other cloud-based applications, we are vulnerable to the inherent unreliability of the Internet.

We monitor Roll20 closely and have set up automated alarms to be notified (via email and SMS) when the Roll20 service is under stress, so that we can deal with the issue before it becomes a problem that might impact customer access.

You can see for yourself how weâre doing on this front over the last 30 days by looking at our Status Page.

You acknowledge and agree that Orr Group shall not be liable for any failure to store or retrieve your materials on Roll20 at any time.
