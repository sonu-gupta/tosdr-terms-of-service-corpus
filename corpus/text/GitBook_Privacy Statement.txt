we only require the minimum amount of personal information that is necessary to fulfill the purpose of your interaction with us.
we don't sell it to third parties.
and we only use it as this Privacy Statement describes.
If you're visiting us from the EU, please see our global privacy practices: we are compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
No matter where you are, where you live, or what your citizenship is, we provide the same standard of privacy protection to all our users around the world, regardless of their country of origin or location.
Of course, the short version doesn't tell you everything, so please read on for more details!What information GitBook collects and whyInformation from website browsersIf you're just browsing the website, we collect the same basic information that most websites collect.
We use common internet technologies, such as cookies and web server logs.
This is stuff we collect from everybody, whether they have an account or not.
The information we collect about all visitors to our website includes the visitorâs browser type, language preference, referring site, additional websites requested, and the date and time of each visitor request.
We also collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.Why we collect thisWe collect this information to better understand how our website visitors use GitBook, and to monitor and protect the security of the website.Information from users with accountsIf you create an account, we require some basic information at the time of account creation.
You will create your own user name and password, and we will ask you for a valid email address.
You also have the option to give us more information if you want to, and this may include "User Personal Information."
"User Personal Information" is any information about one of our users which could, alone or together with other information, personally identify him or her.
Information such as a user name and password, an email address, a real name, and a photograph are examples of âUser Personal Information.â User Personal Information includes Personal Data as defined in the General Data Protection Regulation.
User Personal Information does not include aggregated, non-personally identifying information.
We may use aggregated, non-personally identifying information to operate, improve, and optimize our website and service.Why we collect this

We need your User Personal Information to create your account, and to provide the services you request, or to respond to support requests.


We use your User Personal Information, specifically your user name, to identify you on GitBook.


We use it to fill out your profile and share that profile with other users if you ask us to.


We will use your email address to communicate with you, if you've said that's okay, and only for the reasons youâve said thatâs okay.
Please see our section on email communication for more information.


We use your User Personal Information for internal purposes, such as to maintain logs for security reasons, for training purposes, and for legal documentation.


We limit our use of your User Personal Information to the purposes listed in this Privacy Statement.
If we need to use your User Personal Information for other purposes, we will ask your permission first.
You can always see what information we have, how we're using it, and what permissions you have given us in your user profile.

Our legal basis for processing informationUnder certain international laws (including GDPR), GitBook is required to notify you about the legal basis on which we process User Personal Information.
GitBook processes User Personal Information on the following legal bases:


When you create a GitBook account, you provide your name and an email address.
We require those data elements for you to enter into the Terms of Service agreement with us, and we process those elements on the basis of performing that contract.
We also process your user name and email address on other bases.
If you have a paid account with us, there will be other data elements we must collect and process on the basis of performing that contract.
GitBook does not collect or process a credit card number, but our third-party payment processor does.


When you fill out the information in your user profile, you have the option to provide User Personal Information such as an avatar which may include a photograph or your biography.
We process this information on the basis of consent.
All of this information is entirely optional, and you have the ability to access, modify, and delete it at any time (while you are not able to delete your email address entirely, this information is private and not shared with other users).


Generally, the remainder of the processing of personal information we perform is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests.
For example, for security purposes, we must keep logs of IP addresses that access GitBook, and in order to respond to legal process, we are required to keep records of users who have sent and received DMCA takedown notices.


If you would like to request erasure of data we process on the basis of consent or object to our processing of personal information, please contact us support@gitbook.com.

Our Terms of Service provides more details.
If your space is public or unlisted, anyone (including us and unaffiliated third parties) may view its contents.
If you have included private or sensitive information in your public repository, such as email addresses or passwords, that information may be indexed by search engines or used by third parties.
In addition, while we do not generally search for content in your spaces, we may scan our servers for certain tokens or security signatures, or for known active malware.
Please see more about User Personal Information in public repositories.How we share the information we collectWe do share User Personal Information with your permission, so we can perform services you have requested or communicate on your behalf.
Additionally, you may indicate, through your actions on GitBook, that you are willing to share your User Personal Information.

We will respect your choices.
We do not share, sell, rent, or trade User Personal Information with third parties for their commercial purposes.
We do not host advertising on GitBook.
We may occasionally embed content from third party sites, such as YouTube, and that content may include ads.
While we try to minimize the amount of ads our embedded content contains, we can't always control what third parties show.
Any advertisements on individual GitBook Pages or in GitBook spaces are not sponsored by, or tracked by, GitBook.
We do not disclose User Personal Information outside GitBook, except in the situations listed in this section or in the section below on Compelled Disclosure.
We do share certain aggregated, non-personally identifying information with others about how our users, collectively, use GitBook, or how our users respond to our other offerings, such as our conferences or events.
However, we do not sell this information to advertisers or marketers.
We do share User Personal Information with a limited number of third party vendors who process it on our behalf to provide or improve our service, and who have agreed to privacy restrictions similar to our own Privacy Statement by signing data protection agreements.
Our vendors perform services such as payment processing, customer support ticketing, network data transmission, and other similar services.
When we transfer your data to our vendors, we remain responsible for it.
While GitBook processes all User Personal Information in the United States, our third party vendors may process data outside of the United States or the European Union.

If you do not want your Personal Information to appear in third partiesâ compilations of GitBook data, please do not make your Personal Information publicly available and be sure to configure your email address to be private in your user profile.
If you would like to compile GitBook data, you must comply with our Terms of Service regarding [scraping and privacy, and you may only use any public-facing Personal Information you gather for the purpose for which our user has authorized it.
For example, where a GitBook user has made an email address public-facing for the purpose of identification and attribution, do not use that email address for commercial advertising.
We expect you to reasonably secure any Personal Information you have gathered from GitBook, and to respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and "do not contact" requests from GitBook or GitBook users.
Similarly, projects on GitBook may include publicly available Personal Information collected as part of the collaborative process.
In the event that a GitBook project contains publicly available Personal Information that does not belong to GitBook users, we will only use that Personal Information for the limited purpose for which it was collected, and we will secure that Personal Information as we would secure any User Personal Information.
