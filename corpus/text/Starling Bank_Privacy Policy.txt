Our Privacy Notice sets out how the personal data collected from you will be processed by us.Close pop upPrivacy Notice
Privacy Notice
Version 2.1, Effective 11 October 2019
PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY VERY CAREFULLY


SETTING THE SCENE

At Starling, service is our no.1 priority.
This includes respecting your privacy and protecting your information.
This has always been the case and so we have updated this notice to build on what we are already doing and to make sure it continues to work with the data protection laws.
Part of the updates include trying to make this notice even easier to understand.
To help us do this, we use some straightforward words throughout the notice that are detailed at the bottom of it - so if you need to check what one of these words means, scroll down to the bottom.
The notice describes how we collect and use your information and it covers all the ways you can interact with us...
and there are lots of ways! For example: you visit any of our websites, you use the App, you have an account with us, you get in touch with us, you apply for a job or you use a service that integrates with us.

Please note that you do not have to transfer your information to us.
however, if you do not, it will severely limit your ability to use our products and services - in particular, you will not be able to have a bank account with us.

The notice has the following sections, so it is best to look there first:

What information do we collect;
How do we use your information and what is the lawful basis;
Who do we share your information with;
Some specific information about credit reference and fraud prevention agencies;
Where do we process and store your information or transfer it;
Your rights;
Other information that we need to give you or we think you will find useful;
Meanings of some of the terms we use.

Each section has two parts:




In short - this sets out a brief, easy to read summary of that section.
and





If you want more detail - this is a more comprehensive explanation of that section.



Our websites and the App may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites or other links or apps of our partner networks and our affiliates.
If you follow one of these links, please note that these links and destinations have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies.
Please check these policies before you submit any of your information via these links or destinations.

4.
CREDIT REFERENCE AGENCIES, CREDIT SCORING AND FRAUD PREVENTION AGENCIES


In short, we use credit reference and fraud prevention agencies for a number of matters including when you apply for an account with us and in relation to lending.
Some of the ways we use them is through automated decision making but you can contact us if this happens and you want us to look at an application again.

If you want more detail:


4.1.
We use credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies.
For a detailed explanation of what they do and what they do with information about you, please refer to the following: https://www.transunion.co.uk/crain, https://www.equifax.co.uk/crain/ or https://www.experian.co.uk/legal/crain/.
Where we share personal data about you with Cifas, it will process that personal data in accordance with its Fair Processing Notice, a copy of which can be found at: https://www.cifas.org.uk/fpn.
4.2.
We use systems to make automated decisions in the following areas:
4.2.1.
whether to give you an account or check a product or service is relevant for you;
4.2.2.
detecting fraud or money-laundering and taking action (e.g.
closing or freezing accounts);
4.2.3.
additionally, if you apply for an overdraft or want to extend an overdraft, we use a credit scoring system.
Please note the following:
4.2.3.1.
this is an automated system which most lenders use to make fair and informed decisions on whether to lend money to certain people and how much.
This helps us to lend responsibly.
The credit scoring methods used are regularly tested to ensure they remain fair, effective and unbiased;
4.2.3.2.
if you apply to borrow money, the system takes account of different information, including that of the credit reference agencies and the information we already hold about you.
The system applies the information to look at your application and whether it is responsible to agree to lend to you.
4.3.
If your application is declined via the system, you can still contact us if you want to have your application looked at again.
4.4.
Ongoing reports may also be provided by credit reference or fraud agencies.


5.
WHERE DO WE PROCESS AND STORE YOUR INFORMATION OR TRANSFER IT?


In short, we generally process your information through servers in the UK and EEA and normally store it for six years.
Sometimes the information goes outside the UK and EEA but we try and keep this to a minimum and we put safeguards in place as far as possible.

If you want more detail:


5.1.
We process your information and store it on servers managed by our hosting providers.
5.2.
Those servers are located across a number of secure data centres in the UK and EEA.
Our server environment is highly secure and there is very limited personnel access.
Any information will be encrypted âat restâ (in other words, on being stored).
5.3.
We try to ensure that we do not send your information outside the UK and EEA.
However, this is not possible in all cases:
5.3.1.
in relation to a very small number of our suppliers, your information may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the UK and EEA as well as processed by staff operating outside the UK and EEA who work for them.
We often rely on the EU-U.S.
and Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework (and the UKâs equivalent from time to time) to safeguard the transfer of your information outside the UK and EEA.
We will ensure that suitable safeguards are in place before your information is transferred outside the UK and EEA as required by law and we will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that information about you is treated securely and in accordance with this notice;
5.3.2.
if you are outside the UK and EEA and make payments or send messages, or you are in the UK and EEA and make payments or send messages outside the UK and EEA, we may process payments through other institutions and payment systems.
They may have to process and store information about you in connection with their own regulations.
please note that the standards to which they adhere may not be as stringent as those in the UK and EEA.
5.4.
Unfortunately, the transmission of your information via the Internet can never be 100% secure.
Although we will do our best to protect your information, we cannot guarantee the security of information about you transmitted to us and so any transmission is at your own risk.
Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
