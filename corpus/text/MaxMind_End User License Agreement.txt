The data available through the GeoIP Databases is referred to in this Agreement as the "GeoIP Data".

 âminFraud Serviceâ refers to the service offered by MaxMind that uses MaxMind proprietary data combined with recognized fraud risks to help merchants identify potentially fraudulent online transactions.

 âGeoIP2 Precision Serviceâ refers to the service offered by MaxMind that uses MaxMind proprietary data to provide geolocation and other information associated with an IP address.

 âServicesâ as used in this Agreement encompasses the GeoIP Databases and the GeoIP Data therein, the minFraud Services and the GeoIP2 Precision Services.

 "Web Services" refers to the minFraud Service and the GeoIP2 Precision Service.
The GeoIP Databases are not âWeb Services.â Unless otherwise specified, all references to the Services in this Agreement include the Web Services.

 "Geolocation Functionality" includes, but is not limited to, the distribution of content based on geographic location, any ability to view the GeoIP Data, any ability to view or access graphical or textual representations of the GeoIP data, and any ability to initiate queries to the GeoIP Databases directly or via your commercial product/service.

 a "ShopID" is an input for a query to the minFraud Service.
The ShopID is your internal identification code or name for the shop, affiliate, merchant, or customer that is the source of the online transaction for which the minFraud Service is being queried.

 providing Geolocation Functionality to applications or online platforms if users other than you can access or use the Geolocation Functionality for their own purposes or benefit (e.g., you may use Geolocation Functionality to customize and target your own ads for your own products and services, surveys, and other content but may not use Geolocation Functionality in connection with a service that customizes or targets any content on behalf of your customers, users, or any third party).

 sharing the GeoIP Data with third parties.
As an illustration, restrictions on sharing GeoIP Data include, but are not limited to, (X) displaying geolocation pairing information (meaning displaying an IP address along with its geographic origination such as "this IP address, XXX.XX.XX.XX, originates from New York City, NY, USA").
and (Y) displaying GeoIP Data in an aggregated format such as "1000 IP addresses originated in New York City" or 
 using the GeoIP2 Anonymous IP Database or the GeoIP Data therein for any purpose unrelated to detecting security incidents or protecting against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity.

and (ii) all GeoIP Databases and GeoIP Data immediately upon termination of the license under this Agreement.
Upon request, you shall provide MaxMind with written confirmation of such destruction.


FCRA In addition, the parties understand and agree that MaxMind is not a consumer reporting agency as defined by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C.
Â§1681 et seq.
("FCRA"), and that the Services do not constitute "consumer reports" as defined in the FCRA.
You understand that any information you provide to MaxMind in order to use the Services has not been collected by MaxMind for credit purposes and is not intended to be indicative of any consumer's credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, or other characteristics listed in Section 603(d) of the FCRA.

Any use of the Services by you in violation of this paragraph shall also constitute an unacceptable use.




ACCURACY EXPECTATION: NO USE OF THE GEOIP DATA OR GEOIP2 PRECISION SERVICES FOR IDENTIFYING SPECIFIC HOUSEHOLDS OR INDIVIDUALS.

Due to the nature of geolocation technology and other factors beyond its
control, MaxMind cannot and does not guarantee the accuracy of the Services.
The GeoIP Databases and GeoIP2 Precision Services contain only the geographic data available and the
availability of such data is not consistent for all regions.
Furthermore, none
of the Services reliably identifies any geographic level or division more
precise than the zip code or postal code associated with an IP address.
Accordingly, it is imperative that MaxMind's customers not rely on the GeoIP
Data or GeoIP2 Precision Services to identify a specific household, individual, or street address.
You
acknowledge the foregoing limitation of the Services and you will not
use or encourage others to use the Services for the purpose of identifying or
locating a specific household, individual, or street address.


 NON-DISCLOSURE OF MINFRAUD SERVICE OUTPUTS.

Except as explicitly provided in this Agreement, you may not, nor may you permit others to, disclose to any customer or other third party any output returned by the minFraud Service (e.g., such response
values as the riskScore, proxyScore or proxy score, IP Risk Score, subscores,
high risk flags), recognizing that the confidentiality of such information is
vital to the performance of the minFraud service.
Disclosure of such
information shall be considered a material breach of this Agreement.
For the removal of doubt, you may provide outputs returned by the minFraud Service to customers to whom you have sublicensed the minFraud Service, but you may not provide any minFraud Service outputs to any individual whose transaction was evaluated by the minFraud Service.

You further acknowledge and agree that
(a) all intellectual property rights including copyrights, moral rights,
trademarks, trade secrets, and proprietary rights to the Services are
exclusively owned by MaxMind and (b) you obtain no right, title, or interest
therein.
You hereby assign to MaxMind all copyrights, intellectual property
rights, and any other proprietary or property rights or interests in and to any
work created in violation of this Agreement.


MaxMind's successful maintenance and operation of the Services require that it
store, retain, and utilize data that is submitted to it by customers who use
the Services.
Accordingly, and to the extent that any data submitted to
MaxMind by you is protectable by copyright, moral rights, or any similar
intellectual property laws in any jurisdiction, you hereby assign and agree to
assign to MaxMind all right, title, and interest in and to such data and/or the
aggregated product of such data.
To the extent that you are legally or
contractually unable to assign the foregoing rights of ownership, then you
hereby grant to MaxMind a fully paid-up, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable
license to use, copy, distribute, make derivative works, and otherwise
