We also process information about your followers, the likes you receive and responses to content you upload, for the purposes of personalising your "For You" Feed, promoting your content to other users and exploring whether your profile presents opportunities for collaboration.

Where local laws allow us to, we collect and process your messages, which includes scanning and analysing the information in those messages through the Platformâs messaging functionality.
That information includes the content of the message and information about when the message has been sent, received and/or read, as well as the participants in the communication.
We do this to prevent and block spam, prevent and detect crime, safeguard children (where this is in the substantial public interest) or to protect the interests of our users and other people. 
Please also be aware that messages sent to other users of the Platform will be accessible by those users and that we are not responsible for how those users use or disclose them.
