Consumers:&nbsp.
The vast majority of the information that LegalZoom collects comes directly or indirectly from the consumer that it relates to.&nbsp.
Information that is collected directly from you is information that you provide when you complete a form online, use a chat feature, or speak to us on the phone.&nbsp.
We may also collect information indirectly about you when you interact with our website, through the use of cookies and other tracking technologies.&nbsp.
Indirect collection is described in more detail in the section below called âHow LegalZoom Uses Cookies and Similar Technologies.â

Related Consumers: We may collect information about you from someone you know.&nbsp.
For instance, if you are a shareholder in a business that is formed through LegalZoom, we may be given information about you in order to complete the formation.

An example of the type of information that we may receive from these professionals includes the fact that a consult has occurred.&nbsp.

Business Partners and Affiliates:&nbsp.

Unrelated Parties:&nbsp.
We may receive information related to you from people and entities with whom LegalZoom does not have a direct relationship.&nbsp.
An example of the type of information that we may receive from unrelated third parties is documents that we receive on your behalf in our role as your Registered Agent. How We Use the Information We Collect About Consumers.

Cookies.&nbsp.
LegalZoom and its partners may use the standard cookie feature of major browser applications and third-party service providers, including Google Analytics features (Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager Integration and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting), or employ internally developed cookies and tracking codes, that allow LegalZoom to store a small piece of data on a visitor's computer, or any other device a visitor uses to access our website, about his or her visit to the website or use of other plug-ins exchanging information with LegalZoom.&nbsp.
We also use similar technologies, such as JavaScripts or ETags, to analyze trends, administer the website, track usersâ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

Web Beacons.  We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a.
web beacons), that help us track referrals from our partners and affiliates and better manage content on our website.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a userâs computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.

3rd Party Tracking.  The use of tracking technologies by our service providers, technology partners or other 3rd party assets (such as social media links) on the site is not covered by our Privacy Policy.  These 3rd parties may use cookies, clear gifs, images, and scripts to help them better manage their content on our site.   We do not have access or control over these technologies.  

Partner and Affiliate Tracking. Our partners and affiliates, including Google Analytics (Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager Integration, and Google Analytics and Interest Reporting), may use cookies and web beacons to collect information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.
This means that these partners and affiliates may show our ads on sites across the Internet based upon your previous visits to our website.
Together with our partners and affiliates, we may use these cookies and web beacons to report how your ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to your visits to our site. 
If you would like to learn more or opt out of receiving online display advertising tailored to your interests, please visit the Networking Advertising Initiative at www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp or the Digital Advertising Alliance at http://aboutads.info/choices.&nbsp.
If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking here.&nbsp.
Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.&nbsp.
You will continue to receive generic ads.
If you delete your cookies, use a different browser, or buy a new computer, you will need to renew your online display advertising opt-out choice.
You may also learn more about how Google Analytics uses your information by visiting Googleâs page How Google Uses Information From Sites or Apps That Use Our Service.&nbsp.
You may also visit Google Analyticsâ Ads Settings to opt out of Googleâs use of cookies and customize Google Display Network ads, and Google Analyticsâ Opt Out Browser Add-on for the web. Third Party Links

For instance, when using Identity Protection products (including Business Data Protection and LegalZoom Identity Protection), you will visit websites maintained by LegalZoomâs partner Experian, and the Experian privacy policy will govern the information you provide on that website.
 If you visit other websites, LegalZoom is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of those sites.
It is your responsibility to review the privacy policies of non-LegalZoom websites to confirm that you understand and agree with them.

Social Media Widgets. Our website includes social media features, such as the Facebook âlikeâ button and widgets, such as the âShare thisâ button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site.

If you are a resident of California, this section provides information regarding your rights, and LegalZoomâs responsibilities, regarding your Personal Information. 


California Resident Rights


California law allows California residents, upon a verifiable consumer request, to request that a business that collects consumersâ Personal Information give consumers access to certain information.&nbsp.
This includes the specific pieces and categories of Personal Information that the business has collected about the consumer, the categories of sources for that information, the business or commercial purposes for collecting the information, and the categories of third parties with which the information was shared.
California residents also have the right to submit a request for deletion of information under certain circumstances.&nbsp.
This is not an absolute right and, in some circumstances, LegalZoom may decline to delete the information, such as when LegalZoom has an on-going business relationship with you, when we have a continued need to use the information for purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, or when we are legally required to retain the information.&nbsp.
 
Consistent with California law, if you choose to exercise your rights, we will not charge you different prices or provide different quality of services unless those differences are related to your information.


How to Submit a Request for Access to Information or Deletion of Information


If you would like to submit a request about your data, we encourage you to do so by completing the form located here.&nbsp.
You can also submit a request by emailing customercare@legalzoom.com or by calling our toll-free number at (800) 773-0888. 
After you submit the request you will be asked to verify your email address and may also be asked to provide additional information in order to verify your identity, including potentially providing a declaration under penalty of perjury.&nbsp.
LegalZoom will attempt to verify your identity by asking for information that correlates with the information that we have previously collected about you.&nbsp.

Please note that consistent with California law, we will be unable to satisfy your request until we have verified your identity.
You may also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf.
