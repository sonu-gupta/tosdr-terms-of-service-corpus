Most commonly, we will use your Personal Data under the following circumstances:

You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.

Contract

When we need to execute a contract you have entered into with us by accepting applicable terms and conditions or specific related terms relating to other services offered by us.
 
Where we need to collect Personal Data under the terms of a contract we have with you, and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform our services under the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with any of our services).
In this case, we may have to cancel a service you have with us but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.

Legal or regulatory obligation 

When we need to collect Personal Data by law.
If you fail to provide that data when requested, we will not be able to perform our services under the contract with you (for example, to provide you with any of our products or services).
In this case, we will have to cancel a product or service you have with us and we will notify you at that time.

Legitimate Interests

Legitimate Interest means the broader stake that Xapo has in the processing or the benefit that we derive from the processing of your Personal Data.
Where we rely on legitimate interests, we make sure that we consider and balance any potential impact on you and your rights before we process your Personal Data for our legitimate interests. 
Additionally, we may also process certain special categories of data such as criminal convictions and biometric data where we are lawfully permitted to do so and only for limited purposes such as fraud or money laundering/terrorist financing prevention and detection.
Apart from this, we do not collect any of the following Special Categories of Personal Data about you that includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health and genetic data
We also collect, use and share Aggregated Data such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose.
Aggregated Data could be derived from your Personal Data but is not considered Personal Data in law as this data will not directly or indirectly reveal your identity.
For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific website or Mobile App feature.
However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your Personal Data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as Personal Data, which will be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

We have set out in a table format, a description of all the ways we plan to use your Personal Data, and the legal basis we rely on to do so.

Promotional Offers From Us

We may use your identity, contact, technical, usage and profile data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you.
This is how we decide which services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).
You can expect to receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information or purchased services from us and you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.

AML KYC Privacy NoticeWe will process your identifying data and profile data within operations such as identification (Know your Customer, also known as KYC) and profiling (Customer Due Diligence, also known as CDD) for the purposes of the execution of our Anti Money Laundering (also known as AML) and Counter Terrorism Financing (also known as CTF) customer identification and verification process obligations.
When Xapo asks for CDD, what this refers to is proof of address and proof of identification.
This along with information gathered at the application stage paints a picture of any customer (KYC).
Without KYC, Xapo may unknowingly become involved with illicit activities and therefore subject to reputational, operational and legal risks, which can result in significant financial cost, or eventual winding up of the institution.
KYC is most closely associated with the fight against money-laundering.
Specific proof of address, proof of Identification, source of funds and/or AML-CTF questionnaires that aimed at to fulfil KYC and CDD obligations are compulsory to Xapo users and the failure to be replied might lead (in extreme cases) in the blocking of their accounts or the refusal of services.
In response to the scale and effect of money laundering, the European Union has passed Directives designed to combat money laundering and terrorism.
These Directives, together with national regulations as read below, form the cornerstone of our AML/CTF obligations, establish the legal basis for us to process this data and outline the offenses and penalties for failing to comply.


Directive (EU) 2015/2366 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2015 on payment services in the internal market;


Directive (EU) 2015/849 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing;


Council Decision of 17 October 2000 concerning arrangements for cooperation between financial intelligence units of the Member States in respect of exchanging information (2000/642/JHA);


Crime Proceeds of Crime Act 2015; 


Terrorism Act 2018;


Drug Trafficking Offences Act 1995;






 Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Policies

Our AML policy is designed to prevent money laundering by meeting the European standards on combating money laundering and terrorism financing, including the need to have adequate systems and controls in place to mitigate the risk of the firm being used to facilitate financial crime.
Our AML policy sets out the minimum standards which must be complied with and includes:


Appointing a Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO) who has a sufficient level of seniority and independence, and who has responsibility for oversight of compliance with the relevant legislation, regulations, rules and industry guidance;


Establishing and maintaining a Risk-Based Approach (RBA) to the assessment and management of money laundering and terrorist financing risks faced by the firm.
The requirement to provide CDD related data throughout an RBA that will always take into account different factors such as the status of the client, the nature of the transactions, the financial product or the financial flows involved;


Establishing and maintaining risk-based Customer Due Diligence (CDD), identification, verification and Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures, including enhanced due diligence for customers presenting a higher risk, such as Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs);


Establishing and maintaining risk-based systems and procedures for the monitoring of on-going customer activity;


Establishing procedures for reporting suspicious activity internally and to the relevant law enforcement authorities as appropriate;


Maintaining appropriate records for the minimum prescribed periods;


Providing training for and raising awareness among all relevant employees.


As a regulated financial institution, Xapo has specific requirements regarding AML systems and procedures.
This reflects senior managementâs desire to prevent money laundering.




Sanctions Policy

Xapo is prohibited from transacting with individuals, companies and countries that are on prescribed sanctions lists.
Xapo will therefore screen against United Nations, European Union, UK Treasury and US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions lists in all jurisdictions in which we operate.




Automated Decision Making

We use semi-automated processes which includes, but is not limited to, screening Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) data you provide to us in order to assess whether or not we are legally able to allow you to use our services.
All automated screenings matches are manually reviewed by Xapo compliance analysts.
The analyst will review the triage cases to determine if they should be cleared or escalated to the MLRO.
 




Third Parties AML-KYC

Where processing of personal data is carried out on behalf of Xapo by a third party provider, we conclude a separate contract with the processor with respect to this processing.
This contract ensures compliance with European data protection regulations and defines sufficient guarantees for the implementation of appropriate technical and organisational measures, which ensure the protection of your rights.Categories of Providers
