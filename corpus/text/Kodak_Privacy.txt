Scope of This Notice This Privacy Notice explains how Eastman Kodak Company (343 State Street, Rochester, NY 14650, USA) ("Kodak") uses and discloses personal information.
It also applies to those Kodak affiliates, websites, applications, and other digital offerings that link to it.
The goal of this Privacy Notice is to inform you of the choices you have about the way the information collected is used.


PLEASE NOTE:  This Privacy Notice does not apply to sites hosted by unaffiliated third parties, Kodak brand licensed partners, or unaffiliated online stores that offer Kodak-branded merchandise.
These companies have their own privacy policies, and questions about privacy should be directed to them.

Additionally:

Some Kodak international sites have their own country-specific privacy notices.
These will be presented to you if you use these sites.

On our co-branded sites (such as those sites where Kodak has presented content together with one of our retail partners), a privacy notice unique to that site may be presented.
Private sites (such as those only available to dealers and distributors) and sites created for our employees (or prospective employees) may also have privacy notices unique to those sites.

Please check the âprivacy linkâ on the bottom of each website to read the privacy information associated with each site.
You can also contact the Kodak Privacy Office at privacy@kodak.com if you have any questions.
