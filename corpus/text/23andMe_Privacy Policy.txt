Information we share with third parties




General service providers.


We share the information described above in Section 2 with our third party service providers, as necessary for them to provide their services to us and help us perform our contract with you.
Service providers are third parties (other companies or individuals) that help us to provide, analyze and improve our Services.
While 23andMe directly conducts the majority of data processing activities required to provide our Services to you, we engage some third party service providers to assist in supporting our Services, including in the following areas:



Order fulfillment and shipping.â Our payment processor processes certain Registration Information, such as your billing address and credit card information, as necessary to enable you to purchase a 23andMe kit from the 23andMe.com online store.
Our distribution centers ship your kit(s) to you, and in some cases help return your kit safely to us or to our third party laboratory so your sample can be processed.



Our CLIA-certified genotyping lab.â To use our genetic testing services, you must purchase, or receive as a gift, a 23andMe Personal Genetic Service testing kit, and ship your saliva sample to us or our third party laboratory.
Once delivered, receiving personnel at the laboratory remove and discard kit packaging, which in some cases may contain "sender information" (e.g., name, address), before testing personnel receive the samples for processing.
Receiving personnel do not perform testing, and testing personnel handle saliva samples that are only identified by a unique barcode.
For samples processed by our third party genotyping laboratory, when the laboratory has completed their analysis, they securely send the resulting Genetic Information to us identified by your unique barcode.


During kit registration, you are asked to review our Consent Document for Sample Storage and Additional Genetic Analyses.
Unless you consent to Biobanking and additional analyses, your saliva sample and DNA are destroyed after the laboratory completes its work, subject to the legal and regulatory requirements.
Should you wish to update your sample storage preference to discard a stored sample, you can do so within your 23andMe Account Settings once your sample has completed processing.
As detailed further in Section 5.d.
(Account Deletion), our genotyping laboratory or contracted genotyping laboratory will retain certain information as necessary to comply with applicable regulatory and legal obligations.



Customer Care support. Our Customer Care team uses a number of tools to help organize and manage the requests we receive.
These tools help to ensure we provide timely, high quality support.


Cloud storage, IT, and Security. Our cloud storage providers provide secure storage for information in 23andMe databases, ensure that our infrastructure can support continued use of our Services by 23andMe customers, and protect data in the event of a natural disaster or other disruption to our Service.
Our IT and security service providers assist with intrusion detection and prevention measures to stop any potential attacks against our networks.
We have these third party experts perform regular penetration tests and periodically audit 23andMeâs security controls.



Marketing and analytics. When you use our Services, including our website or mobile app(s), our third party service providers may collect Web-Behavior Information about your visit, such as the links you clicked on, the duration of your visit, and the URLs you visited.
This information can help us improve site navigability and assess our Marketing campaigns.
Per applicable data protection regulations, our EU, UK, and International websites present visitors with a cookie opt in to allow the processing described above via Functionality and Advertising Cookies.


NOTE: Our service providers act on 23andMe's behalf.
We implement procedures and maintain contractual terms with each service provider to protect the confidentiality and security of your information.
However, we cannot guarantee the confidentiality and security of your information due to the inherent risks associated with storing and transmitting data electronically.




For individuals located in the European Economic Area (âEEAâ), United Kingdom, or Switzerland (collectively the âDesignated Countriesâ): Where Personal Information are transferred to a third country or to an international organisation, 23andMe implements appropriate safeguards, such as contractual obligations, relating to the transfer.




"Targeted advertising" service providers


We permit third party advertising networks and providers to collect Web-Behavior Information regarding the use of our Services to help us to deliver targeted online advertisements ("ads") to you.
They use cookies and similar technologies, to gather information about your browser's or device's visits and usage patterns on our Services and on other websites over time, which helps to better personalize ads to match your interests, and to measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns.
We and our third party service providers will not use your Sensitive Information, such as Genetic Information and Self-Reported Information, for targeted marketing without asking for and receiving your explicit consent.


For more information about our marketing practices, please review our Cookie Policy.




Aggregate information


We may share Aggregate Information, which is information that has been stripped of your name and contact information and combined with information of others so that you cannot reasonably be identified as an individual, with third parties.
This Information is different from "Individual-level" information and is not Personal Information because it does not identify any particular individual or disclose any particular individualâs data.
For example, Aggregate Information may include a statement that "30% of our female users share a particular genetic trait," without providing any data or testing results specific to any individual user.
In contrast, Individual-level Genetic Information or Self-Reported Information consists of data about a single individual's genotypes, diseases or other traits/characteristics information and could reveal whether a specific user has a particular genetic trait, or consist of all of the Genetic Information about that user.
23andMe will ask for your consent to share Individual-level Genetic Information or Self-Reported Information with any third party, other than our service providers as necessary for us to provide the Services to you.




Information we share with commonly owned entities


We may share some or all of your Personal Information with other companies under common ownership or control of 23andMe, which may include our subsidiaries, our corporate parent, or any other subsidiaries owned by our corporate parent in order to provide you better service and improve user experience.
Generally, sharing such information is necessary for us to perform on our contract with you.
We may provide additional notice and ask for your prior consent if we wish to share your Personal Information with our commonly owned entities in a materially different way than discussed in this Privacy Statement.




As required by law


Under certain circumstances your Personal Information may be subject to processing pursuant to laws, regulations, judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders.
For example, we may be required to disclose Personal Information in coordination with regulatory authorities in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
23andMe will preserve and disclose any and all information to law enforcement agencies or others if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal or regulatory process (such as a judicial proceeding, court order, or government inquiry) or obligations that 23andMe may owe pursuant to ethical and other professional rules, laws, and regulations.
(b) enforce the 23andMe Terms of Service and other policies.
(c) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties.
or (d) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of 23andMe, its employees, its users, its clients, and the public.
View our Transparency Report for more information.


NOTE: If you are participating in 23andMe Research, 23andMe will withhold disclosure of your Personal Information involved in such Research in response to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants or orders in accordance with any applicable Certificate of Confidentiality that 23andMe has obtained from the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
There are limits to what the Certificate of Confidentiality covers so please visit the Certificates of Confidentiality Kiosk.




Business transactions


In the event that 23andMe goes through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets your Personal Information will likely be among the assets transferred.
In such a case, your information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Statement.

Your choices



Access to your account


We provide access to your 23andMe data within your 23andMe account.
You can access and download data processed by 23andMe within your 23andMe Account Settings and within applicable Reports, Tools, and features.
If you lose access to your 23andMe account or account email address, please contact Customer Care for assistance.
If you lose access to your 23andMe account, in certain circumstances, we may require that you submit additional information sufficient to verify your identity before providing access or otherwise releasing information to you.
If you choose not to submit the required documentation, or the information provided is not sufficient for the purposes sought, 23andMe will not be able to sufficiently verify your identity in order to complete your request.


You may access, correct or update most of your Registration Information on your own within your 23andMe Account Settings.
You may also review and update your consent to 23andMe Research and Biobanking.
You may be able to correct Self-Reported Information entered into a survey, form, or feature within your account, such as on the surveys page, by clicking âEdit your answers here.â Please note that you may not be able to delete User Content that has been shared with others through the Service and that you may not be able to delete information that has been shared with third parties.


Individuals located in Designated Countries should review Section 9.e.
to understand their rights to access Personal Information.




Marketing communications


As noted in Section 3.h.
you may be asked to opt-in to receive product and promotional emails or notifications when creating your 23andMe account or when using our Services.

Sharing outside of the 23andMe Services


You may decide to share your Personal Information with friends and/or family members, doctors or other health care professionals, and/or other individuals outside of our Services, including through third party services such as social networks and third party apps that connect to our website and mobile apps through our application programming interface ("API").
These third parties may use your Personal Information differently than we do under this Privacy Statement.
Please make such choices carefully and review the privacy statements of all other third parties involved in the transaction.
23andMe does not endorse or sponsor any API applications, and does not affirm the accuracy or validity of any interpretations made by third party API applications.


In general, it can be difficult to contain or retrieve Personal Information once it has been shared or disclosed.
23andMe will have no responsibility or liability for any consequences that may result because you have released or shared Personal Information with others.
Likewise, if you are reading this because you have access to the Personal Information of a 23andMe customer through a multi-profile account, we urge you to recognize your responsibility to protect the privacy of each person within that account.
Users with multi-profile accounts (i.e., where multiple family members register their kits to one account) should use caution in setting profile-level privacy settings.




Account deletion


If you no longer wish to participate in our Services, or no longer wish to have your Personal Information be processed, you may delete your 23andMe account and Personal Information within your 23andMe Account Settings.
Once you submit your request, we will send an email to the email address linked to your 23andMe account detailing our account deletion policy and requesting that you confirm your deletion request.
Once you confirm your request to delete your account and data, your account will no longer be accessible while we process your request.
Once you confirm your request, this process cannot be cancelled, undone, withdrawn, or reversed.
When your account is deleted, all associated Personal Information is deleted and any stored samples are discarded, subject to the following limitations:



Information previously included in 23andMe Research.
As stated in any applicable Consent Document, Genetic Information and/or Self-Reported Information that you have previously provided and for which you have given consent to use in 23andMe Research cannot be removed from completed studies that use that information.
Your data will not be included in studies that start more than 30 days after your account is closed (it may take up to 30 days to withdraw your information after your account is closed).

23andMe and/or our contracted genotyping laboratory will retain your Genetic Information, date of birth, and sex as required for compliance with applicable legal obligations, including the federal Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA), California Business and Professions Code Section 1265 and College of American Pathologists (CAP) accreditation requirements.
23andMe will also retain limited information related to your account and data deletion request, including but not limited to, your email address, account deletion request identifier, communications related to inquiries or complaints and legal agreements for a limited period of time as required by law, contractual obligations, and/or as necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims and for audit and compliance purposes.

Neither 23andMe nor any of its Services are designed for, intended to attract, or directed toward children under the age of 18.

Information for Customers in Designated Countries


Section 9 only applies to individuals located in the European Economic Area (âEEAâ), United Kingdom, or Switzerland (the âDesignated Countriesâ).




International Transfers


Your Personal Information will likely be transferred to, stored, and processed in the U.S.
and other countries outside of where you live.
When we conduct such transfers, we rely on various legal bases to lawfully transfer Personal Information around the world, including the European Union Commission approved model contractual clauses.


In addition to such lawful data transfer mechanisms, 23andMe continues to participate in and has certified its compliance with both the EU-U.S.
and Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield Frameworks as set forth by the U.S.
Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Information transferred from the European Union (âEUâ), European Economic Area (âEEAâ), and Switzerland to the United States, respectively.
23andMe remains committed to applying the Privacy Shield Frameworkâs applicable Principles to Personal Information received from the EU, EEA and Switzerland.
If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Statement and applicable Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.
To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit the U.S.

Our relationship with you


We are the âcontrollerâ with respect to your Personal Information because we determine the means and purposes of processing your information when using our Services.




Legal bases for processing Personal Information from the EU


We describe how we process your Personal Information in Sections 2 through 4 of this Privacy Statement.
We may process your Personal Information if you consent to the processing, to satisfy our legal obligations, if it is necessary to carry out our obligations arising from any contracts we entered with you or to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract with you, or for our legitimate interests to protect our property, rights or safety of 23andMe, our customers or others.




Direct Marketing


We will obtain your consent where required to send you marketing communications using electronic means.
You may withdraw your consent at any time within your 23andMe Account Settings or by emailing privacy@23andme.com.â We will only contact you by electronic means (email, push notification, SMS, etc.) with information about our Services that are similar to those which were the subject of a previous sale or negotiation of a sale to you.


We will only share your Personal Information with third parties for marketing purposes with your explicit consent.
If you do not want us to use your Personal Information in this way, please review and update your 23andMe Account Settings as necessary or contact us at privacy@23andme.com.
You may raise such objection with regard to initial or further processing for purposes of direct marketing at any time and free of charge.
The withdrawal of your consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.


Other marketing activities will happen based on the legitimate interests of 23andMe.
E.g., where we tailor marketing communications or send targeted marketing messages via post, phone or social media and other third party platforms.
and in providing existing customers with information (via email or other channels) about similar products and services.




Privacy Rights


You can exercise your privacy rights by following the instructions below or contacting us at privacy@23andMe.com.
We will handle your request under applicable law.
When you make a request, we may verify your identity to protect your privacy and security.



Right to withdraw consent. To the extent 23andMe requests and you provide your consent to the processing of your Personal Information, you can withdraw your consent at any time.
Your withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of our processing based on consent before your withdrawal.


Right of access to and rectification of your Personal Information.â Our site allows you to access and rectify certain Registration Information within your 23andMe Account Settings, and your Self-Reported Information by going to the surveys page, and other information as required by applicable law.
You can download your raw Genetic Information within your 23andMe Account Settings or by going to the applicable tool in âToolsâ.
If you would like to access or rectify any other information, contact Customer Care and we will do our best to assist you without undue delay.
We may reject part or all of your request if responding to your request could adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.


Right to erasure (or, âRight to be Forgottenâ).â As explained under Section 5.d.
(Account Deletion), we allow you to delete your account at any time.
You can request erasure of Personal Information that: (a) is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed.
(b) was collected in relation to processing to which you previously consented, but later withdrew such consent.
or (c) was collected in relation to processing activities to which you object, and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for our processing.
If we have made your Personal Information public and we are required to erase such Personal Information, we will take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform controllers that are processing any links to or copies or replications of your Personal Information of your erasure request.
Our assistance with your request for erasure is subject to limitations by relevant data protection laws, available technology and the cost of implementation.


Right to data portability. If we process your Personal Information based on a contract with you or based on your consent, or the processing is carried out by automated means, you may request your Personal Information in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.
You may also request the transfer of your Personal Information directly to another controller, where technically feasible, unless choosing to exercise this right adversely affects the rights and freedoms of others.
A âcontrollerâ is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of your Personal Information.


Right to restriction of our processing. You can restrict our processing of your Personal Information where one of the following applies: (a) you dispute the accuracy of Personal Information processed by 23andMe (for a period enabling us to verify its accuracy).
(b) the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of the Personal Information and request the restriction of its use instead.
(c) 23andMe no longer needs the Personal Information for the purposes of the processing, but it is required by you for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
and (d) you have objected to certain processing relying on legitimate interest, pending the verification whether 23andMeâs legitimate grounds override your rights.
Restricted Personal Information shall only be processed with your consent or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest.
We will notify you if the restriction is lifted.


Notification of erasure, rectification and restriction. We will provide notice to each recipient that we disclosed your Personal Information to regarding any rectification or erasure of Personal Information or restriction of processing, unless you initiated the disclosure or providing notice proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort.
Upon your request, we will share the list of recipients with you.


Right to object to processing. Where the processing of your Personal Information is based on consent, contract, or legitimate interests described under the Legal Bases for Processing heading above, you may restrict or object, at any time, to the processing of your Personal Information as permitted by applicable law.
We may continue to process your Personal Information if it is necessary for the defense of legal claims, or for any other exceptions permitted by applicable law.


Automated individual decision-making, including profiling. You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal or similarly significant effects on you, except as allowed under applicable data protection laws.


Retention of your Personal Information. Unless you delete your account or delete certain Personal Information (i.e., User Content, etc.), we will store your Personal Information as long as your account is open.
If you delete your account, we will take the steps described under âYour Choices â Account Deletionâ and delete all your Personal Information, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.



The rights described above may be limited by local laws.
Further, your right of access and deletion is not absolute and may not be available if fulfillment of such right would, among other things:



cause interference with execution and enforcement of the law and legal private rights (such as in the case of the investigation or detection of legal claims or the right to a fair trial).


breach or prejudice the rights of confidentiality and security of others.


prejudice security or grievance investigations, corporate re-organizations, future and ongoing negotiations with third parties, the compliance with regulatory requirements relating to economic and financial management.
or


otherwise violate the interests of others or where the burden or cost of providing access would be disproportionate.
