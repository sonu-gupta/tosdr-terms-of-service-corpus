IMPORTANT--PLEASE READ CAREFULLY.
If you are a resident of or have your principal place of business in the European Economic Area, these Terms of Use ("Terms") are an agreement between you and Blackboard International B.V., a private company formed and existing under the laws of the Netherlands.
Otherwise, these Terms are an agreement between you and Blackboard Inc., a Delaware corporation.
References to "us", "we", "our", and "Blackboard" shall mean either Blackboard International B.V.

These Terms govern your access to and use of Blackboard software, products, and/or services (individually or collectively, the "Products") and any information, content, text, graphics, photos or other materials uploaded, downloaded, purchased, or appearing on or through the Products (collectively referred to as "Content").

These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access and use the Products ("Users").

PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND EACH PROVISION.
THESE TERMS CONTAIN A MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER PROVISION THAT, TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE TO YOU, REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in these Terms supersedes or limits your rights under (1) the terms and conditions of any written agreement you have entered into with Blackboard regarding the use of Products, or (2) applicable laws or regulations to the extent these Terms are prohibited by such laws or regulations.
In the event of any conflict between these Terms and the terms and conditions of an applicable written agreement you have entered into with Blackboard, the terms and conditions of the written agreement shall control. 1.
Basic terms &amp.

We may maintain different types of accounts for different types of Users.
If you are accepting these Terms and using the Products on behalf of a company, organization, government, or other legal entity, then (a) âyouâ includes you and that entity, and (b) you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the entity with the authority to bind the entity to these Terms, and that you agree to these Terms on the entityâs behalf.

(ii) controlling the Userâs access to and use of the Products.
and (iii) the consequences of any misuse.
Blackboard requires that the parents, guardian, or other authorized adult or educational institution of a minor affirmatively consent to the use of a Blackboard Product by such minor.

For additional information on how we use your information, please see our Privacy Policy.

General terms A.
Waiver &amp.
severability The failure of Blackboard to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision.
In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.
except that in the event of unenforceability of the universal class action/jury trial waiver set forth in Section 11(B)(iii) below, the entire arbitration agreement shall be unenforceable. B.
Governing law.
dispute resolution 
(i) Governing Law. These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to or application of its conflict of law provisions or your state or country of residence.
All claims, legal proceedings, or litigation arising in connection with the Products will be brought solely in the federal or state courts located in Washington, D.C., United States, and you consent to the jurisdiction of and venue in such courts and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum.
(ii) Arbitration. READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM BLACKBOARD.
For any dispute with Blackboard, you agree to first contact us at GeneralCounsel@blackboard.com and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally.
In the unlikely event that Blackboard has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as provided below) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms, or the breach or alleged breach thereof, by binding arbitration by JAMS, under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS, except as provided herein.
JAMS may be contacted at www.jamsadr.com.
The arbitration will be conducted in Washington, D.C., United States, unless you and Blackboard agree otherwise.
If you are using the Products for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneysâ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses.
If you are an individual using the Products for non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS.
(ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorneyâs fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses.
and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process.
Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing Blackboard from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights.
(iii) Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver. WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSON AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE PRODUCTS FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL, OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIESâ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE (1) PERSONâS CLAIMS.
