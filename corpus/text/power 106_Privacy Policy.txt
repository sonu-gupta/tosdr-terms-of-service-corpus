GDPR
â) IS VOLUNTARY.&nbsp.
WE DO NOT CONSENT OR SUBMIT TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE EUROPEAN UNION FOR ANY PURPOSE OR MATTER OF ANY KIND OR WAIVE ANY RIGHTS OR DEFENSES IN LAW OR EQUITY WITH RESPECT THERETO.
Our website, mobile applications, and the services or products available through them are targeted primarily, but not exclusively for, users in the United States of America.
Any information you enter on our website or mobile applications is transferred outside of the European Union to the United States of America which does not offer an equivalent level of protection to that required in the European Union.

The United States of America uses a sectoral model of privacy protection that relies on a mix of legislation, governmental regulation, and self-regulation.
Article26 of the European Unionâs Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC, 1995 O.J.
(L281) 31) also known as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (âGDPRâ)  allows for transfer of personal data from the European Union to a third country if the individual has unambiguously given his consent to the transfer of Personal Data, regardless of the third countryâs level of protection.

BY USING OUR WEBSITE, OUR MOBILE APPLICATIONS, OR OUR SERVICES, YOU CONSENT TO THE TRANSFER OF ALL PERSONAL DATA TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WHICH MAY NOT OFFER AN EQUIVALENT LEVEL OF PROTECTION TO THAT REQUIRED IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND TO THE PROCESSING OF THAT INFORMATION BY US ON OUR SERVERS LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AS DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.

Your Data Protection Rights Under the GDPR

If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), the GDPR provides you with  certain data protection rights.
GSR aims to take reasonable steps to allow you to correct, amend, delete, or limit the use of your Personal Data.&nbsp.

Â·
You may request that we cease processing of your Personal Data
o For marketing activities

Â·
You may request a copy of the information we have on you in a structured, machine-readable, and commonly used format (â
Data Portability
â)
Â·
You may withdraw your consent at any time where we relied on your consent to process your Personal Data
Please note that we may ask you to verify your identity before responding to requests in exercising your rights.
You also have the right to complain to a Data Protection Authority (as defined in the GDPR) about our collection and use of your Personal Data.
For more information, please contact your local data protection authority in EEA.
Our legal basis for collecting and using your Personal Data depends on the Personal Data we collect and the specific context in which we collect it.&nbsp.
We may process your Personal Data because:

Â·
You have given us permission to do so
Â·
The processing is in our legitimate interests and itâs not overridden by your rights

Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you.&nbsp.

We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestorâs identity or authority to make the request.

For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your Personal Information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.&nbsp.
If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

Consumers who opt-in to Personal Information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time.
