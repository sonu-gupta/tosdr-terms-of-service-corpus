Cisco has simplified our licensing documents.
We no longer require an End User License Agreement (EULA) for on-premise software and a Universal Cloud Agreement (UCA) for cloud-hosted software.
Our EULA now contains the terms of use applicable to all Cisco software (on-premise and cloud-hosted).
Ciscoâs updated End User License Agreement reduces duplication for our customers and simplifies selling for our channel.

Section 1.  Scope and Applicability




This End User License Agreement (âEULAâ) between You and Cisco covers Your use of the Software and Cloud Services (âCisco Technologyâ).
This document also incorporates any Product Specific Terms that may apply to the Cisco Technology You acquire.
Definitions of capitalized terms are in Section 13 (Definitions).

You agree to be bound by the terms of this EULA through (a) Your download, installation, or use of the Cisco Technology.
or (b) Your express agreement to this EULA.


If You do not have authority to enter into this EULA or You do not agree with its terms, do not use the Cisco Technology.
You may request a refund for the Software within 30 days of Your initial purchase provided You return the Software to the Approved Source and disable or uninstall it.
This paragraph does not apply where You have expressly agreed to end user license terms with Cisco as part of a transaction with an Approved Source.




 Section 2.  Using Cisco Technology





2.1.
License and Right to Use. Cisco grants You a non-exclusive, non-transferable (except with respect to Software as permitted under the Cisco Software Transfer and Re-Use Policy) (a) license to use the Software.
and (b) right to use the Cloud Services, both as acquired from an Approved Source, for Your direct benefit during the Usage Term and as set out in Your Entitlement and this EULA (collectively, the âUsage Rightsâ).

2.2. Use by Third Parties. You may permit Authorized Third Parties to exercise the Usage Rights on Your behalf, provided that You are responsible for (a) ensuring that such Authorized Third Parties comply with this EULA and (b) any breach of this EULA by such Authorized Third Parties.

2.3. Beta and Trial Use. If Cisco grants You Usage Rights in the applicable Cisco Technology on a trial, evaluation, beta or other free-of-charge basis (âEvaluation Software and Servicesâ), You may only use the Evaluation Software and Services on a temporary basis for the period limited by the license key or specified by Cisco in writing.  If there is no period identified, such use is limited to 30 days after the Evaluation Software and Services are made available to You.  If You fail to stop using and/or return the Evaluation Software and Services or the equipment on which it is authorized for use by the end of the trial period, You may be invoiced for its list price and agree to pay such invoice.  Cisco, in its discretion, may stop providing the Evaluation Software and Services at any time, at which point You will no longer have access to any related data, information, and files and must immediately cease using the Cisco Technology.  The Evaluation Software and Services may not have been subject to Ciscoâs usual testing and quality assurance processes and may contain bugs, errors, or other issues.  Except where agreed to in writing by Cisco, You will not put Evaluation Software and Services into production use.  Cisco provides Evaluation Software and Services âAS-ISâ without support or any express or implied warranty or indemnity for any problems or issues, and Cisco will not have any liability relating to Your use of the Evaluation Software and Services.

2.4. Upgrades or Additional Copies of Software. You may only use Upgrades or additional copies of the Software beyond Your license Entitlement if You have (a) acquired such rights under a support agreement covering the applicable Software.
or (b) You have purchased the right to use Upgrades or additional copies separately.

2.5. Interoperability of Software. If required by law and upon Your request, Cisco will provide You with the information needed to achieve interoperability between the Software and another independently created program, provided You agree to any additional terms reasonably required by Cisco.
You will treat such information as Confidential Information.

2.6. Subscription Renewal. Usage Rights in Cisco Technology acquired on a subscription basis will automatically renew for the renewal period indicated on the order You or Your Cisco Partner placed with Cisco (âRenewal Termâ) unless: (a) You notify Your Approved Source in writing at least 45 days before the end of Your then-current Usage Term of Your intention not to renew.
or (b) You or Your Cisco Partner elect not to auto-renew at the time of the initial order placed with Cisco.
Your Approved Source will notify You reasonably in advance of any Renewal Term if there are fee changes.
The new fees will apply for the upcoming Renewal Term unless You or Your Cisco Partner promptly notify Cisco in writing, before the renewal date, that You do not accept the fee changes.
In that case, Your subscription will terminate at the end of the current Usage Term.





Section 3.  Additional Conditions of Use

or (d) submit any information that is not contemplated in the applicable Documentation.


3.3.
Evolving Cisco Technology. 
Cisco may: (a) enhance or refine a Cloud Service, although in doing so, Cisco will not materially reduce the core functionality of that Cloud Service, except as contemplated in this Section.
and (b) perform scheduled maintenance of the infrastructure and software used to provide a Cloud Service, during which time You may experience some disruption to that Cloud Service.  Whenever reasonably practicable, Cisco will provide You with advance notice of such maintenance.  You acknowledge that, from time to time, Cisco may need to perform emergency maintenance without providing You advance notice, during which time Cisco may temporarily suspend Your access to, and use of, the Cloud Service. 
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
 Cisco may end the life of Cisco Technology, including component functionality (âEOLâ), by providing written notice on Cisco.com.
If You or Your Approved Source prepaid a fee for Your use of the Cisco Technology that becomes EOL before the expiration of Your then-current Usage Term, Cisco will use commercially reasonable efforts to transition You to a substantially similar Cisco Technology.
If Cisco does not have substantially similar Cisco Technology, then Cisco will credit You or Your Approved Source any unused portion of the prepaid fee for the Cisco Technology that has been declared EOL (âEOL Creditâ).  The EOL Credit will be calculated from the last date the applicable Cisco Technology is available to the last date of the applicable Usage Term.  Such credit can be applied towards the future purchase of Cisco products.

3.6.
Open Source Software. Open source software not owned by Cisco is subject to separate license terms as set out at www.cisco.com/go/opensource.
The applicable open source software licences will not materially or adversely affect Your ability to exercise Usage Rights in applicable Cisco Technology.




Section 4.
Fees



To the extent permitted by law, orders for the Cisco Technology are non-cancellable.
Fees for Your use of Cisco Technology are set out in Your purchase terms with Your Approved Source.  If You use Cisco Technology beyond Your Entitlement (âOverageâ), the Approved Source may invoice You, and You agree to pay, for such Overage.




Section 5.
