Open Banking&nbsp.
We also use data relating to your bank account(s) held by third party financial institutions (âOpen Bankingâ) to help us to provide you with automated and dynamic access to your spending activity.
We will therefore request your permission, as part of the connection process, to access your bank account(s) data using Open Banking.
We use third party providers such as Plaid Inc.
(âPlaidâ), MX Technologies, Inc.
(âMXâ), and TrueLayer Limited or TrueLayer (Ireland) Limited (collectively or individually, âTrueLayerâ) for this purpose, and by using our services, you accept such third party providerâs terms of use and privacy policies and expressly grant such third party the right, power, and authority to access and transmit your information as reasonably necessary to provide the services to you.
The third party provider we use varies based on the location of the third party financial institution at which you maintain the bank account(s) to which you provide us access.
If your bank account is in the United States or Canada, Open Banking will be provided by Plaid or MX.
You authorize us to access data from the applicable third party provider such as personal identity information and possibly other data such as transactional data and, if the third party provider is Plaid, by doing so you accept the Plaid End User Services Agreement and Plaid Privacy Policy.
You can review Plaidâs commitment to safety and security here.
By utilizing Open Banking through Plaid, you acknowledge and agree that the terms of Plaidâs Privacy Policy will govern Plaidâs use of such information, and you expressly agree to the terms and conditions of Plaidâs Privacy Policy.

St.
James House, St.
James Square, Cheltenham, England, GL50 3PR) (âYNAB UKâ), which is acting as an agent of TrueLayer, who is providing the regulated Account Information Service, and who is authorised by the FCA as an Authorised Payment Institution (reference number: 793171).
TrueLayer allows you to send information on your payment accounts to us and other service providers.
In order to use TrueLayerâs services, you will be asked to agree to their Terms of Service and enter your payment account details with TrueLayer or, for Open Banking connections, you will be redirected to your bank by TrueLayer in order to authenticate yourself.
The Terms of Service set out the terms on which you agree to TrueLayer accessing information on your payment accounts for the purposes of transmitting that information to us.
TrueLayer is subject to UK and EU data protection laws and is required to treat your data in accordance with those laws, as well as the Terms of Service and TrueLayerâs Privacy Policy.
TrueLayer is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority under the Payment Services Regulations 2017 and the Electronic Money Regulations 2011 (Firm Reference Number: 901096).
If your bank account is in the EEA, Open Banking will be provided by TrueLayer (Ireland) Limited, (a company with the registered address at 25-28 North Wall Quay, Dublin 1, Dublin, D01H104, Ireland, and Company Registration Number: 671615).
