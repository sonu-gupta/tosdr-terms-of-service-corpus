On other search engines, ads are based on profiles compiled about you using your personal information like search, browsing, and purchase history.
Since we donât collect that information, search ads on DuckDuckGo are based on the search results page you are viewing, not on you as a person.
For example, if you search for cars, weâll show you ads about cars. Learn more.What does Google know about me?Not only does Google keep your search history forever by default, their trackers have been found on 75% of the top million websites, which means they are tracking most everywhere you go on the Internet (unless you stop them with DuckDuckGo!).
And thatâs just the tip of the iceberg. Learn more.Why use DuckDuckGo instead of Google?Ever notice ads constantly following you around? Thatâs in part because Google tracks your searches and hides trackers on millions of websites.
By contrast, our private search engine doesnât track your searches and our DuckDuckGo browser extension and mobile app block Googleâs (and many other companiesâ) trackers across the Internet, helping to keep your browsing history more private, as it should be.
And thatâs just the beginning â by using DuckDuckGo you also escape the manipulation of the filter bubble and can use the Internet faster (after all that tracking code is disabled). Learn more.How do DuckDuckGo search results compare to Googleâs?DuckDuckGo search gives you truly private search results without tradeoffs in result quality.
We have everything youâve come to expect in an online search experience, and a few bonus features that make searching the Internet not only private, but also a bit more fun! And, on top of that, because there is no search history on DuckDuckGo, you escape the filter bubble of manipulated results. Learn more.Whatâs the difference between using DuckDuckGo and Incognito mode?It is a myth that you canât be tracked while using so-called âIncognitoâ mode.
In fact, Incognito mode mainly just deletes information on your computer and does nothing to stop Google from saving your searches, nor does it stop companies, Internet service providers, or governments from being able to track you across the Internet.
By contrast, DuckDuckGo search is completely anonymous and if you add our app &amp.

However, we are able to make an estimate based on the number of searches we get per month, which we make public.
Our best guess â over 50 million people! Learn more.How does the DuckDuckGo app &amp.

This gives you all the key privacy protection tools to search and browse privately, curbing the constant monitoring of your Internet activity by companies like Google and Facebook. Learn more.
