Limited WarrantyWe want you to get the most out of your Motorola products.
Thatâs why we protect them with a limited warranty.
You can read the current Motorola limited warranty information here.
To respond to issues that may or may not be out of our control, Motorola reserves the right to change its warranty at any time.
Some states donât allow a limitation on how long an implied warranty lasts, so some limitations may not apply to you.
Our limited warranty gives you specific legal rights.
and depending on the state you live in, you might also have other rights.
Motorola Devices and Accessories are only under full warranty in the country where they were intended for sale.
Thatâs why we donât recommend buying a Device or Accessory in one country for use in another.
Unfortunately, Motorola canât provide a warranty for third-party accessories.
To get warranty info about those products, refer to the warranty that came with their packaging, or visit their manufacturersâ website.

For Devices designed with Moto Maker

You put a lot of thought into the creation of your Device, so itâs worth a little extra consideration.
If you choose to purchase an Extended Warranty, it will protect your Device from certain kinds of accidental damage the first two years (up to three claims).

YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, MOTOROLA AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES (COLLECTIVELY, "MOTOROLA PARTIES") SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY (WHETHER CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE) FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THE DEVICE OR THESE TERMS, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT A MOTOROLA PARTY OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.
YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE MOTOROLA PARTIES' TOTAL LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH THE DEVICE OR THESE TERMS WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU TO MOTOROLA UNDER THESE TERMS.Arbitration And Opt-outAny controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these terms or any products or services sold or distributed through this site will be resolved by binding arbitration, instead of in court.
The arbitration will take place in a location determined by the arbitrator as set forth in these terms (provided that such location is reasonably convenient for claimant), or a different location as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties.
The arbitration will be conducted under the rules for commercial disputes set forth in the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS (âJAMS Rules and Proceduresâ).
Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
The arbitrator shall be selected pursuant to the JAMS Rules and Procedures.
The arbitrator will apply Illinois law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law.
In the event that the claimant is able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Motorola will pay as much of the claimantâs filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.
If any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal (other than that claims will not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis), or otherwise conflicts with the rules and procedures established by JAMS, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein.
If, however, the portion that is deemed invalid, unenforceable or illegal is that claims will not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither claimant nor Motorola shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute.
Upon filing a demand for arbitration, all parties to the arbitration will have the right of discovery, which discovery shall be completed within sixty days after the demand for arbitration is made, unless further extended by mutual agreement of the parties.
THE ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN THE CLAIMS OF OTHER PERSONS OR PARTIES WHO MAY BE SIMILARLY SITUATED.

Your right to reject: If you do not want this Arbitration provision to apply, you may reject it by mailing or emailing a written rejection notice which describes this Arbitration provision, includes your name, address, phone number, device, and device serial number, date of purchase, and tells Motorola that you are rejecting this Arbitration provision to: arbitration@motorola.com.
A rejection notice is only effective if it is signed by you and Motorola receives the notice within 30 days of purchase.
If you do not reject this Arbitration provision within this 30 day time period, you will not be able to reject it at a later date.
If you reject this provision, that does not affect any other provision of these terms or your ability to use the device.
If you do not reject this Arbitration provision, it will be effective as of the date of purchase.Other ConsiderationsThere are a few limitations we have when it comes to shipping: We can only ship to U.S.
addresses (all 50 states and D.C.), and we canât send to P.O.
boxes or accommodate freight forwarding.
If you live in a country outside the U.S., we recommend using our country locator to see what Motorola Devices and Accessories are available for sale in your market.
Motorola may opt not to ship Devices and Accessories to certain addresses, and in rare instances, Motorola reserves the right to reject your order.
How will you know if weâve accepted your order? Weâll ship you your items!
Other important things to keep in mind:

We do not sell to minors.
We do our best to get you your items as quickly as possible, but delivery dates or times provided by Motorola or our delivery agents are estimates only.
If thereâs one thing thatâs constant, itâs change.
All features, content, specifications, devices, accessories and prices of devices, accessories, and services described on the website are subject to change at any time.
By purchasing a Device or Accessory, you warrant it will be used only in a lawful manner.
The Terms in effect at the time you place an order for the Device or Accessory will apply.
We reserve the right to make changes to these Terms from time to time, and any such changes will apply to future orders.
If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.
Neither party will be responsible for any delay or failure to comply with these Terms if the delay or failure arises from any cause which is beyond its reasonable control.
If you do not comply with these terms, and we don't take action right away, this doesn't mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).
Since weâre primarily a phone manufacturer, there are aspects of the mobile industry we have no influence over.
If your signal is weak or you drop a call, thatâs an issue with your network that Motorola, unfortunately, has no control over.
Similarly, we have no involvement in the billing on your plan or any other aspects of subscription services.
Also, we work hard to accurately depict how our products look on our website.
But sometimes, computer or mobile screens canât reproduce the images with 100 percent accuracy, particularly the colors you see.
