To be clear, you may not use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display or perform any Core Content, whether modified by you or not, outside the virtual environment of the Service except as expressly agreed upon in a written agreement by Manticore or through any Additional Terms or other written policy of Manticore.

Except as prohibited by law, you hereby waive, and you agree to waive, any moral rights (including attribution and integrity) that you may have in any User Content, even if it is altered or changed in a manner not agreeable to you.

Manticore reserves the right to treat User Content on the Service as content stored at the direction of users for which Manticore will not exercise control except to block or remove content that comes to Manticoreâs attention and is offensive, obscene, abusive, illegal or otherwise objectionable to Manticore, or to enforce the rights of third parties or the content restrictions set forth below, when notice of their violation comes to our attention.
Such User Content submitted by you or others need not, however, be maintained on the Service by us for any period of time and you will not have the right, once submitted, to access, archive, maintain, or otherwise use such User Content on the Service.



E.        You grant certain licenses to other users by publicly sharing your User Content.


You agree that by uploading, publishing, or submitting any Content to any publicly accessible areas of the Service, you hereby grant other users of that aspect of the Service a non-exclusive license to access your User Content through the Service, and to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the Content on the Service as permitted through your interactions with the Service under these Terms (the âUser Content Licenseâ).

If you do not wish to grant users of the Service a User Content License or Media License, you agree that it is your obligation to avoid displaying or making available your Content to other users.

therefore, you do not acquire ownership of any copies of the Content, or transfer of any copyright of Intellectual Property Rights in the Content.



F.        You may delete your User Content and terminate any related licenses, with limitations.



With respect to any User Content you have submitted through the Service, the rights granted by you hereunder terminate once you delete such User Content from the Service, except (a) to the extent you shared it as part of the Service.
(b) Manticore used it for promotional purposes, or (c) for the reasonable time it takes to remove from backup and other systems.
In such circumstances, the licenses granted by you above shall terminate, but only for those particular copies or instances of Content that you have deleted from the Service.
You acknowledge that this termination will not apply to any other copies or instances of the same Content that you have not specifically deleted from the Service, including without limitation those that may be displayed elsewhere through the Service and those that may be in the Account inventories of other users to whom you transferred copies.
You acknowledge that the Media License granted to Manticore and other users with respect to your Content will survive any such termination.



6.        UPLOAD CONTENT AT YOUR OWN RISK


Manticore uses reasonable security measures in order to attempt to protect User Content against unauthorized copying and distribution.
However, Manticore does not guarantee that unauthorized copying, use, or distribution of User Content by third parties will not occur.
To the furthest extent permitted by applicable law, you hereby agree that Manticore shall not be liable for any unauthorized copying, use, or distribution of User Content by third parties and release and forever waive any claims you may have against Manticore for such unauthorized copying or usage of such User Content, under any theory.
THE SECURITY MEASURES TO PROTECT USER CONTENT USED BY MANTICORE HEREIN ARE PROVIDED âAS ISâ AND WITH NO WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, CONDITIONS, ASSURANCES, OR OTHER TERMS THAT SUCH SECURITY MEASURES WILL WITHSTAND ATTEMPTS TO EVADE SECURITY MECHANISMS OR THAT THERE WILL BE NO BREACHES, DISABLEMENTS OR OTHER CIRCUMVENTION OF SUCH SECURITY MEASURES.

12.        DISPUTE RESOLUTION + ARBITRATION


PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PROVISION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH MANTICORE AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM MANTICORE.



To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law (but excluding those identified below), you and Manticore agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms or your use of the Service, except that you and Manticore are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable or other relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents.



ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL.



You and Manticore agree that you will notify each other in writing of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises.
Notice to Manticore should be sent to: Manticore Games, Inc., Attention: Legal, 1400 Fashion Island Boulevard, San Francisco, CA 94404.


You and Manticore further agree: to attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration.
that any arbitration will occur in San Mateo County, California.
that arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS (www.JAMSADR.COM).
and that the state or federal courts in San Mateo County, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals or an arbitration award or over any suit between the parties not subject to arbitration.
Other than class procedures and remedies discussed below, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court.
Any dispute between the parties will be governed by this agreement and the laws of the State of California and applicable United States law, without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that may provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction.
Whether the dispute is heard in arbitration or in court, you and Manticore will not commence against the other a class action, class arbitration or other representative action or proceeding.



If you are a resident in any jurisdiction in which the provision in the section above is found to be unenforceable, then the following shall apply:
