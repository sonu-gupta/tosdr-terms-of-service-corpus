What are Cookies?
Cookies are small text files that are downloaded to your computer or mobile device by a website via your web browser or mobile app when you visit a website or other online service.
Cookies store information about how you use an online service so that the website can recognize your device, provide functionality, enhance your experience (like remembering your preferred language), analyze usage patterns, and personalize content and advertising.

When we say âcookie,â we donât mean the delicious ones with chocolate chips.
We are, however, talking about similar online tracking tools and technologies, such as web beacons (also called tracking pixels).
Like cookies, web beacons allow us to analyze how visitors to our websites use Asana and deliver personalized content.
Web beacons can also be included in emails we send to determine whether they have been read or acted on.

Duration of cookie storage
The length of time that cookies are stored on your device will vary, depending on whether the cookies are temporary or persistent.

This allows you to visit and use our websites and services without interruption, and provides us with internal reporting.
These cookies expire when you close your browser.

They can stay on your device for different lengths of time, from 24 hours, to a week, or several years, depending on their function.
These cookies survive after your browser is closed and can be used to recognize your device when you reopen your browser and revisit our websites and apps.
Cookie management

All visitors. There are a number of ways you can manage what cookies are set on your devices.
As mentioned above, deleting or disabling cookies may impact your ability to use certain features and functionalities.
We currently do not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals.


Browser settings. You can disable and/or delete most types of cookies by using your browser settings.
As the means by which to activate or deactivate cookies varies from one web browser to another (e.g., Safari, Chrome, Mozilla Firefox), you should visit your specific web browserâs help menu for more information on cookie preferences.
You can also configure your browser at any time to be notified of the receipt of a cookie, so that you can decide whether you want to accept it or not.
