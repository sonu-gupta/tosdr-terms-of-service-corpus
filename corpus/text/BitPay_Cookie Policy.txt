 What are cookies?  Cookies are a standard feature of websites that allow us to store small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to a website.
Cookies help the website owner learn which areas of the website are useful and which areas need improvement.

Web beacons  Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website.
We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs").
These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Site or opened an email that we sent.
This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Site to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether a user came to our Site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of email marketing campaigns.
In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.

You also have the right to refuse or accept cookies at any time by activating settings on your browser.
You may wish to refer to http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html for information on commonly used browsers.

 Note that blocking some types of cookies may impact your experience on our Site and the services we are able to offer you.
