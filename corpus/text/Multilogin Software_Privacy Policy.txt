Depending on your use of the Services, that may include:

 Whatâs Private
Any data you provide will not be publicly displayed or revealed to other users.
We donât give your personal information to any third-party services, except when itâs necessary to provide Multiloginâs Services (like when we partner with payment processors).
When we share data with third-party services that support our delivery of the Multilogin Services, we require that they protect your personal information to the same standards we do.
We do reserve the right to disclose personal information when we believe that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with the law or law enforcement (in Estonian jurisdiction), to prevent fraud or abuse, or to protect Multiloginâs legal rights. Whatâs Encrypted
We value your personal privacy and privacy of your business.
When you access websites using Multilogin desktop application, the Application encrypts sensitive data before sending it to our servers.
Your account password is used as a private key in encryption algorithms.
We encrypt the following data:

Session identificators stored in cookie files
URLs of active browser tabs

We never store your account password on our servers.
Only master passwordâs hash is stored on our server for login data validation purposes (this means we neither have nor can see the original password) Uses of Your Personal Information
We will use the personal information you provide to:

identify you when you sign in to your account;
enable us to provide you with the Services;
send you marketing communications we think you may find useful, but only in accordance with your email preferences;
administer your account with us;
enable us to contact you regarding any question you make through the Services;
analyze the use of the Services and the people visiting to improve our content and Services.
and
use for other purposes that we may disclose to you when we request your information.

We never post anything to your Facebook, Twitter, or other third-party accounts without your permission. We do not and will not sell your data. Email
We want to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us.
