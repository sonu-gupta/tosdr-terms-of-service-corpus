What are cookies?
We may collect information using âcookies.â Cookies are small data files stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website.
We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our website.
We use two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which are used only by us to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our website.
and (2) third party cookies, which are served by service providers on our website, and can be used by such service providers to recognize your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites.

Our website uses the following types of cookies for the purposes set out below:

These cookies are essential to provide you with services available through our website and to enable you to use some of its features.
For example, they allow you to log in to secure areas of our website and help the content of the pages you request load quickly. Without these cookies, the services that you have asked for cannot be provided, and we only use these cookies to provide you with those services.

Functionality Cookies

These cookies allow our website to remember choices you make when you use our website, such as remembering your language preferences, remembering your login details and remembering the changes you make to other parts of our website which you can customize.
The purpose of these cookies is to provide you with a more personal experience and to avoid you having to re-enter your preferences every time you visit our website.

Analytics and Performance Cookies

These cookies are used to collect information about traffic to our website and how users use our website.
The information gathered does not identify any individual visitor.
It includes the number of visitors to our website, the websites that referred them to our website, the pages they visited on our website, what time of day they visited our website, whether they have visited our website before, and other similar information.
We use this information to help operate our website more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information and to monitor the level of activity on our website.
We use Google Analytics for this purpose.
Google Analytics uses its own cookies.
It is only used to improve how our website works.

Targeted and advertising cookies

These cookies track your browsing habits to enable us to show advertising which is more likely to be of interest to you.
These cookies use information about your browsing history to group you with other users who have similar interests.
Based on that information, and with our permission, third party advertisers can place cookies to enable them to show adverts which we think will be relevant to your interests while you are on third party websites.
You can disable cookies which remember your browsing habits and target advertising at you by visiting http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices.
If you choose to remove targeted or advertising cookies, you will still see adverts but they may not be relevant to you.
Even if you do choose to remove cookies by the companies listed at the above link, not all companies that serve online behavioral advertising are included in this list, and so you may still receive some cookies and tailored adverts from companies that are not listed.

Social Media Cookies

These cookies are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or âlikeâ button on our website or you link your account or engage with our content on or through a social networking website such as Facebook, Twitter or Google+.
The social network will record that you have done this.

Disabling cookies
You can typically remove or reject cookies via your browser settings.
In order to do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the âsettings,â âhelpâ âtoolsâ or âeditâ facility).
Many browsers are set to accept cookies until you change your settings.
If you do not accept our cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of our website.
For example, we may not be able to recognize your computer or mobile device and you may need to log in every time you visit our website.
