A Walmart or Sam's Club gift/e-gift card may be used for the initial interval of a third-party service subscription (i.e., the first month or year).
however, such payment method may not be used for subsequent intervals of the service subscription.
Irrespective of the payment method used for initial purchase, a valid preferred card is needed on file to complete checkout of a third-party service subscription. IV.
Third-Party Service Subscription Billing 
The price, plus any applicable taxes, for a third-party service subscription is disclosed to you when you place your order.
You will be charged when you place your order, regardless of when you activate or start the service subscription with the third party.
You will then be automatically charged on a recurring basis at the interval you have selected (e.g., monthly) unless and until you change or cancel your third-party service subscription.
Note that the service subscription price may change at any time, and the price will change if your Sam's Club membership tier changes.
See the table in Section V, below, for details.
You agree to waive the right to receive notice of all variations in price, and instead agree to receive such notice only if the price for the third-party service subscription increases by more than twenty dollars ($20.00).
In such a case, and if the payment method you selected, or that Sam's Club will charge, is a debit or prepaid card, Sam's Club will provide you with notice at least ten (10) days in advance of the next recurring charge at the higher price, and you will have the option to cancel your subscription.
The notice will be sent to the email associated with your SamsClub.com account.
The price, plus any applicable taxes, for each interval (e.g., each month) will be billed to the payment method selected by you on the subscriptions page of your SamsClub.com account, subject to Section III (Accepted Payment Methods) above.
If we are unable to complete payment for your third-party service subscription with the payment method you selected to purchase your third-party service subscription (for example, because that payment method has expired or is otherwise unavailable), you agree that we may charge any other payment method stored in your SamsClub.com account until you select a new designated payment method.
If no payment methods in your account can be used, your service subscription will be canceled by Sam's Club unless or until you update your payment method information in your SamsClub.com account.
Please remember to update your payment method information as necessary to avoid delays or cancelations.
Your third-party service subscription will otherwise remain in effect until it is canceled by you or Sam's Club.
A free-trial period may be offered to first-time subscribers of certain third-party service subscription plans.
There is a limit of one (1) free trial period per member across all eligible third-party service subscription plans on each third-party service subscription description page on SamsClub.com.
Any free-trial period for a third-party service subscription will begin on the date of purchase on SamsClub.com.
You will be automatically charged for the third-party service subscription at the end of the free-trial period unless you cancel at least twenty-four (24) hours before the free-trial ends.
See Section V, below, for instructions on how to cancel.
If you upgrade your third-party service subscription during the free trial period, you will lose your free trial, and Sam's Club will charge you immediately for the upgraded third-party service subscription plan. V.
Changing and Canceling Third-Party Service Subscriptions If you choose to purchase a third-party service subscription, you will continue to receive the subscription until you change or cancel the subscription or your Sam's Club membership.
You can change or cancel your third-party service subscription on the subscriptions page in your SamsClub.com account.
From there, you can also modify or update your payment method.
You must cancel at least twenty-four (24) hours before the end of your current interval in order to avoid being charged for the next interval of your third-party service subscription.
For example, if your subscription is monthly, you must cancel at least twenty-four (24) hours before the end of the current monthly billing interval in order to avoid a charge for the next monthly interval, and if your subscription is annual, you must cancel at least twenty-four (24) hours before the end of the current annual billing interval in order to avoid a charge for the next annual interval.
There are no refunds for third-party service subscriptions.
