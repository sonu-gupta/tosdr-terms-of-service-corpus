This will occur either by message on the website immediately after you have confirmed your order, or by us sending an e-mail to the e-mail address you have provided to us (the latter of which will apply if you have registered for Ocado Reserved).
Except if you have registered with Ocado Reserved we may do both.

 1.4 Please note that the order confirmation does not constitute our acceptance of your order.
Subject to our cancellation rights in clause 11, acceptance of your order and completion of the contract will take place when we despatch the goods to you.

 1.5 If you have registered for the Ocado Reserved service (our automated order subscription service) or have placed an order for delivery two or more days in advance then we will endeavour also to send you an email a few hours before the final cut-off time for amending the order, alerting you to this cut-off time and reminding you of the scheduled delivery time of your order.
The purpose of the reminder is to reduce the likelihood of delivery times being forgotten and/or orders being left incomplete, and is part of our order confirmation process.
Unless you have requested not to be contacted by text message, we may also send the reminder by text message to the mobile phone number you have given us when setting up your account.

 1.6 After confirmation of the order, any items added via the "One-Click Additions" system before the cut-off time will automatically form part of that order.

Any orders that have not been cancelled by this cut-off time are binding, and will be delivered by Ocado as set out in clause 1.3.

We operate a Challenge 25 policy, which means that if the person receiving delivery of alcohol looks under 25, we will request identification.

We may retain the products if proof of age or an alternative adult is not available.

If you subsequently amend your order to add items, the prices charged for new products which were not in your original order will be the prices quoted at the time you confirm your amended order.
However, if you add more of the same items which were in your original order, then the prices charged for these items will be the prices quoted at the time you confirmed your original order.
Where a substitute item is offered in place of an item ordered, the price charged for that substitute item (if accepted) will be the price applicable at the time the item is substituted.
