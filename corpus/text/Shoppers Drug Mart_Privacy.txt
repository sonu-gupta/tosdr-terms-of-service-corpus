This type of information is also generated by the use of your loyalty and e-commerce accounts and may include information about your purchases

More specifically, personal health information means both diagnostic, treatment and care information, and/or registration information with our healthcare services.

B.
How We Collect Personal InformationWe collect personal information in the following ways:

Directly From You

You may provide personal information to us in our stores, by mail, by email, over the telephone, through our websites or mobile applications or in any other direct manner.

For example:


When you voluntarily share information about yourself with us, we will collect that information in order to provide you with our programs, products or services, respond to your inquiry, or for any other purpose disclosed to you at that time.


From Other Sources

We may receive personal information from other sources with your consent or if the law
requires or permits us to do so (e.g., to meet our anti-money laundering compliance or other legal and regulatory obligations).
In order to ensure the accuracy of the contact information that you provide us, such as your name, email address and phone number, we may retain the services of a service provider to verify and, if necessary, update, complete or otherwise supplement your contact information by providing us with such additional information.
This helps us protect you against error and fraud, and to manage our business operations by ensuring that we can reach you in case of an issue in connection with our programs, products or services, or as otherwise permitted by
applicable law, as described below in the âHow Do We Use Personal Informationâ section.

For example:




If you apply for a PC Financial payment product, with your consent, we may collect information from credit bureaus in order to process your application and determine whether you qualify for a specific product.




If you register for a PC Optimum account, we may retain certain service providers to verify and, if necessary, update, complete or otherwise supplement your mobile number or other contact information you provide us, in order to ensure that this information is sufficiently accurate, complete and up-to-date so that you may  be contacted without undue delay if we need to verify your account or provide you with relevant notice in accordance with applicable law (e.g.
following a breach of security safeguards involving your personal information), and to provide you with communications you request about our programs, products, services and
promotions.




From Technologies Used At Our Locations

We may collect personal information through various types of technologies used in our stores (e.g., grocery, pharmacy), including your image.
These can include our point-of-sale systems, video surveillance or other similar types of technologies (including, for example, anonymous
video analytics which allows us to track the number of individuals in our stores and consider certain demographic information about our customer base on an anonymous basis) which we may use from time to time.

For example:




We use video surveillance in areas surrounding our stores, pharmacies, kiosks, pavilions, bank machines, parking lots and other locations: for security purposes, to protect against theft, to prevent damage to our properties, and to prevent fraud.




We may also use anonymous video analytics to help manage our stores, understand our customer base and improve customer experience.




Through Our Websites And Mobile Applications 

We may collect certain types of information electronically when you interact with our
websites, email, mobile applications, social media accounts, online advertising, or through the use of our or a third partyâs technologies, which include cookies, web beacons, single pixel gifs and other technologies such as Data Management Platforms (DMPs).
This information helps us understand what actions you take on our websites and mobile applications and allows our website and mobile applications to work correctly.
We may combine this information with other information collected in-store or online such as your online and in-store transaction history, and aggregate demographic information, such as the predominant age groups and the average size of households in your area, which can help us gain insights about your interests and preferences.
We do this to support our customer understanding using website and mobile analytics and to provide you with more tailored advertising and marketing campaigns.
This includes serving interest-based advertising to you, subject to your right to withdraw consent, as detailed in our Interest-Based Advertising and Media Notice.
 

For example:




We use your location or language preference to auto-select features when you visit our websites and mobile applications.




We use your online and/or in-store purchase history to provide you with interest-based advertisements on products that you purchase frequently.




We collect, combine and categorize your personal information on an aggregated basis to identify online and offline purchasing patterns to help us analyze our businesses to better serve customers.




We collect information relating to your interests, preferences, and sentiments through your interactions with our websites, applications and social media accounts as well as through aggregate demographic information about households in your area, as determined by your
postal code, to gain insights and provide you with more personalized advertising and marketing.




The technologies we use include:



Cookies, which are small text files that are saved on your computer when you visit a website so that information can be saved between visits, such as your login credentials or language preferences.
For example, cookies allow you to log in quickly when you visit our sites.



Web beacons, and single pixel gifs, which are small image files that have information about you, such as your IP address, that can be downloaded when you visit a website or open an email.
This allows us to understand your online behaviour, monitor our email delivery, and provide you with interest-based advertising.
These tools also allow our third-party tracking tools to gather information, such as your IP address, and provide this back to us in an anonymized, aggregate form (i.e.
in a manner that prevents us from identifying you personally).
Aggregate information refers to personal information compiled and expressed in a summary form where no personal identifiers are included.



Other technologies, such as DMP services, Demand Side Platform (DSP), ad servers, reporting tools and analytics engines, which pull usage data from multiple sources and help manage and collect this data to use for personalization, interest-based advertising, customizing content and other methods to gain insights into our customersâ needs and preferences.


We may use Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc.
("Google").
Google Analytics uses cookies to analyze your use of our websites, to create reports about visitor activities for us and to provide further services associated with the use of the websites and the Internet.
Although this information is collected through your Google ad settings, it is not provided to us in a personally-identifiable format.
You may delete or disable certain of these technologies at any time via your browser.

Multi-Factor Authentication, which is a method of confirming your identity by using more than one way to authenticate you, such as asking for your password and a code that is sent to your email address or phone number;

When we engage a service provider that operates outside of Canada, personal information may be stored, processed, accessed or used in another country.
In that case, the personal information is subject to the law of the jurisdiction in which it is used or stored, including any law permitting or requiring disclosure of the information to the government, government agencies, courts and law enforcement in that jurisdiction.
The countries where our service providers may be located include the United States, the Netherlands, India, and the Philippines.
