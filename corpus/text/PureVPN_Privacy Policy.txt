         You are Invisible â Even We Cannot See What You Do OnlineWe DO NOT keep any record of your browsing activities, connection logs, records of the VPN IPs assigned to you, your original IPs, your connection time, the history of your browsing, the sites you visited, your outgoing traffic, the content or data you accessed, or the DNS queries generated by you.
We want you to have the surety of knowing that we collect minimal data, the sole purpose of which is to operate our VPN and Proxy service and keep it running smoothly.
Our systems, processes, and servers are designed to not keep any sensitive/personally identifiable data.
This is done by design to ensure that we have NO data to share, even when required by law to do so.
We do not just claim it, but we have proved it by having our systems and configurations audited by a leading US-based independent auditor, Altius IT.
The auditor has certified that it:âDid not find any evidence of system configurations and/or system/service log files that independently, or collectively, could lead to identifying a specific person and/or the personâs activity when using the PureVPN service.â Table of Contents

 PureVPN and Data Associated With Payments  Similar to most ecommerce or online businesses, PureVPN too uses third-party payment processors.
Except for a few payment processors who require us to process the payment, all the payment data rests with the respective payment processors.
In instances where we are required to process the data, we process it in real time and pass it on to the processor and chargeback protection service without keeping any record of it with us.
Please visit the privacy policy of the payment processor chosen by you to get a better understanding of what information it collects, stores, and uses.

 Since we are huge believers in anonymity, we have included Coin Payments and Gift Cards â 100% anonymous payment methods â in the list of payment methods accepted by us.


 PureVPN does not share, sell or rent your personal information with anyone apart from using your information to provide products or services you've requested for.


 What We Donât Know, What We Know &amp.
What We Keep We have no logs or records of: 
Your origin IP address
Assigned VPN server IP address
VPN session timestamp
Your browsing activities
DNS requests

 In a nutshell: 
We donât know what you access, browse, upload or download with our service.
We are unable to identify at what time you connected to the VPN, with which IP address and which VPN IP was assigned to you.
Even if we are compelled to share user information, we simply cannot because we have nothing personally identifiable to share.

 Information Included in VPN Connection Logs We know the day you connected to a specific VPN location and from which Internet Service Provider.
This bare minimum set of data is required to help you with technical assistance, solving connecting problems, and overcoming region-specific problems.
We also know the connection length and how many connections you make when you use our VPN service, without connection timestamps, with the sole purpose of categorizing your profile as Power, Core or Casual user.
This categorization helps our Product teams improve and cater to the needs of various user groups as per their preferences.
 Details NOT Included In VPN Connection Logs: 
Your origin IP
Your VPN IP
The specific time when you connected to our server
Your activities after connecting to our server 

Note: Only in case you've purchase our Dedicated IP Addon, a fixed, dedicated IP (VPN IP) is assigned to you.
For the duration of your subscription that remains your VPN IP in our records
Total Bandwidth ConsumedEvery paid PureVPN user gets access to unlimited bandwidth, irrespective of how that bandwidth is used.
We keep track of the total bandwidth consumed by you to make sure every PureVPN user gets the same highest level of speed and experience with PureVPN.
If we suspect abuse of our service by any user where the user is found consuming an unnatural amount of bandwidth and disrupting the service for other users, then we reserve the right to contact that user and ask them to explain their conduct.
 Software Analytics, Stats 'PureVPN collects minimal connection statistics and reports.
The collection is done to ensure superior quality of service and customer support.
However, the data collected as statistics and reports does not and will never include uniquely identifiable user data or behavior, such as traffic details, IP addresses, and DNS requests.
We conduct VPN diagnostics and monitor crash reports to better understand the functionality of our software, how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, failed connection attempts, and provision of uncapped speed to ensure smooth functioning of our apps, extensions, and other client software.

We employ a few tools in our client software for this purpose, the details of which are:

Data from Emails, Live Chats, and Feedback FormsIt is necessary for us to keep the record of your correspondence with us to ensure smooth delivery of service and superior customer service.

Applicable LawsPureVPN specifically chose Hong Kong (HK) for its headquarter because there are "No Mandatory Data Retention Laws" in Hong Kong.
We are, therefore, not legally obliged to store user data and share it with anyone.
Moreover, as stated above, we have no worthwhile data to share with any law enforcement agency from any particular country in the world.
Even if and when we receive subpoenas that are legally upheld in the court of law in Hong Kong, we wonât be of much help since we have almost nothing of value to share.
