        Asana User Terms of Service
Effective Date: November 1, 2018
Asana, Inc.
(âAsana,â âwe,â âourâ) offers a variety of team productivity, collaboration, and organizational tools available online, including via a mobile application (collectively, the âServiceâ), and websites, including but not limited to www.asana.com, wavelength.com, blog.asana.com, community.asana.com (the âWebsitesâ).
Asana has three different types of users depending on the Asana products used:

We call users of the Websites âSite Visitors.â
We call users who use the free version of the Asana Service âFree Users.â While Free Users can access and use the Service, they have access to a more limited set of Service features and functionality than Subscribers.
We call users who use the Service as part of a paid Asana subscription plan (regardless of the subscription tier) âSubscribers.â The Service features and functionalities available to Subscribers are determined by the subscription tier and the specific terms agreed to between Asana and the organization (e.g., your employer or another entity or person, called the âCustomerâ) that entered into a separate agreement that governs delivery, access, and use of the Service (the âCustomer Agreementâ).

We refer to these three types of users collectively as âUsersâ or âyouâ for purposes of these User Terms of Service (the âTermsâ).
Regardless of what type of User you are, these Terms create a legal agreement directly between you and Asana and explain the rules governing use of the Service and Websites.
By accessing or using the Service and Websites, you acknowledge and agree that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy.
If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not access or use the Service and Websites.

We may, from time to time, modify these Terms.
Please check this page periodically for updates.
If you do not agree to, or cannot comply with, the modified Terms, you must stop using the Service and Websites.
The updated Terms will take effect upon their posting and will apply on a going-forward basis, unless otherwise provided in a notice to you, and except as provided in the Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section of these Terms.
Your continued use of the Service and Websites after any such update constitutes your acceptance of such changes.

12.
MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.
IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.

12.1 Application.
You and Asana agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions.
This Section 12 is intended to be interpreted broadly and governs any and all disputes between us including but not limited to claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory.
claims that arose before these Terms or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims related to advertising).
and claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms.
The only disputes excluded from this broad prohibition are the litigation of certain intellectual property and small court claims, as provided below.

12.2.
Initial Dispute Resolution.
Most disputes can be resolved without resort to arbitration.
If you have any dispute with us, you agree that before taking any formal action, you will contact us at dispute-notice@asana.com and provide a brief, written description of the dispute and your contact information (including your username, if your dispute relates to an account).
Except for intellectual property and small claims court claims, the parties agree to use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation with Asana, and good faith negotiations shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.

12.3 Binding Arbitration.
If the parties do not reach an agreed-upon solution within a period of thirty (30) days from the time informal dispute resolution is initiated under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, (except as provided in section 12.7 below) subject to the terms set forth below.
Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms (including the Termsâ formation, performance, and breach), the partiesâ relationship with each other, and/or your use of Asana shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp.
Procedures (âJAMSâ).
The JAMS rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees.
Asana will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than $75,000.
If you receive an arbitration award that is more favorable than any offer we make to resolve the claim, we will pay you $1,000 in addition to the award.
Asana will not seek its attorneysâ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.

12.4 Arbitratorâs Powers.
The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms is void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, or the question of waiver by litigation conduct.
The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.
The arbitratorâs award shall be written and shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.

12.5 Filing a Demand.
To start an arbitration, you must do the following: (a) Write a Demand for Arbitration (âDemandâ) that (i) briefly explains the dispute, (ii) lists your and Asanaâs names and addresses, (iii) specify the amount of money in dispute, if applicable, (iv) identify the requested location for a hearing if an in-person hearing is requested, and (v) state what you want in the dispute.
(b) send one copy of the Demand to JAMS, along with a copy of these Terms and the filing fee required by JAMS.
and (c) Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to us at dispute-notice@asana.com.
The parties understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.
They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.
If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration may take place in the county where you reside at the time of filing, unless you and we both agree to another location or telephonic arbitration.
For individuals residing outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in San Francisco County, California, United States, and you and Asana agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in San Francisco County, California, United States, in order to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

12.6 Class Action Waiver.
The parties further agree that the arbitration shall be conducted in the partyâs respective individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis.
YOU AND ASANA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provisions set forth above shall be deemed null and void in their entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.

12.7 Exception: Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims.
Notwithstanding the partiesâ decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring enforcement actions, validity determinations or claims arising from or relating to theft, piracy or unauthorized use of intellectual property in state or federal court with jurisdiction or in the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office to protect its intellectual property rights (âintellectual property rightsâ means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights).
Either party may also seek relief in small claims court in San Francisco, California for disputes or claims within the scope of that courtâs jurisdiction.

12.8 30-Day Right to Opt Out.
You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to dispute-notice@asana.com with the subject line, âARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT.â The notice must be sent within the later of 30 days of your first use of the Service or within 30 days of changes to this section being announced on the Site.
Otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of these paragraphs.
If you opt out of these arbitration provisions, Asana also will not be bound by them.

12.9 Changes to This Section.
Asana will provide thirty (30) daysâ notice of any changes to this section by posting on the Service and Websites.
Amendments will become effective thirty (30) days after they are posted on the Service and Websites or sent to you by email.
Changes to this section will otherwise apply prospectively only to claims arising after the thirtieth (30th) day.
If a court or arbitrator decides that this subsection on âChanges to This Sectionâ is not enforceable or valid, then this subsection shall be severed from the section entitled Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver, and the court or arbitrator shall apply the first Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section in existence after you began using the Service and Websites.

12.10 Survival.
This Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section shall survive any termination of your use of the Service and Websites.
