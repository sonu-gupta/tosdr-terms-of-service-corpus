We, the Jimdo GmbH (hereinafter referred to as âJimdoâ or âweâ) via this Privacy Policy wish to hereby inform Jimdo users and visitors of our websites as to the purpose, type and extent of the processing of personal information.
The responsible body for this data processing within the meaning of the European General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR) is the Jimdo GmbH, Stresemannstrasse 375, 22761 Hamburg, Germany (privacy@jimdo.com).
Our websites and services are constantly being revised and improved.
Corresponding thereto, this Privacy Policy shall regularly be revised and updated.
This applies in particular to those procedures used by us to carry out usage analysis, as well as those used to measure the effectiveness of advertising methods and comparable services, in particular those belonging to third parties.
The current status of each of these services can be found in the tabulation located at the end of this Privacy Policy statement.
We would also like to note the following as regards to the usage of service providers located outside of the European Union: Jimdo is a service that is offered internationally.
Thus, it extends not only beyond the federal republic of Germany, but also beyond the European Union.
We operate worldwide and our users are scattered across this planet.
Generally we give priority to European service providers when selecting particular services and service offerings, especially where such providers can deliver the required services at a comparable and competitive price and service level.
However, we also wish to be completely transparent.
For many of the services that we use there is simply no comparable, acceptable alternative.
As a result we therefore employ the use of a range of service providers outside the European Union, in particular from the USA.
We take steps to ensure that measures according to European Data Protection law are taken and applied so as to guarantee an adequate level of data protection.Usage of Personal DataWe collect, process and use personal data (in accordance with the definitions of the German Federal Data Processing Law) and the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in order to provide our services.
The promotion of our products and provision of information as regards product functions etc.
to Jimdo Users as well as other interested parties is a natural component thereof.
The scope of the processing of the personal data concerned depends on whether our websites are merely being visited or alternatively being used by a Jimdo User or more specifically if a registration as a user takes place.Childrenâs PrivacyOur websites are generally accessible websites and not intended for children.
We do not knowingly collect personal information from users who are considered to be children under their respective national laws.The processing of personal dataThe Purposes of Processing by JimdoJimdo uses the personal data of the Jimdo user to perform and implement the contract with the Jimdo user and to provide our services (Art.

6 (1) (f) GDPR).
We have introduced control mechanisms in order to balance our interests with the rights of the Jimdo user.
On the basis of these principles, we use the data as follows:

Google AdWords stores a cookie for conversion tracking on the computer's hard drive (so-called "conversion cookie") when the site visitor clicks on a Google-served ad.
These cookies lose their validity after 30 days and are not used for personal identification.
When certain pages are visited on our website, Google and Jimdo may recognize that the page visitor has clicked on the ad and has been redirected to this page.
The information obtained through the conversion cookies is used to generate statistics for AdWords customers who use conversion tracking.
These statistics tell us the total number of users who clicked on the ad served by Google and viewed a page with a conversion tracking tag.
More information about Google AdWords Terms of Service and Privacy can be found here.
With Google AdWords Remarketing, Google sets a cookie in the terminal's browser, which automatically enables interest-based advertising by means of a pseudonymous cookie ID and based on the pages visited by the Jimdo user / page visitor.
If the user has consented to sharing his web history with Google, then Google can use the history of the visit to the Jimdo website, along with the Google analytics data and the Google AdWords data in order to create targeted audiences for cross device remarketing.
The user can permanently disable the setting of such cookies by installing the browser plug-in available at the following link: https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/Google AdWords and Google DoubleClickJimdo also uses the cross-device capabilities of Google AdWords and Google DoubleClick from the provider Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.
This feature allows the Google Analytics remarketing ad groups described above, to be linked to the cross-device features of Google AdWords and Google DoubleClick.
In this way, interest-based, personalized advertising messages that have been adapted to the particular user based on their previous usage and browsing behavior on one terminal (e.g., cell phone) may also be displayed on another user's terminal (e.g., tablet or PC).
Once the user has given their consent, Google links the web and app browsing history to the corresponding Google account for this purpose.
In this way, the same personalized advertising messages can be displayed on each device on which the user logs on with his Google Account.
To support this feature, Google Analytics collects Google-authenticated IDs of users who are temporarily linked to our Google Analytics data to define and create audiences for cross-device ad promotion.
The site visitor can permanently object to cross-device remarketing / targeting by disabling personalized ads in their Google Account: https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/.
If the site visitor wishes to object to Google's general tracking process, the conversion tracking cookies can be disabled by setting the browser to block cookies from the domain www.googleadservices.com: https://www.google.de/settings/ads.
The aggregation of the collected data in the Google account of the site visitor takes place exclusively on the basis of his consent, which he can give or revoke on Google (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR).
For data collection operations that are not merged into the userâs Google Account (for example, because they do not have a Google Account or have objected to the merge), the collection of data is based on Art.
6 (1) (f) GDPR.
The legitimate interest arises from the fact that Jimdo has an interest in the anonymous analysis of the website visitors for advertising purposes.
For more information and privacy policy, see the Google Privacy Policy at: https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads.Google SignalsOn the basis of our legitimate interests (i.e.

In order to do so Google uses the data of users who have activated the option âpersonalized advertisingâ in their Google account settings.
Google Signals can only be used with activated IP anonymization.
As a result, your IP address will be abbreviated by Google within the member states of the European Union or in other states that have ratified the Convention on the European Economic Area prior to its transmission to the United States.
Thus, no conclusions can be drawn as to the identity of a single user.
You can object to the collection of your data via Google Signals, at any time via disabling âpersonalised advertisingâ in your Google Account: https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en

In addition, the site visitor / Jimdo user has the opportunity to evaluate their experience with the Jimdo customer support, after the conclusion of their support-request via the ticket system, Zendesk.
The evaluation request appears directly in the ticket dialog and is optional.
Feedback is only used internally, serves to improve the Jimdo customer support and will not be shared with third parties.
Should the Jimdo user not wish to receive such requests, then they can send an email to that effect, to the Jimdo support team(privacy@jimdo.com) and the opt out shall be implemented.
The legal basis for the processing of the data is our legitimate interest in answering the (customer) inquiries and improving our customer support service in accordance with Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR If the contact is aimed at the conclusion of a contract, then additional legal basis for the processing Article 6 (1) (b) GDPR.
The privacy policy of this our ticket system provider, Zendesk can be found here: https://www.zendesk.com/company/customers-partners/privacy-policy/
The data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary for the achievement of the respective purpose, i.e.
where there is no legitimate interest and, moreover, we are no longer obliged to keep records in which personal data may be contained.Chat FunctionIn the administrative areas of Jimdo websites and on our website, it is possible to contact us via electronic chat.
For this purpose, we use the "Zendesk Chat" service provided by Zendesk Inc., 1019 Market Street, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA.
Zendesk Chat serves the purpose of direct communication in real time (so-called live chat) with visitors to our website, as well as with Jimdo users.
The data entered in the chat window is processed solely to answer the question(s) asked and to optimise our service.
Cookies are used to operate the chat function.
The cookies make it possible to recognise the Internet browser of the site visitor in order to distinguish between the individual users of the chat function.
Insofar as the information collected in this way has a personal reference, the processing is carried out in accordance with Art.
6 para.
1 lit.
f GDPR on the basis of our legitimate interest in effective customer service and the statistical analysis of user behaviour for optimisation purposes.
When using the live chat system, the data provided by the user/site visitor is stored in order to answer the questions asked in the chat.
The data collected includes:

Chat history
Name given
IP address
Country of origin
Pages visited
Duration of the visit to the pages
Further personal information, depending on the details provided by the visitor/user (e.g.
e-mail address, telephone number).

Jimdo has concluded a Data Processing Agreement including standard contractual clauses with Zendesk.
As concerns non-logged in users/site visitors, any data transmitted via this chat function is automatically and completely deleted after four weeks.Newsletter and Newsletter PerformanceOur newsletter regularly provides Jimdo users with information about Jimdoâs products, services and promotions, surveys, prize draws, blog articles and other similar content.
The legal basis for sending the newsletter in conjunction with purchasing Jimdoâs goods or services is Art.
13 (2) of EU Directive 2002/58/EC.
It is also possible to send the Jimdo newsletter on the basis of your consent (Art.
6 (1) (a) GDPR).
Example text informing the user about the usage of data for Jimdoâs own marketing purposes when they set up an account:
You will also receive regular newsletters about Jimdoâs products, services and promotions, where opening and click rates will be monitored in order to optimize the content.
You can unsubscribe at any time.
More information about data processing can be found here.

Our newsletter is sent via the service provider âBraze Incâ, a newsletter sending platform from the US operator Braze, Inc., 318 West 39th Street, 5th Floor, New York, New York 10018, USA.
Jimdo has entered into a Data Processing Agreement with Braze as per Art.
28 GDPR which includes EU standard contractual clauses.

Brazeâs Privacy Policy can be found here: https://www.braze.com/company/legal/privacy#part_three
The legal basis for using Brazeâs services is Art.
6 (1) (f) GDPR â legitimate interest.
Our legitimate interest in using this service is optimizing our marketing measures.
Braze may use the data of the recipient in aggregated format, i.e.
without reference to a user, in order to optimize or improve its own services, such as technically optimizing the sending and the display of the newsletter or for statistical purposes, for example.Measuring Success via Opening and Click Rates:We may use individual functionalities (such as using behavioral data) of our newsletter to trace which content of our newsletter is particularly interesting to the Jimdo user.
We will only use the results of these analyses for the purposes of improving our services and designing our services to better meet your requirements as well as for targeting purposes.
The newsletter therefore contains a so-called âweb beaconâ, which is a pixel-sized file that is retrieved from our server, or if we use Braze or Litmus, from their server when the newsletter is opened.
Technical information, such as browser and system information, as well as IP address and the time of the retrieval is collected as part of this process.
This information is used to improve the technical performance of our services using the technical data, or the target groups and reading behavior based on the access location (which can be determined using the IP address), or the time of access.
Statistical data that is also collected includes determining whether the newsletter has been opened, when it was opened, how long it was opened for and which links were clicked on.
For technical reasons, it may be possible to assign this information to individual newsletter recipients.
However, it is not our goal, or that of the newsletter service provider if used by us, to monitor individual users.
These analyses rather serve to recognize the reading habits of our users and to adapt our content to our users, or to send them different content in accordance with their interests.Unsubscribing, Withdrawing Newsletter Consent:The Jimdo user may object to or withdraw their consent for the storage and usage of their data for sending the newsletter at any time with future effect without needing to give reasons, without being penalized in any way, and without paying any cost for this other than the transmission costs for sending the objection/withdrawal.
This can be done by clicking the unsubscribe link in the newsletter, which can be found at the end of every newsletter.
Alternatively, Jimdo users can deselect the âNewsletterâ box in their customer account.
Your consent to statistical analysis will also be withdrawn at the same time.
It is unfortunately not possible to only object to the statistical analysis in our newsletter, this can only take place when completely unsubscribing from the newsletter.
The legality of the data-processing operations are unaffected by the withdrawal of your consent.
In the event that you withdraw your consent, the personal data used for this data processing will be anonymized or erased.
Data that has been stored by us for other purposes (such as e-mail addresses for the member area) are not affected by this.Jimdo Blog 8 DaysStatisticsThe Jimdo 8 Days blog site uses the web analytics service Jetpack (formerly WordPress.com Stats) operated by Automattic Inc., 60 29th Street # 343, San Francisco, CA 94110-4929, USA, using Quantcast Inc.'s tracking technology.
201 3rd St, Floor 2, San Francisco, CA 94103-3153, USA.
With the help of Jetpack, based on our legitimate interest in the statistical analysis of user behavior for optimization and marketing purposes pursuant to Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR pseudonymised visitor data is collected, evaluated and stored.
From this data, pseudonymised usage profiles can be created and evaluated for the same purpose.
Jetpack uses so-called cookies.
The information generated by the cookie about the use of this website (including the pseudonymous IP address) are transmitted to a server in the United States and stored there to safeguard the above interests.
In order to counter data collection and storage of visitor data for the future, an opt-out cookie can be obtained from Quantcast under the following link, which will prevent future visitor data from the Jimdo userâs browser from being collected and stored at Jetpack: https://www.quantcast.com/opt-out/ The opt-out cookie is set by Quantcast.Hosting of the Jimdo Blog PageJimdo (or more specifically the web space provider for the Jimdo Blog website, WP Engine) collects data about every access to the blog pages (so-called server log files).
Access data includes:
Name of the retrieved web page, file, date and time of retrieval, amount of data transferred, notification of successful retrieval, browser type and version, the user's operating system, referrer URL (the previously visited page), IP address and the requesting provider.
The provider uses the log data for statistical evaluations only with the purpose being the operation, security and optimization of the Blog page.
However, the provider reserves the right to subsequently review the log data if, on the basis of concrete evidence, the legitimate suspicion of unlawful use exists.
The privacy policy of WP-Engine can be viewed here.Blog CommentsDISQUS comment managementBased on our legitimate interests in an efficient, secure and user-friendly commentary system for our blog pages we use the comment management service DISQUS.
In order to use the DISQUS features, users can log in using their own DISQUS user account or existing social media accounts (e.g., OpenID, Facebook, Twitter, or Google).
Here, the user credentials are obtained from the platforms through DISQUS.
It is also possible to use the DISQUS comment feature as a guest without creating or using user accounts with DISQUS or any of the social media providers listed.
Jimdo embeds DISQUS with its features on our Jimdo Blog, â8 daysâ.
However, users enter into a direct contractual relationship with DISQUS, in which DISQUS processes users' comments and acts as point of contact for any deletion of users' data.
Please refer to the DISQUS privacy policy: https://help.disqus.com/terms-and-policies/disqus-privacy-policy in which DISQUS informs users that they save the comment content, as well as store the IP address of the commenter and the timestamp of submission.
Disqus also saves cookies on users' computers and may use them to display advertising.
However, users may object to the processing of their data to display ads:
Jimdo reserves the right to delete comments if their content violates the Jimdo Terms of Service.
In addition, we reserve the right to stop or remove the comment function and the associated comments on any article, at any time.Access and Publicly Available InformationThe Jimdo Website:All information posted on the Jimdo website of a Jimdo user may, in principle, be accessed by other Internet users e.g.
when it is published by the Jimdo user on the Jimdo userâs website.
Therefore, the publication of personal information (eg addresses, telephone numbers) and sensitive data (e.g.
passwords, access data) should be handled carefully and prudently.
Hidden subpages and password-protected areas do not provide absolute protection against unauthorized access.
The same applies to uploaded files, as these may be accessible via direct links.Administrative Access to your Jimdo Website:As part of our customer service and error tracing, our employees also have access to the administrative area of Jimdo Websites (CMS) on an ad hoc basis.
Administrative access is to be understood as insight into all areas of the corresponding Jimdo website, including the password-protected areas.
All our employees are regularly trained in data protection and are under an obligation to maintain confidentiality.EncryptionFor the encryption (HTTPS over TLS) of Jimdo websites of the Jimdo user we use the free service "Let's Encrypt".
Through the certificates, we can offer a so-called transport encryption, which protects the communication to a Jimdo website from access by unauthorized third parties.Rights of the Data Subjects(i.e.
Jimdo user or Jimdo Site Visitor, hereinafter referred to collectively as âJimdo userâ)
According to the relevant legislation, including the GDPR, the Jimdo user and site visitors have certain rights in relation to their personal data that is processed by Jimdo.
In particular, they have a right to information, correction, transferability or deletion of their data.
The Jimdo user also has the right to object to certain processing of their data.
In some cases, it will not be possible to change or remove content after it has been published on the Jimdo website.
Upon receipt of such request, Jimdo may close the corresponding Jimdo Account and remove the offending personal information from public areas as soon as possible based on account activity and applicable law.
The legal right to information, correction or deletion of personal data remains unaffected.Information and AccessThe Jimdo user can usually access, verify and edit their personal information in their Jimdo account by logging in and directly updating or deleting the appropriate information.
We are happy to inform you, which personal data we have stored on you, as well as any fees incurred under applicable law.
The information will be processed by us immediately and is usually sent via email.
In order to receive detailed information, please inform us as far as possible as to the type of personal data requested.
To be sure that the requesting person is also the person whom they claim to be, we require proof of identity.
This can be a copy of an official identity document.
Please ensure that serial numbers, passport numbers or similar are blackened out or removed.
We use this copy solely for identification and processing of the request and delete it as soon as it has served its purpose.Right to ObjectInsofar as the Jimdo userâs or site visitorâs data is collected on the basis of Jimdoâs legitimate interests (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR, the Jimdo user/site visitor may object to the future processing of their data in accordance with Article 21 GDPR at any time, for the future.
The objection may in particular be expressed against processing for direct marketing purposes (via sending an email to privacy@jimdo.com or unsubscribing directly from such communications via the unsubscribe link in every mail).
A corresponding note as regards the Jimdo Newsletter unsubscription process can be found in every newsletter email.
If the Jimdo user makes use of his right to object, Jimdo will stop the processing of the data concerned.
However, further processing is reserved if we can demonstrate compelling legitimate reasons for the processing that outweighs the interests of the Jimdo user, their fundamental rights and freedoms, or if the processing serves the purpose of asserting, exercising or defending legal claims.
If Jimdo is asked to cease all or any part of the processing of the personal information, or if the Jimdo user revokes his consent (if any) to the use or disclosure of their personal information for purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, Jimdo may cease to be able to provide all Jimdo services to the Jimdo user.
The Jimdo user also has the right to object to the processing personal data that is used for statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89 (1) GDPR for reasons that arise from their particular situation via a simple email to that effect sent to privacy@jimdo.com.Right to Data PortabilityIn certain cases, which are listed in detail in Art.
20 GDPR, the site visitor or the Jimdo user has the right to receive personal data concerning him or her, in a structured, common and machine-readable format or to have this data transferred to a third party upon demand.Exercising your RightsIn order to exercise these and other data subject right,, an affected party may, at any time, contact Jimdo via the following contact address privacy@jimdo.com.
Where the Jimdo User exercises his or her legal right to access, correction or deletion of their personal information, Jimdo may, under certain circumstances in particular where legally obliged to so, refuse to provide such information or refuse to correct or delete your personal information.
However, Jimdo will give the reasons in these cases.Right to Lodge a ComplaintWithout prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, the Jimdo user has the right to lodge a complaint with a relevant supervisory authority in accordance with Article 77 GDPR, in particular in the Member State of the userâs place of residence, place of work or place of alleged infringement, if the Jimdo user is of the opinion that the processing of his personal data has not occurred in accordance with the provisions of the GDPR.Data SecurityThe Jimdo User's information is protected by the Jimdo technical and organizational security measures to minimize risks associated with their loss, misuse, unauthorized access, unauthorized disclosure and alteration of their and all users data.
For example, we use firewalls and data encryption, as well as physical access restrictions for our data centers and data access authorization controls.Changes to this Privacy PolicyJimdo reserves the right to change this privacy policy should this be necessary due to a change in legislation or as a result of further or changed services used or offered by Jimdo.
The current version can always be located on this page.
If Jimdo intends to process the data of the Jimdo user for purposes other than those for which they were collected, we will inform the Jimdo user in advance, in accordance with the law.
