Personal Data within Capture Projects and the Mapillary Marketplace

This Policy applies to such processing of Personal Data over which Mapillary is the data controller pursuant to the GDPR.
However, for Marketplace or Capture Projects, Mapillary, and the Organization/Requester for which images are collected, will be joint controllers in relation to the processing of Personal Data within the scope of such Services.
When two or more parties are joint controllers in regard to processing of Personal Data, as in the case of Personal Data processed within the scope of Capture Projects or the Mapillary Marketplace, the joint controllers are to determine their respective responsibilities according to the GDPR.
This determination is made through an internal arrangement between the joint controllers.
The internal arrangement in force between Mapillary and the Organization/Requester that you collect images for can be found in Mapillaryâs Terms of Use.
Mapillary processes Personal Data under this joint controllership for the purposes and on such legal basis as set out in section C above, and as otherwise stipulated in this Policy.
You can always contact Mapillary at support@mapillary.com if you have any questions regarding your Personal Data processed under joint controllership, or if you wish to exercise any of your rights under this Policy or the GDPR.
For the purposes and legal basis of the Requester/Organization, we refer you to their respective privacy policy.
If the Requester/Organization is a private individual acting in their private capacity, Mapillary is instead the sole data controller of Personal Data processed within the scope of the Mapillary Marketplace or Capture Projects, and this Policy (except for this section D) applies to that processing.

E.
Sharing Information

We do not disclose, sell or rent your Personal Data to third parties for their marketing purposes without your prior consent.
If you do consent but later change your mind, you may contact us and we will cease any such activity.

(iii) to comply with laws or respond to lawful requests and legal process or to enforce or apply our terms of use/service, license terms, or other agreements between us, and to protect the rights, safety and property of Mapillary, our agents, employees, customers, members, and others;and
(iv) under written obligations of confidentiality, in connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition, or dissolution, transaction, or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business or assets to another company.

When other companies, e.g.
our service providers, process your Personal Data on our behalf, we always enter into binding data processing agreements that ensure that your Personal Data always enjoys the same level of protection as under this Policy.

F.
No Guarantee of Security

We apply appropriate technical and organizational safeguards and take all reasonable steps to help protect your Personal Data in an effort to prevent loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

Only a California resident may make a verifiable consumer request related to their Personal Information.
A California resident may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of their minor child.
A verifiable consumer request for Personal Data access or portability can only be made twice within a 12-month period.
The verifiable consumer request must provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify the California resident about whom we collected Personal Information or an authorized representative, and contain sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We cannot respond to your request or provide Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you.
Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account on our website.
However, we do consider requests made through your password protected account sufficiently verified when the request relates to Personal Information associated with that specific account.
We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.
We will endeavour to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt.
If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.
If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account.
If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically.
Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer requestâs receipt.
The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.
For Personal Data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your Personal Information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the Personal Information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.
If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

Non-discrimination

Except as permitted by the CCPA, we will not:

deny you goods or services.
