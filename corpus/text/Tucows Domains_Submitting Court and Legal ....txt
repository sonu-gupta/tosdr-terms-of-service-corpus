Expired Registration Recovery Policy

Sets the timeline and process guidelines for domain name expirations and redemptions, outlining the related responsibilities of Registries and Registrars, and providing requirements as to how and when Registrants are notified.

Registrantâs Benefits and Responsibilities

Provides complete and detailed information about your rights and responsibilities as a domain name owner, and explains the relationship between ICANN and Domain Registrars.

Registrant Educational Materials

Informative video tutorials to familiarize you with the basics of domain ownership.
These tutorials offer âplain languageâ summaries of terms related to Registrant Rights and Responsibilities as set out in the Registrar Accreditation Agreement (RAA).

Whois Data Reminder Policy (WDRP)

This policy is enforced by ICANN, and requires all Registrars to annually present each Registrant with the current Whois information associated with the Registrantâs domain(s).
This information is sent to the Registrant in a WDRP message, via email.
The message will contain a link to a page where the Registrant may update their Whois information, should they need to do so.
If the Whois information is still up-to-date and complete, no action is required on the part of the Registrant.
A lack of response on the part of Registrant is assumed to mean that the Whois info presented was accurate.
Tucows sends a WDRP messages to each Registrant 120 days before their domainâs expiry date.
For domains that are registered for multiple years, this information is sent via email, 120 days before the anniversary of the domainâs initial registration date.
