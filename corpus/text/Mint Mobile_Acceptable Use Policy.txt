Unlimited Voice and Data Plans.Your Mint Mobile Service is provided by Mint Mobile, LLC, including its affiliates, assigns and agents (âMint Mobile,â âwe,â âusâ or âourâ).
Mint Mobile reserves the right to periodically review usage levels of unlimited minute and unlimited data Mint Mobile Service plans (âUnlimited Plansâ) to ensure that you are not using an Unlimited Plan in violation of this Acceptable Use Policy (âAUPâ) and if such an abuse or violation is discovered to terminate or adjust the plan as appropriate.
You agree to use the voice portion of your Unlimited Plan for traditional voice calls between two individuals of a duration comparable to that of the average individual customer presently utilizing a Mint Mobile Unlimited Plan and will not employ methods, devices or procedures to take advantage of your Unlimited Plan by using the plan excessively or for means not intended by Mint Mobile.
Excessive use of the voice portion of your Unlimited Plan is defined by Mint Mobile as use that materially exceeds the average call volume or duration used by all other Mint Mobile customers that have purchased an Unlimited Plan.
Mint Mobile may terminate your Service or change your Service plan if, in its sole discretion, Mint Mobile determines that your use of the voice portion of your Unlimited Plan violates this prohibition or is otherwise âunreasonableâ or results in abuse of the Unlimited Plan.
