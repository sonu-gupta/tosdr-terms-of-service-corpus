Dispute Resolution.
Please read this Section 15.2 (the âArbitration Agreementâ) carefully.
It is part of your contract with Parsec and affects your rights.
It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.

Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.
All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service provided by Parsec that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court will be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement.
Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings will be held in English.This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and Parsec, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.

Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration.
If non-appearance-based arbitration is elected, the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions.
the specific manner will be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration.
The arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.
Time Limits.
If you or Parsec pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.
Authority of Arbitrator.
If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Parsec, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.
The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim.
The arbitrator may award monetary damages, and grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms.
The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.
The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.
The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Parsec.
Waiver of Jury Trial.
THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes will be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement.
Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court.
In the event any litigation should arise between you and Parsec in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND PARSEC WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.
Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.
ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER USER.
If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this sectionâs limitations as to a given dispute, claim, or request for relief, then such aspect must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the State or Federal Courts located in the State of New York.
All other disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be arbitrated.
Confidentiality.
All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, will be strictly confidential.
The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law.
This paragraph will not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Arbitration Agreement or an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.
Severability.
If any part of this Arbitration Agreement are found to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts will be of no force and effect and will be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement will continue in full force and effect.
Right to Waive.
Any or all the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted.
Such waiver will not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.
Small Claims Court.Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Parsec may bring an individual action in small claims court.
Emergency Equitable Relief.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration.
A request for interim measures will not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.
Claims Not Subject to Arbitration.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other partyâs patent, copyright, trademark or trade secrets will not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.
In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within New York County, New York, for such purpose.
You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: legal@parsec.app, within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement.
