Welcome to the Wildlife Studios Terms of Service (âTermsâ).
This is a legal agreement between you and Wildlife Studios Limited, an Irish corporation (âWildlifeâ), regarding the Services you use from us.
âServicesâ means collectively, and sometimes individually, the following: (a) each of our Games, and (b) any websites, software or other services we provide with or in support of a Game, whether or not they are installed or used on a computer, console, or a mobile device.
âGameâ means our game that you download and access that is subject to these Terms, regardless of where you download and/or access it, and any documentation, software, updates, Virtual Goods and Content (each defined below) included in it.

IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING ARBITRATION FOR USERS IN THE US ONLY: WHEN YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS YOU ARE AGREEING (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION) TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND US THROUGH BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT.
PLEASE REVIEW CAREFULLY SECTION 19 âDISPUTE RESOLUTION AND GOVERNING LAWâ BELOW FOR DETAILS REGARDING ARBITRATION (INCLUDING THE PROCEDURE TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION).
THESE TERMS ALSO INCLUDE A WAIVER OF RIGHTS BY YOU TO BRING A CLASS ACTION AGAINST US AND A LIMITATION ON DAMAGES THAT YOU CAN COLLECT FROM US THAT MAY ARISE OUT OF YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES.





BY USING THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS.
1.
Defined TermsYouâll notice some capitalized terms in these Terms.
Theyâre called âdefined terms,â and we use them so we donât have to repeat the same language again and again, and to make sure that the use of these terms is consistent throughout the Terms. Weâve included the defined terms throughout because we want it to be easy for you to read them in context.2.
Additional TermsSome Services may be available (or only available) through accessing (or downloading from) a third-party platform or store, including but not limited to the Steam game platform, the Google Play Store, and Apple App Store (each, an âApp Storeâ).
Your use of the Services is also governed by any applicable agreements you have with any App Store (the âApp Store Agreement(s)â).
In the event of a conflict between any other App Store Agreement(s), from which you acquire one of our Games, and these Terms with respect to your use of the Services, including our Games, these Terms will take priority. 
The collection of information from you and related to the Services (whether obtained through an App Store or not) is governed by our Privacy Policy at https://wildlifestudios.com/privacy-policy.
Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose information that we collect from and about you.3.
Eligibility and Registration

Age.
You must be at least 13 years old (or such other minimum age as is applicable in the jurisdiction you live in) to create a Game Account (as defined below) or use or access any of our Services.
If you are at least the relevant minimum age but are not legally considered an adult in your jurisdiction, you must ask one of your parents (or legal guardians) to read these Terms and accept it on your behalf, and to create a Game Account.
Parents and guardians are responsible for the acts of their minor children when using a Game Account they created, or any of our Services, and if you are a parent or guardian accepting these Terms, you understand and agree that you will be responsible for all uses of the Game Account and our Services by your minor child whether or not you authorized such uses.
You may not create or use a Game Account, or use or access any of our Services on behalf of a legal entity or for a commercial purpose.

Account Creation.
To access parts of a Game, you may need to create an in-game account (your âGame Accountâ).
Your Game Account, if applicable, is separate from any account you may have with any App Store (your âApp Store Accountâ).
You may be able to create your Game Account using an existing account you have with us or your email address.
To the extent you create your Game Account through the use of a third-party account (for example, your account with Facebook or Google), we may access certain personal information that the third-party provides to us such as your email address and name to help create your Game Account.
Further information about use of third-party accounts is provided in the Privacy Policy at https://wildlifestudios.com/privacy-policy.

Keep Your Information Current.
Itâs important that you provide us with accurate, complete and up-to-date information for your Game Account and you agree to update such information to keep it that way.
If you donât, we may suspend or terminate your Game Account.
You agree that you will not disclose your Game Account password to anyone and will notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your Game Account.
You are responsible for all activities that occur under your Game Account, whether or not you know about them.
If you believe that your Game Account is no longer secure, then you must immediately notify us at our support email address at support@tfghelp.mail.helpshift.com.

No Account Sharing. You may not sell, rent, lease, share or provide access to your Game Account to anyone else.
We reserve all available legal rights and remedies to prevent unauthorized use of our Services, including, but not limited to, technological barriers, IP mapping, and, in serious cases, directly contacting your Internet Service Provider (ISP) regarding such unauthorized use.

These Terms and any action related thereto including but not limited to any dispute, controversy, difference, or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms, the Game, or any related service, including the existence, validity, interpretation, performance, breach or termination thereof or any dispute regarding non-contractual obligations arising out of or relating to these Terms, the App, or any related service (collectively, âDisputesâ) will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, federal arbitration law, and the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.
Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Section 19, the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes (defined below) that you and we are not required to arbitrate will be the state and federal courts located in the Northern District of California, and you and we each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.
(b)           Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes.
We each agree that any Dispute will be resolved solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding.
You and we agree that the U.S.
Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and that you and we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.
This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms.
(c)           Location of Arbitration. If you are a resident of the United States, any arbitration will take place in your county of residence, to the exclusion of all other venues.
(d)        Exceptions.
As limited exceptions to Section 19(b) above, the following Disputes can be resolved in court and need not be resolved through arbitration: (i) any Dispute that can be resolved in small claims court (if it qualifies).
and (ii) any Dispute involving the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.
(e)           Opt-out.
You have the right to opt out of arbitration entirely and litigate any Dispute
if you provide us with written notice of your desire to do so
by email at our Support Email Address within thirty (30) days following the date you first agree to these Terms.
(f)            Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules.
The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the âAAA Rulesâ) then in effect, except as modified by these Terms.
The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules.
The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at www.adr.org.
If your claim is for U.S.
$10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic or video-conference hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds U.S.
$10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you live, unless we both agree to a different location.
The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement.
(g)           Arbitration Costs.
Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
Weâll pay for all filing, administration and arbitrator fees and expenses if your Dispute is for less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous.
If we prevail in arbitration weâll pay all of our attorneysâ fees and costs and wonât seek to recover them from you.
If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneysâ fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.
(h)          Class Action Waiver. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, if the partiesâ dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution (Section 19) shall be null and void.
(i)             Effect of Changes on Arbitration.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 14 above, if we change any of the terms of this Section 19 after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to our Support Email Address) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the âLast Updatedâ date above or in the date of our notice to you of such change.
