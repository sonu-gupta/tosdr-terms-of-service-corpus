At Certo Software, we value our customers and we work hard to ensure that our products are as good as they can be.
The vast majority of our customers are extremely happy with their purchase and we hope you will be too.
But if there is a problem and you would like to request a refund, hereâs all the information you need:

Certo Software will not provide a refund in the following circumstances:


When the customer failed to read the product description and system requirements before purchasing, thus resulting in dissatisfaction with the productâs functionality and/or results.

Certo Software reserves the right to decline refund requests if a product fails to meet the customerâs needs due to a lack of understanding of the productâs capabilities by the customer.

When a technical issue has occurred, but the customer has refused to cooperate with the Certo Software support team and has not provided adequate information to allow them to resolve any issues, such as detailed description of errors, screenshots etc.
Or the customer has refused to attempt any solution suggested by the support team.
When a customer has activated their Certo AntiSpy license and scanned a device, but disputes the results of the scan without providing any specific proof of inaccuracy.
An example of acceptable proof is a differing result from a comparable product or service.
When a customer has a âchange of mindâ after purchase.
When a refund request is made more than 14 days after purchasing one of our products.
Please note, if requesting a refund within 14 days, your request must still meet the criteria below in order to be approved.


Certo Software will provide a refund in the following circumstances:


When the software purchased has technical problems that prohibits its intended use, and no solution has been provided by our support team within 14 days.
When the customer accidentally bought the same product more than once.
In this case, the duplicate purchase will be refunded.
When the customer initially purchased Certo AntiSpy Basic and within 14 days purchased Certo AntiSpy Pro or Ultimate in order to access additional features.
In this case, the customer may receive a refund for their original purchase of Certo AntiSpy Basic.
When the customerâs subscription renews automatically and they did not wish to continue with the service.
In this case, a refund will only be granted if the refund request is made within 14 days of the renewal date and the customerâs license has not been used to scan a device since the renewal date.
