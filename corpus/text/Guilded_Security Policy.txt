 Policy
Guilded appreciates the security community to find vulnerabilities to keep our customers and our business safe.
Response
Guilded will make a best effort to respond to and triage problems brought to our attention.
Our goal is to respond to reports within four days and then triage within an additional four days.
We'll do our best to keep you informed throughout the process.
Disclosure
The goal of this program is to help keep our users and their data safe so when disclosing a vulnerability please follow the rules set out here.&nbsp.
Additionally, make sure to respect our usersâ privacy and ensure your actions do not harm our users.
On our end, we will make an effort to prioritize security and not take punitive action towards researchers that abide by our guidelines to make sure that we encourage reports.
Guidelines

Please provide detailed, reproducible steps to construct the vulnerability.
When we receive multiple reports for the same issue, we will not necessarily be able to respond to all reports but will respond to the first report received. 
If a single underlying problem causes multiple vulnerabilities, we will consider that a single vulnerability.
Any social engineering (e.g.
phishing) is prohibited.
During your investigations make a reasonable effort to avoid:

privacy violations
destruction of data
interruption or degradation of our service

Only interact with accounts you own or with the explicit permission of the owner.

Recognition and Reward
We will recognize those that help us here and, in some cases, provide a modest reward depending on the scope and severity of the discovered vulnerability.&nbsp.
A report must be the first report we receive for a specific issue to be eligible.
Out of scope vulnerabilities
When reporting vulnerabilities, please consider both the attack scenario and the security impact of the bug.
The following issues are not in scope:

Exposing Session Tokens in URLs without proof of exploitability.
Clickjacking on pages with no sensitive actions
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) on unauthenticated forms or forms with no sensitive actions
Attacks requiring MITM or physical access to a user's device.
Previously known vulnerable libraries without a working Proof of Concept.
Comma Separated Values (CSV) injection without demonstrating a vulnerability.
Missing best practices in SSL/TLS configuration.
Any activity that could lead to the disruption of our service (DoS).
Content spoofing and text injection issues without showing a code execution attack vector
Rate limiting or brute force issues on non-authentication endpoints
Missing best practices in Content Security Policy.
Missing HttpOnly or Secure flags on cookies
Missing email best practices (Invalid, incomplete or missing SPF/DKIM/DMARC records, etc.)
Vulnerabilities only affecting users of outdated or unpatched browsers [Less than 2 stable versions behind the latest released stable version]
Software version disclosure / Banner identification issues / Descriptive error messages or headers (e.g.
stack traces, application, or server errors).
Public Zero-day vulnerabilities that have had an official patch for less than 1 month will be awarded on a case by case basis.
Tabnabbing
Open redirect - unless an additional security impact can be demonstrated
Issues that require unlikely user interaction

Safe Harbor
Any activities conducted in a manner consistent with this policy will be considered authorized conduct.
If legal action is initiated by a third party against you in connection with activities conducted under this policy, we will take steps to make it known that your actions were conducted in compliance with this policy.
Reports can be submitted to security@guilded.gg
