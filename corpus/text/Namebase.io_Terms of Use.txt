SERVICES



General Namebase Services.
Your Namebase account ("Account") encompasses the following basic Namebase services: (i) a hosted wallet that allows you to store, track and manage Handshake Coins only (the "Namebase Wallet").
(ii) functionality whereby you may sell Handshake Coins to Namebase or purchase Handshake Coins from Namebase.
and (iii) use of domain name registration and related services on the Handshake Blockchain network (âHandshake Blockchainâ) (collectively the "Namebase Services").



The Handshake Blockchain.
The Handshake Blockchain is part of an open source proposal to create a decentralized certificate authority composed of a decentralized blockchain with the intention to replace the current system of centralized trusted internet infrastructure.
For more information on the operation of the Handshake Blockchain as well as the domain name registration and related functionality of the Handshake Blockchain see https://handshake.org/files/handshake.txt (the âWhitepaperâ).
Namebase does not own or control the Handshake Blockchain, and all functionality related to domain name registration on the Handshake Blockchain are subject to the underlying protocol rules of the Handshake Blockchain, which functionality may be amended at any time without notice to you or us.
The Namebase Services do not include any guarantee that the Handshake Blockchain will be functional or remain operational.
Namebase is not responsible to determine whether the domain name(s) you select, or the use you or others make of the domain name(s), or other use of the Namebase Services or the Handshake Blockchain, infringes legal rights of others.
It is your responsibility to know whether or not the domain name(s) you select or use or allow others to use infringe legal rights of others.



The Handshake Coin.
