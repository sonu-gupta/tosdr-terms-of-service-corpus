Bitcoin Wallet &amp.
Escrow
 Purse's Bitcoin Wallet allow you to send Bitcoin to, and request, receive, and store supported Bitcoin from, third parties pursuant to instructions you provide through the Purse Site (each such transaction is a "Bitcoin Transaction").
Purse reserves the right to refuse to process or to cancel any pending Bitcoin Transaction as required by law or in response to a subpoena, court order, or other binding government order or to enforce transaction limits.
Purse cannot reverse a Bitcoin Transaction which has been broadcast to a Bitcoin network.
The Hosted Bitcoin Wallet services are available only in connection with those Bitcoins that Purse, in its sole discretion, decides to support.
The Bitcoins that Purse supports may change from time to time.
If you have any questions about which Bitcoin Purse currently supports, please visit https://support.purse.io.
Under no circumstances should you attempt to use your Bitcoin Wallet services to store, send, request, or receive Bitcoin in any form that are not supported by Purse.
Purse assumes no responsibility or liability in connection with any attempt to use Purse Services for Bitcoin that Purse does not support.
 11.
Bitcoin Transactions
 Purse processes supported Bitcoin according to the instructions received from its users and we do not guarantee the identity of any user, receiver, requestee or other party.
Once submitted to the Bitcoin network, a Bitcoin Transaction will be unconfirmed for a period of time pending sufficient confirmation of the transaction by the Bitcoin network.
A transaction is not complete while it is in a pending state.
Funds associated with transactions that are in a pending state will be designated accordingly, and will not be included in your Purse Account balance or be available to conduct transactions.
Purse may charge network fees (miner fees) to process a Bitcoin transaction on your behalf.
Purse will calculate the network fee in its discretion, although Purse will always notify you of the network fee at or before the time you authorize the transaction.
Purse reserves the right to delay any Bitcoin Transaction if it perceives a risk of fraud or illegal activity.
 12.
Bitcoin Storage &amp.
Transmission Delays  Purse securely stores all Bitcoin private keys in our control in a combination of online and offline storage.
As a result, it may be necessary for Purse to retrieve certain information from offline storage in order to facilitate a Bitcoin Transaction in accordance with your instructions, which may delay the initiation or crediting of such Bitcoin Transaction for 48 hours or more.
You acknowledge and agree that a Bitcoin Transaction facilitated by Purse may be delayed.
 13.
Third Party Payments  Purse has no control over, or liability for, the delivery, quality, safety, legality or any other aspect of any goods or services that you may purchase or sell to or from a third party (including other users of Purse Services).
Purse is not responsible for ensuring that a buyer or a seller you may transact with will actually complete the transaction or is authorized to do so.
If you experience a problem with any goods or services purchased from, or sold to, a third party in connection with Bitcoin transferred using the Purse Services, or if you have a dispute with such third party, you must resolve the dispute directly with that third party.
If you believe a third party has behaved in a fraudulent, misleading, or inappropriate manner, or if you cannot adequately resolve a dispute with a third party, you may notify Purse Support at https://support.Purse.com so that we may consider what action to take, if any.
 14.
Advanced Protocols  Unless specifically announced on our website or through some other official public statement of Purse, we do not support metacoins, colored coins, side chains, or other derivative, enhanced, or forked protocols, tokens, or coins which supplement or interact with a Bitcoin supported by Purse (collectively, âAdvanced Protocolsâ).
Do not use your Purse Account or GDAX account to attempt to receive, request, send, store, or engage in any other type of transaction involving an Advanced Protocol.
The Purse platform is not configured to detect and/or secure Advanced Protocol transactions and Purse assumes absolutely no responsibility whatsoever in respect to Advanced Protocols.
 15.
Operation of Bitcoin Protocols  Purse does not own or control the underlying software protocols which govern the operation of Bitcoin supported on our platform.
In general, the underlying protocols are open source and anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute them.
By using the Purse, you acknowledge and agree (i) that Purse is not responsible for operation of the underlying protocols and that Purse makes no guarantee of their functionality, security, or availability.
and (ii) that the underlying protocols are subject to sudden changes in operating rules (a/k/a âforksâ), and that such forks may materially affect the value, function, and/or even the name of the Bitcoin you store in the Purse platform.
In the event of a fork, you agree that Purse may temporarily suspend Purse operations (with or without advance notice to you) and that Purse may, in its sole discretion, decide whether or not to support (or cease supporting) either branch of the forked protocol entirely.
You acknowledge and agree that Purse assumes absolutely no responsibility whatsoever in respect of an unsupported branch of a forked protocol.
 16.
Indemnification
 You agree, at your sole expense, to defend, indemnify and hold us, our service providers and consultants, and OUR respective directors, employees and agents, harmless from and against any and all actual or threatened suits, actions, proceedings (at law or in equity), claims, damages, payments, deficiencies, fines, judgments, settlements, liabilities, losses, costs and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney fees, costs, penalties, interest and disbursements) caused by, arising out of, resulting from, attributable to or in any way incidental to: (i) your use of the Services.
