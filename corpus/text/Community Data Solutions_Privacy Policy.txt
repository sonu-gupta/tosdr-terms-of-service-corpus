 Privacy Policy 1.
Purpose of our policy


QWAD Community Technologies Pty Ltd trading as Community Data Solutions (âweâ, âusâ or âourâ) has adopted this Privacy Policy to ensure that we have standards in place to protect the personal information that we collect about you that is necessary and incidental to running our business and making our services available to you and others.


By publishing this Privacy Policy we aim to make it easy for our customers and the public to understand what personal information we collect and store, why we do so, how we receive and/or obtain that information and the rights you have with respect to your personal information in our possession.


This Privacy Policy follows the standards of the Australian Privacy Principles set by the Australian Government for the handling of personal information under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).


2.
Who, and what, this policy applies to


Our Privacy Policy deals with how we handle âpersonal informationâ, which is information that can be used (or is reasonably likely to) identify an individual.
It does not apply to information we collect about businesses or companies, however it does apply to information about the people in those businesses or companies.
The Privacy Policy applies to all forms of information, physical and digital, whether collected or stored electronically or in hardcopy.


If, at any time, you provide personal or other information about someone other than yourself, you warrant that you have that personâs consent to provide such information for the purpose specified.


3.
The information we collect


In the course of business it is necessary for us to collect personal information.
We always let you know when we are collecting information.
This information allows us to identify who you are for the purposes of our business, contact you in the ordinary course of business and transact with you.
Without limitation, the type of information we may collect about you is:


Identity Information.
We may collect personal details such as your name, location, date of birth, nationality, details of licenses &amp.
registrations, associations, family details, passwords, clues, employment details and third-party usernames and other information that allows us to identify who you are;


Contact Information.
We may collect information such as your email address, telephone &amp.
fax number, third-party usernames, residential, business and postal address and other information that allows us to contact you;


Financial Information.
We may collect information about your finances such as your bank accounts and credit cards, the value of transactions you undertake with us or through our services, the value of certain assets that you declare to us and other information that allows us to transact with you and/or provide you with our services.
and


Statistical Information.
We may collect information about your online and offline preferences, habits, movements, trends, decisions, associations, memberships, finances, purchases and other information for statistical purposes.


Health Information.
We may indirectly receive health and medical information about you from our customers, although we do not have access to this information.


Social Information.
We may indirectly receive social information about your employment, family, income, social &amp.
community services, although we do not have access to this information.




This information is necessary for our business activities because it allows us to identify who you are for the purposes of our business, and also allows us to perform administrative and operational tasks for the purposes of our business.


We may collect other personal information about you, which we will maintain in accordance with this Privacy Policy.


We may also collect non-personal information about you such as information regarding your computer, network and browser.
This may include your IP address.
Where non-personal information is collected the Australian Privacy Principles do not apply.


Individuals have the option to not identify themselves to us, or to use a pseudonym, unless we are required or authorised by law to deal with individuals who have identified themselves, or it is impracticable for us to deal with individuals who have not identified themselves.


We may directly or indirectly collect or receive sensitive information.
Where we collect sensitive information we will comply with the requirements under the Australian Privacy Principles to:


a.
seek consent before collecting the sensitive information and ensure that the information is reasonably necessary for one or more of our functions or activities (unless an exemption in the Australian Privacy Principles applies), where the information is directly solicited.
or
b.
where the information is unsolicited, destroy or de-identify the information if we determine that we could not have obtained the information if we had sought to solicit it directly (and the information is not containing a Commonwealth record).
4.
How your information is collected


Most information will be collected in association with your use, custom, enquiry or dealings with us, but will at all times be collected only by lawful and fair means.
However we may also receive your personal information from sources such as advertising, your own promotions, public records, mailing lists, contractors, staff, recruitment agencies and our business partners.
