PlayStation Plus is an ongoing subscription with a recurring subscription fee which is charged automatically (at the then-current PlayStation Store price) at the frequency you choose at purchase until the subscription is cancelled.


If your wallet doesn't have enough funds when an automatic recurring subscription payment is due, the balance will be automatically funded from the default payment method on record to cover the subscription fee.
 
HOW TO CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION

You can cancel your subscription at any time so that your subscription will expire at the end of your trial period or at the end of the period for which you have already paid, as applicable.
This will stop future payments of subscription fees being taken, but you wonât receive a refund for payments already made.
This is in addition to purchase cancellation rights you may have under your applicable local laws.
See our Cancellation Policy at http://playstation.com/store-cancellation-policy.

14-DAY TRIAL

At the end of your 14-day trial period, your PlayStation Plus subscription will automatically roll into a paid-for ongoing subscription with a recurring monthly subscription fee which will be taken automatically each month.
If you want to prevent this, you can cancel your subscription prior to the end of the 14-day trial period.
You can continue to use the benefits for the full 14 days, even if you cancel before then.

You need a credit/debit card or PayPal account registered to your account for PlayStation Network to access a 14-day trial subscription.

PlayStation customers may experience PlayStation Plus benefits at no extra cost by selecting the 14-day trial.
Each person is eligible for one 14-day trial unless otherwise communicated.
 
MONTHLY PAYMENT PLAN
