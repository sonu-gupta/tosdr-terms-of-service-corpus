TERMS OF USE

BY PARTICIPATING IN THE MYVIZIO SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF USE.
IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF USE, DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE.
COMPLETING THE REGISTRATION PROCESS OR ACCESSING ANY PART OR ALL OF THE SERVICE WILL CONSTITUTE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS OF USE.

If you live in the United States, the binding arbitration agreement and class action waiver affect your rights under this Service.
Please read the text under the section titled âBinding Arbitration.
Class Action Waiver (U.S.
Residents Only)â carefully.


Note to Non-US Residents: if you are a user residing outside the United States, some of the Services will not be available to you.
For those Services that are made available to you, these Terms of Use will govern your use of those Services to the maximum extent permitted by these terms and by applicable law.
In particular, these Terms of Use will govern your use of the SmartCast functionality that is made available to you through your myVIZIO account.

In the event of a dispute about the identity of a member, VIZIO may require that the member provide proof that he/she is the authorized account holder of the email address and/or password associated with the account.
Each user that properly completes the registration process will be considered a member for the purposes of these Terms of Use.
VIZIO may refuse to offer or continue offering the Service to any person and may change its eligibility criteria from time to time.
4.
REGISTRATION.
To become a member, you must complete the registration process by providing VIZIO with complete and accurate information, as required in the registration form.
For example, you may be required to provide your name and zip code, username, password, legitimate electronic mail address and certain additional information, such as preferred contact method and products and services of interest in order to access certain features of the Service.
VIZIO may elect to refuse to register any user, in its sole discretion.

Upon acceptance of your registration, VIZIO will provide access credentials to you.
You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your access credentials and other account information.
You agree to keep all account information up-to-date.
You also agree to notify VIZIO immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security.

CAUTION: ANY ATTEMPT TO DELIBERATELY UNDERMINE THE OPERATION OF THE SERVICE MAY BE A VIOLATION OF LAW.
VIZIO RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SEEK DAMAGES FROM ANY SUCH PERSON TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

5.
PRIVACY.
You agree to VIZIO's Privacy Policy, available at https://www.vizio.com/en/terms/privacy-policy.
VIZIO will not disclose your personally identifiable information in connection with the Service unless: (a) reasonably necessary to perform the Service, (b) authorized by you, (c) otherwise permitted under the Privacy Policy, or (d) VIZIO reasonably believes that such action is necessary to (i) comply with any legal, regulatory, law enforcement or similar requirement or investigation, (ii) protect or defend the rights or property of VIZIO or any user, or (iii) enforce the Terms of Use or any other agreement.
VIZIO will use your social networking account information only as permitted under the Privacy Policy and for the purpose of providing the Service to you, and will not otherwise attempt to obtain information from, or post information using, such accounts.
6.
FEES.
Except as expressly provided otherwise, you are solely responsible for your own costs and expenses to access and use the Service.
VIZIO will determine whether (and how much) to charge for the Service.
Since the Service is initially made available without charge, VIZIO may later decide to charge for some or all of the features of the Service.
Should there be a charge for the Service, VIZIO may later decide to change the price of that fee.
Users will be notified of fees and any fee changes.
7.
FORUMS / POSTINGS.
The Service may include discussion forums, reviews or other features where members may upload, display or transmit user generated content, materials and other information of interest (User Content).
Because VIZIO does not preview or review the postings or User Content on or otherwise via the Service, you must be careful in dealing with other members to avoid fraud.
You acknowledge that information provided by other members may, despite prohibitions in the Terms of Use, be harmful, inaccurate or deceptive.
Authentication of the true identity of Internet users is difficult, and VIZIO cannot and does not confirm that each member is the person who they claim to be.

laws, rules and regulations shall govern.
The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to these Terms of Use.
Use of the Service is not authorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of the Terms of Use.
17.
BINDING ARBITRATION.
CLASS ACTION WAIVER (U.S.
Residents Only).
UNLESS YOU HAVE BROUGHT AN ELIGIBLE CLAIM IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT OR HAVE OPTED OUT AS DESCRIBED BELOW, ANY CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THESE TERMS OF USE OR MYVIZIO, INCLUDING ANY CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE SERVICE OR THE FAILURE OF THE SERVICE WILL BE SETTLED BY BINDING ARBITRATION ADMINISTERED BY THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION (AAA) AND CONDUCTED BY A SINGLE ARBITRATOR APPOINTED BY THE AAA, IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES AND ITS SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES FOR CONSUMER-RELATED DISPUTES.
You may learn more about the AAA and its rules for arbitration by visiting www.adr.org or by calling 800-778-7879.
Since the Service concerns a transaction in interstate or international commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act will apply.
The filing fees to begin and carry out arbitration will be shared between you and VIZIO, but in no event will your fees ever exceed the amount allowable by the AAA, at which point VIZIO will cover all additional administrative fees and expenses.
VIZIO waives its right to recover attorneysâ fees in connection with any arbitration under these Terms of Use.
If you are the prevailing party in an arbitration to which the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes applies, then you are entitled to recover attorneysâ fees as the arbitrator may determine.
The dispute will be governed by the laws of the state or territory in which you resided at the time of your purchase (if in the United States).
The place of arbitration will be Irvine, California, or your county of residence (if in the United States).
The arbitrator will have no authority to award punitive or other damages not measured by the prevailing party's actual damages, except as may be required by statute.
The arbitrator will not award consequential damages, and any award will be limited to monetary damages and will include no equitable relief, injunction, or direction to any party other than the direction to pay a monetary amount.
Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator will be binding and final, except for any right of appeal provided by the Federal Arbitration Act, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
Except as may be required by law, neither you nor VIZIO nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration under this warranty without the prior written consent of you and VIZIO.
ANY DISPUTE, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION, IN COURT, OR OTHERWISE, WILL BE CONDUCTED SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.
VIZIO AND YOU AGREE THAT NO PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED AS A CLASS ACTION, A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR IN ANY OTHER PROCEEDING IN WHICH EITHER PARTY ACTS OR PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY.
NO ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING WILL BE JOINED, CONSOLIDATED, OR COMBINED WITH ANOTHER ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES TO ANY SUCH ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING.
18.
EXCEPTIONS TO BINDING ARBITRATION.
CLASS ACTION WAIVER.

IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THE BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER, THEN: (a) you must notify VIZIO in writing within sixty (60) days of the date that you become a member of myVIZIO.
(b) your written notification must be mailed to VIZIO at 39 Tesla, Irvine, CA 92618, Attn: Legal Department.
and (c) your written notification must include (i) your name, (ii) your address, (iii) the date you became a member of myVIZIO, and (iv) a clear statement that you wish to opt out of the binding arbitration agreement and class action waiver.
In addition, you may pursue a claim in small claims court in your county of residence (if in the United States) or in Orange County, California.
In such case the provisions of the section titled âBinding Arbitration.
Class Action Waiver (U.S.
Residents Only)â will not apply.
19.
INTEGRATION AND SEVERABILITY.
The Terms of Use (including the Policies) are the entire agreement between you and VIZIO with respect to the Service and use of myVIZIO and supersede all prior or communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic).
If any provision of the Terms of Use is found to be unenforceable, other than the class action waiver, that provision will be limited to the extent necessary so that the Terms of Use will otherwise remain in full force and effect.
If the class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entire Section 17 (Binding Arbitration.
Class Action Waiver (U.S.
Residents Only)) will not apply.
The failure of VIZIO to enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision.
20.
GENERAL PROVISIONS.
Your rights and obligations under the Terms of Use are personal, and are not assignable, transferable or subject to sublicense, except with VIZIO's prior written consent.
VIZIO may assign, transfer or delegate any of its rights and obligations hereunder without consent.
All waivers, consents and modifications must be in a writing signed by both parties.
No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created as a result of the Service or these Terms of Use, and neither party has any authority of any kind to bind the other in any respect.
All notices under the Terms of Use will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered or sent by certified or registered mail.
