TLDR/Creator Comment:
HLTB is developed and operated by a single person (with help from my beloved forum mods Pongsifu &amp.
tiamat911).
I have no interest in abusing or selling your personal data.
All information collected is willingly provided by you and used as minimally as possible for HowLongToBeat.com's functionality.
I respect your time and will always strive for transparency.
I consider it an absolute privilege and pleasure to provide this service for you.
HLTB is a passion project but websites do cost money to run and ads are used to keep the servers online and provide a small amount of compensation for my time.
Thank you for visiting.
