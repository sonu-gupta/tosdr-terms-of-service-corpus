Social Networks

We maintain a presence on social media and other external platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter.
We may occasionally incorporate third party social networking features into our Services.
This Privacy Policy applies to our use of information you submit to us there, but it does not apply to what those third-party platforms do with your information.

Our Services may allow you to share information with us that you have already provided to a third party social networking platform.
For example, you may be able to create an account on our Service or log in to our Service using your Facebook account or other third-party credentials.
If you do so, Personal Information or other data that you have provided to the third party may be made available to us by that third party subject to its own privacy policy, terms, and conditions.
Privacy policies of social networks and other external platforms explain how those third parties use, protect, and share your information, including any information you share on those platforms from our Services, and we encourage you to read them.
The information we receive from these platforms may depend on your privacy settings.

We may also include tools in our Services that allow you to share or publicly post content from our Services to your profile on a third party social network.
You may choose to share information about your activities on the Service with such third party platforms and its users, including publishing your information about what content you may have viewed on our Services.
If you visit a Service while logged into certain social media platforms, the social media platform may be able to identify your browser and associate the technical information provided by your web browser with other information that they have already collected about you, which may result in their ability to identify you.
In addition, when you choose to share information about your activities on the Service with certain social media platforms, AP may send technical information about you to that platform as well as information about what content you are viewing.
