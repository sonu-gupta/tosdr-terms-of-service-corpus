To the extent any term or condition of your Minimum Term Agreement expressly conflicts with any term or condition of this Agreement, your Minimum Term Agreement will govern.



C.&nbsp.
Entire Agreement:

This Agreement and all of the documents specifically incorporated herein constitute the entire Agreement between you and Cox for the Services.
No prior agreement and no written or oral statement, advertisement, or Service description will contradict, explain or supplement it.



D.&nbsp.

Your continued use of the Services after such thirty (30) day period will constitute your Acceptance of this Agreement as modified.

In accordance with Applicable Law, Cox will rely on credit bureau reports, other data available from commercial credit reference services, any credit information you furnish, or internal credit information to determine whether or not to provide Services to you, to continue to provide Services to you or whether or not a deposit is required.
You expressly authorize Cox to make inquiries and to receive information about your credit experience from others, to enter this information in your file, and to disclose this information concerning you to appropriate third parties for reasonable business purposes.

 

B.&nbsp.

As permitted by Applicable Law, based on the information we received from the credit reporting agency, credit information you furnish, or internal credit information, and our assessment of the risk associated with that information, Cox Communications may require a deposit from you before providing services or an increase in any deposit for any Service already provided to you.

All fees do not apply to all Services.
 
 

2.&nbsp.
Governmental Taxes and Fees:
 You must pay all federal, state and local taxes, franchise fees and any other fees or payment obligations imposed by government or quasi-governmental bodies however described, levied or assessed which are applicable to the Services or Cox Equipment we provide you.
Unless required by Applicable Law, we may elect not to provide notice of a change in fees or taxes.
You will be responsible for paying any government imposed Surcharges that become applicable retroactively.
 

3.&nbsp.
Other Cox or Third Party Surcharges and Fees:
 You must pay all other Cox imposed surcharges and fees we may assess in connection with the Services or the Cox Equipment (collectively âSurchargesâ).
These Surcharges may include, but are not limited to, the Broadcast Surcharge, Regional Sports Surcharge, federal Universal Service fees, telecommunications relay service fees, carrier cost recovery fees, FCC Access Fees, subscriber line charges, network interface fees, network access charges.
and any other regulatory and administrative costs we incur to provide the Services and comply with governmental programs.
These Surcharges are not government mandated fees or taxes but are charges that are either allowed to be passed through by governmental agencies or are imposed by Cox in order to facilitate the provision of the Services or the Cox Equipment.&nbsp.
A description of some or all of these surcharges and fees may be found on cox.com under Billing and Account Support.&nbsp.
Additionally, certain network providers may assess per minute surcharges or fees for calls that terminate to international wireless telephone numbers or additional surcharges or fees for traffic termination, which may impact the amount of Surcharges charged to you in Cox providing the Service (âPhone Surchargesâ).
The amount and type of these Phone Surcharges may vary depending upon the location of your Premises.
Certain Surcharges, including some Phone Surcharges, may occur or fluctuate according to amounts or limits set by the government that Cox may pass through to you.&nbsp.
Cox may not always provide advance notice if those changes cause adjustments in the amount of the Surcharges charged to you.
 

4.&nbsp.
Third-Party Charges That Are Your Responsibility:
 You acknowledge that you may incur charges with third-party providers such as for accessing on-line services, calling parties who charge for their telephone-based services, purchasing or subscribing to other offerings via the Internet, or interactive options on your video service that are separate and apart from amounts charged by us.
You are solely responsible for all such charges payable to third parties, including all applicable taxes, fees or surcharges.
In addition, you are solely responsible for protecting the security of credit card, debit card, other financial information, or other personal information provided to others in connection with such transactions.&nbsp.
You have the ability to block third party phone charges, such as collect and operator assisted calls.&nbsp.
Please call Cox Customer Care if you would like to block these third party charges.
 

5.&nbsp.
Unreturned Equipment Charges:
 If you upgrade, downgrade, disconnect or swap-out Cox Equipment related to any Cox Service and do not promptly return the Cox Equipment or if it is returned damaged (âUnreturned Equipmentâ), the damages Cox will incur will be difficult to ascertain.
Therefore, Cox may charge your account for each Unreturned Equipment piece, a one-time Unreturned Equipment Charge as liquidated damages in an amount equal to Coxâs reasonable estimates of the replacement costs and incidental costs that Cox incurs.
provided, however, that such amount will not exceed the maximum amount permitted by law or the replacement cost of the Cox Equipment.
If you return your Cox Equipment to Cox by mail, you will be responsible for (i) any damage to the Cox Equipment as assessed by Cox upon receipt, (ii) the replacement cost of such Cox Equipment if it is lost or damaged during transit, and (iii) shipping/handling costs, unless Cox provides written notice in advance that it will pay such costs.
 

6.&nbsp.
Unauthorized and Disputed Charges:
 If you do not agree with a charge on your bill or you believe it is an unauthorized charge you must (i) pay undisputed amounts by the due date listed on your bill and (ii) notify Cox no later than sixty (60) days after the date of the bill (or such later date as required by law) of the disputed or unauthorized charges by calling or writing to us at the number and address specified on your bill and submit any documentation or other information to substantiate your claim of unauthorized charges.
You waive any disputes or credits that you do not report within this 60 day period.&nbsp.
Cox will investigate any disputed charges and will use reasonable efforts to advise you of the results of our investigation within thirty (30) days after Coxâs receipt of your notice of dispute.
Cox may, in its sole discretion, waive such charges.
You will be responsible for charges or other obligations or liabilities associated with any improper, illegal or unauthorized use of the Services, Licensed Software and Cox Equipment as described in Section 13 below.

You agree not to make any notations or restrictions on your checks or on other forms for payment such as âpaid in fullâ and you agree that any such restriction has no legal effect.
If you use a credit or debit card to pay for any charges, taxes, fees or Surcharges, you acknowledge that use of the card is governed by the card issuer agreement, and you must refer to that agreement for your rights and liabilities as a cardholder.
If Cox does not receive payment from your credit card issuer or its agents, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand.&nbsp.
When you provide a check as payment, you authorize us either to use information from your check to make a one-time electronic fund transfer from your account or to process the payment as a check transaction.
 

2. &nbsp.
Billing and Late Payments:
 Unless you are subject to a Minimum Term Agreement, Service(s) are provided to you on a month-to-month basis.&nbsp.
Recurring charges and taxes are due in advance once Service is initiated.
Charges accrue through a full billing period.
Cox may prorate or adjust a bill if the billing period covers less than or more than a full month (for this purpose, each month is considered to have 30 days).
unless you subscribe to a pay-as-you-go service which is not prorated and is billed for a full month.
We will determine the billing period and may change the billing period from time to time.
Cox will determine and may change the billing format from time to time.
You may be billed for some Service(s) individually after they have been provided to you, including without limitation measured and per-call charges, operator-assisted or directory assistance charges, charges for pay-per-view or On Demand movies or events, data usage overage charges and one time charges such as service call charges.&nbsp.
If you fail to make full payment by the payment due date set forth on your bill statement, Cox reserves all rights it may have, subject to Applicable Law, to terminate Service or place the Service(s) in Soft Disconnection, remove Cox Equipment, collect the full amount due, including, without limitation, any applicable interest, costs of collection (including attorneysâ fees and third party agent collection fees), late fees (subject to state law and regulations), door collection fees, bank fees and any other applicable fees, charges or payments.
Any balance amount that remains delinquent may be referred to a third party for collections.
Once the debt is referred to a third party for collection, you may be subject to and agree to reimburse Cox for additional fees, including reasonable attorneysâ fees, and fees related to costs and expenses, which may be based on a percentage of up to 25% of the balance owed (subject to state law and regulations).&nbsp.
For past due balances assigned to a field collector for payment, a fee of up to $25.00, or up to the maximum amount allowed by law or regulation, will be charged to your Cox account, regardless of how you make your payment.
You may be required to pay a reactivation or reinstallation fee and/or a deposit in addition to all past dues charges before Service may be reconnected or restored.
 

3.&nbsp.
Returned Payment:
 If your payment by check is returned, your payment via credit card is denied, or your electronic funds transfer is denied due to insufficient funds, or a closed account, you authorize Cox to make a one-time electronic fund transfer from your account to collect the amount of the payment plus any applicable returned payment fees of up to $25.00 or up to the maximum amount allowed by law or regulation.
When payment is made by credit or bank card, the payment may also be subject to the terms and conditions required by the bank or credit card issuer.
 

4.&nbsp.
Soft Disconnection:
 If your account has been delinquent or if Cox has a reason to believe you have otherwise violated this Agreement, subject to Applicable Law, you may be prevented from using certain of your Services including, for Cox Phone customers from making outbound calls except to 911 and Cox Customer Care (âSoft Disconnectionâ) prior to full termination of service.
This restriction will be lifted once you have made acceptable payments to us or otherwise meet Coxâs minimum financial requirements, or you have communicated with Cox Customer Care and resolved any concerns about your account, Services or compliance with the terms of this Agreement.
 

5. &nbsp.
Stored Payment Methods:
 If you provide Cox with any account information, such as your bank account and routing numbers or your credit or debit card details, we may store that information and use it to administer your account, confirm charges, detect and prevent fraud, verify your identity, process payments to your account that you request in the future by telephone, mobile app, internet, or otherwise, and comply with applicable data security protocols, including but not limited to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard.&nbsp.
Additionally, Cox may, without prior notice to you, use your stored account information to initiate credit or debit entries to your account as necessary to correct any mistakes or amendments in billing, payments, or collection.

PROVIDED HOWEVER IF YOU BECOME A NEW COX CUSTOMER AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISION (EXCEPT JURY TRIAL WAIVER) WITHIN 30 DAYS OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT AS DEFINED IN SECTION 1(d) ABOVE (THE âOPT-OUT PERIODâ).
OTHERWISE, YOU WILL BE BOUND TO SETTLE ANY DISPUTES YOU MAY HAVE WITH COX THROUGH THE FOLLOWING DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURES.

 

A. &nbsp.
YOU AND COX AGREE TO ARBITRATE â RATHER THAN LITIGATE IN COURT â
 any and all claims, disputes, or controversies between you and Cox, including any parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, employees, or agents of Cox, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, negligence, or any other intentional tort) or other legal or equitable theory (âDisputeâ) that arise out of or in any way relate to this Agreement, any of the Services provided under this Agreement or any other Services or products that Cox provides to you in connection with this Agreement (including but not limited to amounts that Cox charges you for Services or products provided, any alleged breach related to the collection, retention or disclosure of your personal information, and any alleged violation of our Privacy Notice).&nbsp.
You and Cox also agree to arbitrate any and all Disputes that arise out of or relate in any way to any services or products provided to you by Cox or any of its affiliated entities under any other agreement.&nbsp.
Notwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate, you and Cox may bring appropriate Disputes against each other in small claims court, if the Dispute falls within the small claims court's jurisdiction, or before the Federal Communications Commission, the relevant state public utilities commission, or any other federal, state, or local government agency authorized by law to hear the Dispute.
 

B. &nbsp.
Opt Out:
 You may opt out of this dispute resolution provision (except for the jury trial waiver contained in Section 4(g) below) by notifying Cox of that intent during the Opt-Out Period by sending an email to Cox at ArbitrationOptOut@cox.com or a letter via U.S.
mail to Cox Legal Department, Attn:&nbsp.
Litigation Counsel, 6205B Peachtree Dunwoody Road, Atlanta, GA 30328 stating that you are opting out of this dispute resolution provision.&nbsp.
Exercising this right, should you choose to do so, will not affect any of the other terms of this Agreement with Cox, and you may remain a Cox customer.&nbsp.
If you opt out of the dispute resolution provision, that opt out will remain in effect if Cox modifies this section in the future or you agree to a new term of service under this Agreement.&nbsp.
If you enter into a new agreement with Cox that includes a dispute resolution provision and you want to opt out of that provision, you will need to follow the instructions in that agreement for opting out.
 

C. &nbsp.
Class Action Waiver:
 You and Cox agree that all Disputes between you and Cox will be arbitrated individually, and that there will be no class, representative, or consolidated actions in arbitration.&nbsp.
If you or Cox brings a claim in small claims court, the class action waiver will apply, and neither of us can bring a claim on a class or representative basis.
Furthermore, neither you nor Cox may participate in a class or representative action as a class member if the class action asserts Disputes that would fall within the scope of this arbitration agreement if they were directly asserted by you or Cox.
We both agree that this class action waiver is an essential part of our arbitration agreement and that if this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable by any court or arbitrator then the entire arbitration agreement set forth in this Section 4 will not apply to any Dispute between you and Cox, except for the provisions of Section 4(g) waiving the right to jury trial.
This class action waiver may not be severed from our arbitration agreement.
 

D. &nbsp.
Arbitrator Authority:
 The arbitration between you and Cox will be binding.&nbsp.
In arbitration, there is no judge and no jury.&nbsp.
Instead, our disputes will be resolved by an arbitrator, whose authority is governed by the terms of this Agreement.
You and Cox agree that an arbitrator may only award such relief as a court of competent jurisdiction could award, limited to the same extent as a court would limit relief pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.
An arbitrator may award attorneys' fees and costs if a court would be authorized to do so, and may issue injunctive or declaratory relief if that relief is required or authorized by the Applicable Law, but that injunctive or declaratory relief may not extend beyond you and your dealings with Cox.&nbsp.
Review of arbitration decisions in the courts is very limited.
 

E. &nbsp.
Informal Dispute Resolution:
 You and Cox agree that you will try to resolve disputes informally before resorting to arbitration.
 If you have a dispute, first call Cox Customer Care at the number listed on your monthly bill statement.&nbsp.

If Cox does not satisfactorily resolve your claim within 30 calendar days of receiving written notice to Cox Customer Care of your claim, then you may pursue the claim in arbitration.&nbsp.
Neither you nor Cox may initiate arbitration without first following the informal dispute resolution procedure provided in this paragraph and thereafter, if the dispute is still not resolved, the party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other written notice of the intent to file for arbitration.&nbsp.
If you are sending a written notice of your intent to file for arbitration to Cox, please send such notice via U.S.
mail to Cox Legal Department, Attn: Litigation Counsel, 6205B Peachtree Dunwoody Road, Atlanta, GA 30328.
If Cox is sending you a written notice of our intent to file for arbitration, we will send it to the last known address of record we have on file for you.

Cox will not seek to recover its fees and costs from you in the arbitration, even if allowed under the law, unless your claim has been determined to be frivolous.
If you are successful in the arbitration, Cox will pay your reasonable attorney's fees and costs.
If you obtain an award from the arbitrator greater than Cox's last written settlement offer, Cox will pay you $5,000 in addition to what you have been awarded in the arbitration.&nbsp.
The arbitration will be held in the county of the billing address where Cox provided you service and either party may appear either in person or by telephone.
 

G. &nbsp.
Jury Trial Waiver:
 If for any reason this arbitration agreement is found to be unenforceable, or if you opt out of this dispute resolution agreement, you and Cox expressly and knowingly WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY. This means that a Judge rather than a Jury will decide disputes between you and Cox if, for any reason, the arbitration agreement is not enforced.
 

H.
&nbsp.
