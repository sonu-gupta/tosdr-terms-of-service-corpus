         KYC Policy
All waiting list applications, as well as product orders, are subject to a verification procedure.
This means that to avoid usage of stolen credit cards and PayPal accounts, we may ask you to verify that youâre the owner of a credit card or a PayPal account that you intended to pay with for Multilogin services.
After you sign up for the Multilogin waiting list, we may (but not necessarily will) ask you to verify your billing account information.
Hereâs how to go about it:

Options for Paypal and credit card payments (you can choose one of the alternatives):  


Send us a copy of an ID, issued by your Government, which clearly shows your name and picture.
The file will be completely deleted after the verification process
Pass a video interview with our customer support representative


Options for Bitcoin: 


We donât ask to verify Bitcoin payments

Please be certain your contact information is correct as applications or orders with an invalid phone number will be cancelled.
We regret that these measures are necessary, but they are designed to protect owners of credit cards and PayPal accounts, as well as, Multilogin.
If a payment is considered high risk, Multilogin may cancel the order at own discretion.
