Purpose and scope of this document


This document describes collection and processing of your personal data used in the use of our mobile device applications SocialPass and SocialScan.
SocialPass is aimed at customers or visitors to public facilities such as restaurants and/or events (guests), while SocialScan serves the operators of public facilities and event organisers (hosts).
The purpose of this document is also to inform the employees of the operators of public institutions and the organisers of events in cantons where the collection of employeesâ data is also mandatory (e.g., in the canton of Vaud).


Concept of personal data / personal data


Personal data is all information relating to your person, such a  name, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number.

Purpose


We collect and process your personal data for the following purposes:

hosts to comply with the legally imposed obligations to collect and verify contact details.
In Switzerland, article 4(2) of the Ordinance of 19 June 2020 on measures to combat the COVID-19 epidemic in special situations is at issue.
The competent health authorities should be able to identify and contact potentially infected persons, within the meaning of Articles 33 e.g., of the Federal Act of 28 September 2012 on the Control of Communicable Diseases of Humans (Pandemic Act).



Data collected.        



5.1.
SocialPass

When using SocialPass for the first time, you will be asked to enter the language of use, telephone number, your name, first name, address of the place of residence and date of birth.
Filling in the corresponding fields is mandatory.
You can also provide your e-mail address (optional).
Please note that your phone number will be automatically checked with an SMS to the number you entered earlier.
This data remains stored in your phone and is used to generate a secure, encrypted QR code.
There may be two cases at the entrance to a public institution or event, depending on the canton in which you are located and the institution/event:


You scan your hostâs QR code using the SocialPass app.
The data provided by your host will then be linked to the data provided by you as well as the time data of the scan (date, time) and, if applicable, the table number, visitor sector or other situation-specific data.
This data is stored on one or more secure servers in Switzerland.

You show your QR code generated by the SocialPass app, and your host scans it.
The SocialScan application of your host then takes over the data that you provided when you first used SocialPass, links it to the data of its establishment / event as well as the relevant time data (date, time) and the data record is stored on one or more secure servers in Switzerland.
Your host does not have access to your data, and it will not be stored with him.

If the   competent health authorities have opted to access the database directly  (VS, VD), they can access it directly if their tracing work requires it.
If the competent health authorities have opted accessing the database directly, the host may, at the request of the local health authority, download a  list of the persons present at a given time and send it to the competent health authority.



If you use SocialPass as a host employee  (only in cantons where the collection of personnel data is also required), scan your employerâs QR code, which is reserved for employees (âTEAMâ) at the start of work and end of work.
The data provided by your employer will then be linked to the data you provide and the time data at the time of the scan (date, time) and stored on one or more secure servers in Switzerland.
SocialPass does not have a connection to your phoneâs GPS system.

5.2.
SocialScan

When using SocialScan for the first time, you will be asked to register your âorganizationâ depending on the category (restaurant, event, sporting event, etc.) and to enter the required identification data (name of the institution or event, postal address, e-mail address and name of the person responsible).
Please note that a user account is created.
When a customer arrives, there may be two cases, depending on which method you use:


Guests scan the QR code you have issued using the SocialPass app.
The data provided by SocialScan users will then be linked to the data provided by the guest by the SocialPass as well as the time data of the scan (date, time) and, if necessary, the table number, visitor sector or other situation-specific data.
This data is stored on one or more secure servers in Switzerland.



You scan the QR code generated by the guestâs SocialPass app.
Your SocialScan application then takes over the data that is made available on SocialPass, links it to the data of your institution/event as well as the relevant time data (date, time) and the data set is stored on one or more secure servers in Switzerland.
You do not have access to the guest and visit data and these are not stored by you.

In case authorized health authorities have opted to access the database directly&nbsp.
(VS, VD),then they can do so if required for their tracing activities.
If the competent health authorities have opted to access the database directly, the host may, at request of the authorized health authority, download a&nbsp.
list of the persons present at a given time and send it to the respective health authority.
You undertake not to save, print, make available to others or otherwise use this list.



You can also allow your employees to store their data if your health authorities so request and allow.
Your employees will be informed of the collection and processing of their personal data by this document, which they must agree to before using the SocialPass application for the first time.
