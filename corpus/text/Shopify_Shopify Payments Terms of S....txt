 Opens in a new windowOpens an external siteOpens an external site in a new window Shopify Payments Terms of Service The Terms and Conditions described herein constitute a legal agreement
(âAgreementâ or âShopify Payments Termsâ) between you (if your business
is a sole proprietorship) or your business (if you are signing up on
behalf of a corporation or other legal entity) (the âMerchantâ, âyouâ or
âyourâ) and Shopify Payments (USA) Inc., organized under the laws of
Delaware with offices at 251 Little Falls Drive, Wilmington, Delaware
19808 (âShopifyâ, âweâ, âusâ, or âourâ). A.
The Shopify Payments Service 


Our Role
The Shopify Payments service (âShopify
Paymentsâ or the âPayments Servicesâ) is a: (i) payment account
boarding.
(ii) payment underwriting.
and, (iii) payment data
transmission service that helps you integrate with a payment
processor (the âProcessorâ), as described more fully in this
Agreement.
The Payments Services may also apply to your use of
point-of-sale equipment (âPOS Equipmentâ), subject to
availability and to your election to procure the same.
You
hereby appoint us as your agent to deliver information and
instructions on your behalf to the Processor.
Under the separate Shopify Platform Terms of
Service (the âShopify
Platform Termsâ), Shopify Inc.
provides you with its online
storefront, shopping cart, store management, marketing, and
other services (collectively, the âShopify Platform Servicesâ).
The Shopify Platform Terms are incorporated herein by reference
and by accepting this Agreement you are also accepting them.
Neither Shopify Inc.
nor Shopify Payments (USA) Inc.
is a
bank, payment institution, or money services business, but are
instead, respectively, a supplier of the Shopify Platform
Services supplied under the Shopify Platform Terms and of the
Payments Services under this Agreement.



The Processor
The Processor is Stripe, Inc., organized under the laws of
California, which is a technical
services provider and may offer the services as an agent of one
or more financial institutions in United States (each, a âFinancial
Services Providerâ).
The processing and settlement of
Transactions (as defined below) (âPayment Processingâ) is
carried out by the Processor and any of the Financial Services
Providers under a separate Stripe Connected Account
Agreement,
including the United States Stripe Services
Agreement and the applicable
Financial Services Terms, and
to the extent you use a payment method that is subject to
additional terms, the Payment
Terms (collectively,
the âProcessor Termsâ).
By accepting this Agreement, you are
also accepting and agreeing to be bound by the Processor Terms,
which is the legal agreement between you and the Processor.
Shopify is not a party to the Processor Terms and is not liable
to you in respect thereof.
By accepting this Agreement and the
Processor Terms you are agreeing to the creation of an account
with the Processor for Payment Processing (the âProcessor
Accountâ).
We reserve the right to change the Processor, subject
to the terms of our agreement with the Processor.
In the event
of any inconsistency between this Agreement and the Processor
Terms, this Agreement shall prevail, except in the event of any
inconsistency between this Agreement and the Processor Terms
concerning Payment Processing or the Processor Account, in which
case the Processor Terms shall prevail.
The Processorâs role is to accept and process credit card, debit
card and other types of payments (collectively âCardsâ) with
respect to sales of your products and services through
internet-based transactions (âCard Not Present Transactions" or
âCNP Transactionsâ).
If applicable, POS Equipment permits
transmission of data to the Processor from in-person,
point-of-sale transactions (âCard Present Transactions" or âCP
Transactionsâ), as well as manually entered transactions (âKeyed
Transactionsâ).
CNP Transactions, CP Transactions and Keyed
Transactions shall be referred to herein, collectively, as
âTransactionsâ.



Your Role
To utilize the Services, you must be a business located in
United States.



The Payments Services
Shopify hereby grants you a
non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, limited,
revocable right to use the Payments Services (the âLicenseâ).
The License shall be for the term of this Agreement only.
Neither the License nor any other provision hereof shall grant
any rights in the Payments Services or other intellectual
property rights except the limited License of use set out above.
You shall not: (i) permit any third party to access the Payments
Services, including, but not limited to, your Shopify Admin on
our website (the âShopify Adminâ), except as permitted herein,
and to carry out Transactions.
(ii) create derivate works based
on the Payments Services.
(iii) copy, frame or mirror any part
of the content of the Payments Services, other than copying or
framing for your internal business purposes.
(iv) reverse
engineer, disassemble, decompile, or otherwise attempt to
discover the source code or trade secrets for any of the
Payments Services.
or, (v) access the Payments Services in order
to build a competitive product or service.
It is your responsibility to obtain your customersâ consent to
be billed for each Transaction or, as the case may be, on a
recurring basis, in compliance with applicable legal
requirements and Visa Europe Ltd., Visa U.S.A., Inc., Visa
Canada Inc.
and Visa International (collectively, âVisaâ),
MasterCard International Incorporated (âMasterCardâ), American
Express or other applicable Card networksâ (such networks being,
collectively, the âPayment Networksâ) payment rules (the
âPayment Network Rulesâ).



POS Equipment
If applicable, you may elect to purchase
POS Equipment from Shopify that will allow you to accept CP
Transactions and Keyed Transactions.
POS hardware may be
purchased on the Shopify hardware store located here:
www.shopify.com/pos/hardware
(the âPOS Equipment Storeâ).
POS software may be downloaded for
iOS devices from the Apple App Store under the title âShopify
POSâ or âShopifyâ.
Your use of the Shopify POS hardware and
software is subject to the applicable sections of the Shopify
Platform Terms of Service.



Payment Methods
The Payments Services support most
Payment Network Cards, including credit, debit, pre-paid, or
gift cards.
You assume sole and exclusive responsibility for the
use of the Payments Services.
You also assume sole and exclusive
responsibility for Transactions under the Processor Terms.
You
are solely responsible for verifying the identity of customers
and of the eligibility of a presented Card used to purchase your
products and services, and Shopify does not guarantee or assume
any liability for Transactions authorized and completed that may
later be reversed or charged back (see section D5 below).
You
are solely responsible for all reversed or charged back
transactions regardless of the reason for, or timing of the
reversal or chargeback.
Shopify or the Processor may add or
remove one or more types of Payment Networks or Cards, in their
sole discretion, at any time, without prior notice to you.



Customer Service
Shopify will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to provide you with customer support to help
resolve issues relating to the Payments Services.
The Processor
retains sole and exclusive responsibility for Payment Processing
of Transactions, including the settlement of funds, but Shopify
will provide reasonable assistance in liaising between you and
the Processor concerning the Payment Processing services.
You
assume sole and exclusive responsibility for providing customer
service or support to your customers for any and all issues
related to your products and services, including, but not
limited to, issues arising from the processing of Cards through
the Payments Services.



Taxes
You have sole and exclusive responsibility to
determine what, if any, taxes apply to the sale of your goods
and services and/or the payments you receive in connection with
your use of the Payments Services ("Taxes").
It is solely your
responsibility to assess, collect, report, or remit the correct
Taxes to the proper tax authority, whether in customersâ
jurisdictions, your jurisdiction or elsewhere.
We are not
obligated to, nor will we, determine whether Taxes apply, or
calculate, collect, report, or remit any Taxes to any tax
authority, arising from any Transaction.
Shopify retains the
right, but not the obligation, at its sole discretion, to
complete and file tax or related reports with tax authorities
regarding Transactions in those jurisdictions where Shopify
deems such reporting necessary.
You hereby indemnify and hold
Shopify harmless from and against any and all liability related
to Taxes and filings made by Shopify in respect thereof.
You
agree that we may send you any tax-related information
electronically.



Your Customers
If prohibited by law, you will not impose
any fee or surcharge on a customer that seeks to use an eligible
Card.
You will provide an informational slip or receipt to your
customer at the conclusion of the Transaction that includes all
information required under Payment Network Rules and applicable
law.



Security
We maintain commercially reasonable
administrative, technical and physical procedures to protect all
the personal information regarding you and your customers that
is stored in our servers from unauthorized access, accidental
loss, or modification.
Shopify cannot, however, guarantee that
unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those
measures or use such personal information for improper purposes.



Data Security
You assume full responsibility for the
security of data on your website or otherwise in your possession
or control.
You agree to comply with all applicable laws and
rules in connection with your collection, security, and
dissemination of any personal, financial, Card, or Transaction
information (collectively, âData", and as pertains to your
customers, âCardholder Dataâ).
You agree that at all times you
shall be compliant with applicable Payment Card Industry Data
Security Standards (âPCI-DSSâ) and, as applicable, the Payment
Application Data Security Standards (âPA-DSSâ).
You agree to
promptly provide Shopify with documentation evidencing your
compliance with PCI-DSS and/or PA-DSS upon request.
You also
agree that you will use only PCI-DSS and PA-DSS compliant
service providers in connection with the storage or transmission
of Card information, including a cardholderâs account number,
expiration date, and CVV2.
You must not store CVV2 data at any
time.
Information on PCI-DSS can be found on the PCI Councilâs
website.
It is your
responsibility to comply with these standards and all the
Payment Network Rules.



Audit Right
If Shopify believes that a security breach,
personal data breach, or other compromise of data may have
occurred, Shopify may require you to have a third-party auditor
that is approved by Shopify conduct a security audit of your
systems and facilities and issue a report to be provided to
Shopify and, at Shopifyâs discretion, to the Processor, its
Financial Services Provider, Payment Networks, and law
enforcement, at your sole cost and expense.



Privacy
Your privacy and the protection of your data
are very important to us.
You acknowledge that you have
received, read in full, and agree with the terms of our Privacy
Policy, our Data
Processing Addendum, and the
Processorâs Privacy Policy.
Our Privacy Policy and Data Processing Addendum are hereby
incorporated into this Agreement.
Shopifyâs Privacy Policy and
the Processorâs Privacy Policy contain important information
about the collection, use, retention, and disclosure of personal
information, as well as other important matters, and explains
how and for what purposes we and the Processor collect, use,
retain, disclose and safeguard the information you provide to
us.
You agree that Shopifyâs Privacy Policy and the Processorâs
Privacy Policy may be modified at Shopifyâs or the Processorâs
option, if necessary, and you will check each Privacy Policy on
a regular basis.
You also acknowledge that the Processor is
required to report your business name and the name of your
principals to the Member Alert to Control High-Risk merchants
list of MasterCard (âMATCH Listâ) maintained by MasterCard and
accessed and updated by American Express, to the VMAS database
upheld by Visa Europe, and/or to the Consortium Merchant
Negative File maintained by Discover, if applicable, pursuant to
the requirements of the Payment Network Rules.
Additionally, you
agree that Shopifyâs collection, use, retention, and disclosure
of personal information is subject to our Data Processing
Addendum.
We will at all times comply with the provisions of applicable
data protection law, including the EU General Data Protection
Regulation (âGDPRâ), as applicable.
If we process any of your
personal data when performing our obligations under this
Agreement, we will do so as a âdata controllerâ, as defined by
the GDPR.
If we process any Cardholder Data on your behalf, we
and you both agree that it is our intention that you shall be
the âdata controllerâ and we shall be the âdata processorâ in
relation to that data, as those terms are defined in the GDPR.
We shall process the personal data only in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and any lawful instructions reasonably
given by you to us from time to time.
Additionally, you
acknowledge that the Processor and MaxMind, a fraud detection
service, each independently serve as âdata controllersâ with
regards to any personal data that they may processes under this
Agreement and that we are not responsible for how they process
such data.
MaxMindâs Privacy Policy may be found here:
www.maxmind.com/en/privacy-policy.
We will notify you (within a reasonable time frame) if we
receive a request from a person to have access to, or to erase
that personâs personal data, a complaint or request relating to
your obligations under applicable data protection legislation,
or any other communication relating directly to the processing
of any personal data in connection with this Agreement.
You
acknowledge that such requests may be subject to independent
legal retention or confidentiality requirements, as permitted by
the GDPR.
We will provide you with reasonable co-operation and assistance
in relation to any complaint or request made in respect of any
personal data processed by us on your behalf, including by
providing you with details of the complaint or request, helping
you to comply with any data subject access requests (within the
relevant timescales set out in applicable data protection
legislation), and providing you with any personal data we hold
in relation to a person making a complaint or request (again,
within a reasonable timescale).
You acknowledge that we are relying on you for direction as to
the extent to which we are entitled to use and process the
personal data in the Cardholder Data that you provide us with.
Consequently, we will not be liable for any claim brought by a
data subject arising from any action or omission by us, to the
extent that such action or omission resulted from your
instruction.
You consent to the exchange of your information between the
account you have established through the Shopify Platform
Services and the Payments Services established under this
Agreement.
Shopify will commingle such accounts and refers to
them together in this Agreement as the âShopify Payments
Accountâ.
Where a data subject is located in the European Economic Area,
that data subjectâs personal data will be processed by Shopify
International Limited, in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
As
part of providing the Payments Services, this personal data may
be transferred to other regions, including to Canada and the
United States.
Additionally, in order to process, use, record,
and disclose your personal information, information related to
your business, and Data, we or our agents may transfer such
information to and receive it from the Processor, its Financial
Services Provider, or their respective agents and, in so doing,
we may transmit or possess it outside of your jurisdiction.
Additionally, in order to provide the Payments Services, we use
a variety of third party âsub-processorsâ that fall into many
broad categoriesâfor example, we use sub-processors to help us:
(i) protect you and Shopify from potentially risky transactions,
security threats, or fraud.
(ii) perform administrative tasks.
(iii) deliver portions of the Payments Services (e.g., third
parties that work with us to actually process credit card
payments or conduct any shipping).
(iv) develop and improve our
products and the Payments Services.
(v) generate analytics or
other information relating to the Payments Services.
and, (vi)
build our technical infrastructure (e.g., using cloud storage
providers or information security vendors).
By using the
Payments Services, you consent to our use of sub-processors,
which is described in more detail in our Privacy
Policy.



Privacy of Others
You represent to us that you are in
compliance with all applicable privacy laws and that you
maintain a publicly accessible privacy policy that accurately
discloses how you collect, use, and disclose personal data,
including through the Payments Services.
Additionally, you
represent to us that you have obtained all necessary rights and
consents under applicable law to allow us and the Processor to
collect, use, retain, and disclose any Cardholder Data that you
provide to, or authorize us to collect, including information
that we may collect directly from you of your customers via
cookies or other means and to use that data to provide the
Payments Services (e.g., to process Transactions and to screen
for fraud or compliance purposes).
Further, you represent that we will not be in breach of any such
laws by collecting, receiving, using, and disclosing such
information in connection with the Payments Services as
described in our Privacy
Policy.
As between the
parties to this Agreement, you are solely responsible for
disclosing to your customers that we will collect and process
their Cardholder Data in our supply of the Payments Services to
you, and that in so doing we may transmit or possess it outside
of your or their jurisdiction, and that it may be subject to
disclosure as required by applicable law.
If you receive information about others, including cardholders
and other customers, through the use of the Payments Services,
you must keep such information confidential and only use it in
connection with the Payments Services or as otherwise permitted
by the subject of such information.
You may not disclose or distribute any such information to a
third party or use any such information for marketing purposes
unless you receive the express consent of the subject thereof to
do so.
You may not disclose Cardholder Data to any third party
other than in connection with processing a Transaction requested
by your customer.



Restricted Use
You are required to obey all laws,
rules, and regulations applicable to your use of the Payments
Services (e.g., including those governing financial services,
consumer protections, unfair competition, anti-discrimination,
or false advertising).
In addition to any other requirements or
restrictions set forth in this Agreement, you shall not: (i)
utilize the credit available on any Card to provide cash
advances to cardholders.

processing that does not arise from your sale of goods or
service to a customer.

aggregator or otherwise resell the Payments Services on behalf
of any third party.

fraudulent authorizations or fraudulent Transactions.

a manner that a Payment Network reasonably believes to be an
abuse of the Payment Network or a violation of the Payment
Network Rules.
You further agree not to permit any third party to do any of the
following: (i) access or attempt to access our systems,
programs, or data that are not made available for public use.
(ii) copy, reproduce, republish, upload, post, transmit, resell,
or distribute, in any way, material from us.
(iii) permit any
third party to use and benefit from the Payments Services via a
rental, lease, timesharing, service bureau, or other
arrangement.
(iv) transfer any rights granted to you under this
Agreement.
(v) work around any of the technical limitations of
the Payments Services, use any tool to enable features or
functionalities that are otherwise disabled in the Payments
Services, or decompile, disassemble, or otherwise reverse
engineer the Payments Services, except to the extent that such
restriction is expressly prohibited by law.
(vi) perform or
attempt to perform any actions that would interfere with the
proper working of the Payments Services, prevent access to or
use of the Payments Services by our other users, or impose an
unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our
infrastructure.
or, (vii) otherwise use the Payments Services
except as expressly allowed under this section.



Suspicion of Unauthorized or Illegal Use
We reserve the
right to not provide the Payments Services in respect of any
Transaction you submit that we believe, in our sole discretion,
is in violation of this Agreement, any other Shopify or
Processor agreement, or exposes you, Shopify, the Processor, or
any other third party to actual or potential risk or harm,
including, but not limited to, fraud and other criminal acts.
You are hereby granting us authorization to share information
with law enforcement about you, your Transactions, or your
Shopify Payments Account.



Payment Network Rules
The Payment Networks have
established guidelines, bylaws, rules, and regulations in the
form of the Payment Network Rules.
You are required to comply
with all applicable Payment Network Rules.
The Payment Network
Rules for Visa, MasterCard and American Express are available on
the Internet at the following links:
Visa,
MasterCard
and American
Express.
The Payment Networks may amend the Payment Network Rules at any
time and without notice to us or to you.
Insofar as the terms of
this Agreement and/or the Processor Terms are inconsistent with
the Payment Network Rules, the Payment Network Rules shall
prevail.
We reserve the right to amend this Agreement at any
time, with notice to you, as may be necessary to comply with the
Payment Network Rules.

provide disclosures and notices, including tax forms, that we
deem appropriate regarding the Payments Services to you by
posting such disclosures and notices in your Shopify Admin,
emailing them to the email address listed in your Shopify
Account, or mailing them to the address listed in your Shopify
Account.
You also agree that electronic disclosures and notices
have the same meaning and effect as if we had provided you with
a paper copy.

to be received by you within twenty-four (24) hours of the time
it is posted to your Shopify Admin or emailed to you, unless we
receive notice that the email was not delivered.

The telephone
messages may be played by a machine automatically when the
telephone is answered, whether answered by you or another party.

voicemail.
You give us permission to call or send a text message
to any telephone number that you have given us and to play
pre-recorded messages or send text messages with information
about this Agreement or your account over the phone.
You agree
that we will not be liable to you for any such calls or
electronic communications even if information is communicated to
an unintended recipient.
You understand that when you receive
such calls or electronic communications you may incur a charge
from the company that provides you with telecommunications,
wireless and/or Internet services.
You agree that we have no
liability for such charges.
You agree to immediately notify us
if you change telephone numbers or are otherwise no longer the
subscriber or customary user of a telephone number or email
address you have previously provided to us.

 C.
Processing Card Transactions and Receiving Your Funds 


Shopify Payments Fees
You agree to pay the fees for
processing that are set out in your Shopify Admin, which are
incorporated herein by reference (the "Processing Fees").
Processing Fees shall be collected from you by the Processor on
our behalf in accordance with the terms of the Stripe Connected
Account
Agreement.
If applicable, fees for POS Equipment are posted here:
www.shopify.com/pos/hardware
and here:
www.shopify.com/pricing (the
âPOS Equipment Feesâ).
At our discretion, POS Equipment Fees
will be collected on our behalf by the Processor pursuant to the
Processor Terms or by such other means as we may prescribe from
time to time.
Fees for Shopify Platform Services are collected by Shopify
pursuant to the Shopify Platform Terms of
Service (the "Shopify
Platform Services Fees").
Processing Fees, Equipment Fees, and
Shopify Platform Services Fees shall be referred to herein
collectively as the "Fees".
You are obligated to pay all applicable taxes, fees and other
charges imposed by any governmental authority, including,
without limitation, any value added tax, goods and services tax,
harmonized sales tax and/or provincial or territorial sales tax,
on the Payments Services provided under this Agreement.
If you
are tax-exempt, you will provide us with an appropriate
certificate or other evidence of tax exemption that is
satisfactory to us.
We reserve the right to change the Fees at any time, subject to
a thirty (30) day notice period to you in accordance with
Section A18.
If you continue to use the Payments Services and
the Processor Services for such thirty (30) days, then you are
deemed to have accepted the change in Fees contemplated by such
notice.
In addition to the Fees, you are also responsible for any
penalties and fines imposed on you or on us by any bank, money
services business, payment network, financial institution, or
other financial intermediary resulting from your use of the
Payments Services in a manner not permitted by this Agreement or
by such financial intermediaryâs rules and regulations.



Security Interest
As security for performance of your
obligations under this Agreement, you grant us a first priority
lien and security interest on all funds processed and deposited
into all Payout Accounts (as defined in the Processor Terms),
and any other bank accounts associated with your Shopify
Payments Account, and in any funds processed using the Payment
Processing services.
These security interests and liens will
secure payment and performance of all of your obligations under
this Agreement and any other agreements now existing or later
entered into between us and you, including, without limitation,
your obligation to pay any amounts due and owing to us.
You will
execute, deliver and pay the fees for any documents we request
to create, perfect, maintain, and enforce this security
interest.



Our Collection Rights
To the extent permitted by law, we
may collect any obligations you owe us under this Agreement by
requesting that the Processor deduct the corresponding amounts
from the Reserve Account (as that term is defined below) or from
funds payable to you arising from the settlement of
Transactions.
Fees will be assessed at the time a Transaction is
processed and will be first deducted from the funds received for
such Transaction.
If these amounts are not sufficient to meet
your obligations to us, we may charge the payment method
associated with your Shopify Payments Account for any amounts
owed to us.
Your failure to fully pay amounts that you owe us on
demand will be a breach of this Agreement.
You will be liable
for our costs associated with collection in addition to the
amount owed, including, without limitation, attorneysâ fees and
expenses, costs of any arbitration or court proceeding,
collection agency fees, and any applicable interest.
Additionally, we may require a personal guarantee from a
principal of a business for funds owed under this Agreement.
If
we require a personal guarantee we will specifically inform you
in advance.
In addition to the amount due, delinquent accounts may be
charged with fees that are incidental to the collection of
delinquent accounts and chargebacks, including, but not limited
to, collection fees and convenience fees and other third-party
charges.
You hereby explicitly agree that all communication in relation
to delinquent accounts will be made by electronic mail or by
phone, as provided to Shopify by you.
Such communication may be
made by Shopify or by anyone on its behalf, including, but not
limited to, a third-party collection agent.



Reserves
Funds held in reserves are amounts of money set
aside to cover chargebacks, refunds, or other payment
obligations under this Agreement (the "Reserve Account").
We, in
our discretion, will set the terms of your Reserve Account and
notify you of such terms, which may require that a certain
amount (including the full amount) of the funds received for a
Transaction are held for a period of time, or that additional
amounts are held in the Reserve Account.
We, in our discretion,
may elect to change the terms of the Reserve Account at any
time, for any reason, based on your payment processing history
or as requested by our payment processors.
We may require you to fund the Reserve Account by means of: (i)
any funds payouts made or due to you for Transactions submitted
to the Payments Services.
or, (ii) amounts available in your
bank account by means of ACH debit to your Shopify Payments
Account.
or, (iv) other sources of funds associated with your
Shopify Payments Account.
or, (iv) requesting that you provide
funds to us for deposit to the Reserve Account.
You agree that: (i) you are not entitled to any interest or
other compensation associated with the funds held in the Reserve
Account.
(ii) you have no right to direct that account.
(iii)
you have no legal interest in those funds or that account.
and,
(iv) you may not assign any interest in those funds or that
account.



Contesting Chargebacks
You or Shopify may elect to
contest chargebacks assessed to your account.
Shopify may
provide you with assistance, including notifications and
software to help contest your chargebacks.
We do not assume any
liability for our role or assistance in contesting chargebacks.
You grant us permission to share records or other information
required with the cardholder, the cardholderâs financial
institution, and your financial institution to help resolve any
chargeback.
You acknowledge that your failure to provide us with
complete and accurate information in a timely manner may result
in an irreversible chargeback being assessed.
If the cardholderâs issuing bank or the Payment Network does not
resolve a dispute in your favor, we may recover the chargeback
amount and any associated fees from you as described in this
Agreement.
We reserve the right, upon notice to you, to charge a fee for
mediating or investigating chargeback disputes.

without limitation, significant credit or fraud risk, or for any
other reason.

funds in the Financial Services Providerâs custody will be paid
out to you subject to the terms of your Payout Schedule (as

hold any funds deemed necessary, pending resolution of any other
terms or obligations defined in this Agreement, including, but
not limited to, chargebacks, fees, refunds, or other
investigations or proceedings.
