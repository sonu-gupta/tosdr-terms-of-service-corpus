Purpose:

Obeo S.A.S.

The Obeo trademarks and logos are a symbol of the quality of the products and services provided by the company.
To ensure that they continue to serve these functions, we need to keep some element of control over their use, especially, we want to ensure that their use is not made in a disparaging manner or to be rude about the Obeo technology, the Obeo company, its products, or its staff.

Property and identification of Obeo trademarks and logos:

The âObeoâ name and logo, and the others products names and logos are the intellectual property of Obeo S.A.S.
and should be identified as such, by including a statement attributing the trademarks to Obeo S.A.S.

By "namespace" we mean an abstract place to group a set of computer programs in a logical manner, in order to build modular programs.
