PLEASE READ CAREFULLY THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN THIS SECTION (âARBITRATION AGREEMENTâ).&nbsp.
IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE MOST DISPUTES WITH US AND MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. &nbsp.



YOU AND WE AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY, OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF, OR RELATING TO, THE TERMS AND/OR YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE SITES OR APPS, ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES SOLD OR DISTRIBUTED BY OR THROUGH THE SITES OR APPS, OR CONTENT (A "DISPUTE" AS DEFINED BELOW) SHALL BE RESOLVED ONLY BY: (A) FINAL AND BINDING, BILATERAL ARBITRATION, subject to the limited exceptions below.
OR (B) IN A SMALL CLAIMS COURT ON INDIVIDUAL BASIS, if your claims qualify.



Disputes


Except for matters that are specifically and expressly excluded herein, this binding agreement to arbitrate covers any and all disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands, or proceedings between you and any of us (individually, a âDisputeâ).&nbsp.
Disputes shall include, but are not limited to, any claims or controversies between you and us (or any of us) in any way relating to or arising out of in any way the Services and/or any other subject matter covered by or relating to these Terms, including but not limited to sales, returns, refunds, cancellations, defects, policies, privacy, advertising, or any communications between you and us (or any of us), even if the claim arises after you or we have terminated use of Services.&nbsp.

(b) we bring against you.
(c) in any way relate to or arise out of any aspect of the relationship between you and us (or any of us), whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, advertising claims, or any other legal theory.

(e) are subject to ongoing litigation where you are not a party or a class member.
and/or (f) arise after the termination of these Terms.&nbsp.
Excluded from the definition of Disputes is any claim where either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property.


Binding Arbitration Process and Procedure

If we cannot resolve a Dispute informally, any Dispute will be resolved only by binding, bilateral arbitration before one or more neutral arbitrators in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement.
You understand that by this Arbitration Agreement, you are giving up the right to a jury trial and to have your dispute resolved in court.
Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Arbitration Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope, applicability, or enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement, shall be determined by arbitration.
Unless you and we otherwise agree, the arbitration shall be conducted via telephone, videoconference, or within the county in which you reside.
You have the right to an in-person hearing in your hometown area. 
Any arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement will take place on an individual basis.
class arbitrations, class actions, and representative actions are not permitted.
There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.&nbsp.
An arbitrator, however, can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief, or statutory damages), and must follow these Terms as a court would.
You and we agree that each party will provide written notice to the other party at least thirty (30) days prior to initiating an arbitration or small claims court proceeding, so that the parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute informally.
Notice to us shall be sent to us (or any of us) by certified mail or courier to:



Foot Locker, Inc.330 West 34th StreetNew York, New York 10001Attention: General Counsel
Such notice must include (a) your name, postal address, telephone number, the email address you use or used in connection with your prior interactions with us and, if different, an email address at which you can be contacted, (b) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (c) the specific relief that you are seeking.&nbsp.
Our notice to you will be sent electronically and/or to the most-recent address we have in our records for you.
it is your responsibility to keep your address up to date.&nbsp.
If you and us cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date notice is received by the applicable party, then either you or us may, as appropriate and in accordance with these Terms, commence an arbitration proceeding or, to the extent specifically provided for above, file a claim in court.

The arbitration shall be administered by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc.
(âJAMSâ) pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and, where applicable, the JAMS Consumer Arbitration Minimum Standards for consumers.
The JAMS rule are available at jamsadr.com.&nbsp.
Unless the parties otherwise agree, the arbitration shall be conducted before a single arbitrator.
Both you and we shall have a reasonable opportunity to participate in the process of choosing the arbitrator.&nbsp.
All arbitrators shall serve as neutral, independent and impartial arbitrators.
The cost of arbitration shall be borne by the parties in accordance with the applicable JAMS Rules.&nbsp.
With the exception of the portion of the JAMS fee to initiate a claim required to be paid by consumers that initiate an arbitration (currently $250 and designed to be approximately equivalent to current Court filing fees), and any counsel that you elect to retain, you will not be responsible for any costs associated with the JAMS proceeding.&nbsp.
If you elect to be represented by counsel, you are responsible for any costs and fees associated with that counsel.
 To the extent permitted by law, an arbitrator may award costs and/or fees if the arbitrator finds the partyâs claims, defenses, or other fee-generating activity to be frivolous or asserted or conducted for an improper purpose.

The parties are entitled to seek recovery of costs and attorneyâs fees to the same extent they would be entitled to seek such recovery for the same claim in court under controlling law.
The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which any award (or decision not to render an award) is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.
The arbitrator shall follow the applicable law.
This Arbitration Agreement shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.
Judgment on an arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
For any Dispute where either the amount alleged to be in controversy at the outset of the Dispute, or the amount recovered by either party in arbitration, exceeds $100,000 or involves a request for public injunctive relief, the Dispute shall be subject to JAMS Optional Appeal Overview.
The decision in such an action shall be required to be in the form of a reasoned, written decision and the appeal will be heard by a panel of three JAMS neutrals from the appellate panel.   
The parties shall maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding and the award, including the hearing, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, a judicial challenge to an award or its enforcement, or unless otherwise required by law or judicial decision.



Waiver Of Class Or Consolidated Actions

You and we agree to resolve any dispute in an individual capacity, and not on behalf of, or as part of, any purported class, consolidated, or representative proceeding.
You and we further agree to not participate in any consolidated, class, or representative proceeding (existing or future) brought by any third party arising out of or relating to any dispute with a third party.
The arbitrator cannot combine more than one personâs or entityâs claims into a single case, and cannot preside over any consolidated, class or representative proceeding (unless we agree otherwise).
This Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions Section (the âClass Action Waiverâ) shall survive any termination of the Services and/or these Terms.


If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
If, however, the Class Action Waiver set forth in section 20.2 hereof is deemed void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the Arbitration Agreement shall be deemed null and void in its entirety.

Right to Reject Arbitration. You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration by sending a timely written notice of your decision to opt out, within thirty (30) days of the date you first become subject to this Arbitration Agreement.
If you want to opt out, your notice must be sent in writing to:

Foot Locker, Inc.330 West 34th StreetNew York, New York 10001Attention: General Counsel
The opt-out notice must include your full name and email address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration.&nbsp.
If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of the Terms will continue to apply to you.
Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have with us (or any of us), or may enter into in the future with us (or any of us).


GOVERNING LAW


These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of New York, U.S.A., without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law, and expressly not by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sales of Goods.
The parties acknowledge that this agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce.
Notwithstanding the provision in the preceding paragraph with respect to applicable substantive law, the Arbitration Agreement set forth in Section 20 hereof, and any arbitration conducted pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement, shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C., Â§ 1, et seq.

As set forth in Section 20 above, most disputes between us will be resolved by mandatory, bilateral arbitration.&nbsp.
With the exception of individual small claims actions, any dispute between you and us that is related to these Terms and/or the Services that is not required to be arbitrated under the Arbitration Agreement shall be resolved exclusively by the state and federal courts of the State of New York. 
If any provision set forth in Sections 2 to 20 of these Terms shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that provision shall be deemed severable from these terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
 Foot Locker's failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right.
This is the entire agreement between us relating to the subject matter herein and shall not be modified except as described herein.
