You do not need to provide any personal information if you simply want to browse the public section of our website and learn about what we have to offer.
When we ask for your personal information, it is so that we can provide a service to you and to communicate with you about our products and services.
For example, if you want to register as a customer of Gordon Food Service, we will ask for your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address, and we will provide that information to someone in our customer relations department who will follow up with you about our products and services.
When you visit the website, we may record information that your web browser routinely shares with websites.
