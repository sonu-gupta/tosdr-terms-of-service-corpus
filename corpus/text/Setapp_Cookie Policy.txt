Cookies contain information that can later be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
Some of the cookies will only be used if you use certain features or select certain preferences, and some cookies are essential to the Site, Software, and/or Services, and will always be used.

Each cookie used by Setapp falls within one of the following categories: 
 Essential cookies Essential cookies (First-Party Cookies) are sometimes called âstrictly necessary,â as without them we cannot provide many services that you need.
