Opening an Account

We offer one type of account: personal account

All Anokhi accounts let you do things like:

Send and receive money/points
Redeem points for merchandise
Transfer money/points to charity or to your bank account

You are responsible for maintaining adequate security and control of any and all IDs, passwords, personal identification numbers, or any other codes that you use to access your Anokhi account and the Anokhi services.
You must keep your mailing address, email address and other contact information current in your Anokhi account profile.

Closing Your Anokhi Account

You may close your account and terminate your relationship with us at any time without cost, but you will remain liable for all obligations related to your Anokhi account even after the Anokhi account is closed.
When you close your Anokhi account, we will cancel any scheduled or incomplete transactions.
You must withdraw or transfer any Anokhi balance from your Anokhi account before closing it.
If you have not provided the required identifying information to us, or if we are unable to verify the required identifying information you provide, you must transfer any Anokhi balance to a linked bank account or debit card.
You cannot withdraw or transfer digital gift certificates/cards that are purchased through Anokhiâs marketplace and linked to your Anokhi account as payment methods.
However, even without your Anokhi account, you can still use the codes you received by email when you purchased the gift certificates/cards to make purchases.
In certain cases, you may not close your Anokhi account, including:

To evade an investigation.
If you have a pending transaction or an open dispute or claim.


If your Anokhi account has a negative balance.
If your Anokhi account is subject to a hold, limitation or reserve.


Link or Unlink a Payment Method

You can link or unlink a U.S.
bank account or Anokhi Credit to your Anokhi account as a payment method.
Please keep your payment method information current.&nbsp.
If this information changes, we may update it using information and third party sources available to us without any action on your part.&nbsp.
If you do not want us to update your information, you may contact your issuer to request this or remove your payment method from your Anokhi account.
If we update your payment method, we will keep any preference setting attached to such payment method.
You may choose to confirm your account, so that we can verify that the account is valid and that you are the owner.&nbsp.
To do this, we will charge you $1.95.&nbsp.
After the account is confirmed, we will immediately refund this amount to the account.


Holding a Anokhi Balance

Money/points that you receive from other Anokhi buyers is held as a balance in your Anokhi account.
The balance functionality in your Anokhi account will differ depending on whether we have been able to verify the required identifying information that you provide to us.
The required identifying information is: name, physical address, date of birth and taxpayer identification number.

If we have not verified the required identifying information, a balance in your Anokhi account can generally only be held in your Anokhi account and transferred to a linked bank account or debit card. 

Any Anokhi balance you hold represents an unsecured claim against Anokhi and, except as provided below, is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).
Anokhi combines your Anokhi balance with the Anokhi balances of other Anokhi users and invests those funds in liquid investments in accordance with state money transmitter laws.
Anokhi owns the interest or other earnings on these investments.
However, the claim against Anokhi represented by your Anokhi balance is not secured by these investments and you do not have any ownership interest (either legal or beneficial) in these investments.
These pooled amounts are held apart from Anokhiâs corporate funds, and Anokhi will neither use these funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes nor will it voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy.


Managing Your Money in Multiple Currencies



Holding a Anokhi balance in a currency other than U.S.
dollars

Your Anokhi balance may be held in any of the currencies supported by Anokhi, and you may hold a balance in more than one of these currencies at the same time.
If we have not verified the required identifying information that you provide to us, you can only access balance that is in a currency other than U.S.
dollars by transferring the balance to a linked bank account or to an eligible debit card and such a transfer will require a currency conversion (with payment of the applicable currency conversion spread) as discussed below.
You are responsible for all risks associated with maintaining a Anokhi balance in multiple currencies.&nbsp.
You may not manage multiple currencies for speculative trading purposes.

Currency conversion

Some uses of your Anokhi account require a currency conversion.&nbsp.
Some examples of situations where a currency conversion is required include:

Purchasing goods from a seller who accepts payments only in a specific currency which you do not hold in your Anokhi account.
Sending money to a bank account in a currency that you do not hold at the time of the transaction.
Receiving money either from a buyer in a currency that your Anokhi account is not configured to accept.
Converting your Anokhi balance from one currency to another, not in connection with any transaction.
Withdrawing funds from your Anokhi balance held in a currency other than U.S.
dollars to the bank account linked to your Anokhi account.
If you sold something and the transaction must be refunded or reversed, and you do not have the correct currency available in your Anokhi balance at the time of the refund or reversal.


How we convert currency

If Anokhi converts currency, it will be completed at the transaction exchange rate we set for the relevant currency exchange.
The transaction exchange rate is adjusted regularly and includes a currency conversion spread (described below) applied and retained by us on a base exchange rate to form the rate applicable to your conversion.
The base exchange rate is based on rates within the wholesale currency markets on the conversion day or the prior Business Day.
or, if required by law or regulation, set at the relevant government reference rate(s).
For purchase and send money transactions described above that involve a currency conversion, the currency conversion spread is 3.0%.
For all other transactions involving a currency conversion, the currency conversion spread is 2.5%.
When you purchase goods from a merchant who accepts payment only in a specific currency that you do not hold in your Anokhi balance, the currency conversion will occur at the time your transaction is processed and the transaction exchange rate in effect at the time the transaction is processed will be used for this currency conversion.


Currency conversion choices

When your payment is funded by a debit or credit card and requires a currency conversion, you consent to and authorize Anokhi to convert the currency in place of your debit or credit card issuer.&nbsp.
You have the right to have your card issuer perform the currency conversion and can choose this option during checkout on your transaction review page before you complete the transaction.
 If your card issuer converts the currency, youâll be charged a rate set by them (shown on your statement), and youâll be subject to any fees and terms set by them related to the conversion.
Anokhi will always perform the conversion for transactions where your Anokhi balance or linked bank account is the payment method.


Account Statements and Requesting Account Records

You have the right to receive an account statement showing your Anokhi account activity.
You may view your Anokhi account statement by logging into your Anokhi account.
In the event you request that we send you hard-copy records related to your Anokhi account, we may charge you a fee of $10.00 per item requested but we wonât charge you for records requested in connection with your good-faith assertion of an error in your Anokhi account.
