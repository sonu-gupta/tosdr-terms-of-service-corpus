  RESPECTING YOUR PRIVACY We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.
This Policy sets out the basis on which any personal data that we collect from you or that you provide to us will be processed on our website.
We keep certain basic information when you visit our website and recognize the importance of keeping that information secure and letting you know what we will do with it.
You may choose to provide us with information that is considered personal data.
The term âpersonal dataâ as used in this Policy refers to information such as your name, e-mail address, mailing address, telephone number, or any other data that can be used to identify you.
You are not required to provide any personal information to browse the public areas of this website.
The term âwebsiteâ includes this website and our associated sites, such as apps.jw.org, ba.jw.org, stream.jw.org, and wol.jw.org.  DATA CONTROLLER INFORMATION This website is owned by Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc.
(âWatchtowerâ), a New York not-for-profit corporation that supports the activities of Jehovahâs Witnesses and their Bible education.
If you voluntarily decide to open an account, make a donation, request a visit, or otherwise take any action that involves providing personal data, you consent to this Policy, as well as to the storage of your data on servers located in the United States of America and to the collection, processing, transfer, and storage of your personal data by Watchtower and cooperating organizations that support Jehovahâs Witnesses in various countries as needed to process your requested action.
The religious organization operates globally through various local entities.
For data protection purposes, these may include local congregations, branch offices, and other similar cooperating organizations of Jehovahâs Witnesses.
The data controller for your personal data varies depending on the nature of your interaction with the website.
For example, if you donate to a legal entity in a particular country, your name and contact information will be provided to that legal entity as identified to you during the donation process.
As another example, if you request a visit, your name and contact information will be provided to a local branch office and congregation of Jehovahâs Witnesses to fulfill your request.
To assist you, if the country you reside in has applicable data protection laws, you may find the contact information for the country you reside in on the Data Protection Contacts page.  DATA SECURITY AND CONFIDENTIALITY We take the security and confidentiality of your personal data very seriously.
We use up-to-date data storage and security techniques to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, improper use or disclosure, unauthorized modification, unlawful destruction, or accidental loss.
All processors of personal data and any third parties we engage to process your personal information are obligated to respect the confidentiality of your information.
We keep your personal data for only as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or to comply with any applicable legal reporting or document retention requirements.
We protect your personal data during transit using encryption protocols such as Transport Layer Security (TLS).
We use computer systems with limited-access protocols, housed in facilities using physical, electronic, and procedural security measures to protect the confidentiality and security of information transmitted to us.
