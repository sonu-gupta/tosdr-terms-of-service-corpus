The laws of each State are different.
The Site contains information about general or common rules that apply in some states.
The Site also contains information about verdicts or settlements in past cases.
You cannot assume that the same rules apply, or that the same result would occur, in your state or any particular state.
The Statute of Limitations is especially important.
Every state has laws called the âstatute of limitationsâ which set a deadline to file a lawsuit.
That means that a lawsuit filed too late may be thrown out, regardless of the defendantâs fault or the severity of the injuries.
Some states have a two-year period for negligence injury claims.
the time period in other states may be longer or shorter.
Insurance policies, particularly homeowners insurance, may require that suit be filed within one year of a loss.
Some states allow claims against government agencies, but require a written notice very soon after the accident, perhaps within three months.
Because investigation and research is needed to identify all possible defendants and theories of recovery, if you have an accident or injury, you should consult a lawyer as soon as possible.MM ClientsOnly individuals who have entered into a mutually signed retainer agreement with MM are MM clients (âMM Clientsâ).
