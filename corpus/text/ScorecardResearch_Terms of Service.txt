If they do not reach a satisfactory solution within a period of sixty (60) days, then, upon notice by any party to the other(s), any unresolved controversy or claim shall be settled by arbitration administered by the International Centre for Dispute Resolution (âICDRâ) (www.icdr.org) in accordance with the provisions of its International Arbitration Rules.
The place of arbitration shall be in New York City, New York, U.S.A.

The testimony, evidence, ruling and all documentation regarding any arbitration shall be considered confidential information.
Neither party may use, disclose, or divulge any such information unless otherwise required by law.

Class Action Waiver: To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no arbitration under these Terms of Service shall be joined to an arbitration involving any other party subject to these Terms of Service, whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise.

In any dispute, NEITHER YOU NOR WE WILL BE ENTITLED TO JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS BY OR AGAINST ANOTHER PARTY IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION OR OTHERWISE PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLAIM AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS MEMBER OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY.
The arbitral tribunal may not consolidate more than one (1) personâs claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

Exclusions
Some jurisdictions, such as the State of New Jersey, do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages.
Accordingly, in certain jurisdictions, some of the above provisions may not apply to you.
all other provisions of these Terms of Service remain in full force and effect.

We may assign our rights and duties under these Terms of Service to any party at any time without notice to you and without your express consent.
You will not assign any of your rights or delegate any of your obligations under these Terms of Service without our prior written consent.
Any purported assignment or delegation in violation of this Section is null and void.
No assignment or delegation relieves you of any of your obligations under these Terms of Service.
If any provision of these Terms of Service shall be held unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms of Service and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
These Terms of Service, together with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between the parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersedes in their entirety any and all written or oral agreements previously existing between the parties with respect to such subject matter.
Some people who endorse our services may receive consideration for their endorsement.
