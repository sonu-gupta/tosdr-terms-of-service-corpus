Vodafone Group Plc is registered with the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), registration number Z8088474.Privacy PolicyCookie PolicyPersonal information we collect about you
Information we collect about you
The types of information we collect about you when you visit and interact with this site are:




Your contact details such as name and email address where you have contacted us through this site.
or






If you have agreed to cookies, data such as your site preferences or language settings.
We can also use this information in an aggregate manner to understand how our visitors navigate this site so we can make it better.




When we collect your personal information
We collect your personal information when you:




Browse and interact with the vodafone.com website.
or






Use our contact forms to get in touch or register your interest.




Vodafone will process your personal data based on:
1. Our legitimate business interests, for example, direct marketing and improvement of our services.
Whenever we rely on this lawful basis to process your data, we assess our business interests to make sure they do not override your rights.
Additionally, in some cases you have the right to object to this processing.
For more information, visit the Your Rights section of this policy.
2. Consent you provide where Vodafone does not rely on another legal basis.
Consent will always be presented separately to you, can be withdrawn at any time and you will be given details on how to change your mind.
How we use your personal information
Maintaining this website and providing you with any services requested through it
For example, when you contact us through this site, weâll use your information to ensure you get the right information and response.
To personalise this website and track its performance
Because of the way this website operates, we may also use information from your browser or browsing activities to personalize the site or route you to relevant information.
For example, we may use web-log information, cookies or web beacons in ways that help us maintain some of your site preferences, send you to the right country-specific information or understand how our visitors navigate the site so we can make it better.
You can choose whether or not to allow cookies or web beacons using your browser preferences.
To find out more about cookies and your choices, visit the Cookies section of this statement.
How we share your personal information
Some of the services or information you can request on this site may come from other members of our corporate family.
Therefore, we may share your information with other companies within Vodafone Group (for example, your local carrier).
The laws of the countries where these companies are based may not be the same as those in the EU, but your information will be treated with the same high standard of care wherever itâs processed within the corporate family.
International data transfer
We may need to transfer your information to other Vodafone Group companies (for example, if the information you request is delivered by them) or service providers in countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA).
The EEA consists of countries in the European Union, Switzerland, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway: they are considered to have equivalent laws when it comes to data protection and privacy.&nbsp.
This kind of data transfer may happen if our servers (i.e.
where we store data) or our suppliers and service providers are based outside the EEA, or if you use our services and products while visiting countries outside this area.
If Vodafone sends your information to a country that is not in the EEA, we will make sure that your information is properly protected.
We will always ensure that there is a proper legal agreement that covers the data transfer.
In addition, if the country is not considered to have laws that are equivalent to EU data protection standards then we will ask the third party to enter into a legal agreement that reflects those standards.
How long we keep your personal information for
Weâll store your information for as long as we have to by law.
If thereâs no legal requirement for us to retain the data, weâll only store it for as long as we need to.
Keeping your personal information secure
We have specialised security teams who constantly review and improve our measures to protect your personal information from unauthorised access, accidental loss, disclosure or destruction.
Communications over the internet (such as emails) arenât secure unless theyâve been encrypted.
Your communications may go through a number of countries before being delivered, as this is the nature of the internet.
We cannot accept responsibility for any unauthorised access or loss of personal information that is beyond our control.
Weâll never ask for your secure personal or account information by an unsolicited means of communication.
Youâre responsible for keeping your personal and account information secure and not sharing it with others.
Our website may provide links to third-party websites.
We cannot be responsible for the security and content of such third-party websites.
So make sure you read that companyâs privacy and cookies policies before using or putting your personal information on their site.
The same applies to any third-party websites or content you connect to using our products and services.
You may choose to disclose your information in certain ways such as social plug-ins (including those offered by Google, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest) or using third-party services that allow you to post reviews or other information publicly, and a third party could use that information.
Social plug-ins and social applications are operated by the social network themselves and are subject to their own terms of use and privacy and cookies policies.
You should make sure youâre familiar with these.
