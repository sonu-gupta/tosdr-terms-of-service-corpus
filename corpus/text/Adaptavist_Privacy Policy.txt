12	Product Data
There are various forms of data that are generated and collected from your use of products.
Reasonable efforts are made to encrypt or encode Personal Data data where we know it is present in Product Data.
Broadly, the data generated and collected from your use of products can be categorised as follows:
12.1	Data Types: In-Product Analytics
We analyse behaviour patterns in order to develop product improvements.
Such data is exclusively used in order to improve our Services.
Adaptavist may capture information such as the page that is viewed, the referrer, or the actions actions performed (such as a clicked button).
Note that:
â¢	IP addresses may be supplied and in some cases can be resolved to a person, which would render them Personal Data.
â¢	In some cases, we track the software instance that data comes from.
In the Atlassian context, this ties to a SEN number.
â¢	You can also set your firewall to disallow (block) this traffic.12 Product DataThere are various forms of data that are generated and collected from your use of products.

â¢	You can also set your firewall to disallow (block) this traffic.
12.2	Data Types: Diagnostic Data ( Error Logs data )
Our Cloud Apps track errors of our Cloud Apps' resources executed in the end users' browsers in real-time.
This includes for example AddOnKey, ClientKey, BaseUrl, anonymised TrackingID, error messages and information about the environment such as browser type, browser version and operating system.
It is exclusively used in order to improve our service.
Errors from JavaScript in our cloud applications are sent to Sentry to alert Adaptavist support.
The data sent to Sentry includes organisational data but no individual data.
Sentry is running in browser and will diagnose issues.
IP address is included, and this in theory can be traced to an individual user (and hence may be considered Personal Data).
In addition, by seeking product support, you may provide log and other information, voluntarily, to our Support staff for analysis and review.
It is possible that this can contain Personal Data depending on how you use and configure your products and systems.
Application logs may be sent to sub-processors or stored.
12.2.1	Log and supplied information
This is information given voluntarily by client to our support staff by a client.
In theory, this could contain Personal Data embedded within user generated content.
This depends on the client manages Personal Data.
Some of this data may be processed and stored on Adaptavist's AWS based servers.

12.2.2	General Diagnostics
This includes error detection and alerting data.
Sentry is running in browser and will diagnose issues.
IP address is included, and this can at times be resolved to an individual, which means it can be Personal Data.

This information is sent to Sentry for processing and storage.
Depending on configuration, information may also be sent to Slack as there is a slack add-on for notifications.

12.2.3	Aggregated Diagnostics and Session Data
This includes data from each customer's use of products which, such as for example usage statistics of product functionality such as the total number of product functions used per day.
This data is anonymised.
Therefore, we cannot identify the end user this data relates to.

Datadog is used for monitoring Synthesized values and metrics such as those outlined above, or CPU usage and requests per second.
12.2.4	Metrics
Application metrics are sent to Datadog for analysis and reporting in order for us to monitor the applications performance.
This will include anonymised organisational data and aggregated data, but no Personal Data by design.

12.3	Data Types: General Data
This includes user generated or configured content or data such as scripts or configuration of cloud based products.
â¢	We store customer scripts for specific Cloud Apps such as ScriptRunner for Jira Cloud and ScriptRunner for Confluence Cloud, as well as queries (encrypted), inside our own infrastructure hosted on AWS and managed and operated by Adaptavist.
There may be a few exceptions where, for example, select low-risk ScriptRunner Cloud data is still hosted on Jira Cloud (Atlassian) storage.
â¢	By design there is normally no Personal Data contained in this data category, though an end user may at their choice configure the products otherwise.
12.4	Data Types: Administrative data
If you are using our Hosted Services for Atlassian Cloud products, Adaptavist may have access to data available to an administrator based on the specific applications scopes granted (please see https://confluence.atlassian.com/upm/atlassian-connect-app-scopes-445186491.html for more information on application scopes).
Access to this information is strictly controlled and will only be used for specific application functionality which requires it and support services such as initial configuration, routine maintenance such as backups and changes to server configuration and also any bespoke content production or alterations we make upon your request.
In addition, Atlassian will have to retain a copy of your contact details and license key of the Atlassian products for their own records, along with any correspondence you may have with them directly.
12.5	Data Types: Personal Profile Data
Integrated Partners such as Atlassian have very specific ways of defining Personal Data.
For Atlassian, this includes data held in a specific set of tables and for a narrow purpose of logically identifying users.
Such data may also be processed by service providers such as AWS Cognito in order to enable profile related product features for Adaptavist offerings.
This data does not include information which may still resolve to an individual (i.e.
be Personal Data within the definition prescribed by the GDPR) and which may be embedded in content throughout various applications.
In order to ensure we harmonise in certain instances with our Integrated Partners from a policy standpoint, we recognise this distinctive category of data as Personal Profile Data.

12.6	On-premises products versus Hosted Services (including Cloud Apps)
Adaptavist provides on-premises products for which you can acquire a license to use.
Use of such products is governed by the Adaptavist End User License Agreement.
On-premises products include Atlassian-based "Server" and "Data Center" variants of our products.
These products, by their nature, will be installed in an environment that a client controls.

Adaptavist also provides hosted products for Atlassian Cloud and in addition, Adaptavist provides products for Slack and Trello.
all together, these are our "Cloud Apps" and Cloud Apps are part of "Hosted Services," which also contain other online services that may be made available by Adaptavist.
