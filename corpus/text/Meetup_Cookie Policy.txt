By using our Platform, you consent to storage and access to cookies and other technologies on your device, in accordance with this Cookie Policy.

Our third party partners may set cookies on your device or use the technologies described below to gather information about your activities on the Platform and other sites and online services you use, in order to provide you with Meetup ads that match member profiles or interests.
For example, if you visit our Platform and also use a social media platform, you may see a Meetup ad on those social media platforms.
