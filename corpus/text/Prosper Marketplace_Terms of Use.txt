(b) Any Claim shall be resolved, upon the election of either us or you, by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association or JAMS, under the applicable arbitration rules of the administrator in effect at the time a Claim is filed ("Rules").
Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis.
class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.
If you file a claim, you may choose the administrator.

You can obtain the Rules and other information about initiating arbitration by contacting the American Arbitration Association at 1633 Broadway, 10th Floor, New York, NY 10019, www.adr.org.
or by contacting JAMS at 1920 Main Street, Suite 300, Irvine, CA 92614, (949) 224-1810, www.jamsadr.com.
The address for serving any arbitration demand or claim on us is Prosper Marketplace, Inc., 221 Main Street, Suite 300, San Francisco, CA 94105, Attention: Compliance.
(c) Claims will be arbitrated by a single, neutral arbitrator, who shall be a retired judge or a lawyer with at least ten years' experience.
We agree not to invoke our right to elect arbitration of an individual Claim filed by you in a small claims or similar court (if any), so long as the Claim is pending on an individual basis only in such court.
(d) We will pay all filing and administration fees charged by the administrator and arbitrator fees up to $1,000, and we will consider your request to pay any additional arbitration costs.
If an arbitrator issues an award in our favor, you will not be required to reimburse us for any fees we have previously paid to the administrator or for which we are responsible.
If you receive an award from the arbitrator, we will reimburse you for any fees paid by you to the administrator or arbitrator.
Each party shall bear its own attorney's, expert's and witness fees, which shall not be considered costs of arbitration.
however, if a statute gives you the right to recover these fees, or fees paid to the administrator or arbitrator, then these statutory rights will apply in arbitration.
(e) Any in-person arbitration hearing will be held in the city with the federal district court closest to your residence, or in such other location as you and we may mutually agree.
The arbitrator shall apply applicable substantive law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.

The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding except that: (1) any party may exercise any appeal right under the FAA.
and (2) any party may appeal any award relating to a claim for more than $100,000 to a three-arbitrator panel appointed by the administrator, which will reconsider de novo any aspect of the appealed award.
The panel's decision will be final and binding, except for any appeal right under the FAA.
Unless applicable law provides otherwise, the appealing party will pay the appeal's cost, regardless of its outcome.
However, we will consider any reasonable written request by you for us to bear the cost.
(f) YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
Further, unless both you and we agree otherwise in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, except that claims brought by joint applicants or co-borrowers relating to the same loan transaction shall be consolidated.
The arbitrator shall have no power to arbitrate any Claims on a class action basis or Claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, other borrowers, or other persons similarly situated.
The validity and effect of this paragraph (f) shall be determined exclusively by a court, and not by the administrator or any arbitrator.
(g) If any portion of this Arbitration Section is deemed invalid or unenforceable for any reason, it shall not invalidate the remaining portions of this section.
However, if paragraph (f) of this Arbitration Section is deemed invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part, then this entire Arbitration Section shall be deemed invalid and unenforceable.
The terms of this Arbitration Section will prevail if there is any conflict between the Rules and this section.
(h) YOU AND WE AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, THE PARTIES ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
YOU AND WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ARBITRATION WILL LIMIT OUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, THE RIGHT TO CONDUCT FULL DISCOVERY, AND THE RIGHT TO APPEAL (EXCEPT AS PERMITTED IN PARAGRAPH (e) OR UNDER THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT).
(i) You understand that you may reject the provisions of this Arbitration Section, in which case neither we nor you will have the right to elect arbitration.

This Arbitration Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
(k) This Arbitration Section shall not apply to covered borrowers as defined in the Military Lending Act.
