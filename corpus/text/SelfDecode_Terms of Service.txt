Welcome to SelfDecode.
Our goal at SelfDecode is to create an environment where you can learn about your genetic makeup, easily discover information relevant to your genetics and lifestyle, and connect with other people on the same journey.
We aim to create tools that you can use to identify genetic variations of interest to you.
We also aim to provide information that you can consider when thinking about how to respond to those variants of interest.
In order for us to provide you with the services described above we need to analyze files that contain data about your genetic variations.
The information hidden in your genetic makeup is both extremely useful and personal.
âSelfDecodeâ means Decodify Me LLC, and/or its affiliates (âSelfDecodeâ, âweâ, âusâ, âLab Test Analyzerâ).
We provide website content, functionality, and other products and services to you when you visit or make purchases at http://www.selfdecode.com (the âSiteâ) or remotely through any SelfDecode applications (collectively, the âServicesâ).
"Service" or "Services" means&nbsp.
SelfDecode's products, software, services, consultations, the mobile app and website (including but not limited to text, graphics, images, and other material and information) as accessed from time to time by the user, regardless if the use is in connection with an account or not.

Description of Services
The Services include the following features and functions related to genetic interpretation:


Uploading a Genotype File. SelfDecode stores the data that you chose to upload that make up the DNA code of your genes (âGenotype Fileâ).
SelfDecode obtains these data from a genotype file that you upload.
The genotype file data and any interpretation of that data, are your âGenetic Information.â 

SelfDecode Platform. SelfDecode hosts a platform (the âSelfDecode Platformâ) where you may receive insights about you from SelfDecode based on your Genetic Information (âSelfDecode Insightsâ), and purchase products and services that will use, interpret and deliver your Genetic Information (âSelfDecode Productsâ).
SelfDecode Products are made by SelfDecode and use a portion of your Genetic Information to offer a specific SelfDecode Product or service to you.
The SelfDecode Platform provides you with tailored results based on the genotype file you choose to use.


SelfDecode Account. SelfDecode provides you access to a software platform via a https://selfdecode.com account (the âSelfDecode Accountâ).
Your SelfDecode Account allows you to manage your Genetic Information, your SelfDecode Insights, the SelfDecode Products you purchased, and other account settings.
If you subscribe as an 'Individual' user then you will be limited to a single genotype file upload, whereas if you register as a 'Professional' user then you will have unlimited uploads available.&nbsp.


SelfDecode Services include, but are not limited to, utilities (tools within the website that perform specific functions relating to processing your genetic and lab test data and presenting results) for interpreting your Genetic Information, these are not guaranteed to be accurate and may be discontinued at any time.
A community platform for forum based discussion and sharing of findings.
This community platform may be canceled at any time.
Services are offered to you as a subscription membership service with either a yearly or monthly fee determined by the subscription package you choose.
Subscriptions cannot be placed on hold.
We provide a free trial and demo version for those who wish to trial the site before purchasing or uploading their file.
Please see the Renewal, Cancellation, and Refund Policy for more information. 
SelfDecode reserves the right to terminate your membership for any reason.
Nothing in the services provided under the subscription membership model establishes you a perpetual license but rather only a subscription where you must pay an ongoing subscription fee to have up to date access to the program, services or new membership offerings.
SelfDecode doesnât promise you unlimited service.
Once your sample is received by SelfDecode, DNA extraction, sequencing, and data analysis are performed to provide non-diagnostic reporting and recommendations.
At its discretion, SelfDecode may use third-party laboratories to perform DNA extraction, sequencing, and data analysis.
Your sample collection kit may be SelfDecode-branded even when such a third party will be doing DNA extraction, sequencing or data analysis.
By returning a sample kit, you acknowledge and agree that SelfDecode may provide the sample to such third parties for DNA extraction, sequencing or data analysis.
SelfDecode and its affiliates may not be able to process your sample if your sample does not contain a sufficient amount of DNA or is contaminated.
If this occurs, SelfDecode will reach out to you to notify you and ask you to provide a new sample.

Notice of Limitations
Our genes influence many traits in our lives.
At SelfDecode, we believe in giving you access to your Genetic Information.
This access can help you further your own self-discovery about your traits.
But before you subscribe to our Services, you should be aware of what genetics can and cannot tell you.

SelfDecode is not engaged in the practice of medicine, and information learned through SelfDecodeâs services is not intended for diagnostic or medical use:

SelfDecodeâs genetic testing services are not intended to be interpreted by users for the purposes of making any decisions regarding parentage or diagnostic or treatment.
The information you learn through our services does not constitute medical advice, and you should not change your health behaviors solely on the basis of the provided genetic information.
The services are not intended to be used by the customer for any diagnostic purpose and are not a substitute for professional medical advice.
You should always seek the advice of your physician or other health care provider with any questions you may have regarding diagnosis, cure, treatment, mitigation, or prevention of any disease or other medical condition or impairment or the status of your health.

BY USING SELFDECODEâS GENETIC TESTING SERVICES, YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT USE ANY INFORMATION PROVIDED BY SELFDECODEâS SERVICE FOR DIAGNOSTIC OR HEALTH RELATED DECISION MAKING BEFORE SEEKING PROFESSIONAL ADVICE FROM A PHYSICIAN, GENETIC COUNSELOR, OR SIMILARLY QUALIFIED HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL REGARDING ANY HEALTHCARE DECISIONS BASED ON GENETIC TESTING RESULTS PROVIDED BY SELFDECODE.

Rather, SelfDecodeâs services are for research, information, and educational use only.
In short, much of the health-related information learned from the provided genetic testing results have not been not clinically validated and the technology SelfDecode uses, although used in research, is not broadly used in healthcare settings.
Clinical validity refers to how well a specific genetic variant is related to the presence, absence, or risk of a specific disease or condition. 
SelfDecode encourages you to talk to a genetic counselor or a health professional prior to submitting a sample collection kit or to aid you in understanding your results.
 
In considering a purchase of the Services or any SelfDecode Product, you should be aware of certain risks and limitations of genetic interpretation.
These include the following:
Genetics is an evolving field of study

SelfDecode Products are based on the current knowledge of genetics.
This knowledge changes every day as we learn more through research.
A SelfDecode Product based on the current state of knowledge may have a different interpretation in the future.
Even though we know many traits have a basis in genetics, we may not know or understand all the genetic contributions for a trait.
Research in science and medicine is continuously discovering new links between genes and traits.
Such research is also showing that some previously identified links may not be valid.
Every genome is different.
Every person has variations that are either unique to them or are not well described in medical and scientific literature.
Your DNA will have variations that are not fully understood.
As such, some SelfDecode Products may reveal variations in your DNA that they cannot currently interpret.
SelfDecode Products provide interpretations based on scientific studies.
Such studies are often based on a specific population, such as a specific ethnicity.
Thus, you may receive interpretations that are based on a population that differs from your ethnicity or genetic background.

Genetics cannot tell you everything about yourself

There are few cases where a single gene (or variation in a single gene) is completely predictive of any one trait.
Most traits are influenced by multiple genetic and non-genetic factors.
Your lifestyle, your environment and chance can also play a role in whether you will have or develop a trait.
The interpretation of Genetic Information is often as a probability, likelihood, or risk.
Even if you have one or more genetic variations linked to a certain trait, it may not mean that you have or will develop that trait.
In addition to non-genetic factors, multiple genes or genetic variations often influence a single trait.
That means the effect of any one, single genetic variation may be low.
Even if you do not have one or more genetic variations linked to a certain trait, you may still have or develop that trait.
In some cases it is more accurate to measure your physical trait (e.g., height) than to use Genetic Information to predict the trait (e.g., genes for height).

You may discover information that causes you distress

You cannot unlearn the knowledge you gain from a SelfDecode Product.
Some people prefer not to know their Genetic Information for some traits.
You may discover Genetic Information that you do not expect.
In some cases this information may be interesting.
In other cases it may lead to unintended reactions such as anxiety, depression or distress.
Examples of these include: 
discovering an unexpected genetic risk for a health condition


SelfDecode allows you to select which insights you would like to receive by purchasing SelfDecode Products and navigating the platform.
You are responsible for considering the potential impact this information may have on you or your relatives before purchasing a SelfDecode Product.

Revealing your Genetic Information may affect your privacy

You may also wish to publicly share results on your own.
You should be careful about sharing your Genetic Information with others and know the consequences before doing so.
Genetic Information that you choose to share with your health professional may become part of your medical record.
That means it could be accessible to other health professionals and possibly health insurance providers in the future.
Please see our Privacy Policy for further information about how we handle your Genetic Information and your options for disclosure of such information.
Our Privacy Policy describes how SelfDecode protects your privacy, and our Platform Consent describes the risks and benefits of genetic interpretation.

Your Genetic Interpretation may have implications for your relatives

Your biological relatives will share some portions of your DNA.
Because of this fact, some information you receive from SelfDecode Products you use may have implications for them as well.
Genetic Information can reveal information that is surprising to you or your family.
For some SelfDecode Products, information may show that other relatives are at risk for a health condition they did not know about before.
It is important to consider how information you learn may have a positive or negative impact on members of your family.
Some of your family members may not want to know about such Genetic Information.
If you have questions about how to share sensitive Genetic Information with relatives, you should speak with a qualified healthcare provider, such as a genetic counselor.

You may receive information about your health

SelfDecode Products analyze your Genetic information for Health purposes, and may suggest actions or interventions that you can take related to your health.
However, SelfDecode Products do not have a complete view of your health history.
Before you act on any health information provided through SelfDecode Products, please first consult with a healthcare professional.
Not all Genetic Information can or should be acted upon.
If you have questions or concerns, you should speak with a health professional such as a physician or genetic counselor prior to purchasing a SelfDecode Product. 
The results of SelfDecode Products should not be used to diagnose or treat and medical condition.
You should consult a qualified healthcare provider before you take medical action.
Not all scientific and health interpretation claims have been validated by the scientific and/or medical community or the Food and Drug Administration (âFDAâ).
However, not all SelfDecode Products on the SelfDecode Platform require approval by the FDA.
SelfDecode does not provide allergy testing and none of our content should be interpreted as allergy testing.

PLEASE CALL YOUR DOCTOR OR 911 IMMEDIATELY IF YOU THINK YOU MAY HAVE A MEDICAL OR PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY.

Dispute Resolution
If a dispute arises between you and SelfDecode, you agree to first contact SelfDecodeâs Customer Support to seek a resolution.
If our Customer Support is not able to resolve the issue, then except for disputes relating to the infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights:

Such disputes will be resolved through binding arbitration rather than in court.
This arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ).
Such arbitration will follow the rules of the AAA (âAAA Rulesâ), as modified by these Terms of Service.
The arbitration will be conducted in the English language.
Any arbitration hearing will be held in Orange County, California.

If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as set forth in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 11), then the AAA Rules will apply regarding payment of arbitration costs.
The AAA Rules and fees are available online at www.adr.org or can be obtained by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.
You and SelfDecode both agree that either party may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
You and SelfDecode agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, consolidated or representative proceeding.
Further, unless both you and SelfDecode agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one personâs claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
If this Section 20 is found to be unenforceable, then this Section 20 will be null and void.
In such a case, you and SelfDecode agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 23 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms of Service.
22.
Waiver and Severability
No waiver of these Terms of Service by SelfDecode shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or any other term or condition.
Any failure of SelfDecode to assert a right or provision under these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
If any provision of these Terms of Service is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of these Terms of Service will continue in full force and effect.
23.
Entire Agreement
These Terms of Service, our Privacy Policy, and Platform Consent constitute the sole and entire agreement between you and SelfDecode with respect to the Services and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to the Services.
24.
Miscellaneous
These Terms of Service and any dispute or claim arising out of, or related to, them or the Site, their subject matter or their formation (in each case, including non-contractual disputes or claims) will be governed by and construed in accordance with California law, without regard to its conflicts of laws principles and excluding the applicability of United Nations Convention for the International Sale of Goods.
To the extent that any lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted hereunder, you and SelfDecode agree to exclusively litigate such disputes in the state courts located in Orange County and the federal courts located in San Francisco County, California, and both parties consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in California.
You may not assign any of your rights in these Terms of Service, and any such attempt is void.
SelfDecode may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.

You also acknowledge and agree that any applicable state law implementation of the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (including any available remedies or laws) shall not apply to these Terms and is hereby disclaimed.
A printed version of these Terms and of any related notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to these Terms to the same extent as other documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.
Please contact SelfDecode if you wish to receive a printed copy of these Terms.
SelfDecode and you are not legal partners or agents of one another.
The relationship between you and SelfDecode is and shall be that of independent contractors and nothing in these Terms shall be construed or used to create or imply any relationship of partners, joint ventures, or employer and employee.

Any attempt of assignment, delegation, or transfer in violation of these Terms shall be void, of no effect, and a material breach of these Terms.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, SelfDecode may assign these Terms in whole or in part.
Moreover, SelfDecode may delegate its rights and responsibilities or use contractors or agents to fulfill its obligations under these Terms.
If any of these Terms are deemed inconsistent with applicable law, then such term(s) shall be interpreted in accordance with law, and no other terms will be modified.
In the event any provision of these Terms is found by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, you agree that unless it materially affects the entire intent and purpose of these Terms, the invalidity, voidness, or unenforceability shall affect neither the validity of these Terms nor the remaining provisions herein, and the provision in question shall be deemed to be replaced with a valid and enforceable provision most closely reflecting the intent and purpose of the original provision.
If we choose not to enforce any of these Terms, we are not waiving our rights.
If the performance of any part of these Terms by either party is prevented, hindered, delayed or otherwise made impracticable by reason of any flood, riot, fire, pandemic, public health crisis, judicial or governmental action, emergency, labor disputes, act of God or any other causes beyond the control of either party, that party shall be excused from such to the extent that it is prevented, hindered or delayed by such causes.
