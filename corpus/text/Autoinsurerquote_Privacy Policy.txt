Use and Sharing of PII:

[Please see our Provisions for California Residents below for details regarding our uses and sharing of personal information]
We use the PII that you supply to personalize your experience with the Site.
The PII that you submit to AutoInsurer Quote remains your property, but by submitting that PII you grant AutoInsurer Quote the right, subject to applicable state and federal law, to use that PII for marketing purposes.
We reserve the right to share, sell, rent or lease such PII with/to any third-party for any and all uses permitted by this Privacy Policy and applicable law.
These third-parties may include, but shall not be limited to: (a) providers of direct marketing services and applications, including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation.
(b) telemarketers (where permitted by applicable law).
and (d) direct marketers.
We may contact you via email with relevant information and special opportunities, including our newsletters and those from partner brands such as FortiFynance.
You also agree that we may contact you at any time with updates and/or any other information that we may deem appropriate for you to receive in connection with your continued use of the Site and/or AutoInsurer Quote offerings.
We may also employ other companies and individuals to perform certain functions on our behalf.
Examples include sending electronic or direct mail, SMS messages, removing duplicate information from user lists, analyzing data and providing marketing analysis.
The agents performing these limited functions on our behalf shall have access to our users' PII as needed to perform these functions for us, but we do not permit them to use user PII for other purposes.
We will also use your PII for customer service, to provide you with information that you may request, to customize your experience with the presented offerings and/or to contact you when necessary in connection with your use of the offerings.
We may also use your PII for internal business purposes, such as analyzing and managing our service offerings including, without limitation, the offerings.
We may also combine the information we have gathered about you with information from other sources.
By submitting your PII by and through the offerings, you agree that such act constitutes an inquiry and/or application for purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule (16 CFR Â§310 et seq.), as amended from time to time (the "Rule") and applicable state do-not-call regulations.
As such, notwithstanding that your telephone number may be listed on the Federal Trade Commission's Do-Not-Call List, and/or on applicable state do-not-call lists, we retain the right to contact you via telemarketing in accordance with the Rule and applicable state do-not-call regulations.
Where you provide "prior express consent" within the meaning of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (47 USC Â§ 227), and its implementing regulations adopted by the Federal Communications Commission (47 CFR Â§ 64.1200), as amended from time-to-time ("TCPA"), you consent to receive telemarketing messages or calls from AutoInsurer Quote, including artificial voice calls, pre-recorded messages and/or SMS text messages delivered via automated technology, to the telephone number(s) that you provided.
Furthermore, where you provide prior express consent, you understand and agree that we may use a third party vendor to record and store your registration and consent for compliance purposes.
Please note that you are not required to provide this consent in order to obtain access to the offerings, and your consent simply allows us to contact you via these means.

Please be advised that by agreeing to this Privacy Policy, you are obligated to immediately inform us if and when the telephone number that you have previously provided to us changes.
Without limiting the foregoing, if you: (i) have your telephone number reassigned to another person or entity.
(ii) give up your telephone number so that it is no longer used by you.
(iii) port your telephone number to a landline or vice versa.
or (iv) otherwise stop using that telephone number for any reason (collectively "Phone Number Change"), you agree that you shall promptly notify AutoInsurer Quote of the Phone Number Change via e-mail at: contact@shareautoinsurerquote.com, or by using one of the methods set forth in the "Contact Us" section below.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy, We reserve the right to release current or past PII: (A) in the event that we believe that the Site is being or has been used in violation of the AutoInsurer Quote Terms and Conditions, or to otherwise commit unlawful acts.
(B) if the information is subpoenaed; provided, however, that, where permitted by applicable law, we shall provide you with e-mail notice, and opportunity to challenge the subpoena, prior to disclosure of any PII pursuant to a subpoena.
or (C) if AutoInsurer Quote is sold, merged, acquired or the subject of bankruptcy proceedings.
provided, however, if it is involved in a bankruptcy proceeding, merger, acquisition or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on the Site of any change in ownership or uses of your PII, as well as any choices that you may have regarding your PII.
You hereby consent to the disclosure of any record or communication to any third-party when we, in our sole discretion, determine the disclosure to be appropriate including, without limitation, sharing your e-mail address with third-parties for suppression purposes in compliance with applicable law, including the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, as amended from time-to-time.
Users should also be aware that courts of equity, such as U.S.
Bankruptcy Courts, might have the authority under certain circumstances to permit PII to be shared or transferred to third-parties without permission.

Third Party Links:

The Site may contain links to third-party websites ("Third Party Websites").
Please be aware that AutoInsurer Quote is not responsible for the privacy practices of Third Party Websites.
We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Site and to read the privacy policies of each and every website that collects PII.
This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by the Site.

Security of Your Personal Information:

All collected information is stored in a technically and physically secure environment.
We take precautions to protect PII both online and off-line.
Where our registration/application process prompts Users to enter sensitive data (such as credit card information and/or Social Security Number), and when we store and transmit such sensitive data, that information is encrypted with advanced TLS (Transport Layer Security).
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
As a result, while we strive to protect your PII, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.
Once we receive your transmission, we make reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our systems.
All of our users' information, not just PII, is restricted in our offices.
Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to PII.
Furthermore, access to this information is strictly limited, and not accessible to the public.
Our employees are dedicated to ensuring the security and privacy of all user information.
Employees not adhering to our firm policies are subject to disciplinary action.
Please note that any attempt to breach the security of the network, our servers, databases or other hardware or software supporting the Site or other websites under the control of AutoInsurer Quote constitutes a crime punishable by law.
We will turn over to authorities, any and all evidence relating to a potential breach of security or other abuse against our network, servers, databases or other such supporting equipment or software.
In compliance with applicable federal and state laws, we shall notify you in the event that we learn of an information security breach with respect to your PII.
You will be notified via e-mail in the event of such a breach.
Please be advised that notice may be delayed in order to address the needs of law enforcement, determine the scope of network damage, and to engage in remedial measures.

Children's Privacy:

[Please see our Provisions for California Residents below for more details regarding the personal information of minors]
We encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate and monitor the interactive activities of their children.
AutoInsurer Quote will never knowingly collect any personal information from individuals under eighteen (18) years of age.

Deleting, Modifying and 
Updating Your Information:

You may do so by sending your request via certified mail to: AutoInsurer Quote, 5015 Madison Ave Ste A -Unit #A6 Sacramento, CA 95841, or e-mailing us at: contact@shareautoinsurerquote.com We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes).
Please be advised that, after you delete your PII, residual copies may take a period of time before they are deleted from our active servers and may remain in our backup systems.

Changes to this Privacy Policy:

We reserve the right to change or update this Privacy Policy at any time in order to maintain compliance with applicable state and federal laws.
All Privacy Policy changes will take effect immediately upon their posting on the Site.
provided, however, that if the manner in which we use PII changes, we will notify users by: (a) sending the modified policy to our users via email.
and/or (b) by any other reasonable means acceptable under applicable state and federal law.
You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your PII in this different manner and we will only use your information in this different manner where you opt-in to such use.
