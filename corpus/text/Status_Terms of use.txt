 Status App Terms of Use

Status strives to be a secure communication tool that upholds human rights.
Designed to enable the free flow of information, protect the right to private, secure conversations, and promote the sovereignty of individuals.
Status provides a secure messaging app, crypto wallet, and Web3 browser, built with state of the art technology, integrated into one powerful super app.
These and any other Status services available through the application are simply called the Status app.
These Terms of Use are a contract between you and Status.
You agree to these terms by installing or using the Status app on any device.
If you donât agree to these terms, donât use the Status app.
Who we areThe Status Network is an open set of projects building peer-to-peer technologies for people to transact securely, communicate freely, and organize with confidence.
Together, anyone participating in the Status Network helps to build financial and social technology that empowers people to advance their own sovereign communities.
Whenever âStatusâ or âweâ is used in these terms, weâre referring to Status Research &amp.
Development GmbH, the Swiss company that distributes the Status app.
Our contact information can be found on our website. Our Principles drive our decisionsThe goal of Status is widespread adoption of the decentralized web.
Our challenge is achieving mass adoption while staying true to our Principles.
These terms are designed to reflect our Principles and goal for mass adoption, while providing important legal protections for Status and the Status community of users.
You agree to use the Status app in a way that promotes the Status Principles.
In order to offer the Status app on distribution platforms, such as third party app stores, we must include certain provisions required by those distribution platforms in these terms.
In circumstances where the required provisions conflict with our Principles, weâre actively searching for alternative solutions, but in the meantime, the Status app is subject to such third party provisions and you agree to all provisions of these terms.
How to use the Status appThe Status app is free, and account generation is pseudo-anonymous.
Youâll never be asked for a phone number, email address, bank account, or any other personal information when generating a Status app account.
When generating an account, a randomization process is started on your own device that generates a key pair.
Youâll then be given display name options to choose from (derived from this key pair).
Only you have access to your private keys, so only youâre responsible for keeping them safe.

We care about your privacyStatus uses an open-source, peer-to-peer protocol with end-to-end encryption and metadata suppression to protect your identity, messages, wallet, and browsing information from third parties.
We donât monetize your private user data, including private messages and browser information, to advertisers or other third parties.
Users may be asked to opt-in to share usage data for the purpose of helping us develop the software.
Be aware that information posted to a blockchain is public.
Guided by our principles, Status is designed to protect your privacy and process as little personal data as possible for the network to thrive.
Status enables pseudo anonymity, strives to provide the right of total anonymity, and offers ways to selectively reveal oneself to the world.
Status canât, by design, and wonât try to, access your account, private messages, or activity on the Status app without your consent.
All private messages sent in the Status app are encrypted end-to-end by default, to help ensure your privacy.
However, your privacy may be compromised if you use third party services offered within the Status app, such as DApps or Ethereum transactions.
Our full terms regarding third party services are described below.
Learn more about how seriously we protect your data by reading our Privacy Policy and Security Protocol.
 Youâre responsible for your activitiesWe believe in the sovereignty of individuals.
As a platform that stands for the cause of personal liberty, we aim to maximize social, political, and economic freedoms.
This also means youâre fully responsible for all activities that occur under your account.

Youâre entirely responsible for the information you submit through the Status app, including any harm resulting from that information, and Status shall not be liable for any acts or omissions by you.
When you generate an account, your private keys are generated and stored locally on your own device.
This means that Status doesnât know which keys belong to you and doesnât process any personal data in this respect.
You may also choose to store your keys on a keycard (such as the Status Keycard).
of course, Status doesnât have access to your keycard either.
Status will never have access to or control over your keys or wallet assets, as Status isnât a custodian.
Youâre responsible for taking precautions to protect yourself and your devices from viruses and other harmful content.
Youâre also responsible for any carrier or connection charges, fees, and taxes associated with the devices on which you use the Status app.
To use the Status app, you must be fully able and competent to agree to these terms and to use all services provided on the Status app.
To use the Status app without parental permission, you must meet the minimum age requirements in your country of residence.

Status is open-sourceThe software we create is a public good.
The Status source code is made available via free and open-source licenses, for anyone to share, modify, and benefit from (according to the applicable license).
We believe in permission-less participation.
Information regarding the Status appâs current software can be found here.
Our view on censorshipOne of the Status Principles is censorship resistance under cryptographic and cryptoeconomic design.
We enable free flow of information, and no content is under surveillance.
Status hasnât reviewed, canât review, and wonât review the content posted by users within the Status app, and therefore, we canât be responsible for any userâs content.
Status aims to provide the tools for user communities to voluntarily self-regulate their own content.
While using the Status app, you may view content thatâs offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable.
content containing technical inaccuracies, typographical mistakes, and other errors.
and material that violates othersâ rights, including privacy and intellectual property rights.
Status doesnât endorse any user content or activity on the Status app and disclaims any responsibility for any harm resulting from user content or activities.
For an explanation about how Status has no means of removing users or user generated content from the Status app, see the section on decentralization and the Waku protocol below. Please limit certain usesWe strive for complete openness and symmetry of information within the Status organization and with our community.
We ask you to respect the Status community too.
You agree to use the Status app in a way that doesnât harm or violate the rights of Status, Status app users, or others in any way.
You agree that you wonât, and you wonât assist others to: (i) gain or try to gain unauthorized access to the Status app or any Status system.
(ii) disrupt the integrity or performance of the Status app or any Status system.
(iii) generate accounts on the Status app through unauthorized means.
(iv) install any viruses, worms, malware, Trojan horses, or other harmful or destructive code or content.
(v) use spam, data mining, or other unsolicited promotional methods, machine generated content, or unethical or unwanted commercial content.
(vi) engage in phishing, spoofing, or similar fraudulent acts.
(vii) spread misinformation or misleadingly impersonate another person or company.
(viii) stalk, bully, harass or abuse another individual in any way.
(ix) violate the privacy rights of others.
or (x) copy, distribute, sell, license, create derivative works from, or in any other way exploit any copyrighted material, trademarks, or any intellectual property rights of others.
The Status app is decentralizedWe minimize centralization across the software and the organization itself by maximizing the number of physical computers composing the network, and maximizing the number of individuals who have control over the system(s) weâre building.
The Status app is a generic chat app for connecting to the global Waku communication network, just as Chrome/Safari is a generic web browser for connecting to the Web, and just as Google/Apple doesnât control the content on the Web, Status doesnât control the content on Waku.
The Status app utilizes a peer-to-peer network that doesnât rely on any centralized servers from which communication can be blocked.
Instead, the Status app uses a distributed network of nodes connected to the Waku peer-to-peer network.
Learn more about Waku here.
Our services may changeAs Status is an open-source, community-driven project, users can both request and contribute to feature development.
Some or all of the services on the Status app may change or be discontinued at any time, including features or support for certain devices and platforms.
Any and all new services or features added to the Status app are also subject to these terms.
Weâll keep you updatedFrom time to time, we provide updates to the Status app in order to enable new features and enhanced functionality.
If you installed the Status app from a third party app store, you consent to the policies of that app store, which may include automatic downloading and installing of updates to the Status app.
If you installed the Status app from a source other than an app store, Status wonât push automatic downloads or updates without your opt-in consent.
The Status app may be intentionally or unintentionally interrupted, including for maintenance, upgrades, or network or equipment failures.
Sometimes we use third party providersCertain services on the Status app may allow you to access, use, or interact with third party products and services, such as websites, blockchain wallet transactions, apps and DApps, support services, and group chat community spaces.
When you use any third party service, their terms and conditions, including privacy policies, govern your use of those services, and Status shall not be liable for your use of or activities on or with any third party service. Utility of the Status Network TokenYou can interact within the Status app using any compatible token including the Status Network Token (SNT).
SNT is an ERC-20 (Ethereum standard) compatible utility token, used to access and power decentralized services in the Status Network, as well as utilities on third party platforms.
Certain features and functionalities within the Status app require users to deposit or spend SNT or other tokens.
Utility of the SNT token is a primary goal of the Status Network and may include network incentivization, sticker market use, ENS user name registration, DApp curation, and governance, among others.
If you interact within the Status app using SNT, you agree to any and all SNT terms and conditions, including without limitation the SNT Governance Terms.
Respect the Status brandWe create software incentivized to continue to exist and improve, without the stewardship of a single entity or any of the current team members.
The Status community has worked hard to build a brand and goodwill that will also continue to exist and improve over time.
Status owns all copyrights, domains, trade dress (look and feel), design rights and themes, trademarks, logos, graphics, and other intellectual property rights associated with the Status app and the Status brand.

We love to see creative work by users from the Status community, but please let us know in advance if you want to use trademarks, logos, or graphics that are modified from our standard colors and designs.
If you write articles or blogs, create websites, or talk about Status, make sure itâs clear you arenât speaking for, on behalf of, or under endorsement by Status.
To request permission to use our copyrighted material or trademarks, such as logos, please contact marketing@status.im.
We may change these termsWe may modify or replace any part of these terms.
Youâre responsible for checking our website periodically for any changes.
Your continued use of the Status app following posted changes to these terms means that you accept those changes.

Risks you should know aboutYou represent and warrant that you understand the inherent risks associated with cryptographic and cryptoeconomic systems and have an understanding of the usage and intricacies of virtual currency and tokens (such as Ether (ETH)), smart contract based tokens (such as ERC 20), and blockchain-based systems.
You acknowledge and agree that: (i) Status and its representatives arenât responsible for the underlying protocols of open source blockchain based networks, which may be subject to sudden changes in operating rules (such as forks), (ii) such changes may materially affect the Status app, and (iii) Status may, in our sole discretion, decide not to support a forked network.
Status and its representatives arenât responsible whatsoever for any underlying software protocols, whether forked or not.
You acknowledge and understand that cryptographic and cryptoeconomic systems are an emerging technology with inherent risks.
For example, advances in technology, such as cryptography or quantum computers, could result in the theft or loss of your tokens or wallet assets.
While security is at the forefront of our priorities (which is why many functions on the Status app are privacy-mode by default) and Status intends to continuously update its security measures, Status canât and doesnât guarantee full security of the Status app, its underlying protocols, or your tokens or wallet assets.
Status has no ongoing duty to alert you to potential security risks, but you can check our Status app security channel for updates when available.
