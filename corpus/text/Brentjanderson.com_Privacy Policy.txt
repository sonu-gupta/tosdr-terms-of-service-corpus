ð I'm an entrepreneur and software engineer.
I work with startups and innovative companies to build great products that delight users.
By day I'm a full-stack engineer at Lambda School.
By night, I'm a dad, husband, Latter-day Saint, and co-founder at Coriaria where we develop products and services that strengthen homes and families.
As an entrepreneur, I use Lean Startup techniques to quickly get to the root of the job to be done so that we can get value to customers as quickly as possible.
As an engineer, I specialize in full-stack web and mobile applications engineering using React &amp.
React Native, Postgres, iOS/Swift, Elixir, and NodeJS.
I also help teams build the best process for rapid innovation across the stack.
My playbook is simple:

Start small and iterate
Focus on people and their needs
Help others become more excellent

With this playbook I have helped tiny early-stage startups, fortune 100 companies, and global brands achieve success.
