 Digital Advertising and Analytics Digital Advertising and Analytics 

We may partner with ad networks and other ad serving providers (âAdvertising Providersâ) that serve ads on behalf of us and others on non-affiliated platforms.
Some of those ads may be personalized, meaning they are intended to be relevant to you based on information Advertising Providers collect about your use of our website and other sites or apps over time, including information about relationships among different browsers and devices.
This type of advertising is known as interest-based advertising.
Entrust adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance (âDAAâ) Self-Regulatory Principles in connection with this interest-based advertising activity.
You may visit the DAA Webchoices tool at www.aboutads.info to learn more about this type of advertising and how to opt out of this advertising on websites by companies participating in the DAA self-regulatory program.
If you delete your cookies or use a different browser, you may need to renew your opt-out choices exercised through the DAA Webchoices tool.
Note that electing to opt out will not stop advertising from appearing in your browser or applications.
It may make the ads you see less relevant to your interests.
Additionally, your browser may offer tools to limit the use of cookies or to delete cookies.
however, if you use these tools, our website may not function as intended.
We may also work with third parties that collect data about your use of our website and other sites or apps over time for non-advertising purposes.
Entrust uses Google Analytics and other third-party services to improve the performance of the website and for analytics or marketing purposes.
For more information about how Google Analytics collects and uses data when you use the website, visit www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners, and to opt out of Google Analytics, visit tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.

We also retain personal data as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, pursue legitimate business interests, conduct audits, and protect or enforce our rights.

We use appropriate technical, organizational and administrative security measures to protect your personal data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
These security measures are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal data.
For example, payment transactions are encrypted using SSL technology or have appropriate safeguards in place to ensure the security and integrity of your personal data where stored on third party servers.

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our websites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.
We ask you not to share your password with anyone.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.
Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our websites.
any transmission is at your own risk.
Once we receive your information, we use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.

It may also be processed by staff who work for us or for one of our suppliers in a location different from where the data was collected.
We will only transfer your personal data as permitted by law.
Certain privacy and data protection laws require data controllers to put in place safeguards to protect personal data transferred across borders.
To comply with this requirement, Entrust has put in place agreements that include the standard contractual clauses recommended by the European Commission to provide adequate safeguards for personal data.


 Who is the Data Controller? Who is the Data Controller?

to correct, delete, or restrict any active processing of your personal data.
and to obtain a copy of your personal data in a structured, machine readable format.
Additionally, you can object to the processing of your personal data in some circumstances (e.g., where we donât have to process the information to meet a legitimate interest, contractual or other legal requirement).
Your right to object to processing of your personal data may be limited in certain circumstances (e.g., where fulfilling your request would reveal personal data about another person or where you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep or have other compelling legitimate interests to keep such as for purposes of fraud prevention).

for example, where our marketing is not based on other lawful grounds.
Note: This will not apply to electronic marketing to Canadian residents where consent is required.
