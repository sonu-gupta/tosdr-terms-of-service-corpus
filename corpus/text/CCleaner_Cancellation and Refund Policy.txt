         Cancellation and Refund Policy for Avast, AVG, CCleaner and HMA! Solutions (Version 1.5) We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee on subscriptions for certain Avast, AVG, CCleaner (including Defraggler, Recuva and Speccy) and HideMyAss! Solutions that end-users purchase directly from us through our online retail stores or through Google Play.
If your purchase qualifies, and you follow all the instructions in this Cancellation and Refund Policy within 30 days of the date of purchase, we will terminate your subscription and refund 100% of the price you paid for the then-current subscription term.
We also allow you to cancel your subscription and request a refund (prorated for the unexpired or unused portion of the Subscription Term) if we provide notice to you that we are amending the End User License Agreement we entered into with you in respect of such subscription and/or Solution (the âEULAâ), and you object to such amendment within 30 days of the date of such notice. Requesting a Cancellation and Refund from Us Before you start, please read all the restrictions and limitations described in this Cancellation and Refund Policy.
If you qualify for a cancellation and refund on your purchase, and you purchased the subscription directly from us through our online retail store or from Google Play, then please follow the instructions below:

Products Purchased from Us and Subscriptions You Terminate for Notified Amendments to the EULA. To request a cancellation and refund for a subscription you purchased from us through our online retail stores, or to terminate a subscription because you object to an amendment to the EULA we have notified to you, please find the confirmation email or invoice we sent directly to you in connection with your purchase, because it will tell you which Avast company you will need to contact (which may not be the brand name on the Solution) and will contain certain other information you must provide us in order to request your cancellation and refund.

Products Purchased from Google Play. To request a cancellation and refund on a subscription and/or Solution you purchased from the Google Play app store, you must provide us with the email address you used in Google Play to purchase the subscription and/or Solution and the Transaction ID for the purchase.
You can find the Transaction ID by: (i) finding the email sent to your Google Play account to confirm your purchase.

Restrictions Regarding Products Purchased from a Physical Store, iTunes and Other Resellers. To request a refund on a subscription and/or Solution you purchased from a physical bricks-and-mortar store, the iTunes app store or any other reseller (not mentioned above), rather than directly from us, please contact the reseller regarding its cancellation and refund policy and any request for a refund.
We do not grant refunds on those purchases.

Restrictions on Refunds to Resellers, Distributors and Channel Partners. If you purchased a subscription and/or Solution for resale to a third party, you have a right to receive refunds only if the right is granted by your Reseller Agreement, Distribution Agreement, Channel Partner Agreement or other agreement with us.
Please review your agreement with us before requesting a cancellation and refund.

Other Restrictions. We do not grant cancellations and refunds for the purchase of any:

Solution if you completed the purchase more than 30 days prior to the date you requested a cancellation and refund
CD, DVD or other physical medium on which we provide a copy of a Solution, unless the physical medium is defective
service we have fully performed prior to the date you requested a cancellation and refund 
Solution within 6 months after you have received a cancellation and refund for any prior purchase of the same Solution
VPN Solution or other communications Solution that you have used to upload and/or download more than 10GB of data in aggregate, or that you have used to connect to our VPN or other communication service more than 100 times
Solution with respect to which you have violated our End User License Agreement


Dispute Resolution (EU Residents Only). If you are a consumer and live in the European Union and you purchased the subscription and/or Solution online from one of our companies based in the European Union, you may be entitled to address any dispute with us through an internet platform for online dispute resolution established by the European Commission (the â
ODR Platform
â).
The ODR Platform is intended to facilitate out-of-court resolutions relating to online purchases of goods and services between consumers and traders based in the European Union.
You will find the ODR Platform by following this link: http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/.
Please note that our End User License Agreement requires that you first contact us and provide us with an opportunity to resolve your issue, before you initiate any dispute resolution process. Related Information Regarding Consumer Products Archive
