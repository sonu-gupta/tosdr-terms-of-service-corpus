Use of cookies Visitors should be aware that LifeWireâs website may automatically collect non-personal information and data through the use of âcookies.â Cookies are small text files websites use to recognize repeat visitors, facilitate the visitorâs ongoing access to and use of the site, and to track usage behavior and compile aggregate data for content improvements.
Cookies are not programs that come onto a visitorâs system and damage files.

If a visitor does not want information collected through the use of cookies, most browsers allow the visitor to deny or accept the cookie feature.
LifeWire uses âcookieâ technology only to obtain non-personal information from its online visitors to improve visitorsâ online experiences and facilitate their visits within our site. Links to other websites and services This site links to other sites and services that LifeWire does maintain.
These websites have their own privacy policies, which we encourage you to review.
We have no responsibility for linked websites and provide these links solely for the convenience and information of our visitors. Protecting personal information LifeWire takes every precaution to protect donor information.
When donors submit sensitive information via our website, we protect their information both online and off-line.
When a form asks donors to enter confidential information (such as credit card numbers or addresses), that information is encrypted and protected with the best encryption software in the industry â SSL.

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect donor information off-line.
All donor information, not just the confidential information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.
Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (our Resource Development Team) have access to personally identifiable information.
All employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Contacting LifeWire LifeWire works hard to ensure that your giving experience is a positive one.
