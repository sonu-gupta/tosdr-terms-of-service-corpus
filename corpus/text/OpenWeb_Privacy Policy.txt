is headquartered in Israel, a jurisdiction which is considered by the European Commission to be offering an adequate level of protection for the Personal Data of EU Member State residents.
While privacy laws may vary between jurisdictions, OpenWeb and its affiliates and Service Providers are each committed to protect Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy, customary industry standards, and such appropriate lawful mechanisms and contractual terms requiring adequate data protection, regardless of any lesser legal requirements that may apply in the jurisdiction to which such data is transferred.

Data Sharing

Legal Compliance: We may disclose or allow government and law enforcement officials access to your Personal Data, in response to a subpoena, search warrant or court order (or similar requirement), or in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
Such disclosure or access may occur if we believe in good faith that we are legally compelled to do so, or that disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding actual or suspected illegal activity, fraud, or other wrongdoing.

Service Providers: We may engage selected third party companies and individuals to perform services complementary to our own (e.g.
hosting services, data analytics services, marketing and advertising services, data and cyber security services, payment processing services, user engagement services, e-mail distribution and monitoring services, text messaging services, session recording, content moderation, and our business, legal and financial advisors) (collectively, âService Providersâ).

5.
Cookies, Tracking Technologies and Advertising Uses
Our Services, our Partners and some of our Service Providers utilize âcookiesâ, anonymous identifiers, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), HTML5 local storage, and other tracking technologies which help us provide, secure and improve our Services, personalize your experience and monitor the performance of our activities and campaigns. 
Our Services also utilize advertising for third party services and products.
We and our advertising Partners use certain data about you in order to improve our advertising practices and make the ads we deliver more effective, relevant and enjoyable, including by deploying contextual, interest-based and other types of advertising, as well as targeting, ad measurement and attribution systems.
The ads and content we or our advertising partners deliver may be shown within our Services or through other channels, such as third-party websites and applications.
Such data includes your IP address, cookies, pixels and other unique identifiers, data related to your connected Social Network Account, and other demographic and interests-based information that we or our advertising partners may have received from or about you, based on your consent or another legal basis (i.e., as required in order to provide you with our respective services, or based on the legitimate interests that we described in Section 2 above). 
When you use our Services, we may share information that we collect from you with our identity partners/service providers, including LiveRamp Inc.
LiveRamp returns an online identification code that we may store in our first-party cookie for our use in online and cross-channel advertising, and it may be shared with advertising companies to enable interest-based and targeted advertising.
The information shared for such activities may include your email (in hashed and non-identifying form), IP address and information about your browser or operating system.
To opt out of this use, please click here.
Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to the processing of your data by our advertising partners and networks.
We recommend that you review their privacy policies for more information. 
A list of the cookies and other tracking technologies we use, as well as additional information concerning our advertising partners and networks (and their policies), can be found here: https://www.openweb.com/cookies/ 

Our practices with respect to Do-Not-Track (DNT) signals: DNT signals are the result of a standardization initiative from 2009 to create a standard signal which could be broadcasted by any web browser, and read by websites accessed through such browser, to note an individualâs preference not to be tracked online.
While the working group assigned to this standardization initiative by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was disbanded in 2019, the California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA) still requires website publishers/operators to disclose whether they respond to web browsersâ âdo not trackâ (DNT) signals.
Similar to most websites, the OpenWeb.com website does not change its practices in response to a âDo Not Trackâ signal in the HTTP header from a browser, as unfortunately these are, from a technical perspective, not sufficiently reliable or standardized for us to warrant full adherence.
We do recommend the use of cookies for an optimal user experience of our Services, but if you choose to remove or block them we definitely respect your choice.
Modern web browsers typically allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and to remove them.
You may also set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies entirely through your browser settings.
OpenWeb supports initiatives of greater transparency and control for users, and offers the following options for controlling the interest-based content and ads you receive: If you reside in the EU and do not want to receive interest-based ads displayed by OpenWeb, you can disable the display of such ads by visiting the EDAA consumer choice page at www.youronlinechoices.eu.
You may also use the NAI opt out tool, which will allow you to opt out of seeing targeted ads from other NAI-approved member companies, and for mobile opt outs, the NAI provides instructions to engage system-level opt outs in Android, iOS, and Windows Phone environments. 
If you reside in California and wish to opt-out of the âsaleâ of your personal information, as defined under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), please follow the instructions in Section â8 below. 
Please note that opting out will not prevent you from seeing ads sourced from us on our Services or on other websites, but it will affect the types of ads that you will see.
These ads will no longer be tailored to your interests and instead will be chosen based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e.
contextually based ads).
Because our tracking mechanisms operate at the device and browser level, to fully opt-out across devices, you will need to do so on each device and browser individually.
Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit the EDAA consumer choice page, your-opt out may not be effective.
6.
Communications

Service Communications: We may contact you with important information regarding our Services.
For example, we may notify you (through any of the means available to us, e.g.
phone, mobile, web notifications or e-mail) of changes or updates to our Services, billing issues, service changes, password-retrieval notices, etc.
Typically, you will not be able to opt-out of receiving such service communications while using our Services, as they are integral to such use.

Notifications and Promotional Communications: We may send you notifications, messages and other updates about new features, offerings, events and special opportunities or any other information we think our Users or Partners will find valuable.
We may provide such notices through any of the contact means available to us, through the Services, or through our marketing campaigns on any other sites or platforms.
If you do not wish to receive such promotional communications, you may notify OpenWeb at any time by changing your communications preferences in your account, by following the âunsubscribeâ, âstopâ, âopt-outâ or âchange e-mail preferencesâ instructions contained in the promotional communications you receive, or by sending an email to privacy@openweb.com.
7.
Data Security
In order to protect your Personal Data held with us and our Service Providers, we are using industry-standard physical, procedural and electronic security measures, including encryption as appropriate.
However, please be aware that regardless of any security measures used, we cannot and do not guarantee the absolute protection and security of any Personal Data stored with us or with any third parties as described in Section 4 above.
8.
Data Subject Rights
If you wish to exercise your rights under any applicable law, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), such as the right to request access to, and rectification or erasure of your Personal Data held with OpenWeb, or to restrict or object to such Personal Dataâs processing, or to port such Personal Data, or to opt-out of the sale of your personal information, or the right to equal services and prices (each to the extent available to you under the laws which apply to you) â please follow the instructions available on our dedicated CCPA or GDPR pages, or contact us by email at privacy@openweb.com.
Please note that once you contact us by e-mail, we may require additional information and documents, including certain Personal Data, in order to authenticate and validate your identity and to process your request.
Such additional data will be then retained by us for legal purposes (e.g.
as proof of the identity of the person submitting the request), in accordance with Section 3 above.

Childrenâs Privacy

Our Services are not designed to attract children under the age of 16.
We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children and do not wish to do so.
If we learn that a person under the age of 16 is using the Services, we will prohibit and block such use and will make all efforts to promptly delete any Personal Data stored with us with regard to such child.
If you believe that we might have any such data, please contact us by email at privacy@openweb.com.
10.
Data Controller/Processor
Certain data protection laws and regulations, such as the EU GDPR or the CCPA, typically distinguish between two main roles for parties processing Personal Data: the âData Controllerâ (or under the CCPA, âbusinessâ), who determines the purposes and means of processing.
and the âData Processorâ (or under the CCPA, âservice providerâ), who processes the data on behalf of the Data Controller.
Below we explain how these roles apply to our Services, to the extent that such laws and regulations apply.
OpenWeb is typically the âData Controllerâ of its Visitorsâ, its Usersâ and its Partnersâ Personal Data, and with respect to which, assumes the responsibilities of Data Controller (solely to the extent applicable under law), as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
Under the CCPA, we are either the âbusinessâ with respect to Usersâ Personal Data (if the User are directly engaged with us), or a âthird partyâ (if such Users do not directly engage with us, whilst we process their personal information on our own behalf).
In the relationship between a publishing Partner and OpenWeb, such Partner shall act as âData Controllerâ (or âbusinessâ under the CCPA) with respect to its own end-users and Users of their Partner Site(s).
In certain instances, OpenWeb will only be deemed as the Data Processor (or service provider) regarding such end-usersâ Personal Data, if we process such end-usersâ data on behalf of our Partner and in accordance with its reasonable instructions, subject to our Terms of Use and other commercial agreements.

If you would like to make any requests or queries regarding Personal Data we process on our Partnerâs behalf, please contact such Partner directly. For example, if you are an end-user of our Partner who wishes to access, correct, or delete data processed by OpenWeb on behalf of such Partner, please direct your request to the relevant Partner.
