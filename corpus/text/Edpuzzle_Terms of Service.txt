Additionally, when the Service is utilized by an educational institution managing student "Educational Records," some User Submissions may be deemed part of said education records (as defined in the "FERPA and Student Data" section below).You retain all ownership rights for any User Submissions.
Edpuzzle does not claim any ownership rights over User Submissions.
Nevertheless, if your educational institution, company or organization has purchased a Pro Upgrade and granted you access to Edpuzzle's Pro features, it is possible that your institution, company or organization owns all intellectual property rights inherent to your content, depending on the contents of your employment agreement or the organization's internal regulations.

If you would like to delete any videos that may contain personal information regarding your identity, please review the "How Do I Delete My Account?" section of our Privacy Policy and follow the steps to request deletion.Edpuzzle will not heed any deletion requests of "teacher accounts" or "teacher content" made by the educational institution, company or organization, as this should be handled by the educational institution, company or organization itself in accordance with its internal regulations or teacher employment agreements.Additionally, when you delete IP content, Education Records, or personal information, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle or trash bin on a computer.

Additionally, certain information, provided to Edpuzzle by School Personnel about a student, such as student name and grade level, may be considered directory information under FERPA (âDirectory Informationâ) and thus not an Education Record.
A school may not generally disclose personally identifiable information from an eligible studentâs education records to a third party without written consent of the parent and/or eligible student or without meeting one of the exemptions set forth in FERPA (âFERPA Exemption(s)â), including the exemption for Directory Information (âDirectory Information Exemptionâ) or disclosure to school officials with a legitimate educational interest (âSchool Official Exemptionâ).As School Personnel or the Institution providing Directory Information or any Education Record to Edpuzzle, you acknowledge, affirm and pledge to Edpuzzle, as applicable, that your Institution has:

Additionally, information collected directly from a student using Edpuzzle is never used or disclosed for third-party advertising, or any kind of first- or third-party behaviorally-targeted advertising, and personal information collected from a student is never sold or rented to anyone.
This section shall not be construed (i) to prohibit Edpuzzle from marketing or advertising directly to parents so long as the marketing or advertising did not result from the use of Education Records to provide behaviorally-targeted advertising or (ii) to limit the ability of Edpuzzle to use student information or Education Records for adaptive learning or customized student learning purposes.Edpuzzle may use Education Records that have been de-identified for product development, research or other purposes (âDe-Identified Dataâ).
De-Identified Data will have all direct and indirect personal identifiers removed.

Upon termination of your account, your right to use the Service will cease immediately.
All provisions of this Agreement which, by their nature, should survive termination, shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.Dispute Resolution(A) Generally: in the interest of resolving disputes between you and the Company in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and the Company agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with these Terms of Service shall be resolved by binding arbitration.
Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.
Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts.
Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.
Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to, all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy, including any other Guidelines and future modifications, whether based on contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms of Service.
You understand and agree that, by entering into these Terms of Service, you and the Company are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.(B) Exceptions: notwithstanding subsection (A), we both agree that nothing herein shall be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either our right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.(C) Arbitration: any arbitration between you and the Company will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by these Terms of Service, and will be administered by the AAA.
The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting the Company.(D) Notice: a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail ("Notice").
The Company's address for Notice is:Edpuzzle, Inc.
833 Market Street, Suite 427, San Francisco, CA 94103, United States of America The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.
and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand").
We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or the Company may commence an arbitration proceeding.
During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or the Company shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.
provided that our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, the Company shall pay you the greater of (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, (ii) the greatest amount offered by the Company in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitratorâs award.(E) Fees: in the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms of Service, the Company will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by the AAA Rules.
Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in San Francisco, California, provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.
If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
In such case, you agree to reimburse the Company for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.
Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.
The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitratorâs ruling on the merits.(F) No Class Actions: you and the Company agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.
Furthermore, unless both you and the Company agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one personâs claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.(G) Enforceability: if only Subsection F of this Section or the entirety of this Section is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described elsewhere in this Section shall govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms of Service.Limitation of LiabilityWe provide our Service using a commercially reasonable level of skill and care and we hope that you will enjoy using it.
