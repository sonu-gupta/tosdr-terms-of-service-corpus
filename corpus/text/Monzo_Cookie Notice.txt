        Cookies help us keep you and Monzo safe, give you a better experience and show you more relevant ads
Think of cookies as stickers - when you visit a site, the site puts a sticker on you so that it knows if you come back and can collect information about your visit.
That lets the site show things relevant to you, based on information youâve entered and stuff youâve looked at.
The length of time stored depends on the cookie, but this is generally between a few minutes and up to two years.
We use these kinds of cookies on monzo.com:

Cookies to help keep you and Monzo safe (you can't turn these off)
Cookies to give you a better experience (you can turn these off)
Cookies to help show you more relevant ads (you can turn these off)

Most are third-party cookies that belong to another website than monzo.com.
Some are our own.
So you know, the cookies we use never store or access any of your banking details.

Cookies that help keep you and Monzo safe
Some cookies help us keep you (and us) safe.
Because we need them to keep our site secure, you can't turn them off.
For example, we use Cloudflare cookies to protect our site against attacks.
Cookies that give you a better experience
We use analytics cookies like Google Analytics to see where you spend your time on our website, and work out which bits of Monzo.com are most (and least) effective.
This helps us know whatâs working, what might be broken and what we should improve.
We also use cookies to recognise you when you come back to our site.
When we spot itâs you, we know whether or not to show you things youâve already seen (like our cookie banner).

 Cookies to help show you more relevant ads
We use cookies from companies like Facebook to show you more relevant ads for things we think youâd like.
For example, if youâve browsed pages about our Savings Pots, we may decide you could be interested in saving and show you an ad about savings on Facebook.
We also use cookies to exclude you from some advertising campaigns.
For example, once you set up your Monzo account, weâll use this data to stop showing you ads asking you to install the app.
You can turn these off using the toggle below if you like.
