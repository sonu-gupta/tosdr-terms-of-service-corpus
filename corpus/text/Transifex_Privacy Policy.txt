Consent
You have given us clear and explicit consent to process your personal information.
If you have previously given consent to processing your information, you can withdraw such consent at any time.
You can do this by emailing us at  privacy@transifex.com.
If you do withdraw your consent, and if we do not have another legal basis for processing your information we will stop processing your personal information.

Processing your information is necessary for a contract to be formulated and executed in order for us to be able to provide our products and services or because such information is necessary before entering into that contract.

Existing customers
If you have been our customer in the past, we may communicate with you via email, in order to inform you about products and services similar to the ones you showed interest in.

Legitimate interests
Processing your information is necessary for our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of a third party, provided those interests are not outweighed by your rights and interests.
These legitimate interests may include the following:

Delivering, developing and improving our services and products.
Ensuring that our website, platform, and infrastructure operate smoothly.
Determining whether marketing campaigns are effective.
Improving data security.
Gaining insights from your behavior on our website in order to be able to offer you and third-party services and products which they find useful.
To ensure smooth provision of third party services integrated in our site, products, and services.

In each case, we found that these legitimate interests were not outweighed by your rights and interests. If you require further information about the balancing test that Transifex has undertaken to justify its reliance on the legitimate interest legal basis under the GDPR, please see Section âContacting Usâ for further details on how to contact us.
Legal obligation
Processing of your information is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example to provide you with invoices, report to tax authorities etc).

We may share information in those cases where we sell or negotiate to sell our business to a buyer or prospective buyer.
In this situation, Transifex will continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal data and give you notice before your personal data is transferred to the buyer or becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.

5.
European Economic Area Residents
If you are residing in a country that is a member state of the European Economic Area (i.e.
EU, Norway, Lichtenstein, Iceland) and pursuant to applicable data privacy legislation,  we shall make sure that you exercise the following rights:

You have the right to access the information we hold about you.
You can contact us and we shall inform you about:

The categories of data weâre processing.
The purposes of data processing.
The categories of third parties to whom the data may be disclosed.
How long the data will be stored (or the criteria used to determine that period).
Other rights you have regarding our use of your information.


You have the right to ask us to correct or rectify personal information about you if they are inaccurate or incomplete.

You can object to us using your information for profiling you or making automated decisions about you.
Please note that exercising this right does not equal to an obligation on our behalf to not show advertisements at all.
 
You have the right to ask us to directly transfer your information to another service, as long as it is technically feasible or to provide you a copy in a common machine-readable format.
Please note that if such information also contains personal data about another person, we may not choose to include such data in our deliverables.
You have the right to be âforgottenâ.
All you have to do is ask and we will delete your information unless we have another legal reason to hold your personal information (such as a legal claim or a regulatory requirement).
You can ask us not to use your information for direct marketing purposes.

You can exercise all the aforementioned rights by emailing us at privacy@transifex.com.
We shall address your request within 30 days of its receipt unless it is too complicated or we are dealing simultaneously with too many such requests.
In the latter case, it may take us up to two additional months to address your request, but we will let you know if that is the case within 30 days of the receipt of your initial request.
Please note that exercising the above rights presupposes that we have collected such personal information ourselves and/or process them for our own purposes.
If these data have been entrusted to us by third parties while we are providing our services to them (for example while customers upload content on our platforms) we are only processing such data on their behalf and under their instructions (we are processors under EU Law).
Accordingly, if we receive a request from you to exercise your right we are not obliged to address it since such a request should be forwarded to our customers instead (controllers).
When we share some information with third parties, some personal data may be processed, transferred or stored outside of the EU or the EEA (please see the section titled âHow do we share your information?â).
To that extent, we take steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected as outlined in this Privacy Policy and require that any third parties outside the EU or the EEA that have access to your personal data provide us with appropriate safeguards for your information.
We would be happy to spend the time and effort necessary to address any of your privacy concerns, however, if you believe that your rights have not been properly addressed you can file a complaint regarding our use of your information to the Data Protection Authority of your habitual residence or place of work.
6.
Word Retention
We will retain your information, which may include general personal information, for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.
If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services, you may delete your account.
We may retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
Consistent with these requirements, we will try to delete your information quickly upon request.
Please note, however, that there might be latency in deleting information from our servers and backed-up versions might exist after deletion.
In addition, we do not delete from our servers files that you have in common with other users.

Our Service offers publicly accessible community services such as blogs, forums, and wikis.

8.
Security
The security of your information is important to us.
 We thus implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to help protect the security of your information.

We follow generally accepted standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
No method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, however.
Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
We have implemented various policies including pseudonymization, encryption, access, and retention policies to guard against unauthorized access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems.
Your password protects your user account, so we encourage you to use a unique and strong password, limit access to your computer and browser, and log out after having used the Transifex Service.
If you have any questions about security on our website, you can contact us at security@transifex.com.
9.
Our Policy Toward Children
Our Services are not directed to persons under 18.
We do not knowingly collect personal data / personally identifiable information from children under 18.
If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at privacy@transifex.com.
If we become aware that a child under 18 has provided us with Personal Information, we will take steps to delete such information from our files.

Changes to our Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy may change from time to time.
If we make a change to this privacy policy that we believe materially reduces your rights, we will provide you with notice (for example, by email).
