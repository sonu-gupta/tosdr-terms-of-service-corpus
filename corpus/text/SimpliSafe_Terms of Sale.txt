Limited Warranty
SimpliSafe warrants to you, the initial purchaser of the System from SimpliSafe or an authorized retailer, that each of the products that make up your SimpliSafe System (âCovered Productsâ) will be free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service for three (3) years from the date that you purchase the Covered Products.
This limited warranty is non-transferrable.
As a condition of this warranty, SimpliSafe may require that you provide proof of purchase during the warranty period and/or return the defective Covered Product.
If SimpliSafe requires the return of the defective Covered Product, return shipping costs will be paid for by SimpliSafe.
Within the warranty period, SimpliSafeâs sole obligations shall be limited to accepting return of the defective product or part of the Covered Product and providing one or more of the following remedies, to be determined at SimpliSafeâs sole discretion:
Replacement of Covered Products:
For valid warranty claims made during the warranty period with respect to Covered Products, SimpliSafe may provide you with a substantially functional equivalent product or part to replace the defective item.
Replacement products provided under this Limited Warranty may be new, repaired or reconditioned, at the sole option of SimpliSafe.
SimpliSafe warrants any replacement products for a three (3) year limited warranty period from the date the replacement parts are shipped to you.
Additionally, if a Covered Product has been discontinued and/or the substantially functional equivalent available replacement product or part to be issued in connection with this warranty would no longer be compatible with your System, at SimpliSafeâs sole discretion, SimpliSafe may offer you additional substantially functional equivalent replacement product(s) to address the compatibility issue.
You understand and agree that this offer to replace other System components to address compatibility issues shall fully satisfy SimpliSafeâs remedy under this or any other applicable product warranty (to the extent this does not contradict or conflict with the terms thereof).
If rejected, you will be deemed to have waived any other rights or remedies under this Limited Warranty.
In no event shall SimpliSafe bear any responsibility for installation any replacement product or part or the cost of such installation.
Refund or Credit:
At SimpliSafeâs sole option and discretion, in lieu of replacing the defective Covered Product, SimpliSafe may instead offer to refund the original purchase price you paid to SimpliSafe or an authorized retailer for the Covered Product.
If the defective Covered Product does not have a separate purchase price, SimpliSafe shall determine a purchase price based upon the overall purchase price of any system that the defective Covered Product may have been a part of.
Such determination shall be solely within SimpliSafeâs discretion.
Subject to availability, and at SimpliSafeâs sole option and discretion, instead of refund you may select a store credit of equal or greater value than the aforementioned refund value (to be determined by SimpliSafe), which may be applied toward other SimpliSafe products or services (to be determined by SimpliSafe).
For the avoidance of doubt, if offered, the store credit remedy option would be offered as an alternative to the refund remedy option, presented for your selection of one or the other.
This refund or credit remedy option shall only be made available at SimpliSafeâs sole discretion and option.

For warranty service, please contact SimpliSafe Customer Support at 1-800-548-9508 or visit www.simplisafe.com/support and click on âContact Usâ.
If SimpliSafe is unable to address the issue that you are facing, SimpliSafe will, subject solely to its discretion, determine the appropriate warranty remedy or warranty remedy option, as listed above.
As explained above, SimpliSafe may, at its discretion, require you return the Covered Product before SimpliSafe determines which warranty remedy option to provide.
In this situation, SimpliSafe will provide you with a prepaid return slip for you to return your old product or part to SimpliSafe.
In the event that SimpliSafe opts to send you a replacement product or part, as a remedy under this Limited Warranty and does not require prior return of such product or part as part of the warranty validation process, such replacement product or part may at SimpliSafeâs discretion still be shipped along with a postage prepaid return slip, and you will return your old product or part to SimpliSafe using such slip.
Failure to return your old product or part in this instance may void any limited warranty on your replacement product or part, to be determined at SimpliSafeâs sole discretion.
This Limited Warranty does not apply in the following cases: failure to follow installation or operating instructions, misuse (which includes, without limitation, using products outdoors unless outdoor use is expressly permitted, and in such cases only as directed, and/or use in improper temperature, humidity or other environmental conditions), alteration, abuse, accident or tampering, or damage or non-performance resulting from use of any item or repair services not provided by SimpliSafe, as well as where your System or any component thereof is obtained from a third party other than SimpliSafe or an authorized retailer.
This Limited Warranty also does not apply if damage was caused by Acts of God, natural disasters, labor disputes, war, terrorism, civil strife, or other causes beyond SimpliSafeâs control (including but not limited to changes impacting the performance, operation or sustainability of third-party communications and technology platforms, networks and protocols).
Consumable parts, such as batteries or battery replacement, and adhesive tapes are excluded from this Limited Warranty.
Products that are tested and found to be in good working condition (not defective) are not covered by this Limited Warranty.
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THIS LIMITED WARRANTY IS EXCLUSIVE AND EXPRESSLY IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, OBLIGATIONS OR LIABILITIES, WHETHER WRITTEN, ORAL, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR OTHERWISE.
SIMPLISAFE DISCLAIMS ALL STATUTORY AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
INSOFAR AS SUCH WARRANTIES CANNOT BE DISCLAIMED, SIMPLISAFE LIMITS THE DURATION AND REMEDIES OF SUCH WARRANTIES TO THE DURATION OF THE LIMITED WARRANTY DESCRIBED ABOVE OR THE SHORTEST PERIOD ALLOWED BY LAW.
IN NO CASE SHALL SIMPLISAFE OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, SUBCONTRACTORS, AGENTS OR REPRESENTATIVES (EACH, A âSIMPLISAFE PARTYâ AND COLLECTIVELY, THE "SIMPLISAFE PARTIES") BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANYONE ELSE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES FOR BREACH OF THIS LIMITED WARRANTY OR ANY OTHER WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER.
THIS WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS.
YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS WHICH VARY FROM STATE TO STATE.
SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS AND DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.
THEREFORE, THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
SimpliSafe does not represent that the System may not be compromised or circumvented.
that the System will prevent any personal injury or property loss.
or that the System will in all cases provide adequate warning or protection.
You understand that the System may be interrupted, circumvented, unavailable (for a limited or extended time period) or otherwise compromised, including as a result of equipment designed or used by a third party for the purpose of causing false alarms or gaining unauthorized access to or otherwise affecting or controlling the System (including any Camera, Smart Lock, or other peripheral SimpliSafe System component).
Furthermore, the SimpliSafe Smart Lock is not an ANSI or BHMA certified door lock or deadbolt, and it must be correctly installed and used with a certified door lock that is operating in good condition.
and used in environmental conditions that fall within the SimpliSafe Smart Lock specifications specified below (or in the corresponding user manual, which shall control in the event of any discrepancy).
You assume all risk associated with the suitability, installation and performance of the door lock and other third-party components, hardware, software and services that you select.
CONSEQUENTLY, NO SIMPLISAFE PARTY, AS DEFINED ABOVE, SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY LOSS, DAMAGE OR EXPENSE (COLLECTIVELY, âLOSSESâ), INCLUDING ANY PROPERTY DAMAGE, PERSONAL INJURY (INCLUDING DEATH), ECONOMIC LOSSES OR ANY OTHER FORM OF LOSS, DAMAGE OR EXPENSE ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH, DUE TO, OR CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY A CLAIM THE SYSTEM FAILED TO GIVE WARNING.
HOWEVER, IF ANY SIMPLISAFE PARTY, AS DEFINED ABOVE, IS HELD LIABLE, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FOR ANY LOSS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH, DUE TO, OR CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THIS LIMITED WARRANTY OR OTHERWISE, THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF ALL SIMPLISAFE PARTIES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE PURCHASE PRICE OF THE SYSTEM, WHICH SHALL BE THE COMPLETE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AGAINST THE SIMPLISAFE PARTIES, AS DEFINED ABOVE.
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT IT IS IMPRACTICAL AND EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE ACTUAL DAMAGES, IF ANY, THAT MAY RESULT FROM A FAILURE OF THE SYSTEM TO GIVE WARNING.
THIS AGREED-UPON AMOUNT (THE PURCHASE PRICE OF THE SYSTEM) IS NOT A PENALTY, AND IS THE SOLE REMEDY.
By purchasing from SimpliSafe, you acknowledge that you have had an opportunity to review SimpliSafe's warranty terms, have done so to the degree you feel you need to be familiar with them, and you accept their terms and conditions, including the limitations, exclusions, and disclaimers.

LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY AND RELEASE
SimpliSafe does not accept liability for Systems purchased hereunder beyond the remedies set forth herein and in SimpliSafe's Limited Warranty.
In particular, as described in SimpliSafe's Limited Warranty, SimpliSafe does not represent that the System may not be compromised or circumvented.
that the System will prevent any personal injury or property loss.
or that the System will in all cases provide adequate warning or protection.
You understand that the System may be interrupted, circumvented, unavailable (for a limited or extended time period) or otherwise compromised, including as a result of equipment designed or used by a third party for the purpose of causing false alarms or gaining unauthorized access to or otherwise affecting or controlling the System (including any Camera).
You understand that a properly installed and maintained alarm may only reduce the risk of a burglary, robbery or other events occurring without providing an alarm, but it is not an insurance or a guarantee that such will not occur or that there will be no personal injury or property loss as a result.
BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, YOU ARE RELEASING EACH SIMPLISAFE PARTY, AS DEFINED ABOVE, ON YOUR BEHALF AND ON BEHALF OF ALL OTHERS WHO MAKE CLAIMS UNDER THE TERMS OF SALE FROM ALL LOSSES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH, DUE TO, OR CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY ANY COVERED CLAIM, AS DEFINED ABOVE.
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL ANY SIMPLISAFE PARTY, AS DEFINED ABOVE, BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE TO YOU FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR PERSONAL INJURY, DEATH OR DAMAGES TO PROPERTY.
NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, EVEN IF A SIMPLISAFE PARTY, AS DEFINED ABOVE, IS FOUND LIABLE FOR ANY LOSSES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH, DUE TO, OR CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY ANY COVERED CLAIM, AS DEFINED ABOVE, ANY SUCH LIABILITY IN THE AGGREGATE OF ALL SIMPLISAFE PARTIES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE PURCHASE PRICE OF THE SYSTEM, WHICH SHALL BE THE COMPLETE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AGAINST ALL SIMPLISAFE PARTIES, AS DEFINED ABOVE.
SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
Release of Insured Losses.
Waiver of Subrogation

You also waive and release any subrogation and other rights you or your insurance company may have against any SimpliSafe Party for money paid to you or on your behalf.

THE DUTY TO DEFEND ARISES UPON THE ASSERTION OF A CLAIM OR DEMAND AGAINST SIMPLISAFE AND DOES SO REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SIMPLISAFE HAS BEEN FOUND LIABLE OR WHETHER SIMPLISAFE HAS INCURRED ANY EXPENSE.
THE FOREGOING INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS MAY NOT BE ENFORCEABLE IN SOME STATES, SO SUCH OBLIGATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

Dispute Resolution and Arbitration
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.
FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW IF YOU WISH TO OPT OUT OF THE REQUIREMENT OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.
Certain portions of this section are deemed to be a âwritten agreement to arbitrateâ pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act.
You and SimpliSafe agree that SimpliSafe intends that this section satisfies the âwritingâ requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act.
In the event of any dispute or disagreement between the parties, or claim or question by a party, arising from or relating to these Terms of Sale or the breach hereof (collectively, a âDisputeâ), the parties hereto shall use their best efforts to settle the Dispute.
To this effect, the parties shall consult and negotiate with each other in good faith and, recognizing their mutual interests, attempt to reach a just and equitable solution satisfactory to both parties.
If the parties do not reach such solution within a period of 60 days then, upon notice by either party to the other, such Dispute shall be finally settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the provisions of its Consumer Arbitration Rules.
Once the Dispute is submitted to the AAA for arbitration each party must pay the appropriate filing fees.
All expenses of the arbitrator and any AAA expenses shall be borne by SimpliSafe.
The parties will remain individually responsible for their own attorney costs or other non-AAA required costs, including but not limited to the expenses of witnesses for either side, which shall be borne by the party producing such witnesses.
If an in-person arbitration hearing is required, then it will be conducted at an American Arbitration Association office that is reasonably convenient for both parties.
If the parties are unable to agree on a location, a determination on location shall be made by the Independent ADR Institution or the neutral arbitrator.
The arbitration will be heard and determined by a single neutral arbitrator selected by the AAA who is a retired judge or a lawyer with not less than 15 years of experience as a practicing member of the bar in the substantive practice area related to the Dispute, who will administer the proceedings in accordance with the AAAâs Consumer Arbitration Rules.
The arbitrator will apply applicable law and the provisions of these Terms of Sale and will determine any Dispute according to the applicable law and facts based upon the record and no other basis.
The arbitratorâs decision must consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim of the Dispute, and must provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and any award (if any) is based.
Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
You can obtain the AAA procedures, rules, and fee information as follows:
AAA: 800.778.7879http://www.adr.org/
In arbitration, as with a court, the arbitrator must honor the terms of these Terms of Sale and can award the prevailing party damages and other relief (including attorneysâ fees).
However, WITH ARBITRATION (A) THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY, (B) THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND ARBITRATION OUTCOME ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY RULES, AND (C) JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATION OUTCOME IS LIMITED.
The parties agree that the arbitration shall be confidential.
All parties to the arbitration will have the right, at their own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other advocate of their choosing.
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU OR SIMPLISAFE WANT TO ASSERT A DISPUTE AGAINST THE OTHER, THEN YOU OR SIMPLISAFE MUST COMMENCE IT (BY DELIVERY OF WRITTEN NOTICE AS SET FORTH IN THE SECTION ENTITLED âOTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONSâ) WITHIN 1 YEAR AFTER THE DISPUTE ARISES -- OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED.
NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT DOES NOT APPLY TO ANY CLAIM SEEKING DAMAGES IN TORT FOR BODILY INJURY, INCLUDING EMOTIONAL OR PSYCHOLOGICAL INJURY, OR PROPERTY DAMAGE OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING CLAIMS FOR LOSS OF USE OR DIMINUTION IN VALUE OF PROPERTY.
IN ADDITION, THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS ACTION BASIS OR ON ANY BASIS INVOLVING ANY DISPUTE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC, OTHER PERSONS OR ENTITIES DOING BUSINESS WITH SIMPLISAFE, OR OTHER PERSONS OR ENTITIES SIMILARLY SITUATED.
FURTHERMORE, ANY DISPUTE BROUGHT BY OR AGAINST SIMPLISAFE MAY NOT BE JOINED OR CONSOLIDATED IN THE ARBITRATION WITH CLAIMS BROUGHT BY OR AGAINST ANY OTHER SIMPLISAFE SUBSCRIBER, UNLESS OTHERWISE AGREED BY THE PARTIES.
FURTHER, THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR AS A MEMBER OF ANY CLASS OF CLAIMANTS PERTAINING TO ANY DISPUTE SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION.
YOU SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE BY PROVIDING WRITTEN NOTICE OF YOUR INTENTION TO DO SO BY EMAILING TOS@SIMPLISAFE.COM WITHIN 60 DAYS OF THESE TERMS OF SALE BECOMING BINDING UPON YOU FOR THE FIRST TIME.
OPTING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE HAS NO EFFECT ON ANY PREVIOUS, OTHER, OR FUTURE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT(S) THAT YOU MAY HAVE WITH SIMPLISAFE.
IF THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE BECOMES BINDING, YOU CAN NOT CHANGE, MODIFY OR REVOKE IT (INCLUDING BY ATTEMPTING TO OPT OUT IN CONNECTION WITH ANY CONFIRMATION OF THE THESE TERMS OF SALE, AS AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME) WITHOUT AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING SIGNED BY SIMPLISAFE.
IN THE EVENT THAT YOU OPT OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS SECTION: YOU AND SIMPLISAFE EACH HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AGREE THAT ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDING ("SUIT") ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH OR DUE TO ANY CLAIM OR DISPUTE THAT HAS ARISEN OR MAY ARISE BETWEEN YOU AND SIMPLISAFE MUST BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY BY A STATE OR FEDERAL COURT LOCATED IN BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS.
YOU AND SIMPLISAFE EACH CONSENT TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF EACH SUCH COURT IN ANY SUCH SUIT AND WAIVE ANY OBJECTION THAT YOU OR SIMPLISAFE MAY HAVE TO JURISDICTION OR VENUE OF ANY SUCH SUIT.
YOU AND SIMPLISAFE EACH CONSENT TO SERVICE OF PROCESS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NOTICE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.
