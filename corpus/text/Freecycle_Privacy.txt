Privacy Policy FAQ

The following are basic questions you may have about our privacy statement.
Where applicable, links are provided to the actual policy statements below this FAQ for further detail.

Why is Freecycle updating its privacy statement?

We now meet the high standard required by the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and have updated our privacy statement to reflect that.
We also continue to simplify language and remove jargon, to make our privacy statement easier to understand and read.

What is the GDPR?

The GDPR is a regulation intended to strengthen and unify data protection for everyone within the European Union (EU).
And because we believe that all our members can benefit from its mandates, we're implementing it globally.
The GDPR requires greater openness and transparency from organisations on how they collect, store and use personal data, while also imposing tighter limits on the use of personal data.

How often do you anticipate updating your privacy statement?

We will update our privacy statement as necessary to ensure that our policies are in line with international regulations, our services and charitable activities.

What information does Freecycle collect about me?

When you visit the Freecycle website and access information, you remain anonymous but to become a member or make a donation we collect personally identifiable information that you voluntarily provide through our website or via e-mail correspondence.

Why does Freecycle need my information?

An email address and an ID is required of members, primarily so that you may then make and receive posts sharing items via email on Freecycle.org.
Further information may be gathered should you make a donation to The Freecycle Network in order to process the gift.

How is my information used?

Freecycle uses the data we collect for the following purposes:

Member / User Support
Service Improvement
Future Services Development
Security, Safety, and Dispute Resolution
Service Performance Analysis
Communications, Fundraising and Marketing


How does collecting my information help Freecycle improve its services?

We use the information to assure that the Freecycle.org web community is functioning smoothly and to make sure that we are offering you the best opportunities to share based on your geographic location.
We also collect error reports, so we can make improvements to eliminate potential bugs and combat fraud.
And finally, understanding how and when our members collectively make use of Freecycle.org helps us design new ways to make sharing that much better.

Does Freecycle sell information to third parties?

No, we donât.

Can I opt out of sharing my information with Freecycle?

You may view Freecycle.org and postings without sharing any personal information.
However, since we donât request sensitive data such as oneâs address, credit card info, etc., we do require a basic level of data (user name, email address) for membership with our charitable nonprofit and for making and replying to posts on Freecycle.org.

How do I delete my personal data from Freecycle and what are the consequences?

You can always alter your personal data or remove you account by editing your account settings here.
If you have further account issues, you may contact our volunteer support team here.
Please note, however, that by deleting your personal data your membership will no longer be functional.

How long does Freecycle keep my information?

Freecycle retains personal data for as long as necessary to provide the services and fulfill the interactions you have requested, or for other essential purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes and enforcing our agreements.
Because these needs can vary for different data types in the context of different services, actual retention periods can vary significantly.
For instance, weâll keep all functional data on file as long as you have an active Freecycle account.

How is information stored and secured on Freecycleâs servers?

Freecycle is committed to protecting the security of your personal data.
Freecycle.org uses the HTTPS protocol.
The 'S' at the end of HTTPS stands for 'Secure'.
It means all communications between your browser and the website are encrypted.
HTTPS is often used to protect highly confidential online transactions like online banking and online shopping order forms.
We also use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal data from unauthorised access, use or disclosure.
For example, we store the personal data you provide on computer systems that have limited access and are in controlled facilities.

Does Freecycle use interest-based advertising?

Yes.
We work with third-party advertisers that utilize cookies and similar technologies to provide more relevant advertising about Freecycle on our website and across the internet.
To provide interest-based advertising, the advertisers combine non-personal data learned about your online activities over time to customize the advertising delivered to you.
We do not share your personal information to do this.

What safeguards are in place for children who have access to Freecycle services?

Children thirteen or older may participate only with the permission and supervision of their parents and/or guardians.
If a child has improperly registered on this site by using false information or without consent, we will cancel the child's account and delete the child's personal information from our records.
