 Social Network &amp.
New Tech Advertising Programs (ADV)

These companies have specific Interest-Based Ads programs that match people that have shown interest in Macy's through our website or other services with their profiles (such as on Facebook) and platforms (such as Facebook and Google properties).

 Macy's Mobile Applications (FUL, ADV, OPS, SEC) 
Macy's offers mobile applications that you may download from your phone or smart device's "app store" as well as apps that you can download from your Internet-connected devices (e.g., smart television).
Macy's mobile applications, with your permission, may use your device's camera, microphone, or location information to enable features or services.
For example, geolocation (e.g., GPS) can help you find a nearby store or learn about upcoming nearby store events.
Another example is in-store locations using Bluetooth signals to connect to our Beacons or our In-Store Wi-Fi Services, which can help you while inside our store to find nearby products or receive real-time offers.
Macy's Mobile Application Preferences are managed in the Macy's application and through your device's settings.
 Beacons (FUL, ADV, OPS, SEC) 
Beacons are small appliances that we use to enhance and make the Macy's in-store experience more interactive.
Beacons broadcast a Bluetooth signal that can be received by Bluetooth-enabled devices, such as a mobile phone, when those devices are within proximity of a beacon.
Beacons do not collect or pull in personal data.
they only push out radio signal pulses to map nearby Bluetooth-enabled devices, much in the same way radar works.
In-app permissions, such as permission to access location and accept Push Notifications (sometimes shown as 'PNS' on your devices), must be enabled for a Beacon to interact with your specific Bluetooth-enabled device.
Interactions with and notifications delivered to your device may include customer service information, in-store directions, offers and advertisements from Macy's as well as other non-Macy's applications and advertisers.
Beacon Preferences are managed through your device (Bluetooth, Location, and PNS settings).
 In-Store Wi-Fi Services (FUL, ADV, OPS, SEC)
Many Macy's locations offer free Wi-Fi Services to visitors.
Wi-Fi routers capture certain data from devices that interact with the router.
Some examples of data automatically collected through our Wi-Fi Service include: 
 Information about your device, including a MAC Address, and telemetry data (such as signal strength and quality) related to your use of our Wi-Fi service.

 Vendors that analyze Wi-Fi data automatically collected to provide operational insights such as foot traffic volumes, dwell times, and how costumers move through our stores.

 Unless we receive consent to use Wi-Fi data in a manner that identifies you or your device(s), Wi-Fi data is anonymously collected or de-identified.
&nbsp.
RFID (FUL, OPS, SEC) 
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags consist of a small chip and antenna that provide a unique identifier for objects.
RFID serves the same purpose as a bar code and must be scanned by a specific type of reader in close proximity to the tag to retrieve tag data.
Macy's uses RFID for inventory management (such as locating shoes in the stock room) and logistics support.
RFID is not used to track or monitor any items once you leave our stores.
 Video Cameras (FUL, OPS, SEC) 
We use cameras in our stores for security purposes, loss prevention, and asset protection.
We also use cameras in our stores for operational purposes, such as such as traffic pattern analysis.
Cameras may include technology to capture demographic information, such as age, gender and dwell time.
We will not use cameras to personally identify you, without your consent, except when the identification is for security, anti-theft, or law enforcement purposes.
 Voice-Enabled Services (FUL, OPS) 
We may use voice-enabled services (VES) to provide you greater functionality and easier shopping experiences with services such as voice search for products (for e.g., "Show me Style &amp.
Company Handbags").
VES will only be used to facilitate specific requests.
Voice files are not used to personally identify an individual and will not be associated within any individual Macy's account.
Voice files will be retained by Macy's and any third party voice-enabled service providers.
Voice-enabled services are opt-in by use.
If you do not wish to opt-in to VES, do not use those features.
VES do not include phone answering machine messages.

Loyalty/Financial Incentives Macy's automatically provides Star Rewards loyalty benefits to Macy's credit cardholders.

To participate as a non-cardholder, you must provide an email (so we can send reward and program-related information), phone number (as the identifier used to track purchases that go toward reward points and to redeem rewards), and birth mont and day (to redeem rewards).
The purpose of the Star Rewards loyalty program is to encourage repeat business with Macy's and enhance your shopping experience.
Repeat customers generally spend more than customers who only shop once or twice a year.
&nbsp.
The benefits provided to customers (or realized by Macy's) vary by customer depending upon the purchases made, whether items are bought in store or online, which offers a customer uses, and many other factors.
Macy's also incurs a variety of expenses related to loyalty benefits.
Those may include, for example, costs associated with discounts on purchases and free shipping.
The benefits are reasonably related to the value of the data you provide.&nbsp.

Safeguarding information macys.com and macysbackstage.com have put in place various procedural, technical, and administrative measures to safeguard the information we collect and use.
We designed our technology-enabled services to accept orders only from Web and mobile browsers that permit communication through a Secure Socket Layer (SSL).
SSL is an encryption standard that provides a layer of security while information is being transmitted over the Internet.

As a matter of policy, we do not disclose details regarding our security measures as this could be beneficial information to criminals and other bad actors.

Be advised, no security safeguards or standards are guaranteed to provide 100% security.
You should always use appropriate self-protection measures and practice safe browsing on all websites.
For more information on how you can securely shop with us, please click here to review our Security Tips.
The National Cybersecurity Alliance also provides comprehensive information to stay safe online.

Additionally, sometimes bad actors attempt to use our brand to create fake web pages, send fake texts or emails, and conduct other illegal activities to commit fraud or attempt to breach consumers' security.
We actively monitor for these illegal scams and shams.
We provide FAQ's and Consumer Protection Alerts in our Customer Protection Center (CPC) as we learn of these activities.
If you receive anything with the Macy's brand that seems suspicious, you can check to see if there is an alert on the CPC or call our Customer Service Department.

Additional Disclosures 1.
Information About Children Under 13 
The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act imposes requirements on Web sites that collect personal information about children under 13 years old (for example - name, address, email address, social security number, etc.).
Our current policy is not to collect any personal information on any person under 13 years old online.
For this reason, our sweepstakes and other promotions conducted online are restricted to entrants who are at least 13 years old.
If this policy changes, we will revise this portion of our Notice of Privacy Practices and will comply with the requirements of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, which includes providing notice and choice to each child's parent or guardian before collecting any personal information.
 2.
Opt-In Consent for Minors 
Macy's services are offered to the customers who are of the age 16 years and above.
No programs, services or offerings are intended for children under the age of 16.
Also, credit products are not available for the customer below the age of 18 years.

In this process, Borderfree makes the sale to you as the merchant of record.
When ordering a product, you will be presented with Borderfree's terms and conditions.
You must agree to them to receive the product(s) you ordered.
Once you agree that Borderfree may share your personal information with macys.com, that data is protected by this Notice of Privacy Practices, and you consent to the transfer and storage of that information on our servers located in the United States.
Our practices are consistent with both the EU and Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Principles.
 macys.com is committed to resolving any customer concerns regarding their privacy.
