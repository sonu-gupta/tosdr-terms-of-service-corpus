Your Relationship with Firstleaf and Penrose Hill
The Firstleaf website is powered by Penrose Hill.
All wine is sold by Penrose Hill.
Your use of our services and this web site (referred to collectively as the âServicesâ) is subject to the terms of this legal agreement between you and Penrose Hill.
This document sets out the terms of that agreement.
At a minimum your agreement with Penrose Hill will always include the terms and conditions set out in this document.
These are referred to as the âUniversal Terms.â
Your agreement with Penrose Hill will also include the terms of any Legal Notices applicable to the Services.
These are referred to as the âAdditional Terms.â Where Additional Terms apply to a Service, these will be accessible for you to read either within, or through your use of, that Service.
The Universal Terms, together with the Additional Terms, form a legally binding agreement between you and Penrose Hill in relation to your use of the Services.
It is important that you take the time to read them carefully.
This legal agreement is referred to as the âTermsâ.
If there is any contradiction between what the Additional Terms say and what the Universal Terms say, then the Additional Terms shall take precedence in relation to that Service.

Copyright and trademark policies
It is Penrose Hillâs policy to respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable international intellectual property law (including, in the United States, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act) and to terminate the accounts of repeat infringers.


Advertisements
Some of the Services are supported by advertising revenue.
These advertisements may be targeted to the content of information stored on the Services, queries made through the Services or other information.
The manner, mode and extent of advertising by Penrose Hill on the Services are subject to change without specific notice to you.
In consideration for Penrose Hill granting you access to and use of the Services, you agree that Penrose Hill may place such advertising on the Services.


Other content
The Services may include hyperlinks to other web sites or content or resources.
Penrose Hill may have no control over any web sites or resources which are provided by companies or persons other than Penrose Hill.
You acknowledge and agree that Penrose Hill is not responsible for the availability of any such external sites or resources, and does not endorse any advertising, products or other materials on or available from such websites or resources.
You acknowledge and agree that Penrose Hill is not liable for any loss or damage which may be incurred by you as a result of the availability of those external sites or resources, or as a result of any reliance placed by you on the completeness, accuracy or existence of any advertising, products or other materials on, or available from, such websites or resources.


Changes to the Terms
Penrose Hill may make changes to the Universal Terms or Additional Terms from time to time.
When these changes are made, Penrose Hill will make a new copy of the Universal Terms available at service@firstleaf.club, and any new Additional Terms will be made available to you from within, or through, the affected Services.
You understand and agree that if you use the Services after the date on which the Universal Terms or Additional Terms have changed, Penrose Hill will treat your use as acceptance of the updated Universal Terms or Additional Terms.


General legal terms
Sometimes when you use the Services, you may (as a result of, or through your use of the Services) use a service or download a piece of software, or purchase goods, which are provided by another person or company.
Your use of these other services, software or goods may be subject to separate terms between you and the company or person concerned.
If so, the Terms do not affect your legal relationship with these other companies or individuals.
The Terms constitute the whole legal agreement between you and Penrose Hill and govern your use of the Services (but excluding any services which Penrose Hill may provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replace any prior agreements between you and Penrose Hill in relation to the Services.
You agree that Penrose Hill may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms, by email, regular mail, or postings on the Services.
You agree that if Penrose Hill does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the Terms (or which Penrose Hill has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Penrose Hillâs rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Penrose Hill.
If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of these Terms is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the Terms without affecting the rest of the Terms.
The remaining provisions of the Terms will continue to be valid and enforceable.
You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Penrose Hill is the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the Terms and that such other companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the Terms which confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them.
Other than this, no other person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the Terms.
The Terms, and your relationship with Penrose Hill under the Terms, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.
Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms, the Services or the relationship between you and us shall be settled by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association using the AAA's Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
Such arbitration shall be specific to you, and as such, you agree that you shall not bring or participate in any action against Penrose Hill as part of a class action either in arbitration or in any court.
In the event the foregoing is held to be unenforceable by any court, You and Penrose Hill agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the State of Delaware to resolve any legal matter arising from the Terms.
Notwithstanding this, you agree that Penrose Hill shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.
