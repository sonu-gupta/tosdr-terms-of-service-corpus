(d) any errors in the Service will be corrected.

COING and/or its suppliers make no representations about the suitability, reliability, availability, continuity, timeliness, and accuracy of the Service and Software.
Without limiting the foregoing, Clockify is not designed or licensed for use in hazardous environments requiring fail-safe controls (for example, aircraft navigation/communication systems, air traffic control, medical device and life support machines, or weapon systems) in which the failure of the Software could lead to death, personal injury or physical and environmental damage ('High-Risk Activities').
Accordingly, this Agreement excludes any High-Risk Activities and User agrees not to use the Software in connection with High-Risk Activities.
In connection to Cloud Clockify, COING reserves the right (but has no obligation) to do any of the following, at any time:

(1) to modify, suspend or terminate operation of or access to Clockify, or any part of the Service or any feature for any reason,
(2) to modify, change, upgrade Clockify or any part of it,
(3) to interrupt the operation of Clockify or any part of it, as necessary to perform routine or non-routine maintenance, error correction, or other changes.

without notice to Users who are not Subscribers, with one month's notice to Subscribers and with two-month notice to Clients. 15.
LIMITATION AND EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY To the maximum extent permitted by the applicable law, COING and/or its suppliers, employees and representatives shall be liable in no event for:

(1) any loss, damage, expense or other harmful consequences resulting from anyone's use or inability to use Clockify;
(2) any installation, implementation, customization or modification of the Software not carried out by COING;
(3) any failure to apply available update, service pack, fix or upgrade that would have avoided the harmful event;
(4) any unauthorized access to the User Content;
(5) any unauthorized use of any User's credentials.

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall COING and/or its suppliers, employees and representatives be liable for: any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential damages or any damages whatsoever (including, without limitation, damages for loss of use, data or profits, or business interruption) arising out of or in any way connected:

â with the use or performance of Clockify,
â with the delay or inability to use Clockify and the Service, including the provision of or failure to provide Services,
â with information, Website, Software, products, Service and related graphics obtained through Clockify, or otherwise arising out of the use of Clockify, whether based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability or otherwise.

In the event that any of the foregoing limitations are deemed unenforceable or in the event any liability of COING is established, to the greatest extent permitted by law, You agree that the entire aggregate liability of COING and sole remedy available to any User in any case in any way arising out of or relating to the Agreement, Software or the Service shall be limited to monetary damages that in the aggregate may not exceed the sum of any amount paid (if any) by that User during the twelve months prior to notice to COING of the dispute for which the remedy is sought.
If the User had no obligation to make such payment during such a period, monetary damages that in the aggregate may not exceed the sum of $100 (hundred dollars).
You agree that this limitation of liability represents a reasonable allocation of risk and is a fundamental element of the basis of the bargain between COING and you.
You understand that the Website, Services and Software would not be provided without such limitations.
Some countries do not allow the limitation of certain damages, so some or all of this limitation of liability may not apply to you and you may have additional rights.
Nevertheless, if any portion of these sections is held to be invalid under the applicable law, the invalidity of such portion shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of the applicable sections.
Section 15 does not exclude mandatory liability for:

(a) Wilful breach by COING of any of its obligations;
(b) Death or personal injury caused by a defective item produced by COING.

Neither Party shall be liable for breaching its obligations due to a circumstance they reasonably could not have foreseen and which is beyond their control, such as, e.g., a force of nature, an act of a legislative or an executive authority, war, civil unrest, act of terror, strike, non-trivial cyber attack, failure of a third-party hosting, Internet failure or any other circumstance qualifying as force majeure under the applicable law â to the extent that the respective circumstance prevented or hindered the Party's performance.
For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this section:

(a) are not intended to derogate from, or limit the application of, any statutory limitation or exclusion of liability;
(b) shall not be construed to limit the amount of, or excuse User from paying, any fee or other consideration owed hereunder.

Security policy is applicable only to User Content on Cloud Clockify.
COING has no control and cannot be held liable for the breach of security of any Userâs data outside Cloud Clockify (for example, when a User installs Clockify desktop app, some data may be stored locally).
Security policy also does not apply to the security of a Clientâs data (please see Section 25.6.
of these Terms of Use for more information). 16.
