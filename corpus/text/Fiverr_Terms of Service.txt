Studio Members can ask to be removed from a Studio Gig at any time.
Studio Gigs: A Studio Gig provides a bundle of services (from two services and up to five) within one Gig.
A Studio Gigâs minimum price is US$100.
As Studio Gig is comprised of several services, every service includes its own pricing, pricing factors, and a Studio Member / Lead that is accountable for such service, all of which is defined by the Studio Lead when creating the Studio Gig.

 Shipping Physical Deliverables Some of the services on Fiverr are delivered physically (arts and crafts, collectable items, etc.).

Sellers can add shipping charges for local shipping (within the same country) and for international shipping (anywhere else).

Gigs that include shipping costs must have physical deliverables sent to Buyers.
Shipping costs added to a Gig only pertains to the cost Sellers require to ship physical items to Buyers.

An Order is marked as Complete after it is marked as Delivered and then accepted by a Buyer.
An Order will be automatically marked as Complete if not accepted and no request for modification was submitted within 3 days after the Order was marked as Delivered.
We encourage our Buyers and Sellers to try and settle conflicts amongst themselves.
If for any reason this fails after using the Resolution Center or if you encounter non-permitted usage on the Site, users can contact Fiverr's Customer Support department for assistance here.
For more information about disputes, Order cancellations and refunds please refer to the Payment Terms.
Orders through the Logo Maker are completed once payment is made by the Buyer.
A milestone (on an Order with milestones) is marked as Complete after it is delivered by the Seller and then accepted by the Buyer.
A milestone will be automatically marked as complete if no acceptance or request for modification were submitted within 8 days after marked as Delivered, however, in such case the Order will be stopped and all further milestones will not start.
Once a milestone is delivered and accepted, Buyers may choose to either continue with the Order and pay for the next milestone, or to stop the Order.
If Buyer does not pay for the next milestone within 10 days of acceptance of previous milestones, the order of the next milestone will not start.
Please note that if you choose to stop the Order, the current ordered milestone will not be cancelled.

 Handling Orders 
When a Buyer orders a Gig, the Seller is notified by email as well as notifications on the site while logged into the account.
Sellers are required to meet the delivery time they specified when creating their Gigs.
Failing to do so will allow the Buyer to cancel the Order when an Order is marked as late and may harm the Seller's status.
Sellers must send completed files and/or proof of work using the Deliver Completed Work button (located on the Order page) to mark the Order as Delivered.
Users are responsible for scanning all transferred files for viruses and malware.
Fiverr will not be held responsible for any damages which might occur due to site usage, use of content or files transferred.
Buyers may use the "Request Revisions" feature located on the Order Page while an Order is marked as Delivered if the delivered materials do not match the Seller's description on their Gig page or they do not match the requirements sent to the Seller at the beginning of the order process.
 Reviews 
Feedback reviews provided by Buyers while completing an Order are an essential part of Fiverr's rating system.
Reviews demonstrate the Buyer's overall experience with the Sellers and their service.
Buyers are encouraged to communicate to the Seller any concerns experienced during their active order in regards to the service provided by the Seller.
Leaving a Buyer's feedback is a basic prerogative of a Buyer.
Feedback reviews will not be removed unless there are clear violations of our Terms of Service and/or our Community Standards.
To prevent any misuse of our Feedback system, all feedback reviews must come from legitimate sales executed exclusively through the Fiverr platform from users within our Community.
Purchases arranged, determined to artificially enhance Seller ratings, or to abuse the Fiverr platform with purchases from additional accounts, will result in a permanent suspension of all related accounts.
Feedback comments given by Buyers are publicly displayed on a Sellerâs Gig page.
Work Samples are the delivered images and videos sent to a Buyer in a delivery message.
Work Samples are added to a Seller's Live Portfolio on their Gig page if the Buyer chooses to publish the Work Sample while providing a public feedback review.
Withholding the delivery of services, files, or information required to complete the Gigâs service with the intent to gain favorable reviews or additional services is prohibited.
Responding and posting a review: Once work is delivered, the Buyer has three days to respond.
If no response is provided within the response period, the Order will be considered completed.
Users are allowed to leave reviews on Orders up to 10 days after an Order is marked as complete.
No new reviews may be added to an Order after 10 days.
Sellers may not solicit the removal of feedback reviews from their Buyers through mutual cancellations.
Feedback reviews are unavailable for orders made through the Logo Maker.
 Disputes and Cancellations We encourage our Buyers and Sellers to try and settle conflicts amongst themselves.
If for any reason this fails after using the Resolution Center or if you encounter non-permitted usage on the Site, users can contact Fiverr's Customer Support department for assistance here.
For more information about disputes, Order cancellations and refunds please refer to the Payment Terms.

Ownership Ownership and limitations: When purchasing a Gig on Fiverr, unless clearly stated otherwise on the Seller's Gig page/description, when the work is delivered, and subject to payment, the Buyer is granted all intellectual property rights, including but not limited to, copyright in the work delivered from the Seller, and the Seller waives any and all moral rights therein.
Accordingly, the Seller expressly assigns to the Buyer the copyright in the delivered work.
All transfer and assignment of intellectual property to the Buyer shall be subject to full payment for the Gig, and the delivery may not be used if payment is cancelled for any reason.
For removal of doubt, in custom created work (such as art work, design work, report generation etc.), the delivered work and its copyright shall be the exclusive property of the Buyer and, upon delivery, the Seller agrees that it thereby, pursuant to these Terms of Service, assigns all right, title and interest in and to the delivered work to the Buyer.
Some Gigs (including for custom created work) charge additional payments (through Gig Extras) for a Commercial Use License.
This means that if you purchase the Gig for personal use, you will own all rights you require for such use, and will not need the Commercial Use License.
If you intend to use it for any charge or other consideration, or for any purpose that is directly or indirectly in connection with any business, or other undertaking intended for profit, you will need to buy the Commercial Use License through a Gig Extra and will have broader rights that cover your business use.
For Voice Over Gigs, when the work is delivered, and subject to payment, the Buyer is purchasing basic rights, (which means the Buyer is paying a one time fee allowing them to use the work forever and for any purpose except for commercials, radio, television and internet commercial spots).
If you intend to use the Voice Over to promote a product and/or service (with the exception of paid marketing channels), you will need to purchase the Commercial Rights (Buy-Out) through Gig Extra.
If you intend to use the Voice Over in radio, television and internet commercials, you will need to purchase the Full Broadcast Rights (Buy-Out) through Gig Extra.
For further information on the type of buy-outs, please read below.
Furthermore, users (both Buyers and Sellers) agree that unless they explicitly indicate otherwise, the content users voluntarily create/upload to Fiverr, including Gig texts, photos, videos, usernames, user photos, user videos and any other information, including the display of delivered work, may be used by Fiverr for no consideration for marketing and/or other purposes.
