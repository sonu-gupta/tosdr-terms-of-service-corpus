Personal data we process and collect
 When you visit our website and services, your IP address and user agent are automatically processed by our web server.
This is technically always necessary.
Then, our server needs your IP address to send responses (e.g.
website content) to your browser.
By default, we do not process any other personal data of you.
The legal basis for the processing your IP address and user agent is Article 6(1) lit.
b GDPR.
Our legitimate interest is to provide our content if you want to access it.
 Session identifiers  While currently logged in, we keep a temporary session identifier on your computer that your software uses to prove your authentication state.
This is erased immediately after you log out or the session expires.
We do not use these identifiers to track your visit or evaluate how you use the services provided by us.
 We do not use any third party cookies or tracking of any kind.
 Logging  By default, no identifiable data such as IP addresses of any user for any service are retained.
To fix problems or stop attacks, it may be necessary to temporarily store access or error logs.
If this is the case we store data such as but not limited to a timestamp, your IP, your useragent and the URL you access.
The data collected is kept for as long as is necessary to resolve the problem, but for a maximum of 24 hours.
This is different for the email server! Full maillogs (they include IP address and maybe other informations like your client) are kept for 24 hours.
This is needed to prevent abuse (spam, malware) and to get aware of issues with remote mailservers (bounces, blacklisting).
 E-Mail Support  The content and the fact of any mail will not be connected to any of your accounts expect you tell us in an email which account you are using.
We periodically delete old requests that are closed (at the latest after one year).

For example we need your username or mail address to allocate data.
You can either delete your user account on the respective service or by writing us an email to support@snopyta.org with your deletion request.

However, sharing data with other service provider is the user's choice and is configured by the users in their settings per service including the decision of with whom and what to share.
