 MoodleCloud policy Privacy Notice 
Last updated 7 Oct 2019

This Privacy Notice tells you how we, Moodle Pty Ltd, will collect and use your personal data to provide our service which allows educators, of any kind, to create a private space online, filled with tools that easily create courses and activities, all optimized for collaborative learning.
The Moodle software is free and open source, and may be hosted by Moodle Pty Ltd, but also by anyone who wishes to manage an installation.
This notice will tell you how Moodle Pty Ltd uses your data, but if the site you are using isnât hosted by Moodle Pty Ltd, then your data controller will have added their own specific information to it as well, on how your data is used by them. Who are we? Moodle Pty Ltd is a software company which allows educators, of any kind, to create a private space online, filled with tools that easily create courses and activities, all optimized for collaborative learning.
The Moodle software is open source, and may be hosted by Moodle Pty Ltd, but also by anyone who wishes to manage an installation. Whatâs covered by this Privacy Notice? Under the EUâs General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) personal data is defined as: âany information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (âdata subjectâ).
an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural personâ.
All data subjects whose personal data is collected, in line with the requirements of the GDPR.

where Moodle Pty Ltd is hosting a website on its own behalf, it is the Data Controller for all the data collected.
Where Moodle Pty Ltd is hosting someone elseâs installation of the Moodle Platform (as with MoodleCloud) it is the Data Processor for the site admin for that installation.
when Moodle Pty Ltd is not hosting an installation of the software platform, it is neither the Data Controller nor the Data Processor and those duties fall on the people or organizations who have installed and are hosting those installations.
 Why does Moodle Pty Ltd need to collect and store personal data? In order for Moodle Pty Ltd to provide you with MoodleCloud and other Moodle hosted websites we need to collect personal data for correspondence purposes and/or to allow us to provide you our service(s).
We are committed to ensuring that the information we collect and use is appropriate for this purpose.

Any third parties that we may share your data with are obliged to keep your details securely, and to use them only to deliver the service they provide on our and of course, your behalf.
When they no longer need your data to fulfil this service, they will dispose of the details in line with Moodle Pty Ltdâs procedures.
