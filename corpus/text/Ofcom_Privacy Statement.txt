         General Privacy Statement â How we handle your personal data Add to Your Pages

Ofcom ('the Office of Communications') is the communications regulator for the United Kingdom.
It collects and processes personal data that it needs to carry out its statutory functions and to operate as a public body, including employing and contracting staff.
This general statement covers all of these various purposes.
In most cases we will collect that data from you directly (for example, if you are applying for a licence from us), however from time to time we might need to collect personal data about you from a third party, such as your communications provider.
In accordance with our legal obligations this General Privacy Statement sets out the information you need to know about the way in which Ofcom will collect, process and store your personal data, how long we will keep it for, your rights in connection with that data, and the people with whom we may need to share it.
Whenever we request personal data for a specific purpose that is not covered in this General Privacy Statement we will explain why we need that information and our lawful basis for collecting it.
Similarly, if in the future we intend to process your data for a purpose other than that for which it was collected, we will provide you with information on that purpose and any other relevant information.
Ofcom is committed to protecting your privacy in accordance with data protection legislation. Why is Ofcom collecting my personal data? Ofcom collects personal data that it needs to perform its statutory functions, to operate as an organisation and to comply with its legal obligations.
