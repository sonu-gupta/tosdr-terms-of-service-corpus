         California "Do Not Sell My Info" Notice 
Effective date: April 1, 2020


â
As discussed in more detail in our Webflow Privacy Policy, we do not sell our usersâ personal information in the traditional sense (i.e., in exchange for payment).  
However, the California Consumer Privacy Act (âCCPAâ) defines the term âsaleâ very broadly, including in such a way that transfers of information relating to advertising cookies could be considered a sale.&nbsp.
As described in our Cookie Policy, we work with certain third party services to assist us in delivering interest-based advertisements to you.  
If you are a California resident, and to the extent that any of these services are considered a âsaleâ of personal information under the CCPA, then you have the right to opt-out of the sale.&nbsp.
Below please find a description of the ways in which you may do so.  
For further information on how California residents may exercise their rights, please see our Privacy Policy.&nbsp.
California residentsâ CCPA sale opt-outs include:
