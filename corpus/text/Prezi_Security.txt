Infrastructure and network security &nbsp.

&nbsp.
&nbsp.

Network ACLs

We follow a microservice architecture in which the different services are loosely coupled and each of them is responsible only for a specific feature or function within the application. 
Access is restricted to the microservices on a networking level.
Services and databases hosted by AWS, by default, are not accessible from anywhere.
explicit inbound rules must be added manually.

&nbsp.

Change monitoring

To ensure that changes potentially affecting the security of the infrastructure are quickly detected, an automated solution was developed by the Security Team that creates alerts in the ticketing system for review.  &nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.

Automated vulnerability scanning

Automated black-box vulnerability scans are executed both periodically and in reaction to infrastructural changes in our cloud environment in order to quickly identify potentially vulnerable systems.

Third-party penetration tests

At least on an annual basis, we engage an independent third-party auditor to perform an infrastructure- and application-level penetration test.

Responsible Disclosure Program

As a result of our public Responsible Disclosure Program (https://prezi.com/bug-bounty/), both our infrastructure and application are continuously scanned by vulnerability scanners and enthusiastic security researchers. 

Security Incident Event Management (SIEM)

Our SIEM solution collects, processes, and correlates detailed logs from our cloud infrastructure, from the nodes running on it, and from the applications themselves.
The security team operates as a security operations center and is responsible for monitoring and responding to both internal and external threats.
The team responds on an ongoing basis to automated alerts opened by different detection mechanisms (e.g.
AWS GuardDuty, AWS Macie, AWS usage logs, threat detection alerts from the infrastructure through Sysdig Falco, detailed security relevant logs from infrastructure components, web security related logs, etc.)

Web Application Firewall (WAF)

We use a next-gen web application firewall solution in blocking mode as a first line of defense in front of all customer-facing web traffic.

Encryption in transit

By default, we use TLS encryption between the Prezi client (either the browser or our desktop/iOS/Android application) and the server.
TLS connection is also set up between servers running in different regions. 
Load balancers are used to terminate TLS with automatic issuance of certificates with strong security parameters (2048-bit RSA public keys with SHA256+RSA signature algorithm).
TLS is also supported for all email communications we have with our customers.

Encryption at rest

Critical customer data (Prezi XMLs and media assets) created after February, 2018 is encrypted on the server side with AES-256.
The encryption is transparent.
keys are managed by our cloud infrastructure provider.

Datacenter

We use a top-tier third-party cloud service provider that is compliant with numerous regulations and privacy standards (EU General Data Protection Regulation, HIPAA, GLBA, HITECH), and possesses industry-recognized certifications (SOC, PCI, FedRAMP, ISO and more).  &nbsp.

Application security 
Security reviews

To highlight potential security risks as early as possible, all architectural plans are reviewed by the Security Team.
On a case-by-case basis, the Security Team also executes threat-modeling exercises in partnership with the engineering teams involved.
As a result, the Security Team interacts on a daily basis with developers and engineers to share security mindset, best practices, and efficient tools.

Static code analysis

We are supporting our secure software development lifecycle with tools that automatically detect code changes against security best practices.
The Security Team reviews all code changes flagged as potential risks, keeps track of open issues, and communicates with engineers to share security-related knowledge and best practices on a daily basis.

Third-Party Penetration tests

At least on an annual basis, we engage with an independent third-party auditor company to perform an infrastructure- and application-level penetration test.

Responsible Disclosure Program

As a result of our public Responsible Disclosure Program (https://prezi.com/bug-bounty/), both our infrastructure and application are continuously scanned by vulnerability scanners and enthusiastic security researchers. 

Auditing

We have detailed user activity logging, including (but not limited to) security-related events like login, password change, presentation creation/deletion/modification, privacy settings, and access rights changes at the application level. &nbsp.

Sharing prezis and data privacy

After creating a presentation, you can protect who sees it by specifically adding collaborators or generating a view link that can be sent to anyone you choose.
You can also make your presentation available for the entire world to see by changing its privacy settings.

Authentication and credential storage

Prezi supports email and password-based authentication along with third-party authentications like Facebook and Google.
The passwords are never stored in plaintext.

Encryption in Transit

By default, we use TLS encryption between the Prezi client (either the browser or our desktop/iOS/Android application) and the server.
TLS connection is also set up between servers running in different regions. 
Load balancers are used to terminate TLS with automatic issuance of certificates with strong security parameters (2048-bit RSA public keys with SHA256+RSA signature algorithm).
TLS is also supported for all email communications we have with you. &nbsp.

Compliance 
SOC2 Type 1 report on Security

We successfully went through an audit by an independent external third-party and obtained a SOC2 report on Security for Prezi .
The report is available upon request to Prezi Business subscribers who sign a nondisclosure agreement.
