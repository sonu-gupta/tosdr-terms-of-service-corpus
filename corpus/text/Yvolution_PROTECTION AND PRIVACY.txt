General

20.1 Aggregate Data: Non-PII Data
As you browse through our website, our web server collects information about your visit, not about you personally.
We gather and monitor statistics such as, for example:
Â· the number of people who visit the websites;
Â· the date and time of visits;
Â· the number of pages viewed;
Â· the amount of time spent on the websites;
Â· the most popular sections of the websites;
Â· thirds party software and third-party service analytics.
This information is anonymous, and no attempt is or will be made to identify visitors.
So, for example, on a specific day we can identify that our websites have fifty thousand visitors.
However, we know nothing about these visitors in terms of email addresses or any other personal information.
From time to time, we may also ask you to provide us with non-PII which does not allow us to identify you by email address, full name, full address or other PII.
We may use this information for internal purposes, or for creating reports for ourselves and third-party advertisers and partners.
Non-PII may be aggregated and used for our internal purposes or may be shared with third parties for any lawful purpose, without your permission.
No third party will know who you are as a result of the use of your non-PII.

20.2 Safety and Security

Further, be sure to delete any PII from the computer before you close it.
We are not responsible if appropriate steps are not followed to delete cached or stored PII.
This will help to ensure that others cannot access your PII.
We take steps to help ensure that all information provided by you, whether PII or non-PII, is treated securely.
No data transmission over the internet or other network, however, can be guaranteed to be totally secure.
While we try to protect your PII, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us.
You use the website, and provide us with PII, at your own risk.
