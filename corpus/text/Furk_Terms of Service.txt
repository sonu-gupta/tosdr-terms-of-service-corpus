GENERAL INFORMATION 
Entire Agreement.
The TOS constitutes the entire agreement between you and Furk.net and governs your use of the Furk.net Services, superseding any prior version of this TOS between you and Furk.net with respect to the Furk.net Services.
You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use or purchase certain other Furk.net Services, affiliate services, third-party content or third-party software.


Choice of Law and Forum.
You and Furk.net each agree that the TOS and the relationship between the parties shall be governed by the laws of the State of New Jersey without regard to its conflict of law provisions and that any and all claims, causes of action or disputes (regardless of theory) arising out of or relating to the TOS, or the relationship between you and Furk.net, shall be brought exclusively in the courts located in New Jersey, and the U.S.
District Court for the District of New Jersey.
You and Furk.net agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of New York, Southern District of New York, and agree to waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over the parties by such courts and to venue in such courts.


Waiver and Severability of Terms.
The failure of Furk.net to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOS shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
If any provision of the TOS is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the TOS remain in full force and effect.


No Right of Survivorship and Non-Transferability.
You agree that your Furk.net account is non-transferable and any rights to your Furk.net ID or contents within your account terminate upon your death.
Upon receipt of a copy of a death certificate, your account may be terminated and all contents therein permanently deleted.
