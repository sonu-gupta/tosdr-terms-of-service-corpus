This privacy policy applies to all information collected through the salad.com website and associated application.
Salad only requires your email address and IP address.
Some additional information may be needed for specific item redemptions.
Personally identifiable information collected by us will only be used for the purpose of providing you with our service.
We collect this information so that you will be able to access your account and so that we will be able to transfer mined cryptocurrencies to your account.
We may also send you email notifications from time to time concerning your account, application updates, and relevant news and information.
We use commercially acceptable data collection, storage, and processing practices, and security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of your personal information and data.
Sensitive and private data exchange between you and our site/application happens over an SSL secured communication channel and is encrypted and protected with digital signatures.
However, it is important to understand that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.
Therefore, while we use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal identification information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
Regardless of our precautions, âperfect securityâ does not exist on the internet.

Browsing and interaction on any other website, including websites that link to our site, is subject to that websiteâs own terms and policies.
