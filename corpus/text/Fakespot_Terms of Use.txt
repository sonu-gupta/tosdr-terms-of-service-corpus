Applicable Law and Jurisdiction
Persons who access the Services do so at their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
The laws of the State of New York will govern these Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy, without regard to conflicts of law principles.
Any and all claims and controversies arising out of and related to these Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy shall be settled in the courts of competent jurisdiction in New York, New York.
Any such claim or controversy shall be adjudicated on an individual basis and shall not be consolidated with a claim of any other party.
The foregoing shall not preclude the Company from seeking injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction located in other countries and jurisdictions for protection of Fakespot IP.
Dispute Resolution and Arbitration
If you are located in, are based in, have offices in, or do business in a jurisdiction in which this Section is enforceable, the following mandatory arbitration provisions apply to you:
You and Fakespot agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Fakespot arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Fakespot as a user of the Services (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual arbitration.
Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.
THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.
There may be more limited discovery than in court.
The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award declaratory or injunctive relief benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.
This arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.
Notwithstanding the paragraph above, you and Fakespot both agree that nothing herein will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S.
small claims court, (2) pursue enforcement actions through applicable U.S.
federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (3) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (4) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.
If you are located in, are based in, have offices in, or do business in the United States, any arbitration between you and Fakespot will be finally settled under the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ) then in force (the âAAA Rulesâ).
Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in New York, New York.
If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the arbitration demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
In such case, you agree to reimburse Fakespot for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.
Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.
The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitratorâs ruling on the merits.
If you are not located in, are not based in, do not have offices in, and do not do business in the United States, any arbitration between you and Fakespot will be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the âICCâ) then in force (the âICC Rulesâ) by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the ICC Rules, as modified by these Terms of Use, and will be administered by the International Court of Arbitration of the ICC.
Any arbitration will be conducted in the English language and the law to be applied in any arbitration shall be the law of the State of New York, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.
Any arbitration must be commenced by filing a demand for arbitration within ONE (1) YEAR after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act, omission, or default giving rise to the claim.
and there shall be no right to any remedy for any claim not asserted within that time period.
If applicable law prohibits a one-year limitation period for asserting claims, any claim must be asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law.
A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail ("Notice").
Fakespot's address for Notice is: contact@fakespot.com.
The Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.
and (2) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand").
We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, you or Fakespot may commence an arbitration proceeding.
All documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of arbitratorâs decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.
Except as required to enforce the arbitratorâs decision and award, neither you nor Fakespot shall make any public announcement or public comment or originate any publicity concerning the arbitration, including, but not limited to, the fact that the parties are in dispute, the existence of the arbitration, or any decision or award of the arbitrator.
