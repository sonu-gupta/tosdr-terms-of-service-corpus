Use of racial, religious or other slurs and stereotypes that incite or promote hatred based on any of the attributes noted above. This can take the form of speech, text, or imagery promoting these stereotypes or treating them as factual.

This includes statements that one group is less than another, calling them less intelligent, less capable, or damaged.

 Educational content We may allow content that includes hate speech if the primary purpose is educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic in nature.
This is not a free pass to promote hate speech.
Examples include:


A documentary about a hate group: Educational content that isnât supporting the group or promoting ideas would be allowed.
A documentary promoting violence or hatred wouldnât be allowed.

A documentary about the scientific study of humans: A documentary about how theories have changed over time, even if it includes theories about the inferiority or superiority of specific groups, would be allowed because itâs educational.
We wonât allow a documentary claiming there's scientific evidence today that an individual or group is inferior or subhuman.
Historical footage of an event, like WWII, which doesn't promote violence or hatred.

This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.
For educational content that includes hate speech, this context must appear in the images or audio of the video itself.
Providing it in the title or description is insufficient. Monetization and other penalties&nbsp.
