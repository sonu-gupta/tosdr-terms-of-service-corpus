We have implemented the following Google Analytics advertising features based on interests and location for the purposes of remarketing: retargeting and enhanced demographic tracking, including affinity audiences, custom affinity audiences, in-market audiences, similar audiences, demographic and location targeting, and demographics and interest reports.

Rights and choices for California Residents


The CCPA provides California Residents with specific rights regarding their personal information.
This section describes your rights and how to exercise them.

Deletion request rights.

You have the right to request that we delete your personal information that we have collected from you, subject to certain exceptions.

Complete a transaction with you


Detect security incidents to protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent or illegal activity


Debug the Service and to identify and repair errors


Exercise free speech or to exercise another right provided by law


Use the personal information solely for internal uses that are reasonably aligned with your expectation based on your relationship with us

Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:

Actually charge, or suggest we charge you different prices or rates, or provide different levels of quality for goods and services.




However, please note that if the exercise of these rights limits our ability to process personal information (such as in the case of a deletion request), we may no longer be able to provide you our products and services or engage with you in the same manner.
We may, where permitted by the CCPA, offer certain financial incentives related to the personal information you provide that can result in different prices, rates and quality levels.
Such financial incentives will be reasonably related to the value of the personal information that you have provided, and in such cases, we will provide written terms that describes such an incentive programs material aspects.


Exercising access, data portability and deletion rights


To exercise the access and deletion rights described above, you should submit a verifiable consumer request to us using the information in the âContacting usâ section of this Privacy Policy.
Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make such requests.
You may only make a verifiable consumer request to exercise your access or data portability rights or your deletion right once free-of-charge within a 12-month period, and such requests must provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably identify you, or identify you as an authorized representative.
We will need to verify your identity before processing your request, which may require us to request additional personal information from you or require you to log into your account, if you have one.
You must also provide sufficient detail in your request such that we can properly understand, evaluate and respond to it.
In certain circumstances, we may decline a request to exercise the rights described above, particularly where we are unable to verify your identity or locate your information in our systems.
If we are unable to comply with all or a portion of your request, we will provide a brief explanation.
We endeavor to respond to verifiable consumer requests within forty-five (45) days of receipt.
If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period.
We will deliver our written responses to these requests either by mail or electronically, at your option.
The response may also explain the reason we cannot comply with the request.  Additional California disclosures California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser Do Not Track (DNT) signals.
Because there currently isnât an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we donât respond to them at this time.
We await the result of work by the privacy community and industry to determine when such a response is appropriate and what form it should take.
A California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (âCalifornia Customerâ) is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third partiesâ direct marketing purposes, subject to certain exceptions, as defined in California Civil Code Sec.

Using EDPOâs online request form: https://edpo.com/gdpr-data-request/ 
Writing to EDPO at Avenue Huart Hamoir 71, 1030 Brussels, Belgium
 Automated decision-making and profiling Automated decision making refers to a decision that is taken solely on the basis of automated processing of your personal data, for example using software, artificial intelligence or other rating or scoring algorithms.
Profiling uses automated processing which sometimes results in automated decision making, and in some cases does not.
When you sign up to use the Services, we may use certain personal information, for example your first name, last name, address and IP address to verify you are eligible to use the Services and to restrict your access if you are not, for example if you are resident in a country or region that is subject to a U.S.
government embargo.
We will also restrict access by use of  automated decision-making and profiling to anyone on or, directly or indirectly, owned, in whole or part, by any person or persons on the U.S.
Treasury Departmentâs List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons or any other U.S.
government list of parties with respect to transactions that are forbidden or restricted.
You have the right to not be subject to decision making which is solely based on automated processing and profiling, but only when that decision results in legal effects or otherwise significantly affects you.
If you believe we have incorrectly made a decision based on automated decision-making and profiling, please contact us using the information in the âContacting usâ section of this Privacy Policy.
Your right not to be subject to automated decision making and profiling does not apply if the decision was necessary for entering into or performing a contract with you or is authorized by law and there are suitable safeguards for your rights and freedoms.
However, in these situations, you can still obtain human intervention in the decision-making process and will make sure there are methods in place for you to express your point of view. How do we secure your personal information? We take steps to help protect your data, including your personal information.
The steps include protecting this data against accidental loss, unauthorized use, disclosure, and restricting access to personal information by our staff.
The Service is hosted by a third-party hosting company that we have determined maintains various security controls and utilizes TLS encryption for all internet communication with the Service.
We also require all staff that administer and develop the service follow a series of controls, including strong passwords, the use of anti-virus and anti-malware software, disk encryption and other practices.
We use various 3rd party processors to enable us to provide the Service, and as part of our vendor due-diligence, we review the security controls these processors have in place for appropriateness in relation to the type of data we collect.
You should keep in mind, however, that the Service utilizes software, hardware, and networks, which from time to time require maintenance and experience problems beyond our control.
Note that no data transmission over the public internet or encryption method can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you provide to us.
You transmit information to us at your own risk. How long do you retain personal information?
