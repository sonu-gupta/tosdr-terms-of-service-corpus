Keeping children safe onlineWe care deeply about making sure children are safe online and have extra privacy processes in place to make sure weâre keeping our younger fans safe when theyâre using our online channels.
In fact, some features have age gates so to prevent children from inadvertently using such features.
We also take all reasonable care to secure that we donât knowingly collect, store, use or process personal information from children who may use those features without proper parental consent.
Weâve joined a digital child safety program which audits our company on a yearly basis to make sure we follow the rules in the way interact with children online.
We also follow all relevant laws for children aged between 13 and 18 and when it comes to personal data, we consider anyone under the age of 16 years a child
If you have any questions or concerns about our Privacy Policy, please contact our Data Protection Officer at privacy.officer@lego.com.
If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.
To view a list of properties covered by our Dispute Resolution provider, please click the seal located at the top of this section.
When we do process personal information from children, we take extra steps to protect their privacy including:

Making sure we tell parents what personal information we collect, store, use and process from their child and explaining whether we share the information
Meeting legal requirements by asking for parental consent to collect, use and process a childâs data and asking for consent to send their children information about our products and services
Limiting how we collect, store, use and process personal information from children so only data that is reasonably needed for them to take part in an online activity is collected
Giving parents access or the option to ask for access to personal information weâve collected from their child â parents can also ask for their childrenâs personal information to be changed or deleted
Collecting and using childrenâs informationWhile some of our websites, channels and apps are designed with families and users of all ages in mind, others are intended to be used mainly by children.
Whenever we collect personal information from a child, we only keep the information for the time we need it to provide a service or for the time itâs legally required to be kept on record.
While children can choose whether to share their information with us, there are features of our websites that wonât function if they havenât given us their information.
Where personal information is needed for features to function, weâll only ask for information that is reasonably required to take part in the activity.
Here are some examples of times when we collect childrenâs data:

When children register onlineChildren can register on our websites to access a variety of services including content, games and competitions.
During registration, we may ask a child to provide their parentâs or guardianâs email address, the childâs first name, gender, their birth date, their username and password.
We use this information for security and notification reasons.
We strongly encourage children to create a username that excludes any personal information.

When children share content theyâve created themselvesSome of our websites allow children to create or use content themselves.
Since only some of these features require personal information from the child, not all activities require consent from a parent or guardian.
Whenever an activity could potentially allow a child to share personal information, we either review the content ourselves and make sure personal information is removed or ask for permission from a parent or guardian to collect the data.
Types of personal data that children have shared with us in the past include stories, free-text fields, drawings that allow text or free-hand entry of information, photographs of your child, sound clips, movie files or any type of content or other persistent identifiers that clearly identifies the child in some way.
If, as well as collecting content that includes personal information, we also plan to share the content publicly or with a third party for their own use, weâll ask the parent or guardian for âverifiable parental consentâ (which is a higher level of parental consent).

When children enter contests and sweepstakesIf a child wants to enter a competition, we ask for the personal information we need for a child to take part.
We usually only ask for the childâs first name (so we can tell the difference between children from the same family) and the email address of a parent or guardian (so we meet legal requirements to notify the responsible adult).
Weâll only contact the parent if the child wins the contest or sweepstake to find out where to send the prize.
If the competition asks the child to create content to enter, we may need to ask for parental consent by email in advance to ensure we meet the privacy requirements for content children have created themselves (please see the information above about children creating content).
Without consent, children wonât be able to take part in our competitions.

When children receive emails from usWe may need ask for their childâs contact details (including their email address) so that we can reply to a question theyâve asked us.
To meet legislative requirements around the world, weâll delete any information we have on the child as soon as the replyâs been sent.
If we need to get in touch with the child a second time, for example to reply to additional questions, we would request an email address from their parent or guardian.
Weâd then only keep the childâs online contact information for the time it takes us to honor their request and wouldnât use the information for any other purpose.
If we ever need a childâs online contact information for ongoing communication, weâd ask for the parentâs or guardianâs email address at the earliest opportunity so that we can keep the adult informed of the data weâre collecting and to give the parent an option to ask us to stop collecting data.
Parents or guardians can opt out of any communication we have with their child at any time by following the unsubscribe instructions within each communication (if there is more than one type of communication, the adult may need to opt out of each individually).
Alternatively, they can contact our LEGO Customer Service team.

When children receive app push notificationsMany apps send users âpush notificationsâ to their customersâ mobile phones or devices to tell them about updates (sometimes even when the app is not in use).
Some of our apps are designed to be used by children.
We ask children to provide the email address of their parent or guardian, so we can tell the adult about their childâs request before we send children push notifications from our apps.
We donât link the device identifier with any other personal information without parental consent.
If you would like your child to stop receiving push notifications from one of apps, you can change the settings on the device your childâs using at any time.

When we collect location informationSome of our websites, channels and apps are designed for children.
We request consent from a parent or guardian by email before collecting information on a childâs street name, address or coordinates.
We do that because such information will effectively make us able to identify a specific child.
As an opposite, we donât require parental consent to collect information on a childâs city, country or region as long as it isnât linked directly to the specific child.
The reason for this, is that such generic information will not make us able to identify a specific child.
If you would like to stop us collecting this type of location information, you can adjust the settings on the device your child is using at any time.
Alternatively, please contact our LEGO Customer Service team.

When we collect âpersistent identifiersâSo we can give visitors to our online channels more relevant and personalized online experiences, we automatically collect some types on information (e.g.
information on IP addresses, mobile device identifier, browsers, internet service providers, referring pages, exit pages, visitor frequency, operating systems, date stamps, time stamps and clickstream data).
We collect this information using technologies such as cookies, pixels, flash cookies, web beacons and other unique identifiers (which we define under the Cookie Policy section of this Privacy Policy).
We may collect this information ourselves or ask a third party to process the data on our behalf.
We use this data to give children access to online features and activities, to customize content, to improve our online channels, to analyze the performance of our online channel and to create anonymous reports.
If we ever want to collect childrenâs data for any other reason, we would contact the childâs parent or guardian for consent in advance.
A list of third-party operators who collect âpersistent identifiersâ on our sites and apps can be found in our Cookie Policy.

What if we accidentally collect childrenâs data?If we discover that weâve unintentionally collected information from a child in a way that doesnât meet COPPA requirements, we will delete the information immediately.Requesting parental consentAsking for low-level consent by emailIf we need to collect a childâs personal information, weâll ask for parental consent according to COPPA legal requirements.
Weâll send the childâs parent or guardian an email explaining what information weâre collecting, how we plan to use it and ask the parent to give or deny their consent.
If we donât receive parental consent in a reasonable time, weâll delete all information weâve collected from the child including the adultâs contact information that we asked for in order to request consent.Asking for high-level âverifiable consentIf we want to share a childâs personal information publicly or with a third party, weâll seek a higher level of parental consent than the email request described above.
We may ask for verification by credit card or other payment method (with a nominal charge involved), verification over the phone or through a video chat to a trained customer service representative or a signed consent form to be returned to us by mail, email attachment or fax.
We may give the parent a guardian a PIN or password that theyâll be able to use in future communications to confirm the adultâs identity.What if a parent or guardian hasnât been contacted for consent?If a child under the age of 16 accesses an online channel thatâs designed for children by using an age gate, weâll email the childâs parent or guardian before collecting any personal information from the child.
If you think that your child is taking part in an online activity that collects their personal information and you or another parent/guardian hasnât received an email letting you know or seeking your consent, please contact our Data Privacy Officer at privacy.officer@lego.com.
We wonât use email addresses provided for parental consent for any other purpose unless the adult has expressly opted in to marketing emails or taken part in an activity which allows email contact.Parental choices and controlsAt any time, parents or guardians can refuse to allow us to use and collect further personal information from their child.
Parents or guardians can ask us to delete the personal information we have collected in connection with their childâs account from our records.
As personal information is required for some services, deleting a childâs records may result in an account, membership, or service being unavailable to the child in future.
If a child has a registered LEGO ID, parents or guardians can access, change or delete the personal information weâve collected from their child by:

Using their childâs username and password to log into their childâs LEGO ID account
Getting in touch with our LEGO Customer Service team

If youâd prefer to contact us, please let us know your childâs username along with the your own telephone number and email address.
Weâll need to confirm your identity as the parent or guardian of the child before granting access to the childâs personal information.
We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.
If we make material changes to how we use Personal Information collected from a child under the age of 16, weâll tell their parent or guardian by email and ask for âverifiable parental consentâ for the new uses of the childâs personal information.Sharing information we have consent to share with othersIf weâve received high-level parental consent to share a childâs personal information publicly, we may also share personal information with our service provides or legal authorities.
We may share information with our service providers including software solution companies, online security partners and customer services.
Our contracts with these companies make sure they only use personal data for the agreed purpose.
We may share personal information to meet legal processes or if disclosure is required by law.
As allowed by relevant laws, we may also share personal information collected from children to:

Comply with a request from to a law enforcement or public agency (including schools or children services) or to avoid liability
Make a disclosure that we believe may stop a crime being committed
Help an investigation related to public safety
Protect the safety of a child whoâs using our online channels
Protect the technology of our service providers or security of our online channels themselves

Parents have the right to consent to the collection, use and processing of their childâs personal information without also having to consent to the disclosure of that information to third parties.
We donât share information with third parties other than as described above.Our employeesWhether youâre an existing employee or applying for a job with us, weâll process specific information relevant for your employment and application.
The principles in this Privacy Policy will also apply to your employment and application.LEGO PartnersWe define LEGO Partners as other companies doing business with the LEGO Group.

All external transfers that contain personal information are done using encrypted technology.
Credit card information is handled by approved service providers that meet PCI (Payment Card Industry) standards and have appropriate safeguards in place.Although we regularly review our security procedures and evaluate new technology and methods to make our online channels safer, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.
Our customers, employees and partners also play an important role in protecting information.
We encourage customers to choose passwords that are difficult for others to guess and to keep their personal passwords secret.
