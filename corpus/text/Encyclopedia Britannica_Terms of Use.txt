Binding arbitration. Any dispute will be conducted exclusively by binding arbitration governed by the U.S.

You are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in as a party or class member) all disputes in court before a judge or jury.
Instead, all disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final and binding.
Any court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitratorâs award.


Class action waiver.
Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis.

No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings.

Arbitration procedure.
Any arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (the âAAAâ) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules.
If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you.&nbsp.
For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in Chicago, Illinois, United States of America, and you and Britannica agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located there, in order to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.&nbsp.
The arbitratorâs award shall conform with these Terms of Use, including without limitation the Limitation of Liability set forth above.

Claims or disputes must be filed within one year.
To the extent permitted by law, any claim or dispute must be filed within one year. &nbsp.
The one-year period begins when the arbitration notice first could be filed.
If such a claim or dispute is not filed within one year, it shall be permanently barred.
