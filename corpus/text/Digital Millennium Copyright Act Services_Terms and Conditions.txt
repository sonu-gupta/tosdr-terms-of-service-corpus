Arbitration


The parties agree to submit any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement to binding arbitration in British Columbia before an arbitrator agreed to by both parties and subject to the rules of the Canadian arbitration process.
The parties agree that such arbitration will be in lieu of either party's rights to assert any claim, demand or suit in any court action, (provided that either party may elect either binding arbitration or a court action with respect to obtaining injunctive relief to terminate the violation by the other party of such party's proprietary rights, including, without limitation any trade secrets, copyrights or trademarks).
Any arbitration shall be final and binding and the parties agree not to contest the enforceability of the arbitrator's order.

All rights and remedies, whether conferred hereunder or by any other instrument or law, will be cumulative and may be exercised singularly or concurrently.
Failure by either party to enforce any term will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other term.
The terms of this Agreement are declared to be severable and in the event any provision of this Agreement is deemed unenforceable, it shall be severed and the remainder of this Agreement shall be given the fullest effect permitted by law.

Customer may not assign any rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of DMCA.com, and any attempt to assign any rights, duties, or obligations hereunder without DMCA.comâs written consent will be void.
DMCA.com may assign all or any part of its rights or obligations without Customerâs consent.
The provisions of this Agreement will enure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties and their respective heirs, executors, successors, permitted assigns, and personal representatives.

Any consent by a party to, or waiver of, a breach by the other party, whether express or implied, shall not constitute consent to or a waiver of any other, different or subsequent breach.

The Services are provided on a non-exclusive basis, and nothing contained herein shall prevent or restrict DMCA.com from providing the same or similar services to any other party, either during the term of this Agreement or at any time thereafter.

The parties are independent contractors.
Neither DMCA.comâs nor Customerâs officers, employees, contractors or agents shall be deemed to be the officers, employees, contractors or agents of the other, and DMCA.com shall not be subject to the day to day supervision or control of Customer.
Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed so as to create any agency, joint venture or partnership between the parties, and neither DMCA.com nor Customer shall represent that its relationship with respect to the other party is other than that of an independent contractor.

Any notice, communication or statement required or permitted to be given hereunder shall be in writing and deemed to have been sufficiently given when delivered in person, or by facsimile (with confirmation of facsimile transmission), email, or by certified mail, return receipt requested and postage prepaid, to the chief executive of the other party at the address set out at the head of this Agreement, or such other persons and/or addresses as either party may advise the other from time to time in accordance with this provision.

DMCA.com will cooperate with any and all appropriate legal authorities in investigating claims of illegal activity, including, but not limited to illegal transfer or use of copyrighted material or other illegal activity.

Entire Agreement


These Terms &amp.
Conditions, when read together with any Service Level Agreement (together, âthis Agreementâ), contain the entire understanding of the parties with respect to DMCA Servicesâ	provision of Services and supersede all prior agreements, proposals and communications between the parties, written or oral, relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.

DMCA Services may assign its rights under the Agreement, in whole or in part, at any time.
In the event of a breach of any provision of the Agreement by the Customer, DMCA Servicesâ failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of the Terms and Conditions shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
