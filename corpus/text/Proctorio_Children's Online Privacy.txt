Congress enacted the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in 1998.
COPPA requires the Federal Trade Commission to issue and enforce regulations concerning children's online privacy.
COPPA imposes certain requirements on operators of websites or online services directed to children under 13 years of age, and on operators of other websites or online services that have actual knowledge that they are collecting personal information online from a child under 13 years of age. Why is COPPA important?
COPPA requires websites to give parents a choice as to whether their child's information can be disclosed to third parties, and give parents a chance to prevent further use or future collection of personal information from their child.
Parents must also, upon request, be given access to the personal information collected from their child and a means of reviewing that information. How does Proctorio comply with COPPA?
We are COPPA certified by the Internet Keep Safe Coalition which signifies our compliance with relevant laws and regulations.
Please see our Personal Data Protections page for more information.
Proctorio does not disseminate personal information to third parties for any use.
All data that enters our system has been encrypted using an unshared key stored in the learning management system (LMS) and can only be unlocked by authorized users within the LMS.
Proctorio utilizes the LMS to gain information about the user's role.
This restricts information from being shared with users who do not fall under the "School Official" role.
The entire process is transparent to the end-user, but prevents Proctorio and unauthorized individuals from accessing student data.
In compliance with section 16 C.F.R.
รยง 312.4(c)(2) of COPPA, Proctorio will notify parents when it learns that it has collected any personal information of a child under 13 years of age.
