To the extent permitted by local law, this is your exclusive remedy for defective products.

Disputes arising out of this HP Limited Warranty or relating to your purchase of the HP Hardware Products subject to this HP Limited Warrantyâwhether based on contract, tort, statute, fraud, or any other legal theoryâare governed by the law of the country and state, province, or territory in which you currently reside, without regard to its conflict-of-law principles.

A Standard battery can be furthered defined has having 300 cycles, while a long-life battery has 1000 cycles.
This HP Hardware Product may include an internal rechargeable non-removable battery that is not user accessible and must be replaced by HP or an HP authorized service provider.

The use of a non-HP or refilled cartridge does not affect either the HP Limited Warranty to the end-user customer or any HP support contract with the end-user customer for the printer.
However, if printer or print head failure or damage is attributable to the use of a non-HP or refilled cartridge, HP will charge its standard time and materials charges to service the printer for the particular failure or damage or for the cost to replace the print head.
For HP ink cartridges and supplies and HP LaserJet supplies, this HP Limited Warranty does not apply to products that, in addition to other exclusions described in this HP Limited Warranty, have been refilled, refurbished, remanufactured, or tampered with in any way.
