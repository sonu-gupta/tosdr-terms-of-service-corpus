Disputes âDisputesâ are defined as any claim, controversy, or dispute between you and Privacy, its processors, suppliers or licensors (or their respective affiliates, agents, directors or employees), including any claims relating in any way to these General Terms, any Additional Terms, or the Services, or any other aspect of our relationship.
Binding Individual Arbitration You and Privacy agree to arbitrate any and all Disputes by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same damages and relief that a court can.
ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THESE GENERAL TERMS WILL ONLY BE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.
CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTIONS, REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS AND CONSOLIDATION WITH OTHER ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED.
YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO HAVE YOUR CASE DECIDED BY A JURY AND YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST PRIVACY.
If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced (but in no case will there be a class or representative arbitration).
All Disputes will be resolved finally and exclusively by binding individual arbitration with a single arbitrator administered by the American Arbitration Association according to this Section and the applicable arbitration rules for that forum.
Consumer claimants (individuals whose transaction is intended for personal, family, or household use) may elect to pursue their claims in their local small-claims court rather than through arbitration so long as their matter remains in small claims court and proceeds only on an individual (non-class or non-representative) basis.
The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.
Â§Â§ 1-16, fully applies.
If you are a consumer bringing a claim relating to personal, household, or family use, any arbitration hearing will occur within the county where you reside.
Otherwise, any arbitration hearing will occur in New York County, New York, or another mutually agreeable location.
The arbitratorâs award will be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
We will pay the arbitration fees due to the American Arbitration Association for individual arbitrations brought in accordance with this section.
If you prevail on any claim for which you are legally entitled to attorneyâs fees, you may seek to recover those fees from the arbitrator.
For any claim where you are seeking relief, we will not seek to have you pay our attorneyâs fees, even if fees might otherwise be awarded, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous.
For purposes of this arbitration provision, references to you and Privacy also include respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors, successors and assigns as well as authorized users or beneficiaries of the Services.
Subject to and without waiver of the arbitration provisions above, you agree that any judicial proceedings (other than small claims actions in consumer cases) will be brought in and you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in state court in New York County, New York, or federal court for the Southern District of New York.
Governing Law These General Terms and any Dispute will be governed by New York law and/or applicable federal law (including the Federal Arbitration Act) as applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within New York, without regard to its choice of law or conflicts of law principles.
Limitation on Time to Initiate a Dispute Any action or proceeding by you relating to any Dispute must commence within 90 days after the cause of action accrues.
Assignment These General Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you and any attempted transfer or assignment will be null and void.
Third Party Services and Links to Other Web Sites You may be offered services, products and promotions provided by third parties and not by Privacy (âThird Party Servicesâ).
If you decide to use Third Party Services you will be responsible for reviewing and understanding the terms and conditions for these services.
We are not responsible for the performance of any Third Party Services.
The Services may contain links to third party websites.
The inclusion of any website link does not imply an approval, endorsement, or recommendation by Privacy.
Such third party websites are not governed by these General Terms.
You access any such website at your own risk.
We expressly disclaim any liability for these websites.
When you use a link to go from the Services to a third party website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect.
Your browsing and interaction on a third party website, including those that have a link in the Services is subject to that websiteâs own terms, rules and policies.
Force Majeure Privacy shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside its reasonable control, including but not limited to, acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, embargos, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, strikes or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials.
Notice You are responsible for providing Privacy with your most current email address.
In the event that the last email address you provided to Privacy is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering you notices required/permitted under these Terms, Privacyâs dispatch of the email containing such notice will constitute effective notice.
You may give notice to Privacy at the following address: (148 Lafayette St, Fl 3, NY, NY 10013) Such notice shall be deemed to be given when received by Privacy by letter delivered by nationally recognized overnight service or first class postage prepaid mail at the above address.
Other Provisions These General Terms, and any applicable Additional Terms or Policies, are a complete statement of the agreement between you and Privacy regarding the Services.
In the event of a conflict between these General Terms and any other Privacy agreement or Policy, these General Terms will prevail and control the subject matter of such conflict.
If any provision of these General Terms or any Additional Term is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, then it will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law, and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.
These General Terms do not limit any rights that we may have under trade secret, copyright, patent, or other laws.
No waiver of any term of these General Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term.

Privacy Cashback Promotions Participants in Privacy cashback promotions may earn Privacy Credits (as defined below) on up to $4,500 of monthly net purchases using their Privacy Account (initiated transaction amounts on purchases minus any credits or returns).
Privacy Credits resulting from Privacy purchases during a calendar month will be automatically applied to your Privacy account generally within the first ten (10) business days of the next calendar month.
However, the timing of when Privacy Credits are applied may vary based on specific terms of a promotion.

 If you close your Privacy Account, all purchases made during the calendar month that the Account was closed will not be eligible for the Privacy cashback promotion.
We reserve the right to render your account ineligible for the cashback promotion in the event of any Chargebacks, ACH bounces, ACH disputes, or suspicious activity associated with your Account.

 Determination of promotion eligibility, duration of a promotion, and the maximum amount of credit earned are at the sole discretion of Privacy.
Privacy reserves the right to modify the rate or timing of Privacy Credits earned by any user pursuant to the promotion at any time.
Privacy reserves the right to verify and adjust credits at any time prior to or following credit.
Your Privacy account must be active and in good standing, as determined by Privacy at its sole discretion, to receive Privacy Credits.

 In our sole discretion, we may deduct Privacy Credits from your account or make a debit entry to your connected funding source in order to make adjustments for returns, purchase cancellations or fraudulent activity.
Any such adjustments, however, will be made in accordance with this Agreement, any applicable Privacy policies and terms, and any and all applicable laws, rules, and regulations.
It is your responsibility to check your Account regularly to ensure that Privacy Credit has been properly credited and paid and that your Account balance is accurate.

Privacy Preferred Merchant Program Privacy offers the Privacy Preferred Merchant Program to allow our customers to earn cashback on purchases completed through Privacyâs browser extension or website subject to these terms and conditions (âPreferred Merchant Program Termsâ).
Privacy receives compensation for referring buyers to the retailers, brands, merchants, and other partners participating in the Program (âAffiliate Storesâ).
Privacy gives a portion of this compensation to our customers as cashback.
Participation in the Program and the opportunity to earn cashback are offered at the sole discretion of Privacy and subject to your compliance with this Agreement.

 In order to earn cashback from the Privacy Preferred Merchant Program, you must be signed in to one of the Privacy Services, click the link to activate the offer, and use a Privacy Card to complete the purchase (âQualifying Purchaseâ).
If you visit other sites before completing your purchase or use coupons not provided by Privacy, you may not be eligible to earn cashback on your purchase.
If you disable âcookiesâ on your computer, you will not be able to earn cashback because cookies are used to verify that your Privacy Account is eligible for the cashback.
Please note, however, that if cookies from other promotional offers for the merchant are already present on your computer, we will not modify them.
Affiliate Store Policies A product purchased from any Affiliate Store through the Program, is governed by and subject to the applicable Affiliate Storeâs policies, including applicable exchange and shipping policies.
You agree that we are not agents of any Affiliate Store and that the Affiliate Stores operate independently and are not under our control with respect to the Program or otherwise.
Accordingly, your participation in offers or promotions of, or correspondence with, any Affiliate Store is solely between you and that Affiliate Store.
We do not assume any liability, obligation or responsibility for any part of such correspondence, offer or promotion, including, without limitation, the withdrawal or modification of any such offer or promotion.
Privacy is not responsible for changes to, or discontinuance of, any Affiliate Store, or for any Affiliate Store withdrawal from the Program, or for any effect on accrual of cashback caused by such changes, discontinuance, or withdrawal.

 The determination of whether a purchase made through an Privacy Affiliate Store qualifies for cashback is at the sole discretion of Privacy.
If an Affiliate Store fails to report a transaction to Privacy or fails to make payment to Privacy for any reason, Privacy reserves the right to cancel the cashback associated with that transaction.
Eligibility Your eligibility to participate in any Privacy.com promotions is at our sole discretion.
Privacy.com reserves the right to terminate any promotions at any time and to refuse or recover any promotion award for any reason, including, but not limited to, your breach of these Terms.

Referred customers (each, a âReferred Customerâ) must register for Privacy using the unique URL provided by Privacy.

 Subject to these terms and conditions, any Referrer Customer that refers an acquaintance to Privacy will receive up to $5 in Privacy account credit (âReferrer Bonusâ) for every such referral when the Referred Customer successfully registers and makes a qualifying transaction with Privacy (the âReferral Offerâ).

 In addition, the Referred Customer will receive up to $5 in Privacy credit off his or her first purchase using Privacyâs software upon his or her successful registration with Privacy (âReferred Bonusâ).

 Determination of program eligibility and qualifying referrals are at the sole discretion of Privacy.
Privacy reserves the right to verify and adjust referral credits at any time prior to or following credit.
Your Privacy account must be active and in good standing, as determined by Privacy at its sole discretion, to receive the Referrer Bonus or Referred Bonus.

 This Referral Offer is intended for Privacy customers only to refer their acquaintances to Privacy and should not be advertised, marketed or otherwise utilized for commercial purposes.

Bank Account Information and Authorized Actions By adding a funding source, you may include access credentials (for example, username and password) that allow you to gain online access to one or more accounts that you maintain with a third-party financial institution and that you choose to designate for use in connection with the Payment Services (each, an âAuthorized Bank Accountâ).
We work with one or more Third Party Services (as defined below) that will securely store pursuant to industry standards any Authorized Bank Account access credentials that you provide and will access your Authorized Bank Accounts for the purposes of providing and improving the Payment Services.
You may only provide account access credentials for and authorize us to access valid accounts that you hold in your own name.
You may not provide access credentials for an account that is held by a third person.

 If you choose to provide your Authorized Bank Account credentials to us, you authorize us to use this information to provide you with the services we offer through the Payment Services.
This authorization will remain in effect until you notify us that you wish to revoke this authorization, which may affect your ability to receive the services.
The Third Party Services providers that we work with include Plaid Technologies, Inc.

and (f) you are not submitting a transaction involving your own merchant.
Termination of Payment Services Privacy may Terminate your use of the Payment Services at any time for any reason.
Any termination of these terms does not relieve you of obligations to pay Fees or costs accrued prior to the termination, Chargebacks, and any other amounts owed to us as provided in these Payment Terms or the Terms of Service.
In the event your Privacy account has a negative balance, Privacy reserves the right to withhold refunds or credits to settle the negative balance.
If your access to Payment Services has been terminated, you may still be permitted to use Privacyâs other products, subject to our discretion.
