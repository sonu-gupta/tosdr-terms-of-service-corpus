This website is maintained in the United States by Arista Networks, Inc.
("we" or "us").
This privacy policy explains how we, and all of our corporate subsidiaries and affiliates (including U.S.
subsidiaries Big Switch Networks LLC, Mojo Networks LLC, Awake Security LLC, and Metamako America LLC), use any personal information that we collect about you when you use this website (the "Site") and our cloud networking solutions and products (the "Services") or otherwise interact with us.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites, services or applications, even if they are accessible through our Services.
We take data privacy and the security of your personal information seriously and will only use such personal information as set out in this privacy policy.
Please read the following information carefully to understand our practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.

Contact Us

We provide certain cloud-based services (e.g.
Arista Cognitive Wi-Fi and CloudVision) to our corporate customers.
If you are an end user of services provided by our customers based on our cloud-services, then we act on behalf of our customer as a data processor and service provider.
This means that our customer acts as a data controller and will provide information on how they collect and process your data using our Services.
They are your contact for any questions you have about how it handles your personal information.
For example, if we provide a coffee shop with an Arista Cognitive Wi-Fi solution and they use it to provide Wi-Fi access to you as a patron, we are merely a data processor for the coffee shop, and the coffee shop is the data controller.
In that situation, youâas a patronâshould work directly with the coffee shop to understand how they use your data.
Additionally, the policies relating to the collection and disclosure of personal information and the rights guaranteed to California residents under the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA") (as discussed below) only relate to Arista's direct actions as a business with you and not a service provider.
For more information, please see the section below Acting as a Data Processor.

Data from Minors
Our Sites and Services do not target and are not intended to attract children or minors under the age of 16.

We will respond to inquiries within forty-five (45) days.
Should we not be able to resolve the matter, depending on your local laws, you may have a right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
Do Not Track
Arista does not track its customers over time or across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals.
However, some third-party sites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you.
If you are visiting such sites, your browser may allow you to set the DNT signal on your browser so that third parties (particularly advertisers) know you do not want to be tracked.
Acting as a Data Processor
With respect to some of our cloud-based product and service offerings, Arista acts merely as a data processor of our corporate customers' data, which may include your personal data as an end user of services provided by our customers.
While we still maintain this data securely and in accordance with the principles of this policy, there are a few aspects of this policy that apply specifically to this situation.
They are:

Our customers provide the same or similar types of data about themselves and about you as we list above, but the extent of collected data is dependent on our customers' settings and the information that you choose to share with our customers.
While you should contact the relevant customer directly, information stored about you additionally may include device identifiers (e.g., MAC or IP addresses) for devices visible to or connected to the Services, device activity, time, location and configuration data, applications used, and/or websites accessed;
Arista only processes this data on the instructions of our customers, the data controllers;
In this capacity, Arista provides data storage and system management for our customers' systems;
Arista may use anonymized or pseudo-anonymized aspects of this customer data to analyze and improve Arista's products and Services;
Because our customers provide the data and we process it only on their instructions, we have given our customers the tools to respond to any data inquiries, such as those relating to access, processing restrictions, deletion, and the like.
we therefore will direct, when necessary, such inquiries to our customers and work with them to respond if they need our assistance.
Please direct any inquiries regarding exercising your rights to your personal data to the company whose services you are directly using.
and
Our customers will determine how long the personal information which you have provided to them is retained.
please contact them in the first instance with any questions.
