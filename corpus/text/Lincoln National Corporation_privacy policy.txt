We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.

Security of Information Transmissions. Information you provide to us when filling out secure forms on our Sites, as well as information we supply when you are visiting those areas, is protected while passing through the Internet using encryption technology called Secure Sockets Layer or SSL.
Your browser will indicate when you are within a secure area of our Sites by displaying a symbol, such as a locked padlock or an unbroken key.
