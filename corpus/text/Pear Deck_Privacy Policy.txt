A Parent has the right to review her Childâs Personal Information, which the Parent can obtain by contacting her Childâs School.

Notwithstanding any such requests, we may continue to share a Childâs Personal Information with third parties for the Internal Purposes and Enforcement Purposes (each as described above).
If a Parent chooses to prohibit any future collection, use or disclosure of the Childâs Personal Information, the Parent may do so by terminating the Childâs Account through the School, and requesting the deletion of the Childâs Personal Information through the School.
Upon receiving such request from the Childâs School, we will delete the Childâs Account information from our live databases and all the information and data stored for such Account.
