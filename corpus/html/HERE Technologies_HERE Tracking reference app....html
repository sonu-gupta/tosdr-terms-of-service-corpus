<strong>Your privacy in HERE Tracking reference apps</strong>
</p>
<p>HERE’s Privacy Policy explains how we process your personal data when you use our products and services.
In addition, the following information applies to your use of HERE Tracking reference apps (the “Service”).The purpose of this document is to give background information on data processing for different features available in the Service.
The features of the Service enable you to monitor and track different kinds of assets (“Asset”), which can report their location and other supplementary information to HERE Tracking Service, oversee the current location of the Asset, request for update of the status of the Asset, define a geofence for the Asset and make the Asset report on any changes in relation to the geofence (such as “entered the geofence” and “left the geofence”).
You may also be able to assign other users capabilities to oversee the Assets.</p>
<p>We encourage you to familiarise yourself with the privacy policies of third party services, when you interact with them.
HERE is not in control or responsible for the contents and features of those services.</p>
<p>Please understand that the features of the Service may depend on how you access the Service.
Different device models and software versions of the Service may offer different features.</p>
<strong>What information do we collect?</strong>
<p>We collect the following categories of information:</p>
<p>
<strong>Registration and contact details</strong>
</p>
<p>Some features may require the use of HERE account, for example when you want to associate an Asset to your account.
The only way for you to claim ownership of an Asset is to assignthat Asset to your HERE account.</p>
<p>When you are logged in with your HERE account, we will try to automatically synchronise your Assets associated with your HERE account.</p>
<p>
<strong>Location data and place information</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Service makes use of information about your actual location (“Location Data”) and the location of the Assets you are overseeing (“Asset Location”).
Location Data reveals where you currently are or where you have been.
Location Data is based on available positioning methods, such as Assisted GPS.
In many device models the user interface of the Service identifies the use of positioning with an icon.</p>
<p>Asset Location relates to the location of your assigned Assets.
Asset Location is based on available positioning methods, such as WiFi based positioning, Bluetooth based positioning and/or cell-tower based positioning or GPS.</p>
<p>When you start to use the Service application or activate the Asset, the application and the Asset activates your selected positioning methods to retrieve your current location.</p>
<p>The Service as well as the Asset may send your Location Data or Asset Location to HERE when you use location enabled features of the Service online, such as request status of the Assets, or receive or send notifications or instructions from the Assets.</p>
<p>Note that to instantaneously request status of the Asset, we may need to send an SMS to the Asset.
This can only be performed if you register the phone number of the Asset with HERE Tracking Service</p>
<p>You may simulate the behaviour of Assets by using HERE Tracker application, available from application stores for both Android and iPhone devices.
The HERE Tracker application turns your mobile phone into an Asset, and starts reporting the location of your device (as an Asset) to the Service, on intervals configured by you.
The reporting only takes place from the moment onwards once you have assigned your device (as an Asset) to the Service and your HERE account.</p>
<p>
