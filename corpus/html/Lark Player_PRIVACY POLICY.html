WHAT INFORMATION DOES LARK PLAYER COLLECT? <p> &nbsp.
</p>
<p> The information we collect can be generally placed in two categories: 1) data on how the user uses our Services.
2) aggregate data on the content with which the user engages.
We collect information to provide better Services to you—from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful or which LARK PLAYER videos you might like.
The information we collect, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
</p>
<p> &nbsp.
</p>
<p>
<b>You understand and consent that we may provide and share the information to our partners, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal experience, but we never disclose information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.
</b>
</p>
<p> &nbsp.
</p>
<p> When you are not signed in to a valid account, we use the unique identifiers tied to the application or device you are using to collect information.
When you are signed in with a third party account, e.g., your Google Account, we use such a specific account to collect information.
</p>
<p> &nbsp.
</p>
<p> For greater certainty, whenever you interact with our website or apps, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, “cookie” information, and the page you requested.
“Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your computer or mobile device that allow us to recognize your computer or device and tell us how and when the Services are visited and by how many people.
You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features.
</p>
<p> &nbsp.
</p>

This information is only collected as aggregate data, without reference to you or your contacts’ identities.
</p>

Your location can be determined by GPS, IP address, sensor data from your device, information about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices.
</p>
<p> &nbsp.
</p>
<p> •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few features to note: </p>
<p> 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're using our software and it crashes, the crash report sent to our server may contain some information about the operating system that you use.
</p>
<p> 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you download content via our desktop software, we store a copy to your computer so that the next time you connect your phone you don't have to download it again.
