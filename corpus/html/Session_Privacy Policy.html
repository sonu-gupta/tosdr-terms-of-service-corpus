<p>
<b>The Session app does not collect or share your information.
That’s our policy in a nutshell.
</b>
</p>Session Privacy Policy&nbsp;Information we don’t collectSession doesn’t store any identifying information about your device, such as your IP address or your user agent.<p>Session is designed so that it doesn’t store any information which could be used to track you.</p>
<p>You don’t need a phone number, e-mail, or any information tied to your real identity to make a Session account.
We did this so that you’ll know you’re private and anonymous whenever you use Session.</p>
<p>We don’t make you jump through hoops or tweak settings to be private — Session is private by default.</p>Information we do collectWhen you first start using Session, you will connect to a seed node run by us which serves you an initial list of Service Nodes.
Your IP address can be seen by the seed node at one point in time.
We do not store a record of this connection.
The seed node will never see who you’re talking to or what you’re talking about.<p>No other information is collected or stored.</p>Information we share<p>If you use Session on your Android or iOS phone, Google or Apple might store information about how you use the app.</p>
<p>They can record when the app is closed, opened, how long you use it for, crash logs, and your device model.
This usage information could also be associated with your Google or Apple account, and it is shared with us.</p>
<p>This is a limitation of mobile operating systems, and applies to all apps used on your device.
Besides this, we don’t share any of your information with Apple, Google, or anyone else.</p>
<p>If you’re planning to use Session on mobile, it’s worth reading Apple or Google’s privacy policies.
