Please read them carefully and contact us if you have any questions.</p>
<p>The Service</p>
<p>Trevor is an online service that connects to your database (your “Datasource”) and lets you write queries against your database using SQL or Trevor’s point and click interface.
You can do things like visualise query results, create dashboards, export results, and receive email alerts when the results change.</p>
<p>Trevor does not store a copy of your database.
However, query results are cached and stored for up to 48 hours before being permanently deleted.
This helps to protect your database from too much traffic.
Data security is a top priority.

</p>
<p>The contract</p>
<p>These Customer Terms (or, if applicable, your written agreement with us) form a binding “Contract” between Customer and us.
</p>
<p>If you purchase subscription(s), connect a datasource, or invite users to access that datasource, or use the Services in any way after being notified of a change to these Customer Terms, you acknowledge your understanding of the then-current Contract and agree to the Contract on behalf of Customer.
Please make sure you have the necessary authority to enter into the Contract on behalf of Customer before proceeding.</p>
<p>Who is a customer?</p>
<p>If you add a Datasource to Trevor, “Customer” is the organization that you represent.
</p>
<p>If you signed up using your corporate email domain, your organisation is the Customer.
</p>
<p>If you are not formally affiliated with an organisation, and signed up using your personal email address, you are the Customer.
</p>
<p>Customer has ultimate authority over your Trevor account, the Datasources you have connected, and any associated paid subscription to Trevor.
Customer can modify and re-assign roles on your Datasource (including your role).
If Customer elects to replace you as the individual with ultimate authority for the Datasource, we will provide you with notice and you agree to take any actions reasonably requested by us or Customer to facilitate the transfer of authority to a new representative of Customer.</p>
<p>Authorised Collaborators </p>
<p>You are an Authorised Collaborator (“Collaborator”) if an organisation or other third party that we refer to in these Terms of Use as Customer has invited you to a Datasource, or if you have set up a Datasource on behalf of Customer.
</p>
<p>If, for example, you are joining a Datasource belonging to your employer, Customer is your employer.
If you are joining a Datasource created by your friend in relation to her new startup idea, then she is our Customer.
</p>
<p>Authorised Collaborators acknowledge and agree that Customer may remove their access to the Service at any time.
</p>
<p>It is solely customer’s responsibility to inform any authorised collaborators and any other relevant parties of any relevant customer policies and practices and any settings that may impact the processing of customer data.
(b) obtain any rights, permissions or consents from authorised collaborators and any other relevant parties that are necessary for the lawful use of customer data and the operation of the services.</p>
<p>Subscriptions</p>
<p>A Paid Subscription may be required to access and use the Service.
A paid subscription can be procured and managed via Trevor’s interface.
Any fees quoted by Trevor will be exclusive of VAT / applicable sales tax.
</p>
<p>The Service is billed on a monthly basis, normally in advance.
Your monthly billing period starts on the day that you set up a paid subscription.
Any upgrades made during your monthly billing period will take place immediately, and the associated increase to your bill will be calculated (pro rata) and added to your next bill.
Any downgrades you make will take place on your next billing date, and no refunds will be given.
</p>
<p>To activate and maintain a Paid Subscription, current, complete and accurate information must be provided (such as a change in billing address, credit card number, or credit card expiration date).
</p>
<p>A Paid Subscription can be cancelled at any time.
However, the cancellation will only take affect at the end of your current monthly billing period.
For example, if you are charged on the 5th of every month, and you cancel on the 20th, no more payments will be taken and your account will be automatically downgraded on the 5th of the following month.</p>
<p>We may share information about our future product plans.
Our public statements about those product plans are an expression of intent, but do not rely on them when making a purchase.
If Customer decides to buy our Services, that decision should be based on the functionality or features we have made available today.</p>
<p>If any fees owed to us by Customer (excluding amounts disputed reasonably and in good faith) are 10 days overdue, we may, without limiting our other rights and remedies, downgrade any fee-based Services to free plans until those amounts are paid in full.</p>
<p>Feedback</p>
<p>We are open to and greatly appreciate feedback, as it helps us to improve the Service.
If you do send us feedback, we may well use it.
So, by providing feedback, you grant us an unlimited, irrevocable, perpetual, sublicensable, transferable, royalty-free license to use it for any purpose without any obligation or compensation to you or Customer.</p>

<p>The protection of Customer Data is a top priority for us.
We will maintain administrative, physical, and technical safeguards at a level not materially less protective than as described in our Security policy.
Those safeguards will include measures for preventing unauthorized access, use, modification, deletion and disclosure of Customer Data by our personnel.
