<b>Protecting Children:</b>
</p>
<p>We take special care to protect the privacy of children.
We urge parents and guardians to participate in their children’s online activities and should employ controls where possible– including website blocking and filtering technologies - to supervise their children’s use of, and access to, the internet.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Children under 16 should always ask and get permission from a parent or guardian before providing ANY information to anyone online.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Our Services are not intended for use by children under the age of 16 without parental consent.&nbsp;&nbsp;Children under the age of 16 should ask their parents before using this site.&nbsp;&nbsp;Users must be 16 or older to be eligible to register accounts on Go With Charlotte.&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not send email correspondence to users who do not register with us and agree to our terms of service.&nbsp;</p>

<br>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We do not share personalized information about your child with third parties, other than with vendors, consultants and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work on our behalf.&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not permanently store photos you upload- they are used only to enable the creation of a cartoonized image, and are destroyed after they are no longer necessary to fulfill this function.
Please note, this means we cannot re-create your cartoonized image from your original photo once you’ve placed an order.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
