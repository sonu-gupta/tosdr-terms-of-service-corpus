<strong>Types of Information We Collect<br>
</strong>
<br>There are two types of information we may collect through your access to and use of the Site and/or Services:<br>
<br>• “Personal Information” means information about an identifiable individual (including any “Personal Information” as such term is defined in the <em>Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act</em>, Canada or the <em>Personal Information Protection Act</em>, British Columbia).
Personal Information may include, but is not limited to, a person’s name, email address, residential address, precise geolocation information (i.e., your specific location), telephone number, payment card information, transaction history, other billing information and, in some cases, user name.<br>
<br>• “Non-Personal Information” means information that does not identify you and cannot be used to contact you personally and may include your date of birth, age, gender, postal code and non-precise geolocation information (e.g., your city), as well as information about your computer, mobile device, and/or media system platform and their hardware/software/firmware and including but not limited to your unique device ID, Internet Protocol (IP) address, or other persistent identifiers.
Non-Personal Information also includes “Usage Data” which is anonymous data associated with your computer, mobile device, and/or media system platform, that includes, in-media time, activities, purchases, badges, and in full compliance with HIPAA and Privacy laws, and on an aggregated and anonymous basis, your diary entries, data and notes, recipes, targets and profile.<br>
<br>Note: Under certain circumstances, Personal Information and/or Non-Personal Information may constitute PHI.
If HIPAA applies to such Personal Information and/or Non-Personal Information, we will take appropriate steps to comply with HIPAA’s privacy and security rule requirement.
For example, if we are a Business Associate of a Covered Entity, and if specific Personal Information and/or Non-Personal Information that we use or disclose as such a Business Associate is PHI, we will take appropriate steps to comply with HIPAA’s privacy and security rule requirement with respect to any such use and disclosure.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Application of this Privacy Policy<br>
</strong>
<br>This Privacy Policy only applies to the information that Cronometer collects and uses, or is supplied, through the access to and use of the Site and/or Services.
Any information disclosed to any third party service providers is dealt with in accordance with the privacy policies adopted by each of those service providers.
Individuals are encouraged to review the privacy policies maintained by each of those service providers to understand how their information will be used by those entities to process requests.
For example, we partner with third party service providers and vendors to provide access to existing payment gateways and your credit card, banking and other billing information is kept with our payment processor Stripe and you can read about their privacy policy at the following link: www.stripe.com.<br>
<br>The Site and/or Services may contain links to third party websites (the “Linked Sites”) that are not controlled or operated by Cronometer.
The Linked Sites are maintained by third parties who have their own privacy policies and their own terms and conditions of use.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to any of the Linked Sites and Cronometer is not responsible for any information disclosed to or collected by those Linked Sites or for the privacy practices of any operators or sponsors of the Linked Sites.
The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party.
Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we do not accept responsibility for any use of your information by such third parties, and we do not guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security practices as Cronometer.
To determine how your information will be treated when accessing or using the Linked Sites, you must read the privacy policy, if any, that applies to each of the Linked Sites.<br>
