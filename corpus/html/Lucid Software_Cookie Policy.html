</p>
<p>Like most websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to remember things about you so that we can provide you with a better experience.</p>
<ul>

They may be served by the entity that operates the website you are visiting (“first-party cookies”) or by other companies (“third-party cookies”).</li>
<li>Web beacons (sometimes called “tracking pixels” or “clear gifs”) are small images that contain a unique identifier that is embedded in our website or in emails or other communications that are sent through our services.
Web beacons are used to collect information about your browser or device and can set cookies.</li>

The cookies we use generally fall into one of the following categories.</p>
<p>
<b>Category of Cookies</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Why we use these cookies</b>
</p>
<p>Technical</p>
<p>These cookies are essential for our services to function properly.
Like the other cookies we use, technical cookies&nbsp;may be either first-party cookies or third-party cookies.</p>

<p>We use these cookies to remember your settings and preferences.</p>
<p>For example, we may use these cookies to remember your language preferences.</p>
<p>Security</p>
<p>We use these cookies to help identify and prevent security risks.</p>
<p>Performance and Functionality</p>
<p>We use these cookies to collect information about how you interact with our services and to help us improve them.</p>
<p>For example, we may use these cookies to determine if you have interacted with a certain page and how well the page performed.</p>

<p>Device IDs: If you access our mobile app, the advertising identifier associated with your device or other identifiers may be recorded and used for purposes similar to those of cookies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>Your Choices</b>
</p>
<p>You have a number of options to control or limit how we and our partners use cookies and similar technologies, including for advertising.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>By Blocking Web Browser Cookies.
</strong>Although most browsers and devices accept cookies by default, their settings usually allow you to clear or decline cookies.
If you disable cookies, however, some of the features of our services may not function properly.
As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s configuration documentation for more information.</li>
<li>
<strong>By Using Industry-Developed Opt-Out Tools.</strong> For information on how our advertising partners allow you to opt out of receiving ads based on your web browsing history, please visit&nbsp;the Digital Advertising Alliance or the Network Advertising Initiative.
European users may opt out of receiving targeted advertising through the&nbsp;European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance.
Additionally, California consumers may use the Digital Advertising Alliance’s CCPA tool to send requests for a web browser to opt out of the sale of personal information by some or all of that framework’s participating companies by accessing the DAA’s tool here: https://www.privacyrights.info.</li>
<li>
<strong>Google and Facebook.</strong> To opt out of ads on Facebook or Google that are targeted to your interests, use your&nbsp;Facebook&nbsp;or&nbsp;Google Ads&nbsp;settings.
To prevent your data from being used by Google Analytics, you can install&nbsp;Google’s opt-out browser add-on.</li>
<li>
<strong>Mobile Platform Opt Outs.</strong> Check your mobile device for settings that control ads based on your interactions with the applications on your device.
For example, on your iOS device, enable the “Limit Ad Tracking” setting, and on your Android device, enable the “Opt out of Ads Personalization” setting.
