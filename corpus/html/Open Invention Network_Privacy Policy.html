The servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.</p>
Electronic Signature and Related Forms
<p>It is not required that organizations join the OIN community via our online electronic signature service, as organizations may mail in signed hardcopies of the OIN license agreement.&nbsp.
However, many organizations opt to do so for convenience.&nbsp.
To do so, a user at the organization must first complete online forms.&nbsp.
During the filling of these forms, a user is required to give certain information (such as name, email address, and title).
Our electronic signature service also stamps your signed OIN license agreement with your IP address.&nbsp.
This information is used to verify the user’s identity and provide legal notices to your organization as required by the OIN license agreement.</p>
