Specifically, California residents may request that we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inform you about the categories of personal data we collect or disclose about you.
the categories of sources of such data.

and the categories of third parties with whom we share/disclose personal data.

<p>
<strong>Note for non-California residents:</strong> We will seek to honor requests to exercise the above rights made by non-California residents to the extent required by applicable law.</p>
<p>Please note that certain data may be exempt from such access, data portability, and deletion requests under California law.
For example, we need to retain certain data in order to provide the Services to you.</p>
<p>Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal data.

<li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal data if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal data relates to you.
Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an Account with us.

This will cause data to cease to be added to any cookies or other tracking technologies that have been set on our Services or block them entirely.
