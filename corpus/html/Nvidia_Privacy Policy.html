<p>
<strong>Types of data.</strong> We may ask for personal information when you make purchases from the online NVIDIA Store, or when we need to configure GeForce Experience, GeForce NOW, and SHIELD TV.
We’ll only ask for the minimum data we need, depending on the products you use.
If you don't want to share your data, you may not be able to use some of our products, or they may not work as well.
Here is some information we might need: &nbsp.
&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Your contact information, including name, email address, phone number, and shipping address, so that we can contact you or ship items you have requested;</li>
<li>Your birthdate and geographic region in which you reside, so we can comply with local laws;</li>
<li>Details on your device and network configurations, how you are using our products or services (including the software you are using), and details on how your system is performing, so we can optimize hardware and software configurations.</li>
</ul>

But we won't collect this information unless you consent.</p>
<p>
<strong>Uses of data.</strong> We use personal data to contact you, ship products to you, comply with local laws, optimize your hardware and software configurations, and fix bugs.
We also use personal data for our legitimate interests in business forecasting, usage analytics, and new product development.</p>

<p>We value our business partners’ privacy.

<p>Here is how we share data:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you order a product from us, your contact information is shared with our shipping vendors to help fulfill your order;</li>
<li>If you visit our online discussion forums, your user profile is shared with a technical vendor to manage operations such as content moderation and account management;</li>

<li>&nbsp;If you are an enterprise customer or developer, or if you sign up for NVIDIA literature, conferences, or webinars, your contact information may be shared with a business partner so they can communicate with you about NVIDIA-branded products or services.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also receive personal data shared from other companies that provide identity enrichment.
We use this information, such as your job title from LinkedIn, to supplement the personal data we receive from you and to show you more personalized website content if you have opted into recommendations.</p>
<p>
<strong>Cross-border data transfers</strong>.
NVIDIA is located in California, and in most cases we need to securely transfer and store your information in the USA.
To meet data protection requirements, we are a member of the EU-U.S.
and Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield frameworks, and we are subject to enforcement by the U.S.
Federal Trade Commission.
This means we adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles of notice, choice, and accountability for onward transfer, security, data integrity, purpose limitation, access, recourse, enforcement, and liability.
We are the data controller, and we remain responsible for any of your personal information that is shared with third parties for processing on our behalf.</p>
<p>NVIDIA has committed to cooperating with the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (DPAs) and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) with regard to unresolved Privacy Shield complaints concerning data transferred from the EU and Switzerland.
Under certain conditions, you may invoke binding arbitration to resolve any complaint.
We are subject to U.S.
law, and we may be required to share data with U.S.
law enforcement agencies.
To learn more about Privacy Shield, please visit the U.S.
Department of Commerce Privacy Shield website: https://www.privacyshield.gov.
For more information regarding our Privacy Shield certification, please see: https://www.privacyshield.gov/list.</p>
<p>Data retention.
We retain your personal data for as long as our engagement with you continues (e.g., emails, website visits, logins, or event attendance).
We erase customer and enterprise personal data if there has been no engagement with you for more than five years.</p>
<p>You may also exercise your right to erasure at any time.
Customers with NVIDIA.com accounts may request erasure of personal data by visiting privacy.nvidia.com.
Developers, business partners, or other members of the public may request erasure of personal data by contacting privacy@nvidia.com.</p> Public Data Collection <p>We collect publicly available data to support our Autonomous Vehicle (AV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) projects.
AV and AI technologies require access to large volumes of high-quality data to learn how to perceive, classify, and navigate among people, objects, and scenes.
Our public data collection is critical for safe, reliable, and accurate development.
Images or video collected are exclusively used for the purposes of these AV and AI projects, and are not used or connected to user profiles for our other products and services.</p>
<p>We collect the following publicly available data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Public images, audio-video, and survey data (e.g., lidar / radar data) surrounding our NVIDIA-identified vehicles, so that we can train our AV and AI models to safely and reliably perceive, classify, and navigate public roads and other spaces;</li>
<li>Publicly licensed or non-copyrighted images of people, faces, or objects so that we can train our AI models to reliably and accurately classify the content of these images;</li>
<li>Public images and audio-video in clearly disclosed locations so that we can train our AI models to reliably and accurately classify people, faces, and public incidents such as accidents or car alarms.</li>
</ul>
<p>We sometimes share publicly available data with business partners that are also developing AV and AI technology.
If we share public data, we require that our partners strictly abide by this Privacy Policy including its restrictions on how such data is used, shared, and stored.</p>
<p>We retain public data for as long as it continues to support our AV and AI projects.
If you are a member of the public and wish to exercise any of your privacy rights, please contact us directly at privacy@nvidia.com.</p> Contact Us <p>If you have any questions, or if you are an Authorized Agent seeking to make a request on behalf of a consumer under California’s Consumer Privacy Act, please send an email to our Data Privacy Officer at privacy@nvidia.com.</p>
