Other information described in the&nbsp;<b>
<i>Information Collected Automatically</i>
</b>&nbsp;section below (some of which is personal information).
and</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
Any other information you provide to us, including user-generated content.</p>
<p>We may also create inferences from this information or from other personal information we hold.</p>
<p>If you submit someone else’s personal information to us (e.g., someone else’s contact information), you represent that you are authorized to provide this information to us.</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>Information Collected Automatically</i>
</b>
</p>
<p>We may collect certain information about you automatically when you visit or use our online Services, or when you interact with emails, advertisements, or other electronic messages we send to you through the Services.
This information may include your IP address, device characteristics (including device identifiers), web browser characteristics, unique identifiers and other data stored in cookies, operating system details, language preference, referring URLs, length of visits, pages viewed, and other information that may be automatically accessible to us from your browser or device.</p>
<p>We and our vendors may automatically collect this information using various tools and technologies such as cookies, web server logs, tags, SDKs, tracking pixels, local storage, JavaScript, APIs, session replay/screen capture (i.e., how you use and navigate the services, but not your keystroke data), and other similar technologies.&nbsp.
Additional information on other technologies we may use is set forth below.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
What is a cookie? A cookie is a piece of data that a website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your device, sometimes with a code unique to your device.
Cookies enable us and our vendors to (i) recognize your computer.
(ii) store your preferences, settings, and other data.
(iii) understand the web pages you have visited on our Services and elsewhere.
(iv), enhance your user experience by delivering and measuring the effectiveness of content and advertising tailored to your interests.
(v) perform searches and analytics.
and (vi) assist with security and administrative functions.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
What is a web server log? A web server log is a file where online activity is stored.&nbsp.
It may be used for similar purposes.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
What’s an SDK? An SDK is a set of tools and/or code that we embed in our applications and software to perform certain functions, such as allowing us or third parties to collect information about how users interact with our Services.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
What are Tags or tracking pixels? Tags or tracking pixels (sometimes also referred to as web beacons or clear GIFs) are small code (sometimes containing, generating, or detecting a unique identifier) embedded in websites, online ads, and email, that can be used for purposes such as generating web server logs or reading or writing cookies for the purposes described above.</p>
<p>As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather information through other methods.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may also use certain third-party web and mobile app analytics services – including but not limited to Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, Twitter Analytics, and Facebook Custom Audiences – to help us understand and analyze how visitors use the online Services and serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and in different channels (including on the web, in mobile apps, on out-of-home digital surfaces, and in connected TV apps.
We’ve implemented Google Analytics Advertising features such as&nbsp;remarketing with analytics, interest-based advertising, demographics and interests reporting, user segment analysis, look-alike modeling and impression reporting.
We and third-party vendors may use first-party cookies or other first-party identifiers as well as third-party cookies or other third-party identifiers to provide Chipotle with insight into behavior information relating to inferred visitor age range (e.g., GenZ, Millenial, GenX, etc.), your interests, and&nbsp;to deliver advertisements to you, create a profile of you, measure your interests, detect your demographics, detect your location, personalize content, and detect and associate online and offline behaviors such as site visitation, dwell time and actions taken.
For more information on how the Google Marketing Platform uses the data collected through the online Services, visit:&nbsp;<b>www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</b>.</p>
<p>In addition to the automatic collection mechanisms listed above, we may also:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
As an advertising publisher, use tags in connection with the Nielsen Digital Ad Ratings Service for Google Ad Manager;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
Through tracking technologies, receive and use Foursquare service user data, including search terms, what pages you view, your access times, the time you spend on each page, the IP address used to access the pages, and other user data (<i>see&nbsp;</i>
<b>Foursquare Privacy Policy</b>).
and</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
Use Microsoft’s Bing Universal Event Tracking (UET) feature, in which case Microsoft collects your personal information (<i>see&nbsp;</i>
<b>Microsoft Privacy Statement</b>).</p>
<p>Depending on your personal device and App permission settings, when using the App, we may collect or have access to your:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Precise geolocation.</b>&nbsp;When you give the App permission to do this, the App may use your mobile device’s location services to collect real-time information about the location of your device (using both GPS and other methods) to provide requested location services, ensure your orders are placed at the correct location, and to serve you relevant offers or promotions.
However, Chipotle does not retain or store your precise location when you enable sharing this information on your mobile device.</li>
<li>
<b>Camera.</b>&nbsp;When enabled, this may allow the App to access the camera to scan and input payment method details.
Providing access to your Camera function is entirely optional.</li>
<li>
<b>Wi-Fi connection information.</b>&nbsp;When enabled, this may allow the App to view Wi-Fi connections.</li>
<li>
<b>Other.</b>&nbsp;The App will send and receive data to and from the Internet, and may view network connections, have full network access, control vibration of your device, or prevent your device from sleeping.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may be able to enable or disable geolocation collection by the App by adjusting the permissions in your account or device settings.
If GPS precise location services are disabled, other means of establishing or estimating location (e.g., connecting to or proximity to Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, beacons, or our networks) may still be active.
&nbsp;networks generally</p>
<p>Some of the technology described above is used by us or our partners to correlate information collected about you over time across two or more websites or online services.</p>
<p>Please review Section 7 (“Your Choices”) for additional information about how you can manage the use of these technologies.</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>Information Collected From Third Parties</i>
</b>
</p>
<p>Our vendors and other third parties may share with us your personal information.
For example, if you order food or catering, order gift cards, make a purchase for merchandise, make a payment, or provide feedback on your experiences, you may submit personal information to one or more third parties that may share your information with us.</p>
<p>In some circumstances, we also may collect information about you from publicly-available sources, including content about our Services that you make publicly available on third-party websites (e.g., social media platforms).&nbsp.
We or vendors assisting us may also receive information from geolocation data providers to help us understand aggregate visit patterns in restaurant markets of interest, but these providers get the location data from sources other than our own App and websites.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, for certain features of the online Services, you may log in through your third-party social media account or share content from the online Services through third-party social media platforms.
We may combine information that we have about you with information we obtain from third parties.
When you submit information to a third party, you are subject to that third party’s terms of use and privacy policies, for which we are not responsible.</p>
<p>
<b>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
USE OF INFORMATION</b>
</p>
<p>We may use personal information we obtain about you to:</p>

or</li>
<li>for any other purpose, with your consent where appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also use any of the personal information we collect to (1) generate pseudonymous or other proprietary identifiers and use them for any of the purposes described in this Privacy Policy (for example, creating, using and sharing an encrypted hash of an email address you provided to us for our advertising purposes).
and (2) generate anonymous or de-identified information and use it for any purpose.</p>
<p>
<b>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
SHARING OF INFORMATION</b>
</p>
<p>We may share your personal information with vendors who assist us with the uses and disclosures described in this Privacy Policy, such as delivery services, analytics providers, marketing and advertising services, providers of payment services, providers of of other support for our transactions (e.g., accounting services), providers of technical services (e.g., data storage and customer relationship management databases).&nbsp;We generally require our vendors to provide at least the same or equal protection of user data as stated in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Some of the vendors who help us (for example, those mentioned in the “<b>
<i>Information Collected Automatically</i>
</b>” section above) may view, edit, or set their own tracking technologies/cookies, some of which collect personal information.</p>
<p>We may also share, including by publicly posting on our online Services or other public online locations, certain content about us or our Services that you submit to us or otherwise make publicly available.&nbsp.
For example, we may repost content that you post about us on social media.</p>
<p>In the event of a business transaction, such as if we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets (e.g., further to a merger, reorganization, liquidation, or any other business transaction, including negotiations of such transactions), we reserve the right to disclose any information we obtain through the Services.
You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Privacy Policy.&nbsp.
To the extent legally permitted, the acquiring party may use the information pursuant to their own privacy policy instead of this one.</p>
<p>We may also disclose personal information when required by subpoena, search warrant, or other legal processes, or in response to activities that are unlawful or a violation of Chipotle’s rules for use of the Services, or to protect and defend the rights or property of Chipotle or others.&nbsp.
This may involve the disclosure of personal information to law enforcement, other governmental entities, or other third parties, depending on the circumstances.</p>
<p>
<b>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
RETENTION OF INFORMATION</b>
</p>
<p>We retain personal information to achieve the purposes for which the information was collected.
In certain cases, we may need to retain personal information for purposes required under applicable law, for tax or audit purposes, or for other purposes permitted under law.</p>
<p>
<b>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
SECURITY</b>
</p>
<p>Although we use various security measures as part of an effort to protect your personal information from loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction, these measures may fail or be insufficient.
No collection, transmission, storage or other handling of personal information is completely secure (whether online or offline), and we cannot guarantee the security of your information.</p>
<p>
<b>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</b>
</p>
<p>The online Services are not intended for, and are not intentionally targeted to, children under 13, and we do not knowingly request or collect personal information from any person under 13 years of age through the Services.
If we learn that the online Services have received personal information directly from a child who is under the age of 13, we will delete the information in accordance with applicable law.</p>
<p>
<b>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.

<b>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS</b>
</p>
<p>The following section provides detailed information applicable to California residents under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>Collection, Use, and Disclosure of California Personal Information</i>
</b>
</p>
<p>During the 12 months leading up to the effective date of this Privacy Policy, we have collected all of the types of personal information described in Section 1 (“<b>
<i>Collection of Information</i>
</b>
<i>”</i>)<i>&nbsp;</i>of this Privacy Policy.&nbsp.
During that period, we made the following disclosures of personal information about Californians for the purposes described in Section 2 (“<b>
<i>Use of Information</i>
</b>
<i>”</i>) above:</p>
<p>
<b>Category of personal information</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Categories of third parties to which it was disclosed</b>

<i>Information Collected Automatically</i>
</b>&nbsp;section above (some of which is personal information)</p>
<p>Affiliates, delivery services, marketing and advertising services, providers of payment services, transactional support providers.</p>
<p>Other information you provide to us, including user-generated content and information provided via surveys, focus groups, and/or other marketing research efforts</p>
<p>Affiliates, delivery services, marketing and advertising services, providers of payment services, transactional support providers.</p>
<p>Inferences</p>
<p>Affiliates, delivery services, marketing and advertising services, providers of payment services, transactional support providers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the 12 months leading up to the effective date of this Privacy Policy, we “sold” (as that term is defined under the CCPA), commercial information (transaction data), payment card information, and internet or other network or device activity (like a record of a browser’s visit to our website) to market and advertise services to assist with such activities.&nbsp.
We do not “sell” personal information if we have actual knowledge that the consumer is less than 16 years of age.</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>Your CCPA Information &amp.
Deletion Rights</i>
</b>
</p>
<p>The CCPA allows you to request us to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inform you about the categories of personal information we collect or disclose about you.
the categories of sources of such information.
the business or commercial purpose for collecting your personal information.
and the categories of third parties with whom we share/disclose personal&nbsp;information.</li>
<li>Provide access to and/or a copy of certain personal information we hold about you.</li>
<li>Delete certain personal information we have about&nbsp;you.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you would like to exercise any of these rights, you may submit your request by completing our&nbsp;CCPA Data Request Form&nbsp;or contacting us by phone at 833-506-0473.</p>
<p>Please note that certain information may be exempt from such requests under California law.
&nbsp;For example, we need certain information to provide our Services to you.&nbsp.
We also will take reasonable steps verify your identity before responding to your request, which may include, at a minimum, depending on the sensitivity of the information you are requesting and the type of request you are making, verifying your name, email address, and other information regarding your use of the Services (e.g., date of last purchase or last 4 digits of a payment/gift card).
&nbsp;</p>
<p>While you have the right to make a deletion request at any time, kindly note that processing this right would cause you may lose any promotional offers that would have been provided as a result of maintaining your deleted Chipotle Rewards account.&nbsp.
This may include any benefit provided through the exclusive use of Rewards account, like any accrued points, prizes, and promotional coupons.</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>Your CCPA Right to Opt Out of “Sale” of Personal Information</i>
</b>
</p>
<p>Californians have a right to direct us not to “sell” certain personal information as that term is defined in under the CCPA.&nbsp.
You can exercise that right by performing BOTH of the following steps:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
Follow the instructions on our&nbsp;CCPA Do Not Sell Request Form</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
OR contact us by phone at 833-506-0473 to make a general do-not-sell request.
We may take reasonable steps to verify the validity of your request.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>Requests Made by Agents</i>
</b>
</p>
<p>If you are an agent making a request on behalf of a consumer, we reserve the right to take steps to verify that you are authorized to make that request, which may include requiring you to provide us with written proof such as a notarized authentication letter or a power of attorney, as stipulated applicable state law.&nbsp.
As part of the process, we may additionally require the customer to verify their identity directly with us.
For security and legal reasons, Chipotle will reject requests that require us to access third-party websites or services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because opt-out requests for sales made through cookies and related technology must be performed from each browser that is used to access our Services, it is easiest for the consumer to perform such opt-outs themselves.&nbsp.
However, if a consumer wishes for an agent to perform browser-based requests on their behalf, the consumer may arrange for the agent to use the consumer’s browser to make such requests.&nbsp.
We are not responsible for the security risks of this or any other arrangements that a consumer may have with an agent.&nbsp.
For clarity, this is not permission for any user to share their login credentials with an agent or any third party.&nbsp.
Such sharing is a violation of our Terms of Use and is not required for an agent to make requests under this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>Nondiscrimination</i>
</b>
</p>
<p>You also have the right not to receive “discriminatory treatment” (within the meaning of the CCPA) for exercising CCPA rights.</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>Notice of Financial Incentives</i>
</b>
</p>
<p>The Chipotle Rewards Program lets participants earn or otherwise receive rewards (e.g., free entrees) and discounts, in return for registering and/or making purchases, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spend-based incentives, where you earn credit based upon spend levels</li>
<li>Discounts and free products offered for frequent visitors&nbsp;</li>
<li>Periodic promotional discounts and offers</li>
</ul>
<p>You can sign up for the Rewards Program by&nbsp;registering on our website&nbsp;or through the Chipotle app.
&nbsp;Registration requires you to provide your name, email address, telephone number, and (optionally) your day and month of birth.&nbsp.
We will then associate that and other categories of personal information with your Rewards Program account, such as other unique identifiers, purchase history, geolocation data, preferences you provide (e.g., favorite Chipotle restaurants), and stored payment methods.&nbsp.
Note that we also may collect all of this information outside the context of the Rewards Program.</p>
<p>Full terms for the Rewards Program are available&nbsp;here.</p>
<p>You may withdraw from the Rewards Program at any time and forfeit any ongoing incentives by contacting us using the contact information below.</p>
<p>
<br>
While we do not and cannot assign a monetary value to the personal information we collect through the Rewards Program, we do benefit financially from the Rewards Program.
For example, although we may lose immediate revenue when a member uses a discount, the positive experience may lead to an overall increase in visits to our restaurants.</p>
<p>Calculating the actual value that Chipotle generates from those efforts (whether in aggregate or by individual) or a monetary value of the personal information involved is impossible.
There are many reasons for this:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
First, the information is of no monetary value by itself, as Chipotle achieves personal information-related benefits only when the information is used in combination with, and in the context of, other aspects of our business such as (1) high-quality marketing efforts, (2) the compelling financial components of our Rewards Program that do not require use of the personal information, such as the ability to earn discounts and rewards, (3) the high quality of our food and service, and (4) the proximity of our restaurants to Rewards Program members.&nbsp;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
Second, we can’t precisely determine the motivating factors of any specific purchase, or the relative weights of each factor.&nbsp.
Even if somebody redeems a coupon we sent to the contact information they supplied during Rewards Program registration, we can’t determine whether they would have made the same purchase on the same day even without the coupon.&nbsp.
In a lot of households, Tuesday is taco Tuesday – coupon or not.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
Third, the level of engagement with our uses of personal information varies among Rewards Program members.
For example, some members may read a lot of our marketing content, while others have unsubscribed and never see any.
Some live next door to one of our restaurants, while others are out of delivery range.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
Fourth, the dining habits of our Rewards Program members appear to vary significantly.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
Fifth, not all members link their purchases to their Rewards Program membership, so we can’t identify all purchases by Rewards Program members, let alone which ones were influenced by their participation in the program.</p>
<p>For these reasons, we estimate that the value of the personal information collected for the Rewards Program would be less than the value the individual receives from their participation in the Reward Program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>Other California Law</i>
</b>
</p>
<p>Subject to certain limitations under California’s Shine the Light law, residents of the State of California may contact us as described at the end of this Privacy Policy to request a list of third parties to whom we disclosed certain personal information for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes during the preceding year.
The information we will provide will describe our general practices in the prior calendar year and will not be specific to you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your request should indicate that you are a California resident, and you must provide your full current California address, to which we will send our response.
Your inquiry must specify “Shine the Light Request” in the subject line of the email or the first line of the letter, and include your California address.
We are only required to respond to one such request per individual each year.&nbsp.
We may take reasonable steps to verify your identity and the authenticity of the request.</p>
<p>
<b>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES AND SERVICES</b>
</p>
<p>The Services may offer links to websites and other services that are not maintained by Chipotle.
By visiting one of these linked websites or services, you are subject to their privacy and other policies.
We are not responsible for, or able to monitor or control, the policies and practices of other companies.</p>
