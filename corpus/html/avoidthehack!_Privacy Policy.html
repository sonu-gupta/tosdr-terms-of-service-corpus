<p>Our privacy policy was last updated: <strong>24 OCT 2021</strong> View previous</p>
<p>As a website that promotes end-user cybersecurity and user data privacy, avoidthehack! respects the privacy of all visitors.</p>
<p>As a testament to this, we will keep our privacy policy short and easy to understand.</p>
Information we collect
<p>avoidthehack! uses Matomo for analytics, which is an open source and privacy-friendly analytics software.
It is GDPR and CCPA compliant.</p>
<p>We self-host Matomo on our own servers, so what limited information it collects remains in house.
Our Matomo configuration collects:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first two bytes of your IP address (192.168.xxx.xxx).
The rest is anonymized.</li>
<li>The pages of this website (and only this website) that you visit</li>
<li>Your browser's referrer header, <em>if</em> one is sent.
This is automatically anonymized so that we only collect the domain of the URL, even if your browser offers the full string.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your browser happens to send a <strong>DO NOT TRACK (DNT)</strong> request to our website on your behalf, we honor these requests by default.</p>
<p>We don't collect personally identifiable information without consent.</p>
<p>If we do collect personal data, such as your email address, it is <strong>only via user consent</strong> such as when you fill out our contact form.</p>
Information third-parties collect
<p>We use Commento's commenting system for the comment sections of most of our posts.
</p>
<p>This commenting system does allow you to comment anonymously.
Please note that if you choose to "login" to post a comment, then a persistent cookie will be stored on your device.</p>
How we use your information
<p>The information we collect via Matomo is used to further improve avoidthehack! for all visitors.
Specifically, we use information collected to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Optimize this website for speed and ease-of-use</li>
<li>Ensure site security from potential attackers</li>
</ul>
<p>What contact information you may give to us is used to provide a response and/or contact you, ex: in response to a question you may ask.</p>
<p>avoidthehack! <strong>DOES NOT</strong> sell any personal information...
because there's nothing to sell.</p>
<p>If you would like to remain anonymous when sending us a message, you do not have to use your real name <em>or</em> email address.
</p>
<p>Please be aware that if you do not use your real email address, we won't be able to respond to your message.</p>
