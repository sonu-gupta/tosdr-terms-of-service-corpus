In accordance with COPPA, a School or School Representative may act as the agent of the parent or legal guardian of a Student and provide consent on behalf of the parent for Screencastify‚Äôs collection, use and disclosure of the Student‚Äôs information so long as such collection, use and disclosure are solely related to the Student‚Äôs use of the Services for educational purposes.
