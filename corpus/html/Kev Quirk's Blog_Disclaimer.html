The opinions expressed here are my own and not those of my employer.</p>
<p>In addition, my thoughts and opinions change from time to time.
I consider this a necessary consequence of having an open mind.</p>
<p>This blog is intended to provide a semi-permanent, point in time snapshot of the various thoughts running around my brain.
As such, any thoughts and opinions expressed within my previous posts may not be the same, or even similar, to those I may hold today.</p> Blog Posts <p>I sometimes write technical posts on this blog.
All of which describe processes that have worked for me at the time of writing, but if I find an error I will post an update.
Where possible, I will provide context as to why I decided to follow the processes I describe.</p>
<p>My technical posts are generally not the only way to achieve a goal, they may not even be the <em>correct</em> way to do so.
They are nothing more than a document which describes how I personally scratched a technical itch, or overcame a problem I was facing.</p>
<p>All of my posts assume a certain level of technical ability.
If you’re not comfortable in the command line of an operating system, my posts probably aren’t for you.</p>
