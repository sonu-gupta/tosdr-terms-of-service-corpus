The DeepL Pro Translator will try to notify the user about exceeding these limits and warn about possible performance issues.</p>
<p>The DeepL Pro Translator allows Customer to translate whole documents.
Ability to translate documents is subject to the ability of DeepL Pro to correctly read and translate the documents, which can't be guaranteed.</p>
