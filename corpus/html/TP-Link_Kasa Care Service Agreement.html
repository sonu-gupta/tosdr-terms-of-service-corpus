recordings covering limited time frames depending on your level of Kasa
Care Services.</p>
Subscription Plans
<p>Every Kasa Cam comes with our free Kasa Care Services package ("Free
Package") that may provide you with various services.
We reserve the
right to modify any services provided under the Free Package or
terminate the Free Package at any time in our sole discretion.</p>
<p>We also offer multiple tiers of paid subscription plans for our Kasa
Care Services.

to any applicable taxes) on a monthly or annually recurring basis
depending on the billing cycle you choose and the promotion code you
apply, if any, for as long as your subscription is in effect, and (2)
your subscription is in effect until you cancel it or it is terminated
at our discretion because your credit card was declined or you otherwise
fail to pay your subscription fee.</p>
