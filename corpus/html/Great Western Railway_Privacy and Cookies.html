Communications This section is to explain how we will ensure that you only receive communications that you wish to receive:<br>
<br>
Marketing communications:
We can only use your personal information to send you marketing messages if we have either your consent or a ‘legitimate interest’.
A ‘legitimate interest’ is when we have a business or commercial reason to use your information.
It must not unfairly go against what is right and best for you.<br>
<br>
The personal data we have for you is made up of what you tell us, and the data we collect about you when you use our services, or data provided to us from third parties we work with.
We study this to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you.
This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you.<br>
<br>
We want to ensure that you are informed and aware of the best products, services, promotions and events that we can offer you.
By consenting to receive additional communications (by mail, telephone, SMS, text/picture/video message, app push notifications or email) from us and any named third parties that feature at the point of obtaining consent in respect of such information, we will process your personal data in accordance with this privacy policy.<br>
<br>
If you have provided your consent to receive marketing communications from us and you change your mind, you can change your preferences and unsubscribe at any time by unsubscribing from the relevant communication channel, changing your preferences in the preference centre or by contacting us at GWR-DPO@gwr.com.
If you choose not to receive this information we will be unable to keep you informed of new products, services and promotions that may interest you.<br>
<br>
Whatever you choose, you'll still receive booking confirmations and other important information, for example service updates.<br>
<br>
Service communications:
As detailed in the table at section 6, we may send you communications such as those which relate to any service updates (e.g.
service disruption) or provide customer satisfaction surveys.
We consider that we can lawfully send these communications to you as we have a legitimate interest to do so, namely to effectively provide you with the best service we can and to grow our business.
</li>
<li> 7.
Who will have access to your personal data? This section is to explain who, within GWR, will have access to your data.
Your personal data will only be seen or used by our employees who have a legitimate business need to access your personal data for the purposes set out in this privacy policy.<br>
<br>
We take your privacy seriously and have implemented appropriate physical, technical and organisational security measures designed to secure your personal data against accidental loss, destruction or damage and unauthorised access, use, alteration or disclosure.
</li>
<li> 8.
Who else might we share your personal data with? This section will inform you of who we share your personal data with and why.
Except as explained in this privacy policy, we will not share your personal data without your consent unless required to do so by law.<br>
<br>
We may share your personal data with you, and where appropriate, your family, your associates and your representatives.<br>
<br>
We may share your personal data with any member of our group which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company (FirstGroup plc) and its subsidiaries as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006.

How do we protect your personal data? This section explains how we keep your personal data safe and where it will be held.<br>
<br>
We take your privacy seriously and are committed to maintaining the privacy and security of the personal data you provide to us, and the choices you have regarding our collection and use of your personal data.<br>
<br>
Once we have received your personal data, we follow strict security procedures as to how your personal data is stored and used, and who sees it, to help stop any unauthorised access.<br>
<br>
Any payment transactions will be encrypted.
Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.
You should not share this information with anyone.<br>
<br>
The information that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the United Kingdom (UK).
When we transfer and store your personal data outside of the UK we will ensure that it is adequately protected by using appropriate safeguards as further detailed below.<br>
<br>
Staff operating outside the UK who work for us, or one of our suppliers, may process the information.
Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services;<br>
<br>
Where your personal data is transferred from the UK to a recipient outside the UK in a country not recognised by the United Kingdom as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data, such transfer shall be covered by a framework recognised by the relevant authorities or courts as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data including but not limited to&nbsp;Standard Contractual Clauses (the agreement in the form annexed to the European Commission's decision of 5 February 2010 on Standard Contractual Clauses for the transfer of personal data to processors established in third countries which can be found here (PDF, 776 KB))<br>
<br> Unfortunately, the transmission of your personal data via the internet is not completely secure and although we do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to us over the internet and you acknowledge that any transmission is at your own risk.
</li>
<li> 10.
How long do we keep your personal data? This section explains the length of time that we will retain your personal data.<br>
<br>
We will keep your personal data for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it was obtained.
The criteria for determining the duration for which we will retain your personal data are as follows:<br>
<br>
(1) we will retain your personal data in a form that permits identification only for as long as:<br>
<ul>
<li>we maintain an ongoing relationship with you.
or</li>
<li>your personal data is necessary in connection with the lawful purposes set out in this policy for which we have a valid legal basis.</li>
</ul>
plus
<br>
(2) the duration of:<br>
<ul>
<li>any applicable limitation period under applicable law (i.e.
any period during which any person could bring a legal claim against us in connection with your personal data, or to which your personal data may be relevant).
or</li>
<li>an additional reasonable period following the end of such applicable limitation period.</li>
</ul>
and<br>
<br>
(3) in addition, if any relevant legal claims are brought, we may continue to process your personal data for such additional periods as are necessary in connection with that claim.<br>
<br>
During the periods in paragraphs (2)a and (2)b above, we will restrict our processing of your personal data to the storage of, and maintaining the security of, those data, except to the extent that those data need to be reviewed in connection with any legal claim or obligation under applicable law.<br>
<br>
After this period your personal data will be anonymised so that you are no longer identified or identifiable from such information, or securely deleted/destroyed.<br>
<br>
Any third parties that we engage will keep your data stored on their systems for as long as is necessary to provide the relevant services to you or us.
If we end our relationship with any third party providers, we will make sure that they securely delete or return your personal data to us.<br>
<br>
The retention periods for CCTV and BWV vary depending on the location and system in use.
Such periods tend not to exceed 30 days and will always be reasonable or as long as is required by law.
For more information please contact us using the details provided in section 13.<br>
<br>
We may retain personal data about you for statistical purposes (for example, to help us better advertise our services).
Where data is retained for statistical purposes it will always be anonymised, meaning that you will not be identifiable from that data.
</li>
<li> 11.
What are your rights? This section explains that you have a number of rights in relation to your personal data.
There are circumstances in which your rights may not apply.
You have the right to request that we:<br>
<ul>
<li>provide you with a copy of the information we hold about you;</li>
<li>update any of your personal information if it is inaccurate or out of date;</li>
<li>delete the personal data we hold about you - if we are providing services to you and you ask us to delete personal data we hold about you then we may be unable to continue providing those services to you;</li>
<li>restrict the way in which we process your personal data;</li>
<li>stop processing your data if you have valid objections to such processing.
and</li>
<li>transfer your personal data to a third party.</li>
</ul>
For more information on your rights and how to use them, or if you would like to make any of the requests set out above, please contact us using the details provided in section 13.
We will respond to all such requests within the time period required by law.
Occasionally it may take us longer, if your request is particularly complex, you have made a number of requests or you have not supplied the information we need to respond to you.
In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.<br>
<br>
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights).
This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.<br>
<br>
As explained in the section on Communications above, even if you consented to the processing of your personal data for marketing purposes (by ticking the relevant box or by requesting information about services), you have the right to ask us to stop processing your personal data for such purposes.
You can exercise this right at any time by unsubscribing from the relevant communication channel, changing your preferences in the preference centre or by contacting us at GWR-DPO@gwr.com.<br>
<br>
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).
However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.
Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

</ul> Cookie policy
<p>
<strong>Last updated: 6 July 2021</strong>
</p>
<p>This policy explains how our website, mobile app and Wi-Fi portal use cookies.</p>
What is a cookie?
<p>Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your personal computer, mobile or other device when you visit a website.<br>
<br>
Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognises that cookie.
Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognise a user's device.
<br>
<br>
Cookies in themselves do not identify you, just the computer or device you are using.
Cookies do lots of different jobs, like making it easier for you to log onto, and use, our site during future visits, letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving your experience.
They also allow us to monitor traffic on our site and can also help to ensure that advertising you see online is more relevant to you and your interests.<br>
<br>
Cookies themselves only record which areas of our site have been visited by your computer or device and for how long.
Allowing us to create a cookie does not give us access to the rest of your computer, and does not allow us to see any personally identifiable data about you.</p>
Types of Cookies
<p>We've arranged the Cookies we use into three groups:<br>
<br>
a) <strong>Required cookies:</strong> These Cookies are necessary for core features of this site to operate properly.
Because they are needed for the site’s operation, they are always set to "Active".
They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our website or make a purchase.<br>
<br>
b) <strong>Functionality cookies:</strong> These Cookies allow us to analyze site usage in order to evaluate and improve its performance.
They are also used to provide a better user experience on the site, such as by measuring interactions with particular content or remembering settings.
<br>
<br>
d) <strong>Advertising cookies: </strong>These Cookies are used by advertising companies to inform and serve personalized ads more relevant to your interests.
These Cookies also may facilitate sharing information with social networks or recording your interactions with particular ads.</p>
Cookies we use
<p>You can find more information about the individual cookies we use and the purposes for which we use them in the table below.
If you choose not to accept any Functionality or Advertising cookies or your browser is not compatible with our cookie preference tool we will only use Required cookies.<br>
