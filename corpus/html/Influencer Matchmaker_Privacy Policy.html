<ul>

We only allow such third parties to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>6.INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS<p>We share your personal data within our group of companies which involves transferring your data outside the European Economic Area (EEA).]</p>
<p>Countries outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) do not always offer the same levels of protection to your personal data, so European law has prohibited transfers of personal data outside of the EEA unless the transfer meets certain criteria.</p>
<p>Many of our third parties service providers are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.</p>
<p>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we do our best to ensure a similar degree of security of data by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission.
or</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts or codes of conduct or certification mechanisms approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.
or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where we use providers based in the United States, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the EU-US Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If none of the above safeguards is available, we may request your explicit consent to the specific transfer.
You will have the right to withdraw this consent at any time.</p>
<p>Please email us at <strong>contact@influencermatchmaker.co.uk</strong> if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.</p>7.DATA SECURITY<p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed.
In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know such data.

<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
<p>By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for six years after they cease being customers for tax purposes.</p>
<p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see below for further information.</p>
