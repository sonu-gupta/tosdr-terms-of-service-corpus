         <p>We value our customers and our goal is to provide the best product experience and service to you.</p>
<p>Our products all have trial versions for people to utilize the functions before determining to purchase.
We recommend our users get a free trial from our official website to see if it’s satisfactory to you.
There are not many functional differences between trial version and a paid one except the watermark, time limits, etc.</p>
<p>Once an order is placed, our system will deliver the Serial Number(s) to your email address automatically.
After you have received the serial numbers, you’re then able to activate the products and continue the usage of product without limits.
You can apply for a full refund with our approval, but it’s recommended to solve your problem with the assistance of our support team before the refund:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get online help on the MSTech website.</li>
<li>Get online help, by sending your question to support@mstech-co.com email.</li>
</ul>
