<li>App Sandbox is an access control technology provided in macOS, enforced at the kernel level.
Its strategy is twofold:
<ol>
<li>App Sandbox force the app describes how to interact with the system.
The system then grants the app the access it needs to get its job done, and no more.</li>
<li>App Sandbox allows the user to transparently grant the app additional access by way of Open and Save dialogs, drag and drop, and other familiar user interactions.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>A non-sandboxed app has the full rights of the user who is running that app, and can access any resources that the user can access.
If an attacker can potentially exploit that app, the attacker gains the ability to do anything that the user can do.</li>
