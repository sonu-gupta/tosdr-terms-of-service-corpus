To the extent allowed by applicable law, products purchased from an unauthorized retailer are not covered by our return policy.<p>If you wish to return part of your order, we will refund the retail price of each item from your original order.
For example, if you purchased a MANSCAPED™ Perfect Package ($139.99 value) and choose to keep The Lawn Mower™ 3.0 trimmer ($79.99 value), your refund will be $139.99 - $79.99 = $60.00.
