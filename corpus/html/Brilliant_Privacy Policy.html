If you are a resident of the European Union ("EU"), United Kingdom, Lichtenstein, Norway, or Iceland, you may have additional rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the "GDPR") with respect to your Personal Information, as outlined below.

What Personal Information Does Brilliant Collect? <p> Brilliant collects information you voluntarily submit to the Service, such as, the information we collect when you register for an account: your name, email address, school, date of birth, etc.
</p>
<p> Information you elect to submit to the Service in a public or quasi-public manner may be disclosed to other users of the Application or the general public ("User Submission(s)").
For example–if you make a post to a message board or chat forum that includes any personal information – such information will be made publicly available.
We endeavor to make sure the Service's functionality puts you on reasonable notice as to the scope of an intended submission.
</p>
<p> In addition, we may automatically receive and store certain, anonymous types of information whenever you interact with the Service.
Such information may include the user's IP address, domain server, and type of Internet browser.

<em>Do Not Track Policy.</em> Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services.
Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy.
Your browser may offer you a "Do Not Track" option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites.
Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave our Services.
