</ul> Vulnerability Disclosure Policy Last Update: June 20th, 2022 Brand Promise
<p>Taboola, Inc., together with its affiliates (“Taboola”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) is committed to working<br>
with security researchers to verify and address any potential vulnerabilities in our services that are<br>
reported to us in accordance with this Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (“Policy”).
We hope to foster<br>
an open partnership with the security community, and we recognize that the work the community<br>
does is important in continuing to ensure the safety and security of our customers, users, and<br>
partners.</p>
<p>We have developed this Policy to both reflect our corporate values and to uphold our legal<br>
responsibility to good-faith security researchers that are providing us with their expertise and<br>
security suggestions.</p>
Program &amp.
Scope
<p>We ask that all security researchers submit vulnerability reports about any of the following<br>
(collectively, the “Services”):</p>
<ul>
<li>Our website, www.taboola.com, the websites of our affiliates and subsidiaries (including Connexity and Skimlinks), or any Taboola website displaying our Privacy Policy<br>
(collectively the “Sites”)</li>
<li>Our content discovery platforms, feeds, widgets, analytics tools, and other technical<br>
applications that we provide on third-party websites (collectively, the “Content Discovery<br>
Platform”)</li>
<li>The Taboola News suite of content-discovery tools available on mobile devices and<br>
operating systems (including the Start line of products, collectively “Taboola News”)</li>
</ul>
Legal Posture
<p>We openly accept vulnerability reports for the Services, and Taboola will not engage in legal action<br>
against individuals who submit vulnerability reports in accordance with this Policy.
We agree not to<br>
pursue legal action against individuals who:</p>
<ul>
<li>Engage in vulnerability testing within the scope of this Policy.</li>
<li>Engage in vulnerability testing involving only the Services.</li>
<li>Engage in vulnerability testing without affecting or harming Taboola or its customers, users,<br>
or partners.</li>
<li>Adhere to the laws of their location and the location of Taboola.
For example, violating laws<br>
that would only result in a claim by Taboola (and not a criminal claim) may be acceptable as<br>
Taboola is authorizing the activity (reverse engineering or circumventing protective<br>
measures) to improve the Services.</li>
<li>Refrain from disclosing vulnerability details to the public before a mutually agreed-upon<br>
timeframe expires.</li>
</ul>
