<p>HERE processes your Personal Data pursuant to several legal bases, depending on the type of data and purpose of the processing.
Under most circumstances, HERE’s processing of your Personal Data in the recruitment context is based on your request in the anticipation of entering into an employment agreement with HERE.
HERE will also process this information where required to comply with legal obligations to which it is subject, such as governmental reporting obligations.
In some circumstances, HERE will process your Personal Data pursuant to its own legitimate interests in operating its business, including conducting the above described activities for internal administrative purposes and ensuring network and information security.
A different legal basis may be provided at the point where Personal Data is collected.</p>
<p>4.
How is Sensitive Information treated?</p>
<p>HERE aims to limit the collection of Sensitive Information<sup>
<sup>[1]</sup>
</sup> and shall only collect Sensitive Information if there is a legal justification for processing it, or if it is collected and processed with your express consent.</p>
<p>HERE recognizes the additional need to protect Sensitive Information.
All Sensitive Information is processed in strict compliance with applicable local law and only by a restricted number of individuals who have a clear and justified need to know such information.</p>
<p>Sensitive Information may be processed where necessary to enable HERE to exercise its legal rights or perform its legal obligations in the field of employment law or related fields of law.
Examples of such obligations include ensuring the health and safety of HERE’s employees through the provision of a safe working environment or where the processing is carried out by a doctor or similar health professional bound by a duty of confidentiality to you and is necessary for medical purposes.</p>
<p>5.
Who has access to your data?</p>
<p>It is HERE’s responsibility to implement appropriate access control measures to ensure that your Personal Data is only accessed by persons having a clear need to know such information.</p>
<p>The extent to which your Personal Data are made accessible will depend upon the nature of the data concerned.
Prior to hire, your Personal Data is not made widely available.
Some Personal Data, such as your resume, job history, and other information relevant to assessing your fitness for the position to which you have applied, are made available as needed to the HERE team you are seeking to join, others within HERE with a stake in the applied for role, and appropriate members of the HERE Human Resources Department.
Except as needed to assess your qualifications for the role, access to most of your Personal Data is restricted to certain experts (e.g.
Human Resources, IT or Legal) to the extent necessary to perform their work tasks.</p>
<p>6.
Transfer of your Personal Data</p>
<p>HERE will not sell, lease, rent or otherwise disclose your Personal Data except as provided in this section:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
Consent: HERE may share your Personal Data if you have given your consent for HERE to do so.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
HERE companies and authorized third parties: HERE may share your Personal Data with other HERE companies or authorized third parties who process Personal Data for HERE for the purposes described in this Policy or otherwise provide recruitment related services to HERE.
In such cases HERE will ensure that there is a genuine need to transfer your Personal Data and that measures are in place to safeguard the processing of your Personal Data through other HERE companies or authorized third parties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Authorized third parties include, for example, recruitment agencies, professional advisors, external legal counsel, consumer credit reporting agencies, recruiting systems providers, providers of assessments and other third party suppliers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Authorized third parties may technically have access to your Personal Data in the course of providing their services but will be contractually restricted (or subject to a professional or statutory duty of confidentiality) from processing your Personal Data for other purposes.
HERE also requires them to act consistently with this Policy and to use appropriate security measures to protect your Personal Data.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
International transfers of Personal Data: HERE is a global company that has affiliates, business processes, management structures and technical systems that cross national borders.
This means that your Personal Data may be transferred across international borders to countries other than the one where you are applying to as an applicant.
Such other countries do not always have equivalent laws providing specific protection for or rights in relation to Personal Data or they have different rules on privacy and data protection.
HERE takes steps to ensure that there is a legal basis for such a transfer and that adequate protection for your Personal Data is provided as required by applicable law.
Such steps include, for example, the use of standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission or relevant authorities and the requirement to use appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your Personal Data.
You may contact the HERE Privacy Office at privacy@HERE.com to obtain additional information about the safeguards taken by HERE in connection with these transfers.
A copy of the unchangeable Standard Contractual Clauses can be accessed on the webpage of the European Commission.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
Mandatory disclosures: HERE may be required by or under mandatory law to disclose your Personal Data to certain authorities or other third parties, for example, to government agencies responsible for the employment activities, statistical information or to the police or other law enforcement agencies, for example in context of conducting a background check.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
Mergers and acquisitions: Where HERE takes steps to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize its businesses in certain countries, this may involve disclosing Personal Data to prospective or actual purchasers and their advisers.
In such circumstances, HERE will take all reasonable steps to ensure that appropriate measures to protect Personal Data are taken by such prospective or actual purchasers and their advisors.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
Other: HERE may disclose your personal data if it is necessary to protect your vital interests.
HERE may also disclose and otherwise process your Personal Data in accordance with applicable law to defend HERE’s legitimate interests, for example, in legal proceedings.</p>
<p>7.
What steps are taken to safeguard Personal Data?</p>
<p>Privacy and security are key considerations for HERE.
We have assigned specific responsibilities to address privacy and security related matters.
We enforce our internal policies and guidelines through an appropriate selection of activities, including proactive and reactive risk management, security and privacy engineering, training and assessments.
We take appropriate steps to address online security, physical security, risk of data loss and other such risks taking into consideration the risk represented by the processing and the nature of the data being protected.
Also, we limit access to our data bases containing Personal Data to authorized persons having a justified need to access such information.</p>
<p>8.
Data quality</p>
<p>We take reasonable steps to keep the Personal Data we possess accurate and to delete incorrect or unnecessary Personal Data.
We encourage you to access your Personal Data through your account from time to time to ensure that it is up to date.
To the extent permitted or required by applicable local law or subject to your consent, we may use public sources in order to verify that Personal Data we hold is correct.</p>
