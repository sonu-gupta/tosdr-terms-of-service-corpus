Our Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms
<p>We and our third party service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information about your use of our Site or Services.
We may combine this information with other personal information we collect from you (and our third party service providers may do so on our behalf).</p>
<p>Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests.
You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies).
you also may opt-out of targeted advertising by following the instructions in the Third Party Ad Network section.</p>
<p>
<strong>Cookies.</strong> Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes.
Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Site and Services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at our Site and Service.
The ability to select or download information on our Site is not cookie-driven.
There are two types of cookies: session and persistent cookies.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Session Cookies.</strong> Session cookies exist only during an online session.
They disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer.
We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged into the Site.
This allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our Site.</li>
<li>
<strong>Persistent Cookies.</strong> Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer.
We use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity, and to display advertising both on our Site and on third-party sites.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Disabling Cookies.</strong> Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future.
The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.
Visitors to our Site who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the Site, but some features may not function.</p>
<p>
<strong>Local Storage Objects.</strong> We may use Flash Local Storage Objects (“Flash LSOs”) to store your Site preferences and to personalize your visit.
Flash LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored.
Typically, you cannot control, delete, or disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs through your web browser.
For more information on Flash LSOs, or to learn how to manage your settings for Flash LSOs, go to the Adobe Flash Player Help Page, choose “Global Storage Settings Panel” and follow the instructions.
To see the Flash LSOs currently on your computer, choose “Website Storage Settings Panel” and follow the instructions to review and, if you choose, to delete any specific Flash LSO.</p>
<p>
<strong>Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies.</strong> Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages.
We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a.
web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Site to, among other things, track the activities of Site visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Site usage.
We and our third party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to our customers, to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded.</p>
<p>
<strong>Third Party Analytics.</strong> We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of our Site and, to the extent permitted, our Application.
We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our Services.
We use these tools to help us improve our Services, performance and user experiences.
These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services.
We do not share your personal information with these third parties.
To opt out of the collection of this demographic information from Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting, you can use the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.</p>
