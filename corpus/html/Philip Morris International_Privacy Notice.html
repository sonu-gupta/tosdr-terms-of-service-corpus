Where might information about you be sent? <p>As with any multinational organisation, PMI affiliates transfer information globally.
Accordingly, information about you may be transferred globally (for example, if you are in&nbsp.

In all such cases, the transfer will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>on the basis of a European Commission adequacy decision;</li>

<p>If you have signed up to receive e-mail alerts (and similar) or to use a PMI digital touchpoint, most of the information in your profile is kept for the duration of the period you continue to receive the alerts, use the digital touchpoint, or respond to our communications.
However, some elements of your profile, such as your history of use of the PMI digital touchpoint, naturally go out of date after a period of time, so we delete them automatically after defined periods as appropriate for the purpose for which we collected them.</p>
