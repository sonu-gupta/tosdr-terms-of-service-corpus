A username is technically required so you can log in from multiple computers and devices.

A hash of your password is stored in the Readwise database, and the plain-text password is only used for hash comparison to the stored value.

For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider, your IP address, and information provided by and about your Internet browser.
As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather similar information through other means.</p>
<p>We may also use "cookie" technology.

Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.</p>

For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>We may tell an advertiser or publisher that&nbsp;X&nbsp;number of people visited a certain area on our website.</li>

<li>We may anonymously use the titles of the books you’ve read and highlighted to recommend other books that you may enjoy.</li>
</ul>
<p>When information is used in this or a similar manner, we do not disclose anything that could be used to identify the individuals on whom the information is based.</p>
<p>We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or to defend against legal claims.</p>
<p>We may disclose your information when we believe it necessary or desirable in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our policies, and/or to protect our rights and property.</p>
<p>In the future, we may sell, buy, merge, or partner with other companies or businesses.
In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.</p> Publicly Accessible Information <p>In the future, Readwise may contain social and sharing functionality, including:</p>
