<p>XV.
Miscellaneous.</p>
<p>These Terms may not be modified by you except by a writing executed by the duly-authorized representatives of City Hive.
These Terms will inure to the benefit of and will be binding upon each party’s successors and assigns.
These Terms and the rights granted under these Terms may be assigned by City Hive but may not be assigned by you without the prior express written consent of City Hive.
If any provision of these Terms is or becomes, at any time or for any reason, unenforceable or invalid, no other provision of these Terms will be affected and the remaining provisions will continue to be enforceable and valid according to the terms of such provisions.
It is expressly understood that in the event either party fails to perform any term of these Terms and the other party does not enforce that term, the failure to enforce not constitute a waiver of any term.
Nothing contained in these Terms will be deemed to constitute either party as the agent or representative of the other party or both parties as joint venturers or partners for any purpose.
No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between City Hive and you or any third party as a result of these Terms or your use of the Services.
&nbsp;In the event that either party is prevented from performing, or is unable to perform, any of its obligations under these Terms due to any cause beyond the reasonable control of the party invoking this provision, the affected party’s performance will be extended for the period of delay or inability to perform due to such occurrence.
You and City Hive agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to the interpretation or construction of these Terms.
The headings and captions contained in these Terms will not be considered to be part of these Terms but are for convenience only.</p>
<p>
<b>XVI.&nbsp;</b>Injunctive Relief</p>
<p>You agree that a breach of these Terms will cause irreparable injury to City Hive for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and City Hive shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, in addition to any remedies it may have hereunder or at law, without having to post a bond or other security or prove damages.</p>
<p>
<b>XVII.&nbsp;</b>Dispute Resolution</p>
<p>Arbitration, No Class Actions.
ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICES WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION, RATHER THAN IN COURT, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify.
The Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) and federal arbitration law apply to these Terms.
&nbsp;If you do not want to arbitrate disputes with City Hive and you are an individual, you may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending an email to info@CityHive.net within 30 days of the day you first access or use the Services.</p>
<p>THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.
HOWEVER, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT (INCLUDING INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF OR STATUTORY DAMAGES), AND MUST FOLLOW THESE TERMS AS A COURT WOULD.</p>
<p>If you intend to seek arbitration you must first send written notice to City Hive’s Customer Service Center of your intent to arbitrate (“Notice”).
The Notice to City Hive should be sent by any of the following means: (i) electronic mail to info@CityhHive.net or (ii) U.S.
Postal Service certified mail to City Hive, Inc., Attn: Customer Service Center, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich, #2968, New York, NY, 10007.
The Notice must: (x) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.
(y) set forth the specific relief sought.
and (z) set forth your name, address and contact information.
If we intend to seek arbitration against you, we will send any notice of dispute to you at the contact information we have for you.
&nbsp;If we do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or City Hive may commence an arbitration proceeding.</p>
<p>The arbitration will be conducted before a neutral single arbitrator, whose decision will be final and binding, and the arbitral proceedings will be governed by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules, Consumer Due Process Protocol, and Supplementary Procedures for Resolution of Consumer Related Disputes, as modified by these Terms.
The AAA’s rules are available at&nbsp;ADR.org&nbsp;or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this arbitration clause, but the arbitrator is bound by these Terms.
If you initiate arbitration, your arbitration fees will be limited to the filing fee set forth in the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules.
We will reimburse all other AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees paid by you for claims totaling less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator determines that the arbitration was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, in which case the payment of all such fees shall be governed by the AAA Rules.
In such case, you agree to reimburse City Hive for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.
City Hive will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claim or the relief sought is improper or not warranted.
The arbitration shall be conducted, at the option of the party seeking relief, by telephone, online, based solely on written submissions or in person in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or at a mutually agreed location.
&nbsp;The arbitration will be conducted in the English language.
Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
&nbsp;No claim or action arising from or concerning the Services or otherwise hereunder may be brought later than one (1) year from the date the claim or cause of action arose.
&nbsp;The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or formation of this arbitration agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this arbitration agreement is void or voidable.</p>
<p>WE EACH AGREE THAT TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.
Further, you agree that the arbitrator may not consolidate proceedings or more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding, and that if this specific proviso is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration clause shall be null and void.
If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.
&nbsp;If a court of competent jurisdiction finds the foregoing arbitration provisions invalid or inapplicable, you and we each agree to the exclusive jurisdiction and the exercise of personal jurisdiction of the state or federal court located in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for the purpose of litigating all claims or disputes, and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum.
We also both agree that City Hive may bring suit in court for injunctive relief to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.</p>
