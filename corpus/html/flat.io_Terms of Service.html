This means that we are unable to promise that your use of the Service will be uninterrupted, without delays, error-free or meet your expectations and we do not give any commitment relating to the performance or availability of the Service in these Terms of Service and, to the extent we are able to do so, we exclude any commitments that may be implied by law.</p>

Changes to the Service <p>

Improvements and updates are also made to reflect changing technologies, tastes, behaviours and the way people use the Internet and our Service.</p>
<p>
<strong>18.2.</strong> In order to do this, we may need to update, reset, stop offering and/or supporting a particular part of the Service, or feature relating to the Service (“changes to the Service”).
These changes to the Service may affect your past activities on the Service, features that you use and your User Content (“Service elements”).
Any changes to the Service could involve your Service elements being deleted or reset.</p>
<p>
<strong>18.3.</strong> You agree that a key characteristic of our Service is that changes to the Service will take place over time and this is an important basis on which we grant you access to the Service.
Once we have made changes to the Service, your continued use of the Service will show that you have accepted any changes to the Service.
You are always free to stop using the Service or deactivate your Account in the settings feature of the Service.</p>
<p>

<strong>19.1.</strong> We may revise these Terms of Service from time to time but the most current version will always be at support@flat.io.</p>

<p>
<strong>19.3.</strong> We will try, where possible and reasonable, to contact you to let you know about any significant changes to any of the documents referred to in these Terms of Service.
We may contact you through the Service (for example by asking you to accept the changes before you continue to use the Service) or via a separate email.</p>
<p>
<strong>19.4.</strong> Normally, we will try to give you some warning before the new terms become effective.
However, sometimes changes will need to be made immediately and if this happens we will not give you any notice</p> 20.
Documents that apply to our relationship with you <p>
<strong>20.1.</strong> The current version of the Terms of Service contains the only terms and conditions that apply to our relationship with you.
Older versions of the Terms of Service will no longer apply to our relationship and will be completely replaced by the current version.</p>
<p>
<strong>20.2.</strong> We intend to rely on these Terms of Service as setting out the written terms of our agreement with you for the provision of the Service.
If part of the Terms of Service cannot be enforced then the remainder of the Terms of Service will still apply to our relationship.</p>
<p>
<strong>20.3.</strong> If you do not comply with these Terms of Service and we do not take action immediately, this does not mean we have given up any right we have and we may still take action in the future.</p> 21.
Law <p>
<strong>21.1.</strong> As we are based in England, English law will apply to all disputes and the interpretation of these Terms of Service.
