</ul> Terms of Service <p>These Terms of Service (“TOS”) are a contract between you, or the entity on whose behalf you are executing this agreement (“you” or “your”), and VERO SERVERS (“VEROSERVERS.COM”, “we”, “us”, or “our”).
By using our Services, you agree to abide by these TOS and our Privacy Policy.
These TOS may be modified at any time and, by continuing to use our Services, you agree to be bound by the modifications.
The most recent version of these TOS can always be found here.</p>
<p>While we facilitate your business on the Internet, we are an independent contractor.
We only have control of the products and services we provide directly, and are not liable for your actions, the actions of 3<sup>rd</sup> (third) party service providers, or the actions of individuals who use your products and services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SERVICES</p>
<p>VEROSERVERS.COM provides a number of services and products to its customers, which are collectively referred to in these TOS as the “Services”.
&nbsp;Regardless of whether you pay for a Service or it is provided as part of a package or for free, any Service you request or allow to be provided by VEROSERVERS.COM is included as part of the “Services” we refer to in these TOS and our Privacy Policy.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Services may also be provided by 3<sup>rd</sup> parties and their terms of service or use that may contain additional or different terms will also apply to your use of their services.
We shall not be responsible for any changes in the Services that cause any 3<sup>rd </sup>party products to become obsolete, require modification or alteration, or otherwise affect the performance of the Services.
Any malfunction or manufacturer's defects of 3<sup>rd</sup> party products or services, either sold, licensed or provided by VEROSERVERS.COM to you will not be deemed a breach of our obligations under this TOS.</p>
<p>We may change the specifications or details of the Services (including pricing) at any time, but we have no obligation to change the Services.
&nbsp;Additionally, the 3<sup>rd </sup>parties we contract with to provide Services may change their offering between the time of purchase and the date the Services are delivered.
&nbsp;We will use commercially reasonable efforts to inform you of changes to the Services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ACCOUNT ELIGIBILITY</p>
<p>By registering for or using the Services, you represent and warrant, that you are 18 (eighteen) years of age or older.
The Services are intended solely for users who are 18 years of age or older.
Any registration, use of or access to the Services, by anyone under 18 is unauthorized and is a violation of this Agreement.</p>
<p>If you use the Services on behalf of another party you agree that you are authorized to bind such other party to this Agreement and to act on such other party's behalf with respect to any actions you take in connection with the Services.</p>
<p>It is your responsibility to provide accurate, current, and complete information on the registration forms, including an email address that is different from the domain you are signing up under.
If there is ever an abuse issue or we need to contact you, we will use the primary email address we have on file.
It is your responsibility to ensure that the contact information for your account, including any domain accounts is accurate, correct and complete at all times.
VEROSERVERS.COM is not responsible for any lapse in the Services, including without limitation, any lapsed domain registrations due to outdated contact information being associated with the domain.</p>
<p>You agree to be fully responsible for all use of your account and for any actions that take place through your account.

You agree to pay for the Services in advance of the time period during which such Services are provided.
Subject to applicable laws, rules, and regulations, payments received will be first applied to the oldest outstanding invoice in your billing account.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise provided, you agree that until and unless you notify VEROSERVERS.COM of your desire to cancel the Services, you will be billed on an automatically (if such payment method is supported by the selected payment gateway) recurring basis to prevent any disruption to your Services, using your credit card or other billing information on file with us.</p>
<p>Prices and/or fees for the Services do not include any applicable taxes imposed by any taxing authority (e.g.
value - added tax).
Any applicable taxes will be added to VEROSERVERS.COM’s invoice as a separate charge to be paid by you.</p>
<p>All invoices must be paid within 7 (seven) days of the invoice due date.
Any invoice that is outstanding for more than 7 (seven) days may result in the suspension or termination of Services.
Access to the account will not be restored until payment has been received.
If you fail to pay the fees as specified herein, we may suspend or terminate your account and pursue the collection costs incurred by VEROSERVERS.COM.</p>
<p>Any account suspended for non - payment is subject to a reactivation fee.</p>
