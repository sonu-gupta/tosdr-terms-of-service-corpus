<strong>Website usage information we collect.</strong> In addition to Personal Information that you choose to submit to us, whenever you visit or interact with our Sites, we may collect or store information about your interaction with our Sites (“<strong>Usage Information</strong>”).
This Usage Information may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>your IP address or any other unique identifier assigned to the device that you use to access our Sites;</li>
<li>the functionality and characteristics of your device, including type of browser, operating system and hardware, mobile network information, and in some cases location information;</li>
<li>the URL that referred you to our Sites, if any;</li>

and</li>
<li>the time of day that you visited our Sites and how long your visit lasted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usage Information is typically anonymous information.
however, if it is combined with your Personal Information in a manner that reasonably allows it to be associated with your identity, or is otherwise considered Personal Information under applicable law, it will be treated as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy, and, if you are an EU resident, it may be considered Personal Data and be subject to the section applicable to EU users below.</p>
<p>We use certain common methods and technologies to collect and store Usage Information about your interaction with our Sites (“<strong>Analytic Technologies</strong>”).
These Analytic Technologies may be downloaded to the personal computer, laptop, tablet, mobile phone, or similar device that you use to access the Sites (“<strong>Your Device</strong>”).
The specific Analytic Technologies that we use are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Cookies.</strong> A cookie is a data file placed on Your Device when you visit our Sites.
We use cookies only to facilitate the use and navigation of our Sites and to remember you and your preferences in case you revisit our Sites in the future and to conduct range measurement.
Information collected relates to technical information (e.g.
your browser, a timestamp, and a unique identifier).
Almost all browsers allow blocking of cookies in their entirety, removal of existing cookies, or warning to prevent the placing of a cookie.
You can find more information on this functionality in the documentation or in the help file of your browser.
Please note that blocking of cookies might impede your use of our Sites.
For more information, please see our Cookie Policy cybersecurity.att.com/legal/cookie-policy.
If you are a resident of the EU or other jurisdiction that requires us to obtain your consent to use cookies on our Sites, then you will have an opportunity to manage your cookie preferences on such Sites.
except that certain cookies are essential to enable core site functionality, and you cannot choose to disable those cookies.</li>
<li>
<strong>Do Not Track Policy.
</strong> Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites.
Our Sites do not support Do Not Track requests at this time.</li>
<li>
<strong>Analytics.</strong> We use analytics applications, including “<strong>Google Analytics</strong>”, to collect information about use of the Sites.
Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit a website, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other websites they visited prior to coming to a website.
We use the information obtained from these applications only to improve our Sites and our product and service offerings.
The information generated about your use of our Sites will be transferred and saved to the vendor’s server in the United States.
For Google Analytics, within Member States of the European Union or other signatories of the Agreement on the European Economic Area, Google will first shorten your IP address.
In exceptional cases, the full IP address will be transferred to a Google server in the United States to be shortened there.
Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Sites is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.
You can opt-out of Google Analytics tracking by visiting https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/.</li>
<li>
<strong>Web Beacons.</strong> A web beacon, including tracking pixels, is a small graphic image or other web programming code, also known as “1×1 GIF” or “clear GIF.” We may download web beacons to Your Device when you access our Sites or through email messages that we send to you.
Web beacons are used to improve your experience on our Sites.
Web beacons also help us to understand whether users read email messages and click on the links contained within those messages so that we can deliver relevant content and messages.
Our web beacons may collect certain of your contact information (e.g., the email address associated with an email message that contains a web beacon).</li>
<li>
<strong>Embedded Scripts.</strong> An embedded script is a programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with our Sites, such as which links within our Sites you click on, which type of browser or device you use (e.g.
mobile or desktop version).
We use such information to enhance the user experience.
This code is downloaded onto Your Device when you access our Sites and is deactivated or deleted when you leave our Sites.
Identification of the user does not take place.</li>
</ul>

Thus, your Personal Information associated with our Sites may be transferred to and/or processed in a country other than that from which it was collected.
The data protection laws in those countries may differ from those of the country in which you are located.
The servers may be operated by third party hosted service providers.</p>
<p>
<strong>Links to Other Websites and Applications.</strong> The Sites may contain various links to, as well as plug-ins or widgets from, social media and other third-party websites or applications, which may provide additional information, goods, services, and/or promotions.
These third-party websites or applications are owned and operated independently of AlienVault, and may have their own separate privacy and data collection practices.

If you choose to voluntarily post User Submissions to a Community Forum, be aware that such information is viewable by anyone else on that Community Forum.
Think carefully before you post and use caution before disclosing any Personal Information in a Community Forum.
We are not responsible for the accuracy, use, or misuse of any User Submission that you disclose or receive through a Community Forum.
We might also delete User Submissions without further notice if they include harmful or inappropriate content (e.g., pornographic material, content encouraging vandalism, crime, terrorism, racism, violence, or cruelty), or infringe any third party’s rights or applicable law.</p>
<p>
<strong>Promotions.</strong> We may offer various promotions (“<strong>Promotions</strong>”) through the Sites or elsewhere that may require registration with your Personal Information.
If you choose to enter or otherwise participate in a Promotion, your Personal Information may be disclosed to third parties in connection with administration of the Promotion, such as in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as otherwise required by law.

(2) protect and/or defend this Privacy Policy or other policies or terms of use applicable to our Sites, including investigations of potential violations thereof.
(3) protect the safety, rights, property, or security of AlienVault or any third party.

<p>In accordance with our routine record keeping and applicable law, we may delete certain records that contain your Personal Information.
We are under no obligation to store such information indefinitely, and we disclaim any liability arising out of, or related to, the destruction of that information.
In addition, you should be aware that it is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our databases without some residual data because of backups and other reasons.
Also, if you have posted any User Submissions to a Community Forum, these communications cannot generally be removed.</p>
<p>Under California Civil Code Sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to contact us to prevent disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes.
in order to submit such a request, please contact us at privacy@alienvault.com.</p> INFORMATION SECURITY <p>We will take reasonable precautions to protect your Personal Information in our possession from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction.
