AEBC may terminate or suspend service at any time at its sole discretion, for non-payment of account charges.
In the case of termination for non-payment, the Customer is fully liable to AEBC for all charges accrued before termination, including, without limitation, interest charges and costs incurred by AEBC for collection costs and attorney’s fees.

<p>
<strong>Billing Disputes:</strong> The Customer must notify AEBC in writing of any disputed charges within thirty (30) days of the date of the billing for such charges.
In the absence of such dispute, charges billed are deemed correct and dispute waived.
In the event that the Customer, in good faith, determines that there is a material discrepancy between AEBC’s invoiced charges and Customer’s calculation of charges owed, Customer shall be permitted to withhold payment of such disputed charges, provided that Customer pays all undisputed charges on or before due date and presents in good faith and in reasonable detail the billing discrepancy in question for the purpose of resolving the disputed charges.
In the event parties fail to mutually resolve the disputed charges within a reasonable time period which will generally be within thirty (30) days of the next billing cycle, the parties shall resolve such dispute by arbitration conducted by a single arbitrator appointed by agreement.
AEBC reserves the right to put the disputed services on hold to avoid incurring additional costs.
