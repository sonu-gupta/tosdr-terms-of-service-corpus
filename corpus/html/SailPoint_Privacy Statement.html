<li>to our&nbsp;group companies, Affiliates, third party services providers and partners&nbsp;who provide data processing services to us (for example, to support the delivery of, provide functionality on, or help to enhance the security of our Website, Applications, Third Party Services or Services), or who otherwise process Personal Information for purposes that are described in this Privacy Statement or otherwise notified to you when we collect your Personal Information;</li>

<li>to any&nbsp;competent law enforcement body, regulatory, government agency, court or other third party&nbsp;where we believe disclosure is necessary (i) as a matter of applicable law or regulation, (ii) to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights and property, or (iii) to protect your rights, property or safety or those of any other person;</li>
<li>to an actual or&nbsp;potential buyer&nbsp;(and its agents and advisers) in connection with any actual or proposed purchase, merger or acquisition of assets or any part of our business.
and</li>
<li>to any&nbsp;other person with your consent&nbsp;to the disclosure.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>Finally, we also share aggregated, anonymized or statistical information about you (and your use of our Websites, Services and Applications) with others for a variety of purposes, including to improve our products and services.&nbsp.
Such information is not Personal Information and is not subject to the restrictions set forth in this Privacy Statement.</p>
<p>
<em>International data transfers</em>
</p>
<p>Your Personal Information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident.
These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective).</p>
<p>Specifically, our Website and Application servers are located in the United States, and our third party service providers and partners operate around the world.
This means that when we collect your Personal Information we may process it in any of these countries.</p>
<p>However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your Personal Information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Statement.</p>
<p>
<em>Privacy Shield</em>
</p>
<p>Where Personal Information originates from the European Economic Area or Switzerland and is transferred to the United States, SailPoint agrees to comply with the EU-U.S.
and Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield Frameworks, respectively.
SailPoint makes an affirmative commitment to adhere to EU-U.S.
and Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield Principles (the “Privacy Shield Principles”).
The U.S.
subsidiaries of SailPoint Technologies, Inc., as listed here, also adhere to the EU-U.S.
and Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield Principles.
With respect to such Personal Information, to the extent of any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Statement and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles govern.
More information on the EU-U.S.
and Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield programs can be found at&nbsp;https://www.privacyshield.gov.</p>
<p>In the context of an onward transfer, SailPoint has responsibility for processing Personal Information it receives under Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf.
Where required by Privacy Shield, we enter into written agreements with those third-party agents and service providers requiring them to provide the same level of protection Privacy Shield requires and limiting their use of the data to the specified services provided on our behalf.
We take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that third-party agents and service providers process EEA and Swiss Personal Information in accordance with our Privacy Shield obligations and to stop and remediate any unauthorized processing.
Under certain circumstances, we may remain liable for the acts of our third party agents or service providers who perform services on our behalf for their handling of EEA or Swiss Personal Data that we transfer to them.</p>
<p>On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) issued a judgment which made the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework no longer a valid mechanism to comply with EU data protection requirements when transferring personal data from the European Union to the United States.
Following the CJEU’s decision, the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner also concluded that the Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield no longer provides a valid mechanism for the transfer of personal data from Switzerland to the United States.
However, SailPoint continues to honor its commitments under the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework, along with reliance on alternative mechanisms to legitimize international personal data transfers from the European Union or Switzerland to the United States, such as by implementing standard contractual clauses.</p> Legal basis for processing Personal Information (EEA and Swiss visitors only)
<p>If you are a User or Visitor from the European Economic Area or Switzerland, our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Information described above will depend on the Personal Information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.</p>
<p>However, we will normally collect Personal Information from you only (i) where we need the Personal Information to perform a contract with you, (ii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests (e.g., responding to your requests and enquiries via our SailBot tool) and not overridden by your rights, or (iii) where we have your consent to do so.</p>
<p>If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your Personal Information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “Contact Information” heading below [Contact Information].</p> Security
<p>Wherever your Personal Information may be held within SailPoint or on its behalf, SailPoint takes reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the Personal Information that you share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure.
SailPoint trains its employees on data handling practices.
In addition, SailPoint and its business partners enter into confidentiality agreements which require that care and precautions be taken to prevent loss, misuse, or disclosure of your Personal Information.</p>
<p>However, while we attempt to ensure the integrity and security of Personal Information, please note that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.
Therefore, although SailPoint complies with its legal obligations in respect of the security of your personal data we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p> Data retention
<p>We retain Personal Information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).</p>
<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your Personal Information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your Personal Information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p> Your data protection rights and choices

know about, or delete Personal Information we have collected in our capacity as
a service provider, we will inform the requestor that we will not be responding
because we are a service provider, and recommend you place your request
directly to the business.&nbsp.
