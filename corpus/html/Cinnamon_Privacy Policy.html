<p>You have the right to receive a subset of the personal information you provide us if we process it on the legal bases of our contract with you or with your consent in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and a right to request that we transfer such personal information to another party.
If you wish for us to transfer the personal information to another party, please ensure you detail that party and note that we can only do so where it is technically feasible.
We are not responsible for the security of the personal information or its processing once received by the third party.</p>
<p>Correction</p>
<br>
<p>You have the right to require us to correct any personal information held about you that is inaccurate and have incomplete data completed.
Where you request correction, please explain in detail why you believe the personal information we hold about you to be inaccurate or incomplete so that we can assess whether a correction is required.
Please note that while we assess whether the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate or incomplete, you may exercise your right to restrict our processing of the applicable data as described below.</p>

<p>You have a right to require us to stop processing the personal information we hold about you other than for storage purposes in the following circumstances:</p>

or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You have objected to us processing personal information we hold about you on the basis of our legitimate interest and you wish us to stop processing the personal information while we determine whether there is an overriding interest in us retaining such personal information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Objection</p>
<br>
<p>You have the right to object to our processing of data about you and we will consider your request.
Please provide us with detail as to your reasoning so that we can assess whether there is a compelling overriding interest in us continuing to process such data or we need to process it in relation to legal claims.</p>
<p>You also have the right, at any time, to object to our processing of data about you in order to send you marketing, including where we build profiles for such purposes and we will stop processing the data for that purpose.</p>
