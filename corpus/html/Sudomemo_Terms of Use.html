</strong>
</p>
<p>1.
Flipnotes and other content posted to Sudomemo may be used by Team Sudomemo at any time for purposes such as promotions or demonstrations.</p>

Users also acknowledge that Flipnotes and other content uploaded to the Sudomemo service may be revised or changed by other users (as ‘spin offs’) and be published (in whole or in part and including any modifications thereof) either on Sudomemo or elsewhere freely.</p>
<p>3.
By uploading a Flipnote or other content, a user understands that they must own – or obtain – all rights and permissions necessary to post that Flipnote or other content.

Each user is solely responsible for:<br>
(i) Interactions and exchanges of information with other users from their username.<br>

Therefore, users have the responsibility to make sure that other persons connecting to and using Sudomemo with their system/username are aware of the rules.</p>

It is therefore the responsibility of each user to ensure that the Flipnotes and other content that they post is lawful and does not infringe on any third party’s rights.</p>
