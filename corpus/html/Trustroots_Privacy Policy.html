(PDF).</p> Email <p>We route all our site operation emails, such as those you receive when you get a message on Trustroots, using Mandrill.
Read their privacy policy.
 If you subscribe to our newsletters, your email will be stored at&nbsp;MailChimp&nbsp;who we use them to send newsletters, read their privacy policy.</p>
<p>MailChimp and Mandrill are the same company.
The key bit of their privacy policy, in relation to your data, is that they state that they don’t, under any circumstances, sell [Trustroots] lists (of your email addresses), market to people on [Trustroots] lists, or share [Trustroots] lists with any other party (unless it’s required by law).</p> Social networks <p>Some of the features at the site use other social networks such as Twitter, Facebook, GitHub or Gravatar.
You don’t have to connect your profile to these social networks and we don’t share any data you provide to us with them.
If you choose to connect with social networks we take information from those social networks and then display it on your Trustroots profile.
Some of the data from these sites is then stored at our server in order to facilitate this.&nbsp;  Some of our users want to use these networks and they have a right to do so.
Others prefer to steer away from these networks and we’ll also accommodate these users.</p> 5) Checking, amending or deleting your data <p>You are able to download your profile data to check for inaccuracies or information you may not want us to have.  If you want to amend data on your profile you can do so using ordinary site functions.
If you want you profile to be removed entirely you can contact us and we will erase all the data.</p> Edit this page on GitHub This documentation is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License .
