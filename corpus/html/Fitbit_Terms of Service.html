DISPUTE RESOLUTION
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH US AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You agree that any dispute between you and Fitbit arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service, the Fitbit Service, or any other Fitbit products or services (collectively, “Disputes”) will be governed by the arbitration procedure outlined below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Governing Law: Except as otherwise required by applicable law, the Terms of Service and the resolution of any Disputes shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws principles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Informal Dispute Resolution: We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case.
Before filing a claim against Fitbit, you agree to try to resolve the Dispute informally by contacting&nbsp;<u>support@fitbit.com</u>.
We'll try to resolve the Dispute informally by contacting you through email.
If a dispute is not resolved within 15 days after submission, you or Fitbit may bring a formal proceeding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We Both Agree To Arbitrate: You and Fitbit agree to resolve any Disputes through final and binding arbitration, except as set forth under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Opt-out of Agreement to Arbitrate: You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by contacting&nbsp;<u>optout@fitbit.com</u>&nbsp;within 30 days of first accepting these Terms of Service and stating that you (include your first and last name) decline this arbitration agreement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Arbitration Procedures: The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes.
The arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or work, San Francisco, California, or any other location we agree to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Arbitration Fees: The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees.
Fitbit will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than $75,000.
Fitbit will not seek its attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate: Either you or Fitbit may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Francisco (CA) or any United States county where you live or work.
Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Fitbit products or Fitbit Service, or infringement of intellectual property rights (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No Class Actions: You may only resolve Disputes with Fitbit on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action.
Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed under our agreement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Judicial Forum for Disputes: Except as otherwise required by applicable law, in the event that the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you and Fitbit agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the federal or state courts of San Francisco County, California.
Both you and Fitbit consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there.
We both agree to waive our right to a jury trial.</p>
<p>Limitation on Claims: Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to your use of the Fitbit products or Fitbit Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose, or else that claim or cause of action will be barred forever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
24.
GENERAL TERMS
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Except as otherwise stated herein, these Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Fitbit and you regarding the Fitbit Service, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Fitbit and you regarding the Fitbit Service and Fitbit Content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt on the message will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Fitbit.
Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.</p>
