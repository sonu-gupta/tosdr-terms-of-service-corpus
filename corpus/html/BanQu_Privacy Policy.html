<p>Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies</p>
<p>BanQu—as well as certain third parties that provide functionality on the Services—uses a variety of technologies to learn more about how people use the Services and the Internet.
This section provides more information about some of those technologies and how they work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cookies.
Cookies are small text files that websites and other online services use to store information about users on the users’ own computers.
For example, cookies can be used to store your login credentials so that you do not have to enter them each time you return to a website.
Cookies also may be used to store a unique identification number tied to your computer so that a website can recognize you as the same user across different visits to the website.
You can configure your Internet browser to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse cookies completely.</li>
</ul>
<p>BanQu and the third parties that provide functionality on the Services may use cookies to relate the information automatically collected when you use the Services to information we obtain from you directly or from commercially available sources.</p>
<ul>
<li>Other local storage.
We, along with third-party partners, use other kinds of local storage, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as “Flash cookies”) and HTML5 local storage, in connection with the Services.
These technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your computer and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences.
These objects are stored in different parts of your computer from ordinary browser cookies, however.
Many Internet browsers allow you to disable HTML5 local storage or delete information contained in HTML5 local storage using browser controls.</li>
<li>Web beacons.
We, along with our third-party partners, may also use technologies called Web beacons that communicate information from your Internet browser to a web server.
Web beacons can be embedded in web pages, videos, or emails, and can allow a web server to read certain types of information from your browser, check whether you have viewed a particular web page or email message, and determine, among other things, the time and date on which you viewed the Web beacon, the IP address of your computer, and the URL of the web page from which the Web beacon was viewed.
We and our partners use Web beacons for a variety of purposes, including analyzing the use of the Services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes to this Privacy Policy</p>
<p>From time to time, we may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to the scope of the Services or for other reasons.
Therefore, it is important to check the effective date of the Privacy Policy posted here each time you use the Services.
If we make any material revisions to this Privacy Policy, we email you at the email address you have provided or will place a notice on our website.
By continuing to use the Services after we make changes, you indicate your consent to those changes, except as limited by applicable law.</p>
