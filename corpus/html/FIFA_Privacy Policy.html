Defending your data</p>
<p>Living Football is our commitment to the people who love the beautiful game – and that includes the way we process your personal data.
We’re proud that you trust us to look after your data and our team members work hard to keep all personal information safe and secure.
When it comes to data, we follow two main laws – the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Swiss Data Protection Act (DPA) – as well as other national data protection legislation in the places where we operate.

How we look after your data</p>

Data protection laws are complex, so all team members who deal with personal data get the right training to make sure they’re match fit when it comes to your information.

Keeping your data safe</p>
<p>
We’ve got all sorts of tactics to keep your data safe and we’re proud of the work our team members do to defend your data.
But we can never guarantee that your data is safe from accidental loss and/or unauthorised access, use, alteration or disclosure.
To help protect you from identity theft, we will never ask for your credit card information, account credentials or national identification/passport number by email or phone.
If you send sensitive information by unencrypted email, there’s always a risk that your data will be intercepted.
If you send us an unencrypted email, we’ll take it that you’re happy to accept that risk.
If you suspect someone unauthorised is trying to access your data, please get in touch with us at dataprotection@fifa.org.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>9.
Updating and deleting your data</p>
<p>
You can review, correct, update or change your data at any time.
If you ask us to delete your data, we’ll do so unless there’s a legal reason that means we have to keep it.
If that’s the case, we’ll let you know.
</p>
<p>10.
Children and data</p>
<p>
We don’t collect personal data from children under 16.
Under-16s should always ask a parent/guardian for permission to use our digital services.
We recommend that parents and guardians clear their browser cache of cookies to minimise the personal data collected.
If we find out we’ve collected data from a child without permission, we’ll delete it.
</p>
<p>11.
Where we process your data</p>
<p>
We process information in Switzerland, the European Economic Area (EEA) and other places, depending on the location of our business partners and third parties.
That means your data may be processed in places where the data protection laws aren’t as strict as in Switzerland and the EEA.
We’ll take all reasonable steps to make sure your information is as safe there as it would be under the DPA and GDPR.
</p>
<p>12.
Buying tickets</p>
<p>
There’s nothing like the thrill of a FIFA competition – and sometimes, the competition for tickets is almost as fierce as the action on the pitch! When applying for tickets, you agree that your data will be used, processed and stored by FIFA and our third parties.
We’ll use your data for things like ticket production, sales, allocation, customer care, safety, security and rights protection.
If you consent, we’ll also use your data to tell you about other FIFA products and events, as well as products and services from our third parties.
</p>
<p>13.

Have we scored an own goal with your data? Or do you want to request a VAR review to see what’s happened to your information? If you’d like to submit a query or make a complaint, contact us at dataprotection@fifa.org.
Our data protection referees may ask you to prove your identity before we can deal with your query/complaint.
