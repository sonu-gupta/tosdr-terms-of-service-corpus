</p>2.
THE DATA WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU AND HOW WE USE IT<p>We will only use your Personal Data when the law allows us to.
Most commonly, we will use your Personal Data under the following circumstances:</p>
<p>
<strong>Consent</strong>
</p>
<p>When you give us your consent, for example, to access your contacts on your phone or allow us to have access to your location.
You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.
To withdraw your consent just go to the Privacy Settings in our Android or iOS Mobile app or contact us at&nbsp;support@xapo.com</p>
<p>
<strong>Contract</strong>
</p>
<p>When we need to execute a contract you have entered into with us by accepting applicable terms and conditions or specific related terms relating to other services offered by us.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where we need to collect Personal Data under the terms of a contract we have with you, and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform our services under the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with any of our services).
In this case, we may have to cancel a service you have with us but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.</p>
<p>
<strong>Legal or regulatory obligation&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>When we need to collect Personal Data by law.
If you fail to provide that data when requested, we will not be able to perform our services under the contract with you (for example, to provide you with any of our products or services).
In this case, we will have to cancel a product or service you have with us and we will notify you at that time.</p>
<p>
<strong>Legitimate Interests</strong>
</p>
<p>Legitimate Interest means the broader stake that Xapo has in the processing or the benefit that we derive from the processing of your Personal Data.</p>
<p>Where we rely on legitimate interests, we make sure that we consider and balance any potential impact on you and your rights before we process your Personal Data for our legitimate interests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, we may also process certain special categories of data such as criminal convictions and biometric data where we are lawfully permitted to do so and only for limited purposes such as fraud or money laundering/terrorist financing prevention and detection.
Apart from this, we do not collect any of the following Special Categories of Personal Data about you that includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health and genetic data</p>
<p>We also collect, use and share&nbsp;Aggregated Data&nbsp;such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose.
Aggregated Data could be derived from your Personal Data but is not considered Personal Data in law as this data will&nbsp;not&nbsp;directly or indirectly reveal your identity.
For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific website or Mobile App feature.
However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your Personal Data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as Personal Data, which will be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>
<strong>Purposes and Legal Basis for which we will use your Personal Data</strong>
</p>
<p>We have set out in a table format, a description of all&nbsp;the ways we plan to use your Personal Data, and the legal basis we rely on to do so.
&nbsp;We have also identified what our legitimate interests are where appropriate.
Note that we may process your Personal Data for multiple legal reasons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>Marketing</strong>
</p>
<p>We are committed to providing you with choices regarding certain Personal Data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising.
We will get your consent before sending third party direct marketing communications to you via email or text message.
You have the right to withdraw consent to receive 3rd party marketing communications at any time by contacting us.</p>
<p>
<strong>Promotional Offers From Us</strong>
</p>
<p>We may use your identity, contact, technical, usage and profile data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you.
This is how we decide which services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).</p>
<p>You can expect to receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information or purchased services from us and you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.</p>
<p>
<strong>Change of purpose&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>We will only use your Personal Data for the purposes for which we collected it.
We will delete it after fulfilling the intended purpose or after expiration of the respective storage periods.</p>
<p>

</ul>
<p>Please be aware that by doing so, we will need to close your Xapo account and this action is not reversible and by requesting us to erase your data we are not able to provide Xapo services to you any longer.

&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, when interacting with the blockchain we may not be able to ensure that your Personal Data is deleted.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>

<p>You have a right to request to restrict processing of your Personal Data, such as where:</p>

<li>if you believe processing is unlawful, you may request, instead of requesting erasure, that we restrict the use of unlawfully processed Personal Data;</li>
<li>we no longer need to process your Personal Data but need to retain your information for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims or regulatory requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the type of processing you request to restrict, please be aware that by doing so, we may need to close your Xapo account and this action is not reversible and by requesting us to stop processing your data we are not able to provide Xapo services to you any longer.

<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Right to data portability</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;Where the legal basis for our processing is your consent, or the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party of, or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract, you have a right to receive the Personal Data you provided to us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right to object to direct marketing (‘opting out’)</p>
<p>You have a choice about whether or not you wish to receive information from us.</p>
<p>We will not contact you for marketing purposes unless you have an existing business relationship with us to offer you similar services, and we rely &nbsp;on our legitimate interests as the lawful basis for processing;</p>
<p>On each and every marketing communication, we will always provide an option for you to exercise your right to object to the processing of your Personal Data for marketing purposes (known as ‘opting-out’) by clicking on the ‘unsubscribe’ button on our marketing emails or choosing a similar opt-out option on any forms we use to collect your Personal Data.</p>
<p>Please note that any administrative or service-related communications (to offer our services, or notify you of an update to this Privacy Policy or applicable terms and conditions, etc.) will solely be directed at our clients or business partners, and such communications generally do not offer an option to unsubscribe, as they are necessary to provide the services requested.</p>
<p>Therefore, please be aware that your ability to opt-out from receiving marketing and promotional materials does not change our right to contact you regarding your use of our online services and Android or iOS Mobile apps or as part of a contractual relationship we may have with you.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Right to request access</strong>
</p>

</p>AML KYC Privacy Notice<p>We will process your identifying data and profile data within operations such as identification (Know your Customer, also known as KYC) and profiling (Customer Due Diligence, also known as CDD) for the purposes of the execution of our Anti Money Laundering (also known as AML) and Counter Terrorism Financing (also known as CTF) customer identification and verification process obligations.</p>
<p>When Xapo asks for CDD, what this refers to is proof of address and proof of identification.
This along with information gathered at the application stage paints a picture of any customer (KYC).
Without KYC, Xapo may unknowingly become involved with illicit activities and therefore subject to reputational, operational and legal risks, which can result in significant financial cost, or eventual winding up of the institution.
KYC is most closely associated with the fight against money-laundering.</p>
<p>Specific proof of address, proof of Identification, source of funds and/or AML-CTF questionnaires that aimed at to fulfil KYC and CDD obligations are compulsory to Xapo users and the failure to be replied might lead (in extreme cases) in the blocking of their accounts or the refusal of services.</p>
<p>In response to the scale and effect of money laundering, the European Union has passed Directives designed to combat money laundering and terrorism.
These Directives, together with national regulations as read below, form the cornerstone of our AML/CTF obligations, establish the legal basis for us to process this data and outline the offenses and penalties for failing to comply.</p>

<strong>&nbsp;Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Policies</strong>
</p>
<p>Our AML policy is designed to prevent money laundering by meeting the European standards on combating money laundering and terrorism financing, including the need to have adequate systems and controls in place to mitigate the risk of the firm being used to facilitate financial crime.
Our AML policy sets out the minimum standards which must be complied with and includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Appointing a Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO) who has a sufficient level of seniority and independence, and who has responsibility for oversight of compliance with the relevant legislation, regulations, rules and industry guidance;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establishing and maintaining a Risk-Based Approach (RBA) to the assessment and management of money laundering and terrorist financing risks faced by the firm.
The requirement to provide CDD related data throughout an RBA that will always take into account different factors such as the status of the client, the nature of the transactions, the financial product or the financial flows involved;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establishing and maintaining risk-based Customer Due Diligence (CDD), identification, verification and Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures, including enhanced due diligence for customers presenting a higher risk, such as Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establishing and maintaining risk-based systems and procedures for the monitoring of on-going customer activity;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establishing procedures for reporting suspicious activity internally and to the relevant law enforcement authorities as appropriate;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maintaining appropriate records for the minimum prescribed periods;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing training for and raising awareness among all relevant employees.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As a regulated financial institution, Xapo has specific requirements regarding AML systems and procedures.
This reflects senior management’s desire to prevent money laundering.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Sanctions Policy</strong>
</p>
<p>Xapo is prohibited from transacting with individuals, companies and countries that are on prescribed sanctions lists.
Xapo will therefore screen against United Nations, European Union, UK Treasury and US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions lists in all jurisdictions in which we operate.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Automated Decision Making</strong>
</p>
<p>We use semi-automated processes which includes, but is not limited to, screening Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) data you provide to us in order to assess whether or not we are legally able to allow you to use our services.</p>
<p>All automated screenings matches are manually reviewed by Xapo compliance analysts.
The analyst will review the triage cases to determine if they should be cleared or escalated to the MLRO.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Third Parties AML-KYC</strong>
</p>
<p>Where processing of personal data is carried out on behalf of Xapo by a third party provider, we conclude a separate contract with the processor with respect to this processing.
This contract ensures compliance with European data protection regulations and defines sufficient guarantees for the implementation of appropriate technical and organisational measures, which ensure the protection of your rights.</p>Categories of Providers<p>
