<p>&nbsp;</p> Information We Gather Automatically
<p>When you visit the Altria Corporate Websites, your browser automatically sends us certain information about your use of the Altria Corporate Websites, such as the Internet Protocol (IP) address and type of the device you're using, web browser characteristics, language preferences, referring/exit pages, clickstream data, and the dates and times of visits to the Altria Corporate Websites.
We collect this information through the use of cookies and web beacons to better understand how visitors use the Altria Corporate Websites and for other purposes described in this Privacy Statement.</p> Cookies and Web Beacons
<p>Cookies are small text files that websites often place on the computer hard drives of visitors to their sites.
A cookie contains a unique number, which is used to recognize your computer when a user of your computer returns to a website that was visited previously.
Web beacons (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags and clear GIFs) are Internet tools that help us determine, for example, whether a website page has been viewed.
We use cookies and web beacons to enhance the online experience of our visitors and to better understand how the Altria Corporate Websites are used.
Cookies and web beacons may tell us, for example, whether you have visited the Altria Corporate Website before or if you are a new visitor.
You can manage cookies through your web browser.
Most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable existing cookies.
You can find out how to do this for your particular browser by clicking "help" on your browser's menu or by visiting www.allaboutcookies.org.
The Altria Corporate Websites are not designed to respond to "do not track" requests from browsers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> Online Analytics Services, Tracking and Interest-Based Advertising
<p>We use third-party web analytics services on the Altria Corporate Websites, such as those of Google Analytics.
The analytics providers that administer these services use technologies such as cookies to help us analyze how visitors use the Altria Corporate Websites.
The information collected through these means (including IP address) is disclosed to these analytics providers to help us evaluate use of the Altria Corporate Websites and diagnose technical issues.
To learn about how Google Analytics collects and processes data and the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on, you can visit https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/181881?hl=en and https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites.</p>
<p>
When you visit the Altria Corporate Websites, we and certain third parties may obtain personal information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites and other online services.
On the Altria Corporate Websites, both we and our advertising partners may collect information about your online activities to provide you about Altria and its companies.
We will not provide you information that markets the companies' products to you.
You may see our ads on other websites or mobile apps because we participate in advertising networks.
Ad networks allow us to target our messaging to users considering demographic data, users' inferred interests and browsing context.
These networks track users' online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of browser cookies, device identifiers, and other similar technologies.
The networks use this information to show ads that may be tailored to individuals' interests, to track users' browsers or devices across multiple websites and apps, and to build a profile of users' online browsing and app usage activities.
The information our ad networks may collect includes data about users' visits to websites and apps that participate in the relevant ad networks, such as the pages or ads viewed and the actions taken on the websites or apps.
This data collection takes place both on the Altria Corporate Websites and on third-party websites and apps that participate in the ad networks.
This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.</p>
