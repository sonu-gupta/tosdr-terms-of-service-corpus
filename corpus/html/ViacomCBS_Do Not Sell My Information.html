Our Privacy Policy https://www.viacomcbsprivacy.com/policy describes the circumstances under which we share your information with third parties outside ViacomCBS and its affiliates (collectively “ViacomCBS”).</p>
<p>If you are a California resident and would like to opt out of the “sale” of your “personal information” to “third parties” associated to your registered account, your newsletter subscription or otherwise associated to the email address you may have provided to us please submit your request here https://www.viacomcbsprivacy.com/dns.</p>Opting Out of Interest-based Advertising<p>Our Privacy Policy also provides you with information regarding how to opt out of receiving interest-based advertising on desktop and mobile websites for:</p>

<p>In addition, the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Ad Choices tool offers a centralized place to opt out of the sale of personal information by any or all DAA participating companies that are collecting your personal information across multiple digital properties (including the ViacomCBS Services).
