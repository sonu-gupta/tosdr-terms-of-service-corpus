<strong>Collection and Use of Personal Information</strong>

<ul>
<li>
<u>Registration and Ordering</u> Before using certain parts of this Site or purchasing Mint Mobile products or services, you must complete an online registration form or provide certain information to Mint Mobile’s representatives.
During registration (whether via this Site or otherwise), you will be prompted to provide to Mint Mobile certain personal information, which may include, but is not limited to, your name, billing address(es), phone number, port-in phone number, email address, and credit card number.
This personal information is used for billing purposes, fulfilling your orders, and communicating with you about your order and this Site, and for marketing purposes.
If Mint Mobile encounters a problem when processing your order, it will use your personal information to contact you.</li>
<li>
<u>User Submissions</u> Certain areas of this Site may permit you to enter your email address and other contact information to receive further information about Mint Mobile or for other purposes.
Your submissions for these purposes are completely voluntary, so you have a choice whether to participate and disclose information to Mint Mobile.
Should you choose to submit information in response to these requests, Mint Mobile may collect and use your name, email address, geographic location and other information submitted on this Site to market Mint Mobile products and services and any other products and services offered by Mint Mobile.</li>
<li>
<u>Automatically Generated and Collected Information</u>&nbsp;In addition to information that you volunteer as described above, this Site utilizes technologies to collect information and track your user experience.
Mint Mobile will use this information to improve this Site and user experience.
In addition, this Site automatically recognizes the Internet URL from which you access this Site and may also log your Internet protocol (“IP”) address (which may indicate the location of your computer on the Internet), Internet service provider, and date/time stamp for system administration, order verification, marketing, and system troubleshooting purposes.
In addition, all wireless communication systems know when your phone is turned on and approximately where the device is physically located.</li>
<li>
<u>Information from Third Parties</u>&nbsp;We may obtain information about you and combine it with your account information.
For example, we may receive information from the retailer from whom you purchased a Mint Mobile product prior to your commencing service with us.</li>
<li>
<u>Location-Based Services</u>&nbsp;We use location information to route wireless communications and to provide 911 service, which allows emergency services to locate your general location.
We may disclose, without your consent, the approximate location of a wireless device to a governmental entity or law enforcement authority when we are served with lawful process or reasonably believe there is an emergency involving risk of death or serious physical harm.
Depending on your device, you may also be able to obtain a wide array of services based on the location of your device (for example, driving directions, enhanced 411 Directory Assistance or search results, etc.).
These data services, known as Location-Based Services (“LBS”) are made available by us and other entities, usually via applications.
These services use various location technologies and acquire location data from various sources.
These applications and services use various location technologies (including Global Positioning Satellite (“GPS”), Assisted GPS (“AGPS”), cell ID and enhanced cell ID technologies) to identify the approximate location of a device, which is then used in conjunction with the application to enhance the user’s experience (for example, to provide driving directions, to provide enhanced 411 Directory Assistance or search results, etc.).LBS may, or may not, involve any interaction with or dependency on our supplier’s network, and location-based services may or may not look to our network to obtain location data.
Where our network supplier allows third parties the capability of accessing data about your location that is derived from our supplier’s network, our network supplier requires those third parties to observe specific privacy and security protections consistent with this policy.
It is important that you understand the location capabilities and settings of your device, and that you carefully read and understand the terms under which these services are provided – whether by us or another entity.
You should carefully review the privacy policies and other terms of third parties with whom you have authorized the sharing of your location information, and you should consider the risks involved in disclosing your location information to other people.
Where we provide a location-based service, you will receive notice of the location features of the service and collection of location data is with your consent.
You will be provided options for managing when and how such information should be shared.
