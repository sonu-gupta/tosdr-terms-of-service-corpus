</p>
<p>3.
How do we protect your information?</p>
<p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information.
We offer the use of a secure server.
All supplied sensitive information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential.</p>
<p>4.
How do we ensure that our processing systems remain confidential, resilient, and available?</p>
<p>A.
SUMMARY</p>
<p>We implement a variety of measures to ensure that our processing systems remain confidential, resilient, and available.
Specifically, we have implemented processes to help ensure high availability, business continuity, and prompt disaster recovery.
We commit to maintaining strong physical and logical access controls, and conduct regular penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>B.
LEARN MORE</p>
<p>
<b>High Availability.</b> Every part of the Game utilizes properly-provisioned, redundant servers (e.g., multiple load balancers, web servers, replica databases) in case of failure.
We take servers out of operation as part of regular maintenance, without impacting availability.</p>
<p>
<b>Business Continuity.</b> We keep encrypted backups of data daily in multiple regions on Google Cloud Platform.
While never expected, in the case of production data loss (i.e., primary data stores loss), we will restore organizational data from these backups.</p>
<p>
<b>Disaster Recovery.</b> In the event of a region-wide outage, we will bring up a duplicate environment in a different Google Cloud Platform region.
Our operations team has extensive experience performing full region migrations.</p>
<p>
<b>Physical Access Controls.</b> CryptoKitties is hosted on Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform.
Google data centers feature a layered security model, including extensive safeguards such as custom-designed electronic access cards, alarms, vehicle access barriers, perimeter fencing, metal detectors, and biometrics.
According to the Google Security Whitepaper: “The data center floor features laser beam intrusion detection.
Data centers are monitored 24/7 by high-resolution interior and exterior cameras that can detect and track intruders.
Access logs, activity records, and camera footage are reviewed in case an incident occurs.
Data centers are also routinely patrolled by professional security guards who have undergone rigorous background checks and training.” AWS data centers feature a layered security model, including extensive safeguards such as custom-designed electronic access cards, alarms, vehicle access barriers, perimeter fencing, metal detectors, and biometrics.
According to the AWS Security Whitepaper: “AWS’s data centers are state of the art, utilizing innovative architectural and engineering approaches.
Amazon has many years of experience in designing, constructing, and operating large-scale data centers.
This experience has been applied to the AWS platform and infrastructure.
AWS data centers are housed in nondescript facilities.
Physical access is strictly controlled both at the perimeter and at building ingress points by professional security staff utilizing video surveillance, intrusion detection systems, and other electronic means.
Authorized staff must pass two-factor authentication a minimum of two times to access data center floors.
All visitors and contractors are required to present identification and are signed in and continually escorted by authorized staff.” Dapper employees do not have physical access to Google or AWS data centers, servers, network equipment, or storage.</p>
<p>
<b>Logical Access Controls.</b> Dapper is the assigned administrator of its infrastructure on Google Cloud Platform, and only designated authorized Dapper operations team members have access to configure the infrastructure on an as-needed basis behind a two-factor authenticated virtual private network.
Specific private keys are required for individual servers, and keys are stored in a secure and encrypted location.
</p>
<p>
<b>Penetration Testing.</b> We engage an independent, third-party agency to perform black box penetration testing on an annual basis.
Information about security vulnerabilities that are successfully exploited through penetration testing is then used to set mitigation and remediation priorities.</p>
<p>
<b>Intrusion Detection and Prevention.</b> Unusual network patterns or suspicious behavior are among Dapper’s biggest concerns for infrastructure hosting and management.
Google Cloud Platform’s intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) rely on both signature-based and algorithm-based security to help identify traffic patterns that are similar to known attack methods.
IDS/IPS involves tightly controlling the size and make-up of the attack surface, employing intelligent detection controls at data entry points, and developing and deploying technologies that automatically remedy dangerous situations, as well as preventing known threats from accessing the system in the first place.
We do not provide direct access to security event forensics, but we do provide access to our engineering and customer support teams during and after any unscheduled downtime.

<p>In addition to placing web beacons on our own websites, we sometimes work with other companies to place our web beacons on their websites or in their advertisements.
This helps us to develop statistics on how often clicking on an advertisement on a Dapper website results in a purchase or other action on the advertiser's website.</p>
<p>Finally, our Game may contain web beacons or similar technologies from third-party analytics providers that help us compile aggregated statistics about the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or other operations.
These technologies enable the analytics providers to set or read their own cookies or other identifiers on your device, through which they can collect information about your online activities across applications, websites or other products.</p>

Data Retention</p>
<p>A.
SUMMARY</p>
<p>We may retain your personal information as long as you continue to use the Game, have an account with us, or for as long as is necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy.
You can ask to close your account by contacting us as described above, and we will delete your personal information on request.
We may, however, retain personal information for an additional period as is permitted or required under applicable laws, for legal, tax, or regulatory reasons, or for legitimate and lawful business purposes.</p>
<p>B.
LEARN MORE</p>
<p>We will retain your personal data for as long as necessary to make the Game available to you, or for other essential purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements.
Because these needs can vary for different types of data, actual retention periods can vary significantly.
The criteria we use to determine the retention periods include:</p>
<p>
</p>
<li>How long is the personal data needed to make the Game available to you and/or operate our business? This includes such things such as maintaining and improving the performance of the Game, keeping our systems secure, and maintaining appropriate business and financial records.
This is the general rule that establishes the baseline for most data retention periods.</li>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<li>Is there an automated control, such as in your user dashboard, that enables you to access and delete the personal data at any time? If there is not, a shortened data retention time will generally be adopted.</li>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<li>Is the personal data of a sensitive type? If so, a shortened retention time would generally be appropriate.</li>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<li>Has the user provided consent for a longer retention period? If so, we will retain the data in accordance with your consent.</li>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<li>Is Dapper subject to a legal, contractual, or similar obligation to retain the data? Examples can include mandatory data retention laws in the applicable jurisdiction, government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation, or data that must be retained for the purposes of litigation.</li>
<p>
