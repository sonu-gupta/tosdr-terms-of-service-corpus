</ul> SECTION 1 - OVERVIEW
<p>(Please, please read the whole thing, this is a contract after all.)</p>
<p>Platform.sh is your hosting solution.
Our PaaS (Platform as a Service) will let you host your products and services on a dedicated real-time basis, configured and optimized by us, Platform.sh.
Our end to end complete infrastructure allows you to simply deploy your applications to the cloud without any headaches.</p>
<p>We automatically configure and run not only your application server but all the services on which it depends (databases, search engines, cache backends, etc.).
On top of an easy to navigate web interface, we offer you APIs to control all your third-party integrations and tools.</p>
<p>“Platform.sh” is operated by Platform.sh SAS, a French company located at 131, Boulevard de Sébastopol, Paris, 75002 France, and Platform.sh, Inc.
a Delaware registered corporation, addressed at PO Box 536 Brooklyn, MI 49230 and may include its affiliates, subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, contractors, and/or licensors (together, referred to throughout these Terms of Service as “Platform.sh” or “us” or “we”).</p>
<p>By visiting our site and/ or purchasing something from us, you agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions (“Terms of Service”, “Terms”), including those additional terms and conditions and policies referenced herein and/or available by hyperlink, including our Privacy Policy.
These Terms of Service apply to all users of the site, including without limitation users who are browsers, vendors, customers, merchants, and/or contributors of content.
We offer many services, tools, products, software, and offerings on related Platform.sh websites (the “Services”), including but not limited to, all information, tools and Services available from this website (or “site”) to you (the “user”, “customer,” “company” conditioned upon your acceptance of such terms, conditions, policies and notices in or referenced in the Terms of Service.</p>
<p>Please read these Terms carefully before accessing or using our website.
By accessing or using any part of the site, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this agreement, then you may not access the website or use any services.
If these Terms of Service are considered an offer, acceptance is expressly limited to these Terms of Service.</p>
<p>METERED AND USAGE BASED: Our Services are bundled in monthly plans, but the actual billing is based on the actual usage you make of our services.
To learn more about our self-service plans, please visit our pricing page.</p>
<p>UPTIME: We try to keep our Services up all the time, but the self-service plans only come with a very limited uptime guarantee of 99.5% (our track record is much higher, but we will not commit to it because not all services run with redundancy).
Most other providers won’t even commit to this.
If you need guaranteed uptime because you depend on your website for your company’s income you should check out our ENTERPRISE offering.</p>
<p>SUPPORT: The self-service Professional plans do not include personalized support.
We do give support, on a best effort basis, through an online service desk, and on public forums.
We are sorry but our engineers will simply not take phone calls (if you are using this service you are probably a developer, and do not like taking phone calls either).
If your organization needs people they can contact 24/7, again you will need to purchase an optional ENTERPRISE offering (which redefines white gloving, our support staff will be more than happy to talk to you!).
Please contact your salesperson for our terms.</p>
<p>ENTERPRISE SUPPORT: Selected self-service Professional plans do offer an optional enterprise SLA, which provides the following ticket response times through an online service desk: Priority 1 – Less than 1 hour, Priority 2 &amp.
3 – Less than 1 working day.
This SLA is offered on an annual term basis, paid for in advance, and is non-refundable.
Further details can be found in the specific terms referenced in the Order/Quote form you will need to sign to buy this.</p>

We may exercise this right on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with applicable law.

You commit to abide by and to assure adherence to the technical specifications and limitations of such Services, to assure that the use of our Services is done within the limits of the law and in accordance with these Terms.</p>
<p>Specifically, we call your attention to the fact that, in accordance with applicable law, specifically French law, you must clearly be identifiable to third parties in your function as a web host, if you use our services to host public communication services online (notably websites or blogs), regardless of whether you are only an editor to such services.</p>
<p>Platform.sh Services provides you with a fully autonomous management interface including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>to subscribe, modify, and/or to cancel Platform.sh Services and options to a more or less powerful plan, throughout the duration of the contract;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to manage your hosting in real time (and notably publish online, delete, or modify all or some of the content on a real time dedicated basis);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to modify and update your contact information associated with Platform.sh hosting service.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some changes may incur additional fees, for which you will be informed and will be subject to your express prior consent.</p>
<p>You understand that some changes cannot be performed, most notably you may not reduce the amount of storage dedicated to any specific environment or project.
In order to reduce storage, you may need to subscribe to a new Platform.sh Service offering and transition the content from the larger one to the smaller one.</p>
<p>As a reminder, in accordance with these Terms, your access codes, which are private, are under your full and complete responsibility.
Platform.sh will not be accountable for misuse by third parties of your account, it is your responsibility to keep such credentials private and safe.</p>
<p>For the purpose of ensuring the proper operation of its Services, and the safety and stability of the system, Platform.sh may intervene under certain circumstances, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>to stop a technical malfunction inherent to our system;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to carry out a maintenance operation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in case of trouble affecting the safety and/or the stability of the system: abusive use and/or illegal use, or continued misuse following a warning from our service (e.g.: spamming, fraud, hacking, unauthorized access attempts…).
obvious damage to, or attempt to damage our infrastructure caused by your instance of your software (e.g.
DDoS, botnet, spamming).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In any event, Platform.sh reserves the right to interrupt some or all of the Services in order to perform a technical intervention, particularly in the case of defective operation, or to improve the operation, or to perform maintenance.
In accordance with our 99.5% self-service uptime, we will do everything necessary to limit the time of such interruption as much as possible and, if possible, we will give you reasonable prior notice, indicating the date, type, and duration of the intervention, so that you can make all the necessary arrangements.</p>
<p>However, you acknowledge that we will not be able to give you prior notice in the case where the Service interruption is due to an external reason, for example emergency security patching (and in particular, one that would be inherent to the internet itself, acts of God, war, terrorism, riot, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, earthquakes, labor strikes, industrial disputes, or fuel crises) or if it is explicitly requested by a competent authority or in application of current French law.</p>
<p>Platform.sh Professional is intended to be used to host websites, web-applications, and web-APIs with unmetered bandwidth based on fair-use assumptions.
It is not intended to be used as a download service or as a Content Delivery Network (CDN).
As such, the Services self-service offering currently does not limit the bandwidth you may use, as long as it falls inside the realm of what Platform.sh deems as ordinary usage.
The Professional Enterprise offering includes CDN with a 1Tb per month included amount, beyond which overages are chargeable.</p>
<p>Our development environments share resources between themselves and as such are not intended to be used for production type workloads such as intensive calculations and regular long running jobs.</p>
<p>Should Platform.sh deem a customer’s account as exceeding fair use bandwidth consumption, or development environment usage, Platform.sh will notify the customer and allow the customer to remedy the problem.
However, should a customer’s’ bandwidth or Central Processing Unit (CPU) usage be significantly greater than what Plaform.sh deems as fair use of the Services, Platform.sh reserves the right to suspend or throttle the customer’s account where appropriate.
In such event, Platform.sh will notify you and discuss other available options and Services that could better suited for your use and needs.</p>
<p>
<strong>SSL Certificates</strong>
</p>
<p>Platform.sh provisions automatically for every site and environment SSL certificates using the “Let’s Encrypt” service (with some limitations).
You may provision your own SSL certificates for production environments, but development environments will always carry a “Let’s Encrypt” provisioned certificate.
By using the Platform.sh service, you recognize Platform.sh as a duly authorized agent for the provisioning of such certificates.</p>
<p>
<strong>Free Trial</strong>
</p>
<p>If you sign up for our 30-day free trial period (the “Free Trial”), you may be required to provide a valid credit card or other valid payment method.
Your provided payment method will be charged on the first day following the Free Trial unless you cancel and uninstall your ongoing projects utilizing our Services, as required for cancellation, before the end of the Free Trial period.
The Free Trial is only available to first-time users of the service.
Platform.sh reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to determine your eligibility for a Free Trial, and, subject to applicable laws, to withdraw or to modify a Free Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the greatest extent permitted under the law.</p>
<p>Currently, the Free Trial is limited to development plans and you may not host production sites using the Free Trial.</p>
<p>The Free Trial offers development plans which have different resource allocations than our production plans, and as such, a project that successfully deploys as a Free Trial development plan may not be able to deploy at any of the other plans.</p>
<p>You may not sign up for multiple accounts in order to receive additional Free Trial benefits.
We may terminate or suspend a Free Trial at any time without notice or liability, and in our sole discretion, and we reserve the right to adjust pricing relative to any Services offered through a Free Trial.</p>
<p>
<strong>Sponsored Sites</strong>
</p>
<p>From time to time, at its sole discretion, Platform.sh may sponsor the hosting of selected sites.
Such hosted sites must comply with the current Terms regardless of whether they pay for the Services or not.
Platform.sh reviews all sponsored hosted sites from time to time and may decide to terminate, without prejudice, the Services at its sole discretion.</p>
<p>Sponsored sites are expected to display a widget “Powered by Platform.sh.” Platform.sh may update such widget’s contents from time to time and the sponsored site will update the contents in a timely fashion.
A sponsored site may request, and Platform.sh will accept, variations of the widget as long as such variations have written pre-approval from Platform.sh, or fall within branding guidelines provided by Platform.sh .In accordance with such sponsorship, Platform.sh may announce on its own media presence, both online and offline, regarding such sponsored project hosting, and kindly ask the sponsored site communicate the same (at least once) over its social media presence (Twitter, mailing list, etc) the sponsored hosting.</p>
<p>If such eligible customer project is a registered non-profit organization in the US or Germany, it is also expected to provide paperwork to register an in-kind donation to the organization of the equivalent price of the service ($50 USD/month or the EUR equivalent), for the non-profit organization’s tax purposes.</p>

<p>

<p>
<strong>Governing Law.
Judicial forum for disputes.</strong>
</p>
<p>These Terms are governed by French law and in accordance with the laws the Commerce Tribunal of Paris, France, without regard to any such conflicts of law principles.
You and Platform.sh agree that any judicial proceeding to resolve claims relating to these Terms will be subject to the mandatory international arbitration provisions below.
Both you and Platform.sh consent to such mandatory arbitration.
<strong>If you reside in a country (for example, European Union member states) with laws that give consumers the right to bring disputes in their local courts, this paragraph doesn’t affect those requirements or rights.</strong>
</p>
<p>IF YOU’RE A U.S.
RESIDENT, YOU ALSO AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS:</p>
<p>
<strong>Both Parties Agree To Arbitrate.</strong> You and Platform.sh agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms through final and binding arbitration before one arbitrator, except as set forth under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below.
This includes disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this “Mandatory Arbitration Provisions” section, including its enforceability, revocability, or validity.</p>
<p>
<strong>Arbitration Procedures.</strong> Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Terms of Service and incorporated agreements or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration in London, United Kingdom before one arbitrator(s) with substantial experience arbitrating claims relating to commercial contracts relating to software.
The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its International Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those Rules or pursuant to JAMS’ International Arbitration Rules and Procedures.
This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.
The language to be used in the arbitral proceedings will be English.
Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>
<p>
<strong>Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate</strong>.

Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above.
If the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Commerce Tribunal of Paris, France to resolve your claim.</p>
<p>

If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Mandatory Arbitration Provisions” section will be deemed void.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the above, if you reside in a country with laws that give consumers the right to bring disputes in their local courts (for example, European Union member states), the Terms of Service shall be governed by the laws of the Commerce Tribunal of Paris, France (or construed in accordance with your local laws if the laws of France are not enforceable).
