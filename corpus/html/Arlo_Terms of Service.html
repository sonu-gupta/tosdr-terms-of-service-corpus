DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION.
CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
PLEASE READ THIS PROVISION CAREFULLY.
IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.
<br>
<p>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND THE COMPANY ARE EACH AGREEING TO ARBITRATE ALL DISPUTES ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND ARE THEREFORE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>
<p>BINDING ARBITRATION.
To the extent possible under your local law, both you and the Company agree to arbitrate any and all disputes or claims out of or relating to this Agreement, any Arlo Services, or your relationship to Arlo.
All disputes concerning whether a claim is subject to arbitration (including disputes about the interpretation, breach, applicability, enforceability, revocability, or validity of this Agreement) shall be decided by the arbitrator.
Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury to resolve claims.
Arbitration is less formal than a traditional court proceeding and the arbitrator’s decision is subject to limited review by courts.</p>
<p>The arbitration will be governed and administered by the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc.
(“JAMS”) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and consumer contract disputes, who will be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS.
To the extent JAMS is not available in your state, the arbitration will be governed and administered by the American Arbitration Association Consumer Arbitration Rules.
The right to arbitration under this Agreement is protected by, and any arbitration will also be governed by, the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C.
§§ 1 et seq.).
Both parties agree that the parties’ relationship involves interstate commerce.
Judgment upon the award so rendered may be entered in a court having jurisdiction, or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be.</p>
<p>EXCEPTIONS TO ARBITRATION.
Not withstanding the foregoing, each party will have the right to institute an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable relief pending a final decision by the arbitrator.
For all purposes of this Agreement, for any dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration, the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the United States Federal Courts located in the Northern District of California.</p>
<p>CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
The parties agree that they both give up the right to a jury trial, and that each may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action lawsuit: CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED.</p>
<p>THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER ARE OPTIONAL.
You may decline or opt out of this agreement to arbitrate by sending written and signed notice to legal@arlo.com within thirty (30) calendar days of agreeing to these Terms.</p> 7.

Should the claim for damages be based on willful or grossly negligent breach of contractual duty or obligation on the part of Arlo, the preclusion and limitation of liability mentioned in the preceding sentences will not apply.

<strong>Accessibility Statement</strong>
<strong>Compliance status</strong>
<p>We firmly believe that the internet should be available and accessible to anyone and are committed to providing a website that is accessible to the broadest possible audience, regardless of ability.</p>
<p>To fulfill this, we aim to adhere as strictly as possible to the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG 2.1) at the AA level.
These guidelines explain how to make web content accessible to people with a wide array of disabilities.
Complying with those guidelines helps us ensure that the website is accessible to blind people, people with motor impairments, visual impairment, cognitive disabilities, and more.</p>
<p>This website utilizes various technologies that are meant to make it as accessible as possible at all times.
We utilize an accessibility interface that allows persons with specific disabilities to adjust the website’s UI (user interface) and design it to their personal needs.</p>
<p>Additionally, the website utilizes an AI-based application that runs in the background and optimizes its accessibility level constantly.
This application remediates the website’s HTML, adapts its functionality and behavior for screen-readers used by blind users, and for keyboard functions used by individuals with motor impairments.</p>
<p>If you wish to contact the website’s owner please use the website's form</p>
<strong>Screen-reader and keyboard navigation</strong>
<p>Our website implements the ARIA attributes (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) technique, alongside various behavioral changes, to ensure blind users visiting with screen-readers can read, comprehend, and enjoy the website’s functions.
As soon as a user with a screen-reader enters your site, they immediately receive a prompt to enter the Screen-Reader Profile so they can browse and operate your site effectively.
Here’s how our website covers some of the most important screen-reader requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Screen-reader optimization:&nbsp;</strong>we run a process that learns the website’s components from top to bottom, to ensure ongoing compliance even when updating the website.
In this process, we provide screen-readers with meaningful data using the ARIA set of attributes.
For example, we provide accurate form labels.
descriptions for actionable icons (social media icons, search icons, cart icons, etc.).
validation guidance for form inputs.
element roles such as buttons, menus, modal dialogues (popups), and others.&nbsp;<br>
<br>Additionally, the background process scans all of the website’s images.
It provides an accurate and meaningful image-object-recognition-based description as an ALT (alternate text) tag for images that are not described.
It will also extract texts embedded within the image using an OCR (optical character recognition) technology.
To turn on screen-reader adjustments at any time, users need only to press the Alt+1 keyboard combination.
Screen-reader users also get automatic announcements to turn the Screen-reader mode on as soon as they enter the website.<br>
<br>These adjustments are compatible with popular screen readers such as JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, and TalkBack.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Keyboard navigation optimization:&nbsp;</strong>The background process also adjusts the website’s HTML and adds various behaviors using JavaScript code to make the website operable by the keyboard.
This includes the ability to navigate the website using the Tab and Shift+Tab keys, operate dropdowns with the arrow keys, close them with Esc, trigger buttons and links using the Enter key, navigate between radio and checkbox elements using the arrow keys, and fill them in with the Spacebar or Enter key.<br>
<br>Additionally, keyboard users will find content-skip menus available at any time by clicking Alt+2, or as the first element of the site while navigating with the keyboard.
The background process also handles triggered popups by moving the keyboard focus towards them as soon as they appear, not allowing the focus to drift outside.<br>
<br>Users can also use shortcuts such as “M” (menus), “H” (headings), “F” (forms), “B” (buttons), and “G” (graphics) to jump to specific elements.</li>
</ol>

<strong>Additional UI, design, and readability adjustments</strong>

<strong>Font&nbsp;adjustments –</strong>&nbsp;users can increase and decrease its size, change its family (type), adjust the spacing,&nbsp;alignment, line height,&nbsp;and more.</li>
<li>
<strong>Color&nbsp;adjustments –</strong>&nbsp;users can select various color contrast profiles such as light, dark, inverted, and monochrome.
Additionally, users can swap color schemes of titles, texts, and backgrounds with over seven different coloring options.</li>
<li>
<strong>Animations –</strong>&nbsp;epileptic users can stop all running animations with the click of a button.
Animations controlled by the interface include videos, GIFs, and CSS flashing transitions.</li>
<li>
<strong>Content&nbsp;highlighting –</strong>&nbsp;users can choose to emphasize essential elements such as links and titles.
They can also choose to highlight focused or hovered elements only.</li>
<li>
<strong>Audio muting&nbsp;–</strong>&nbsp;users with hearing devices may experience headaches or other issues due to automatic audio playing.
This option lets users mute the entire website instantly.</li>
<li>
<strong>Cognitive&nbsp;disorders –</strong>&nbsp;we utilize a search engine linked to Wikipedia and Wiktionary, allowing people with cognitive disorders to decipher meanings of phrases, initials, slang, and others.</li>
<li>
<strong>Additional functions&nbsp;</strong>
<strong>–</strong> we allow users to change cursor color and size, use a printing mode, enable a virtual keyboard, and many other functions.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Assistive technology and browser compatibility</strong>
<p>We aim to support as many browsers and assistive technologies as possible, so our users can choose the best fitting tools for them, with as few limitations as possible.
Therefore, we have worked very hard to be able to support all major systems that comprise over 95% of the user market share, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera and Microsoft Edge, JAWS, and NVDA (screen readers), both for Windows and MAC users.</p>
<strong>Notes, comments, and feedback</strong>
<p>Despite our very best efforts to allow anybody to adjust the website to their needs, there may still be pages or sections that are not fully accessible, are in the process of becoming accessible, or are lacking an adequate technological solution to make them accessible.
Still, we are continually improving our accessibility, adding, updating, improving its options and features, and developing and adopting new technologies.
All this is meant to reach the optimal level of accessibility following technological advancements.
