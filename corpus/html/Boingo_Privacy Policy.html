<br>
<strong>Optional Information</strong>
<br>
<p>Like any business interested in attracting and offering the highest quality of service to customers, Boingo gathers voluntary demographic information about our customers.
These questions seek to gain insight on such things as how an individual became aware of our service, their gender, occupation and travel preferences and practices.
In addition, customer comments and inquiries are collected and stored for each customer that submits them.
This information is collected and stored with the customer’s individual Boingo account information.</p>
<p>Boingo occasionally conducts user surveys to better target our service offering to existing as well as new customers.
We sometimes share aggregated demographic information in these surveys with various business partners.
Participation in our customer surveys is voluntary.</p>
<p>Boingo has and may institute referral programs or similar programs, such as the “Tell a Friend” program.
Boingo’s “Tell a Friend” program allows customers to receive credit for each individual (a “Referral”) that, as a result of their recommendation, also becomes a customer.
For a customer to receive a free month of service under this program, (1) the Referral must become a subscriber to Boingo Unlimited and remain a subscriber of Boingo Unlimited for more than 31 days.
(2) the Referral cannot be an existing Boingo customer.
and (3) the Referral cannot have been previously submitted to the “Tell a Friend” program by another person.
Existing customers provide the e-mail address of the Referral, and Boingo may send an e-mail message to the Referral from the referring customer’s e-mail address informing them of the Boingo service.</p>
<br>
<strong>Geographic Location Information</strong>
<p>When you use Boingo’s services on a mobile device (such as your laptop or a smart phone), Boingo may collect and/or track certain geographic location information that is derived from your usage of the Boingo service such as usage patterns, travel patterns, Web site page views, traffic patterns and information about your geographic location.
Boingo may use this tracking and location information for statistical, analytical or business-related purposes to improve our products, offerings and services and to manage our networks and systems more efficiently.</p>
<br>
<strong>Information Collected Automatically</strong>
<p>To keep track of traffic on their servers, Web sites often store a small data file on your hard disk and/or device when you visit them.
This file is commonly referred to as a “cookie.” For detailed information on the cookies we collect, please visit our Cookie Policy.
A cookie file can contain user specific information, such as User ID, or it can be used to maintain a connection with you during your visit (so that you can visit pages of a site without retyping the same information over and over).
The Services use cookies and similar technologies such as pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs, and JavaScript (collectively, “cookies”) to track customer traffic patterns, to maintain a connection during your visit with us, to track your preferences, and to diagnose problems on our server and administer our site.
The cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us, e.g., your email address, that we may share with a data provider solely in hashed, non-human readable form.
Cookies enable you to enter all parts of the Site, and are used to save your User ID on the login page (we encrypt the User ID for added security).
In addition, cookie files help us assist you with questions about site navigation, functionality or performance.
Partners also may use their own “cookies.” We may supplement the information we collect from you with information received from third parties, including third parties that have placed their own cookies on your device(s).</p>
<p>IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO HAVE WEB COOKIES PLACED ON YOUR COMPUTER, YOU SHOULD SET YOUR BROWSER TO REFUSE WEB COOKIES, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT CERTAIN FEATURES OF THIS SITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT THE AID OF WEB COOKIES.
IF YOU REFUSE WEB COOKIES, YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RESULTING LOSS OF FUNCTIONALITY.</p>
<p>To explore what cookie settings are available to you, look in the “preferences” or “options” section of your browser’s menu.
To find out more information about cookies, including information about how to manage and delete cookies, please visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org/.</p>
<strong>Information about Interest-Based Advertisements: </strong>
<br>
<p>We may serve advertisements, and also allow third-party ad networks, including third-party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms, to serve advertisements through the Services.
These advertisements may be targeted to users who fit certain general profile categories or display certain preferences or behaviors (“Interest-Based Ads”).
Information for Internet-Based Ads (including Personal Data) may be provided to us by you, or derived from the usage patterns of particular users on the Services and/or services of third parties.
Such information may be gathered through tracking users’ activities across time and unaffiliated properties, including when you leave the Services.
To accomplish this, we or our service providers may deliver cookies, including a file (known as a “web beacon”) from an ad network to you through the Services.
Web beacons allow websites to track users who have visited that page or to access certain cookies.
Web beacons also allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers and enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites.
Web beacons allow ad networks to view, edit or set their own cookies on your browser, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.</p>
<p>Boingo may use web beacons in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boingo may use web beacons within our Web sites in order to track customers signing up at one of our hotspot locations.</li>
<li>Boingo may use web beacons within our Web sites in order to fulfill sponsored access campaigns or other promotions.</li>
<li>Boingo may use web beacons to measure where customers leave the signup process in order to improve customer experience.</li>
<li>Boingo may use web beacons to track customers that come through our Web sites from advertisements or search engines.</li>
<li>Boingo may use web beacons to serve ads to customers after they leave our Web sites.</li>
</ul>
<p>Boingo also records the MAC (Media Access Controller) address, IDFA, ADID and device identifier numbers from the network card in or used with your computer or other device to enable Boingo to accurately perform our billing functions and in the ordinary course of business.</p>
<p>We comply with the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.
Through the DAA and Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”), several media and marketing associations have developed an industry self-regulatory program to give consumers a better understanding of, and greater control over, ads that are customized based a consumer’s online behavior across different websites and properties.
To make choices about Interest-Based Ads from participating third parties, including to opt-out of receiving behaviorally targeted advertisements from participating organizations, please visit the DAA’s or NAI’s consumer opt-out pages, which are located at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ or www.aboutads.info/choices.</p>
<strong>Information Collected from Other Websites and Do Not Track Policy</strong>
<br>
<p>Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services.
Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy.
Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and/or across different websites.
Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave our Services.</p>
<br>
<strong>How We Use Your Personal Data</strong>
<p>We process Personal Data to operate, improve, understand and personalize our Services.
We use Personal Data for the following purposes:</p>

</ul>
<p>Subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy, we may disclose information to our employees, contractors, affiliates, distributors, dealers, vendors, partners and suppliers who process information on our behalf, participate with us in the provision or operation of our site or provide you with services.</p>
<p>We may email you about products and services that we believe may be of interest to you if you’ve provided us the means to do so.
Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us, which helps us improve our Services.
If you wish to opt-out of receiving marketing materials from us, please follow the instructions at the bottom of each email for opting out or send a request via email to privacy@boingo.com.
Please note that if you do not want to receive legal notices from us, those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are responsible for reviewing such legal notices for changes.</p>
<p>We allow advertisers and/or merchant partners (“Advertisers”) to choose the demographic information of users who will see their advertisements and/or promotional offers and you agree that we may provide any of the information we have collected from you in non-personally identifiable form to an Advertiser, in order for that Advertiser to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements and/or offers.
For example, we might use the fact you are located in San Francisco to show you ads or offers for San Francisco businesses, but we will not tell such businesses who you are.
</p>
<p>Advertisers may serve ads that appear on our sites or services, which may contain a feature allowing you to input your email address.
If you choose to input your email address in connection with these ads, you understand that we will transmit your email address to the applicable third party advertiser.
this Privacy Policy does not apply to such advertisers’ collection and use practices, so please review their privacy policies before providing your email address in this manner.</p>

<p>Please note that if you do not want to receive legal notices from us, those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are responsible for reviewing such legal notices for changes.</p>
<br>
<strong>Personal Data of Children</strong>
<p>We do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Data from children under the age of 16.
In the event that we learn that we have collected Personal Data from a child under age 16, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.
If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 16, please contact us at privacy@boingo.com.</p>
<br>
<strong>Security Measures</strong>
<p>Your account information is protected by a unique User Identification and password that is issued to you.
Your User Identification and password should be kept confidential because it is the key to accessing the information held by Boingo about you.
If your computer or other device is accessible to or by others, please log out of the Boingo site before you leave it.
Security is also provided through your web browser, which supports 40, 56 or a 128-bit version of encryption with the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) security protocol.</p>
<p>Boingo has instituted internal safeguards to reduce the likelihood of accidental disclosures and unintended access of your information (although it is impossible to eliminate this possibility completely).
In general, all employees, contractors and other companies engaged by Boingo are contractually required, through signed, internal non-disclosure agreements, to keep your Personal Data confidential and not to use it in any way other than what is necessary to perform their work for Boingo.
Violations of these policies can result in termination in the case of employees, the severing of contractual obligations in the case of contractors and other companies, and in civil and criminal penalties if warranted and applicable by law.</p>
<p>While Boingo uses reasonable measures to protect the security of your information, no security measures are foolproof, and Boingo does not guarantee that your information will remain confidential.</p>
<p>The Services may contain links to other sites.
We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites.
When following a link to another site you should read that site’s privacy policy.</p>
<p>We retain Personal Data about you for as long as you have an open account with us or as otherwise necessary to provide you with our Services.
In some cases we retain Personal Data for longer, if doing so is necessary to comply with our legal or contractual obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed, or is otherwise permitted or required by applicable law, rule or regulation.
We may further retain information in an anonymous or aggregated form where that information would not identify you personally.</p>
<br>
<strong>Security of Third Party Networks</strong>
<p>Because of the global nature of our services, there are some places where you cannot access the Boingo Wi-Fi Network.
In these places, you may (1) manually search for available third party networks and, if required to do so, assent to Terms of Service or other click-through agreements.
or (2) connect to other people’s Wi-Fi networks automatically by using the Boingo Wi-Finder tool if you opt-in to use this feature.
Please see our FAQs for more information about these options: http://www.boingo.com/faq/wifinder.</p>
<p>Third parties are under no obligation to comply with this Privacy Policy with respect to information that you provide directly to those third parties or that those third parties collect for themselves.
We do not control the third-party sites that may be accessible through this Site or Boingo’s services.
Thus, this Privacy Policy does not apply to information provided to third-party sites or gathered by the third parties that operate them.
Before visiting a third-party site, whether by means of Boingo Wi-Finder, manually searching for an available third party network or otherwise, and before providing any information to any third party, you should inform yourself of the privacy policies and practices (if any) of the third party, and should take those steps necessary to your discretion, to protect your privacy.</p>
<br>
<strong>Affiliated Businesses and Third Party Websites</strong>
<p>In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we’re affiliated with may sell items or provide services to you through the Services (either alone or jointly with us).
You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Data with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service.
One such service may include the ability for you to automatically transmit Third Party Account Information to your Services profile or to automatically transmit information in your Services profile to your third party account.
We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business’ or websites’ policies.</p>
<strong>California Resident Rights</strong>
<p>If you are a California resident, you have the rights outlined in this section.
Please see the “Exercising Your Rights” section below for instructions regarding how to exercise these rights.
If there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this Privacy Policy and you are a California resident, the portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such conflict.
If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following applies to you, please contact us at privacy@boingo.com.</p>
<strong>Access</strong>
<p>If the CCPA applies to you, you have the right to request certain information about our collection and use of your Personal Data over the past twelve (12) months.
We will provide you with the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The categories of Personal Data that we have collected about you</li>
<li>The categories of sources from which that Personal Data was collected</li>
<li>The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your Personal Data</li>
<li>The categories of third parties with whom we have shared your Personal Data</li>
<li>The specific pieces of Personal Data that we have collected about you</li>
</ul>
<p>If we have disclosed your Personal Data for a business purpose over the past 12 months, we will identify the categories of Personal Data shared with each category of third party recipient.</p>
<strong>Deletion</strong>
<p>You have the right to request that we delete the Personal Data that we have collected from you.
Under the CCPA, this right is subject to certain exceptions: for example, we may need to retain your Personal Data to provide you with the Services or complete a transaction or other action you have requested.
If your deletion request is subject to one of these exceptions, we may deny your deletion request.</p>
<strong>Exercising Your Rights</strong>
<p>To exercise the rights described above, you must send us a request that (1) provides sufficient information to allow us to verify that you are the person about whom we have collected Personal Data, and (2) describes your request in sufficient detail to allow us to understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
Each request that meets both of these criteria (as determined by Boingo in its sole discretion) will be considered a “Valid Request.” We may choose to not respond to requests that do not meet these criteria.
We will only use Personal Data provided in a Valid Request to verify you and complete your request.
You do not need an account to submit a Valid Request.</p>
<p>We will work to respond to your Valid Request within forty five (45) days of receipt.
We will not charge you a fee for making a Valid Request unless your Valid Request(s) is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.
If we determine that your Valid Request warrants a fee, we will notify you of the fee and explain that decision before completing your request.</p>
<p>You may submit a Valid Request using the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Call us at: +1-800-880-4117</li>
<li>Email us at: privacy@boingo.com</li>
</ul>
<strong>Sales of Personal Data</strong>
<p>In this section, we use the term ‘sell’ as it is defined in the CCPA.
We sell your Personal Data, subject to your right to opt-out of these sales.</p>
<p>As described in our Cookie Policyv, we have incorporated cookies from certain third parties into our Services.
These cookies allow those third parties to receive information about your activity on our Services that is associated with your browser or device.
Those third parties may use that data to serve you relevant ads on our Services or on other websites you visit.
Under the CCPA, sharing your data through third party cookies for online advertising may be considered a “sale” of information.</p>
<p>You have the right to opt-out of the sale of your Personal Data.
You can opt-out using the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Email us at: privacy@boingo.com</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have submitted an opt-out request, we will not ask you to reauthorize the sale of your Personal Data for at least 12 months.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, we do not sell the Personal Data of minors under 16 years of age.</p>
<strong>We Will Not Discriminate Against You for Exercising Your Rights Under the CCPA</strong>
<p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA.
We will not deny you our goods or services, charge you different prices or rates, or provide you a lower quality of goods and services if you exercise your rights under the CCPA.
However, we may offer different tiers of our Services as allowed by applicable data privacy laws (including the CCPA) with varying prices, rates, or levels of quality of the goods or services you receive related to the value of Personal Data that we receive from you.</p>
<br>
<strong>Nevada Resident Rights</strong>
<p>If you are a resident of Nevada, you have the right to opt-out of the sale of certain Personal Data to third parties who intend to license or sell that Personal Data.
You can exercise this right by contacting us at privacy@boingo.com with the subject line “Nevada Do Not Sell Request” and providing us with your name and the email address associated with your account.
Please note that we do not currently sell your Personal Data as sales are defined in Nevada Revised Statutes Chapter 603A.</p>
