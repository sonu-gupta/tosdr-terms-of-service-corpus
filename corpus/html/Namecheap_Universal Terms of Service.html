If We determine there is a problem with spam, We will take the appropriate action to resolve the situation.</p>
<p>We define spam as the sending of Unsolicited Commercial Email (UCE), Unsolicited Bulk Email (UBE) or Unsolicited Facsimiles (Fax), which is email or facsimile sent to recipients as an advertisement or otherwise, without first obtaining prior confirmed consent to receive these communications.
This can include, but is not limited to, the following:</p>

In order to use Our products and services, You must not only abide by all applicable laws and regulations, which include the Can-Spam Act of 2003 and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, but You must also abide by this no spam policy.</p>
<p>If We determine the services in question are being used in association with spam, We will re-direct, suspend, or cancel any web site hosting, domain registration, email boxes or other applicable services for a period deemed appropriate by Namecheap.
The registrant or customer will be required to respond by email to Us stating that they will cease to send spam and/or have spam sent on their behalf.
We may require a non-refundable reactivation fee to be paid before the site, email boxes and/or Services are reactivated.
In the event We determine the abuse has not stopped after Services have been restored the first time, We may terminate any and all Services associated with the domain name in question and, if We do, no refund will be available to You.</p>

<strong>Remedies, Liquidated Damages.</strong> You agree that We may immediately terminate any Account which we believe, in Our sole and absolute discretion, is transmitting or is otherwise connected with any spam or other unsolicited bulk email.

</li>
<li> Additional Reservation of Rights.
<p>Namecheap expressly reserves the right to deny, cancel, terminate, suspend, lock, or modify access to (or control of) any account or any Services (including the right to cancel or transfer any domain name registration) for any reason (as determined by Namecheap in its sole and absolute discretion), including but not limited to the following: (i) to correct mistakes made by Namecheap in offering or delivering any Services (including any domain name registration).

<li> Billing &amp.
Payment.

Termination &amp.
Cancellation Policy.
<p>
<strong>Billing and Payment.</strong> All fees for the Services shall be in accordance with Namecheap's fee schedule then in effect, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference, and shall be due at the time You order the Services, unless otherwise noted.
You may pay for Services by providing a valid credit or debit card, an electronic check (from your personal or business checking account, as appropriate), PayPal, Bitcoin, or any other payment method then accepted by Namecheap (each a “Payment Method”).
provided, however, that We may at Our option require that You pay fees through a particular payment means (such as by credit card or by wire transfer) or that You change from one payment provider to another.
Charges for the Service(s) will be billed to Your chosen Payment Method as charges for “NAME-CHEAP.COM.” If You choose to pay for the Service(s) by credit card, Our payment processing service provider may, at the beginning of the payment process, pre-authorize the transaction charges against Your credit card.
This process confirms both the validity of the credit card and the availability of sufficient funds to finalize the transaction.
If, after commencing the payment process, You subsequently elect not to finalize Your transaction, We will clear any pre-authorized charges from Our systems and reverse the payment within two [2] hours.
Depending on Your credit card provider and their policies, pre-authorized charges may continue to be reflected in Your credit card account details for longer than this two [2] hour period.
All prices and fees are non-refundable unless otherwise expressly noted, even if Your Services are suspended, terminated, or transferred prior to the end of the Services term.
Namecheap expressly reserves the right to change or modify its prices and fees at any time, and such changes or modifications shall be posted online at this site, or the relevant site of the Service, and effective immediately without need for further notice to You.
If You have purchased or obtained Services for a period of months or years, changes or modifications in prices and fees shall be effective when the Services in question come up for renewal as further described below.</p>
<p>IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT YOU DO NOT EXPERIENCE AN INTERRUPTION OR LOSS OF SERVICES, MOST SERVICES OFFER AN AUTOMATIC RENEWAL OPTION.
THE AUTOMATIC RENEWAL OPTION WILL ATTEMPT TO AUTOMATICALLY RENEW THE APPLICABLE SERVICE FOR A RENEWAL PERIOD EQUAL IN TIME TO THE MOST RECENT SERVICE PERIOD, EXCEPT FOR DOMAIN NAMES WHICH WILL RENEW FOR THE ORIGINAL SERVICE PERIOD.
FOR EXAMPLE, FOR PRODUCTS OTHER THAN DOMAINS, IF YOUR LAST SERVICE PERIOD IS FOR ONE YEAR, YOUR RENEWAL PERIOD WILL BE FOR ONE YEAR.
WITH THE AUTOMATIC RENEWAL OPTION, NAMECHEAP WILL ATTEMPT TO RENEW THE APPLICABLE SERVICE WHEN IT COMES UP FOR RENEWAL AND WILL TAKE PAYMENT FROM THE PAYMENT METHOD YOU HAVE ON FILE WITH US AT NAMECHEAP’S THEN CURRENT RATES, WHICH YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE MAY BE HIGHER OR LOWER THAN THE RATES FOR THE ORIGINAL SERVICE PERIOD.
PLEASE NOTE THAT RENEWAL DATES VARY BY SERVICE.
FOR INSTANCE, SOME SERVICES MAY RENEW THIRTY (30) DAYS PRIOR TO EXPIRATION AND OTHERS MAY RENEW FIVE (5) DAYS PRIOR TO EXPIRATION.
YOU MAY ENABLE OR DISABLE THE AUTOMATIC RENEWAL OPTION AT ANY TIME.
HOWEVER, SHOULD YOU ELECT TO DISABLE THE AUTOMATIC RENEWAL OPTION AND FAIL TO MANUALLY RENEW YOUR SERVICES BEFORE THEY EXPIRE OR IF YOUR PAYMENT METHOD CHOSEN FOR YOUR AUTOMATIC RENEWAL SHOULD FAIL, YOU MAY EXPERIENCE AN INTERRUPTION OR LOSS OF SERVICES, AND NAMECHEAP SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY REGARDING THE SAME.
NAMECHEAP RESERVES THE RIGHT TO DETERMINE WHETHER A SECOND ATTEMPT AT PAYMENT WILL BE MADE SHOULD THE CHOSEN PAYMENT METHOD FAIL.</p>
<p>IN ADDITION, NAMECHEAP MAY PARTICIPATE IN “RECURRING BILLING PROGRAMS” OR “ACCOUNT UPDATER SERVICES” SUPPORTED BY YOUR THIRD-PARTY BILLING PROVIDER.
IF YOU ARE ENROLLED IN AN AUTOMATIC RENEWAL OPTION AND WE ARE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY CHARGE YOUR EXISTING PAYMENT METHOD, YOUR CREDIT CARD PROVIDER (OR YOUR BANK) MAY NOTIFY US OF UPDATES TO YOUR CREDIT CARD NUMBER AND/OR EXPIRATION DATE, OR THEY MAY AUTOMATICALLY CHARGE YOUR NEW CREDIT CARD ON OUR BEHALF WITHOUT NOTIFICATION TO US.
IN ACCORDANCE WITH RECURRING BILLING PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS, IN THE EVENT THAT WE ARE NOTIFIED OF AN UPDATE TO YOUR CREDIT CARD NUMBER AND/OR EXPIRATION DATE, NAMECHEAP WILL AUTOMATICALLY UPDATE YOUR PAYMENT PROFILE ON YOUR BEHALF.
NAMECHEAP MAKES NO GUARANTEES THAT WE WILL REQUEST OR RECEIVE UPDATED CREDIT CARD INFORMATION.
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT IT IS YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO MODIFY AND MAINTAIN YOUR ACCOUNT SETTINGS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO (I) SETTING YOUR RENEWAL OPTIONS AND (II) ENSURING YOUR ASSOCIATED PAYMENT METHOD(S) ARE CURRENT AND VALID.
FURTHER, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOUR FAILURE TO DO SO MAY RESULT IN THE INTERRUPTION OR LOSS OF SERVICES, AND NAMECHEAP SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY REGARDING THE SAME.</p>
<p>If for any reason Namecheap is unable to charge your payment method for the full amount owed for the Services provided, or if We receive notification of a chargeback, reversal, payment dispute, or are charged a penalty for any fee previously charged to your payment method, You agree that Namecheap may pursue all available lawful remedies in order to obtain payment, including but not limited to, immediate cancellation, without notice to You, of any domain names or Services registered or renewed on Your behalf.
You also agree that all rights to and interest in and use of any Services, content and/or products purchased through Us, including all data hosted on Our systems shall be assumed by Us in satisfaction of any indebtedness by You to Us.
We will reinstate Your rights to and control over these Services solely at our discretion, and subject to our receipt of the unpaid fee(s) and Our reinstatement fee, currently set at $200 (US Dollars).
Namecheap also reserves the right to charge You reasonable "administrative fees" or "processing fees" for (i) tasks Namecheap may perform outside the normal scope of its Services, (ii) additional time and/or costs We may incur in providing its Services, and/or (iii) Your noncompliance with this Agreement (as determined by Namecheap in its sole and absolute discretion).
Typical administrative or processing fee scenarios include, but are not limited to (i) customer service issues that require additional personal time or attention.
(ii) UDRP action(s) in connection with Your domain name(s) and/or disputes that require accounting or legal services, whether performed by Namecheap staff or by outside firms retained by Namecheap.
(iii) recouping any and all costs and fees, including the cost of Services, incurred by Namecheap as the results of chargebacks or other payment disputes brought by You, Your bank or payment method processor.
These administrative fees or processing fees will be billed to the payment method You have on file with Namecheap.</p>
<p>If You signed up for a monthly payment plan, Your monthly billing date will be determined based on the day of the month You purchased the products or Services.
If You signed up for an annual (or longer) payment plan, and You elected the automatic renewal option, Namecheap will automatically renew Your Services when they come up for renewal and will take payment in accordance with the designated payment method at Namecheap's then current rates.</p>
<p>
<strong>Currency.</strong> While all purchases are processed in US dollars, Namecheap may provide an estimated conversion price to currencies other than US dollars.
You acknowledge and agree that the pricing displayed during the checkout process is an estimate.
Due to potential slight time delays between actual purchase and the payment settlement, the actual price charged may fluctuate.
Accordingly, Namecheap makes no representations or warranties that the actual price will be the same or substantially similar to the actual price You will pay and You waive any and all claims based upon any discrepancy between the estimate and the actual price.
In addition, You may be charged VAT or additional off-shore margin and/or fees, based on the country indicated in Your billing address section.
Any amounts to be charged will appear during the checkout process.</p>
<p>
<strong>Termination &amp.
Cancellation Policy.</strong> The initial term of Your agreement with Namecheap shall be as set forth in Your Order Form.

<p>In the event of termination or suspension of Services under the above circumstances, You agree (a) that no pre-paid fees will be refunded to You.
and (b) that Namecheap may take control of any domain name associated with the terminated Services, provided such domain name was registered through the domain name registration of Namecheap.</p>
