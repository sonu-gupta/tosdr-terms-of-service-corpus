How Long Does Bedrock Learning Keep Data? <p>
<strong>Why we Delete Data</strong>
</p>
<p>Bedrock Learning stores data for its users.
To ensure that Bedrock Learning does not hold user information in perpetuity, it has set criteria for the deletion of un-used data.</p>
<p>
<strong>Product Data</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Users</strong>
<br> Bedrock Learning holds data for Teacher and Student accounts.
If these accounts are left inactive for two years they will be deleted.
The definition of inactive is if the user has not logged in (via any route) for two years.
Also, any empty classes and groups will be deleted after two years and any classes or groups that exist on an inactive account for two years will also be deleted.</p>
<p>
<strong>Progress Tracker</strong>
<br> Any saved score data will be deleted after 5 years on a rolling basis.
Even if the student is still active, we will only hold 5 years’ worth of results per child.
if more is required, the export data feature should be used.
If a student is deleted as a result of being inactive for two years, all score data held for that student is also deleted.</p> 6.
Who has access to my/my students’ data? <p>To ensure that the user receives the best customer care, members of Bedrock Learning staff have access to user data.
However, only the customer management team, the technical support team and the Directors have access to this information.
In correspondence with schools, we clearly request that all personal data is sent directly to the customer management team, if for whatever reason it is sent to another member of staff, they will immediately delete the file and inform the sender.
Bedrock Learning Ltd will not be liable for the error.</p>
<p>
<strong>Sharing Data</strong>
</p>
<p>Bedrock Learning has a strict policy of not sharing any information about students with anyone outside the organisation.
Please note that the passwords can be controlled by the users themselves and may not be well-chosen, securely stored and may be shared by the whole school but we are not in control of that and strongly discourage such behaviours.<br> Bedrock Learning will not share data with third parties unless explicit instruction is given by the school in question, for example, to integrate with a VLE provider and we will never sell user information.</p>
<p>
<strong>External Data Storage</strong>
</p>
<p>Bedrock Learning stores data on our secure database servers.
The servers are housed in secure data centres, trusted and used by many of the country’s leading organisations.
Physical access to our servers is strictly limited to data centre staff, our own IT staff and accompanied external contractors when needed, in order to maintain the servers.
Access to the servers in the data centre requires proof of identify (photo ID) and is controlled by magnetic card readers and keys to both the cages and individual cabinets that surround the server racks, all of which are monitored by the data centre security staff using CCTV.
Remote access to the data is limited to the tools needed by the IT support staff to maintain and operate the servers and is restricted to known users (identified by usernames and secure keys) connecting from known locations (IP addresses).
Bedrock Learning stores data on UK and EU servers only.</p> 7.

Bedrock Learning Working Practices <p>
<strong>As part of our commitment to transparency, we have detailed our working practices with regards to data management and protection.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Data Use</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li> When working with personal data, Bedrock Learning Ltd employees should ensure the screens of their computers are always locked when left unattended.<br>
</li>
<li> Data will be password protected before being transferred electronically.
When sending data externally to schools or parents, a secure file transfer will be used, which encrypts all data in transit.
For the purposes of sending other, non-sensitive personal data, files will be password protected.<br>
</li>
<li> Employees should not save copies of personal data to their own computers.
They will always access and update the central copy of any data.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Data Accuracy</strong>
</p>
<p>Under law, we are obliged to take reasonable steps to ensure data is kept accurate and up to date.
To ensure we fulfil this responsibility, we commit that:</p>
<ul>
<li> Data will be held in as few places as necessary.
Staff should not create any unnecessary additional data sets.
</li>
<li>Staff should take every opportunity to ensure data is updated.
For instance, by confirming a customer’s details when they call.
</li>
<li> Bedrock Learning Ltd will make it easy for individuals to update the information we hold about them.
Any customer can do this by contacting data@bedrocklearning.org </li>
<li> Data will be updated as soon as any inaccuracies are discovered.
</li>
</ul> 9.
Data Breaches <p>
<strong>A personal data breach means a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data.
This includes breaches that are the result of both accidental and deliberate causes.</strong>
</p>
<p>In the unlikely event of a data breach, Bedrock Learning will follow a strict protocol:</p>
<p>Employees are trained to immediately recognise a data breach and understand that a data breach is not only about loss or theft of personal data.
As soon as a data breach is identified, the employee will escalate the incident to our data protection officer (DPO).
The DPO will evaluate the risk to the individual(s) concerned and the size of the breach.
If it is deemed that there is a risk to individuals or if the breach affects a large number of users, we will notify the ICO within 24 hours.</p>
<p>We will notify affected individuals about any breach within 24 hours and this will be documented in company records.</p>
