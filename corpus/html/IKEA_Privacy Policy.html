<p>You have the right, subject to certain exceptions defined in the California Consumer Protection Act “CCPA” and other applicable laws and regulations, to request that companies disclose certain information to you about their collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months.
This right of access includes information about:</p>
<ul>
<li>The categories of personal information we collected about you.</li>
<li>The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.</li>
<li>Our business or commercial purpose for collecting that personal information.</li>

<li>The categories of personal information that each recipient received.</li>
<li>The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you.<br>
<br>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>DELETION REQUEST RIGHTS<br>
</strong>You have the right, subject to certain exceptions defined in the CCPA and other applicable laws and regulations, to request that a company delete any of your personal information that it has collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>EXERCISING ACCESS, DATA PORTABILITY, AND DELETION RIGHTS<br>
</strong>To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, California residents may submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calling us at 1-888-888-4532</li>
<li>Submitting an online request here</li>
<li>Requesting a submission card in-person at one of our California stores.<br>
<br>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The verifiable consumer request must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to verify, to a reasonably high degree of certainty, that you are the person about whom we collected personal information.
This may include requesting that you provide us with at least two or more pieces of personal information to match against personal information about you that we may or may not maintain and which we have determined to be reliable for the purpose of verification.</li>
<li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.<br>
<br>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.
Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.
We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.</p>
<p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>DO NOT SELL RIGHTS<br>
</strong>You have the right, subject to certain exceptions defined in the CCPA and other applicable laws and regulations, to request that companies stop selling your personal information and refrain from doing so in the future.

However, if you would like to submit such a request, please send your request to infosec.dataprivacy.us@ikea.com.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>AUTHORIZED AGENT<br>
</strong>Only you, or a person you have designated in writing as your authorized agent, or who is registered with the California Secretary of State to act on your behalf, or to whom you have provided power of attorney pursuant to California Probate Code sections 4000 to 4465, (“Authorized Agent”), may make a verifiable consumer request or do not sell request related to your personal information.
You may also make a verifiable consumer request or do not sell request on behalf of your minor child.</p>
<p>If you wish to have an Authorized Agent make a request on your behalf, they will need to provide us with sufficient written proof that you have designated them as your Authorized Agent and we will still require you to provide sufficient information to allow us to reasonably verify that you are the person about whom we collected personal information.</p>
<p>

<li>Provide you a different level or quality of services.</li>

<br>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels.
Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects.
Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.
For example, if you become a member of IKEA Family, IKEA will provide you with certain benefits and special offers in exchange for you providing your contact information, other information about yourself, and opting in to IKEA marketing communications.
More details are available at the IKEA Family website, the IKEA Family FAQ, and IKEA’s Terms of Use.
</p>
<p>If you are a California resident, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits you to request a list of all third parties to which we, during the immediately preceding calendar year, have disclosed certain personally identifiable information for direct marketing purposes.
IKEA does not share personal information about its consumers with any third parties outside the IKEA corporate family for their own marketing purposes.
