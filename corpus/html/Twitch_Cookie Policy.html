To improve your user experience, Local Shared Objects (commonly known as “Flash cookies”) are employed to provide functions such as remembering your settings and preferences.
Flash cookies are stored on your device, but they are managed through an interface different from the one provided by your web browser.

Instead, you can access your Flash management tools from Adobe’s website directly.
The Adobe website provides comprehensive information on how to delete or disable Flash cookies see adobe.com/security/flashplayer for further information.

For example, developers of Extensions that are used by broadcasters on their Twitch channels may set cookies to operate those Extensions and remember your user settings and preferences, e.g., format, position, etc., of the Extension.</p>
<p>In addition, third-party advertisers and other organizations may use their own cookies to collect information about your activities on the Twitch Services websites and/or the advertisements you have clicked on.
This information may be used by them to serve advertisements that they believe are most likely to be of interest to you based on content you have viewed.
Third-party advertisers may also use this information to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements.</p>
<p>We do not control these cookies.
To disable or reject third-party cookies, please refer to the relevant third party’s website.
For Extensions in particular, we encourage you to visit an Extension’s detail pages to review any privacy policy posted by the relevant developer, which may include additional information on their cookie practices.
