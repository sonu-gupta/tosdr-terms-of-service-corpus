<br>Terms of Service GENERAL
<p>HideIPVPN.com (hereafter referenced as HideIPVPN) provides VPN services under the name of HideIPVPN.com.
As a provider of internet services, HideIPVPN offers its clients, and their customers and users, the means to disseminate public, private, commercial, and non-commercial information.</p>
<p>HideIPVPN respects the fact that the Internet provides a forum for free and open discussion and dissemination of information.
However, when there are competing interests at issue,&nbsp;HideIPVPN reserves the right to take certain preventative or corrective actions.
In order to protect these competing interests,&nbsp;HideIPVPN has developed these Terms Of Service, which supplements and explains certain terms of each customer’s respective service agreement.
These terms are intended as a guide to the customer’s rights and obligations when utilizing HideIPVPN’s services.</p>
<p>These terms will be revised from time to time.
