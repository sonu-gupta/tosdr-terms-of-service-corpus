         <strong>Traffic Authority Refund Policy</strong>
<p>Traffic Authority offers a 30-day satisfaction guarantee on all initial fees paid to the company.
All subsequent fees are nonrefundable.
When a refund is requested by an Affiliate the bonuses and commissions attributable to the refunded service will be deducted from the Affiliate who received bonuses or commissions on such sales.
Deductions will occur in the month in which the refund is given and continue every pay period thereafter until the commission is recovered.</p>
<p>Traffic that has already been used is not eligible to be refunded under any circumstance.
Only the unused portion of a traffic order can be refunded and the customer is responsible for pausing their own order in the event they decide to request a refund for their remaining traffic order balance.
Since traffic is allocated when a package is purchased, refunds will be subject to a cancellation fee of 20% of the package price.</p>
<p>To cancel your subscription or request a refund on your order, please submit a support ticket to https://smsinc.zendesk.com or email support@trafficauthority.net or phone our support center at (850) 745-2961</p>
