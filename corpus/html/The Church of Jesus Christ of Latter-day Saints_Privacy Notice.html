</ul> Privacy Notice (Updated 2021-04-06) <p>In this Notice, we, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and its entities, provide you with information about how we process your personal data.
When referring to "us" or "we" or "our" we mean the Church and Church entities.</p>
<p>
<strong>1.
Who controls your personal data?</strong>
</p>
<p>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints acts through its representatives and Church entities when we process your personal data.
When you share personal data with us, you are sharing it with the Church through Church entities.</p>
<p>a.
The Church: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (the "<strong>Church</strong>") is a community of people who believe the same religious doctrine, practice the same religious rites and ordinances, and are governed by ecclesiastical principles.
Local units of the Church, such as wards, branches, stakes, districts, missions, and areas, are merely subdivisions of this community of believers and are not separate legal entities.
limited exceptions apply.</p>
<p>b.
Church entities: To satisfy temporal affairs needs and fulfill other purposes of the Church, a legal structure composed of various distinct legal entities assists the Church throughout the world.
These distinct legal entities (herein "<strong>Church entities</strong>") are legally separate from the Church.
One of those Church entities, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a Utah corporation sole, together with one or more other Church entities, processes your personal data as responsible joint data controllers.
Some Church entities may receive personal data as data processors to provide services to those Church entities that act as data controllers.
At your request, we will provide you with information as to which Church entities process your personal data.</p>
<p>
<strong>2.&nbsp.
What personal data do we collect?</strong>
</p>
<p>We collect personal data that (a) you actively submit to us, (b) we record, and (c) we obtain from third parties.
We may process your personal data with or without automatic means, including collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, analysis, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction of your personal data.</p>
<p>a.&nbsp.
Actively submitted data.
You submit personal data to us when you join the Church, seek Church ordinances, request Church materials, request access to Church tools or services, or engage in other interactions or communications with the Church.
When you interact with the Church, we generally process name, birth date, birthplace, telephone number, email address, physical address, photo, gender, donation/payment information, and so on.
You may provide us with additional information to participate at your own initiative in surveys, contests, or other activities or events, including when you participate in video or audio recordings, such as when using video conferencing technology.
Participation in surveys, contests, and similar activities is optional.
If you do not wish to participate in, or provide personal data in connection with, such activities, this will not affect your membership status or ability to use available Church tools or services.
In each such case you will know what personal data you provide to us because you actively and voluntarily submit the data.</p>
<p>b.
Data we obtain from third parties and passively submitted data.
When local law permits, you may submit personal data, including contact information about someone other than yourself (in other words, a third party) to allow us to make contact with that person, make a delivery, or otherwise meet your request.
When providing personal data about anyone other than yourself, you must first obtain the other person’s informed consent if his or her consent is legally required.</p>
<p>If you or someone else has provided us with your personal contact information and you would like to request that we do not contact you further, please follow the unsubscribe or opt-out procedures provided on the specific site, newsletter or email notification, or please contact us at DataPrivacyOfficer@ChurchofJesusChrist.org.</p>
<p>We may process and make publicly available personal data obtained from published sources.
We may process and publish living information in compliance with applicable local laws.</p>
<p>Your location-based information may be collected by some mobile applications for the purpose of helping you find the nearest temple or meetinghouse location or for a similar reason.
You can edit the settings on your device to opt out of location-based services.</p>
<p>When you visit any of our resources, our servers (using log files or filtering systems) may collect information that your web browser sends any time you visit a website.
This information may include but is not limited to your Internet Protocol address (IP address), browser type, operating system, language preference, any referring web page you were visiting before you came to our site, the date and time of each visitor request, information you search for on our resources, and other information collected by cookies or similar technologies.
&nbsp;Please refer to the Cookie Preferences tool (“Cookies Tool”) posted on each of our mobile applications and websites to learn more about cookies, including the types of cookies and to specify which cookies we use.

For what purposes do we process personal data?</strong>
</p>
<p>We process personal data for ecclesiastical, genealogy, humanitarian, social welfare, missionary, teaching, and other operational and administrative purposes.</p>

In this context, the legal basis for our processing of your personal data is either the necessity to perform contractual and other obligations that we have towards you or carrying out of our legitimate activities as a church.</p>
<p>We may also use your data to comply with applicable laws and exercise legal rights as the basis for our data processing.</p>
