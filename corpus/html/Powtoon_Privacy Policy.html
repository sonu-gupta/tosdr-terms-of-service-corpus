<ol>
<li>The European Union;</li>
<li>Israel – which has been granted an adequacy decision by the European Commission, meaning that its data privacy legislation is considered to provide an equivalent level of protection to personal data as provided within the European Union and thus data transfers to Israel do not require an additional transfer mechanisms;</li>

<ol>
<li>We believe that, under the specific circumstances, releasing such personal information will be appropriate in order to comply with any European Union or Member State law applicable to us;</li>

Data Protection <p>Powtoon operates a rigorous information security management system and protects data according to industry best practices.
We have implemented, and work to constantly improve, a wide array of processes, procedures, and technical controls such as encryption, firewalls, and segregation of networks.
All this is done to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all our users' data.</p> &nbsp.
Privacy of Children Compliance <p>We are proud that Powtoon is a tool widely used in schools by children of all ages.
As such, we are committed to safeguarding each child’s personal information, in compliance with but not limited to the following laws and regulations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</li>
<li>The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)</li>
<li>The New York State Education Law 2-d</li>
</ul> Student accounts <p>To protect children's privacy, their accounts are labeled internally at Powtoon as <em>student accounts</em> and are subject to all the requirements of the above laws.
Specifically, with regards to personal information, our approach is to not collect or store personal information belonging to children that created a student account.</p>
<p>Student accounts are created when children sign up for our service in one of the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>By using their clever.com account</li>
<li>By accepting an invitation from a teacher to join a Powtoon classroom group</li>
<li>By signing up on our dedicated student signup page</li>
<li>By signing up on our dedicated education signup page and choosing the student option in the signup form</li>
<li>By accessing Powtoon through their school's learning management system (for example: Canvas)</li>
</ul> No commercial use of data <p>Student account data is used exclusively to deliver Powtoon's services.
No commercial use of student data is made.</p> Communications <p>To student accounts with email addresses (Google G Suite for Education), Powtoon will send only transactional emails that provide notification for events such as the completion of a video rendering process.</p>
<p>All transactional notifications from Powtoon to student account holders without email addresses take the form of on-site notifications.
Powtoon refrains from sending any marketing or other non-transactional email messages to student account holders.</p> Access to content created in student accounts <p>Videos and presentations created by student account holders and which are published for viewing on the Powtoon platform, are published in private mode by default.
These videos and presentations are not added to the Powtoon site map and not made available for indexing by search engines.</p> Google G Suite accounts for education <p>Many schools use Google G Suite for Education to issue "school use only" Google accounts to their students.
These students may use their Google account to sign up for Powtoon on the education signup page.
Powtoon will protect such accounts from disclosure and will use the email address associated with such accounts only for sending transactional email messages.</p> Data breach prevention and response plan <p>Data of children is, like all other data Powtoon controls, safeguarded according to industry standards and best practices.
For more details, see Data Protection above.
Furthermore, we make every reasonable effort to prevent data breaches and have a documented security incident management policy and procedure.</p>
<p>As we do not collect personal information from students, the risk of personal student information being extracted from our system is very low.
If you want to be informed in the event of a data breach that affects student account data, you can register your institution to our breach notification list by emailing edu-privacy@powtoon.com with the subject line "registration to breach notification list".
In this email, please include the name of your institution, your name and role, together with your contact information.
In the unlikely event that such a breach will occur, we will inform all registered institutions within 72 hours of detecting the breach.</p> &nbsp.
