These third-party services use the kinds of technology described in the preceding sections to help us analyze how users use the Services, including by noting the URL that users visited before they came to our Services.
These service providers will receive or directly collect the information collected by the technology, which they will use to evaluate your use of the Services.
As described in the following paragraphs, we also use Google Analytics with the Services for certain purposes related to online marketing.
You may wish to install the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on, available at: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout, &nbsp;to prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics.</p>
<p>We also allow other third parties, such as Google Analytics, Facebook and other ad networks and ad servers, to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use the Services.
These tracking technologies enable these third parties to serve our tailored marketing to you while viewing other areas of the Internet, based on anonymous information collected while you are using the Services.
We have implemented the following Google Analytics advertising features based on interests and location for the purposes of remarketing: retargeting and enhanced demographic tracking, including affinity audiences, custom affinity audiences, in-market audiences, similar audiences, demographic and location targeting, and demographics and interest reports.
The parties that provide these technologies may offer you a way to opt out of targeted marketing as described below.

<strong>Exercising access, data portability and deletion rights</strong>

We will deliver our written responses to these requests either by mail or electronically, at your option.
The response may also explain the reason we cannot comply with the request.&nbsp;</p> Additional California disclosures <p>California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser Do Not Track (DNT) signals.
Because there currently isn’t an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we don’t respond to them at this time.
We await the result of work by the privacy community and industry to determine when such a response is appropriate and what form it should take.</p>

<strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - European Representative</strong>
</p>
<p>Pursuant to Article 27 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),&nbsp;Matterport has appointed European Data Protection Office (EDPO) as its GDPR representative in the EU.
You can contact EDPO regarding matters pertaining to the GDPR by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using EDPO’s online request form:&nbsp;https://edpo.com/gdpr-data-request/&nbsp;</li>
<li>Writing to EDPO at Avenue Huart Hamoir 71, 1030 Brussels, Belgium</li>
</ul> Automated decision-making and profiling <p>Automated decision making refers to a decision that is taken solely on the basis of automated processing of your personal data, for example using software, artificial intelligence or other rating or scoring algorithms.
Profiling uses automated processing which sometimes results in automated decision making, and in some cases does not.</p>
<p>When you sign up to use the Services, we may use certain personal information, for example your first name, last name, address and IP address to verify you are eligible to use the Services and to restrict your access if you are not, for example if you are resident in a country or region that is subject to a U.S.
government embargo.
We will also restrict access by use of &nbsp;automated decision-making and profiling to anyone on or, directly or indirectly, owned, in whole or part, by any person or persons on the U.S.
Treasury Department’s List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons or any other U.S.
government list of parties with respect to transactions that are forbidden or restricted.</p>
<p>You have the right to not be subject to decision making which is solely based on automated processing and profiling, but only when that decision results in legal effects or otherwise significantly affects you.
If you believe we have incorrectly made a decision based on automated decision-making and profiling, please contact us using the information in the ‘Contacting us’ section of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Your right not to be subject to automated decision making and profiling does not apply if the decision was necessary for entering into or performing a contract with you or is authorized by law and there are suitable safeguards for your rights and freedoms.
However, in these situations, you can still obtain human intervention in the decision-making process and will make sure there are methods in place for you to express your point of view.</p> How do we secure your personal information? <p>We take steps to help protect your data, including your personal information.
The steps include protecting this data against accidental loss, unauthorized use, disclosure, and restricting access to personal information by our staff.
The Service is hosted by a third-party hosting company that we have determined maintains various security controls and utilizes TLS encryption for all internet communication with the Service.
We also require all staff that administer and develop the service follow a series of controls, including strong passwords, the use of anti-virus and anti-malware software, disk encryption and other practices.</p>
<p>We use various 3rd party processors to enable us to provide the Service, and as part of our vendor due-diligence, we review the security controls these processors have in place for appropriateness in relation to the type of data we collect.</p>
<p>You should keep in mind, however, that the Service utilizes software, hardware, and networks, which from time to time require maintenance and experience problems beyond our control.
Note that no data transmission over the public internet or encryption method can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you provide to us.
You transmit information to us at your own risk.</p> How long do you retain personal information? <p>Unless otherwise specifically stated elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, we will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.&nbsp;</p> What is our policy on deletion of personal information? <p>Customers can request through support to delete the personal (PII) data at any time.
To exercise the access and deletion rights described above, the account owner should submit a verifiable consumer request to us using the information in the ‘Contact us’ section.</p> Rights to access <p>You may correct or update information collected about you by contacting Matterport at the email or mailing address noted below.
We will use commercially reasonable efforts to correct or update our records.
For our records, we may retain original and updated information for reasons such as technical constraints, dispute resolution, troubleshooting, and agreement enforcement.</p>
<p>You have the right to access personal information about you.
We may request a fee to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you, as permitted by law.
We may decline to process requests that are frivolous, vexatious, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or not otherwise required by local law.</p>
<strong>Links to third-party websites, apps or services?</strong>
<p>This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of personal information collected from you by Matterport.
You should be aware that when you are using the Services, you may also use or be directed to other websites, applications or services of third parties that are beyond our control, and Matterport is not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties or the content of their websites, applications or services.
We encourage you to read the posted privacy policy whenever interacting with any third party website, application or service.</p>
<strong>Updates to this Policy</strong>
<p>We may occasionally update this Policy.
When we do, we will also revise the “last updated” date at the beginning of the Policy.
Your continued use of our Service after such changes will be subject to the then-current policy.
If we change this Policy in a manner that is material, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you via the contact methods you have provided of the change prior to applying the change to any personal information that we collected from you prior to the date the change becomes effective.
We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about how we collect, use, and disclose personal information.</p>
<strong>What is our policy on children users of the Services?</strong>
<p>We do not knowingly collect or maintain personal information from persons under 16 years old.
Our Services are intended for use by a general audience, and no part of our Services is directed to children under 16.
If Matterport learns that personal information of children less than 16 years old has been collected without verifiable parental consent, then Matterport will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.
If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under the age of 16 has obtained an account on the Services or otherwise provided us with personal information without your consent, then you may alert Matterport at the address below and request that we delete that child’s personal information from our systems.</p>
