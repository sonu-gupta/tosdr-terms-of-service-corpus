If you purchase a lifetime full Software license, you are granted one user license to use the Software on one computer.
You should use Software for any legal purpose.
The usage of Software with lifetime license has no time limitation, but the period of free updates may be limited to three years after the first use of product key (serial number).
Note that the paid updates term is not enforced, and users still update IDM freely at the moment.
Otherwise, If you purchase one-year full Software license, you are granted one user license to use the Software on one computer during one year after the first use of product key (serial number).
You should use Software for any legal purpose.
The usage of Software with one-year license has one year time limitation.
It means that Software stops working in one year and asks for another license, unless the license is extended for another year by paying one-year license fee again.
The period of free updates is limited only by the expiration time of one-year license.
