</ol> Privacy notice <p>GOV.UK (or www.gov.uk) is provided by the Government Digital Service (<abbr>GDS</abbr>), part of the Cabinet Office.</p>
<p>Cabinet Office is the data controller for pages starting with www.gov.uk - for example, www.gov.uk/pip.</p>
<p>If you follow a link to a service provided by another government department, agency or local authority, that organisation will:</p>
<ul>
<li>be the data controller</li>
<li>be responsible for processing any data you share with them</li>
<li>publish and manage their own privacy notice with details of how to contact them</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Example</strong>
</p>
<p>If you make a claim for Universal Credit www.universal-credit.service.gov.uk, the Department for Work and Pensions will be the responsible controller.
The service’s own privacy notice will apply.</p>
