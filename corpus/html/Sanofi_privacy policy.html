<ul>
<li>
<strong>your prior consent: </strong> where you have clearly expressed your approval of SANOFI’s processing of your Personal Data.
In practice, this will generally mean that SANOFI will ask you to sign a document, or to fill-in an online “opt-in” form or to follow any relevant procedure to allow you to be fully informed and then either clearly accept or refuse the data processing envisaged.
</li>
<li>
<strong>a contractual relationship</strong> between you and SANOFI: in such case, the processing of your Personal Data is generally necessary to the execution or the performance of the contract.
this means that if you do not wish SANOFI to process your Personal Data in that context, SANOFI may or will be obliged to refuse to enter into such contract with you or will not be able to provide the products or services covered in this contract.</li>
<li>
<strong>legal obligations </strong>applicable to SANOFI’s activities.
for instance, SANOFI is required to implement pharmacovigilance procedures to monitor adverse effects of marketed products, which generally involves the collection and retention of Personal Data.
</li>
<li>
<strong>the “legitimate interest” </strong>of SANOFI in the sense of applicable data protection law.
In such a case, SANOFI shall consider your fundamental rights and interests in determining whether the processing is legitimate and lawful.

Where does the Personal Data come from? SANOFI will always collect Personal Data from trusted sources <p>SANOFI may collect your Personal Data from different sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Data that you communicate to us </strong>through various media, through registrations, applications surveys or direct and indirect interactions with SANOFI.
For example, data you provide to register to scientific events sponsored by SANOFI, to submit an online application, to send us a request for information, etc.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Data that we collect automatically,</strong> for instance when following your interactions with our websites, platforms, applications and services through certain technologies, such as cookies.</li>
<li>
<strong>Data that we collect in accordance with applicable law from public sources available,</strong> including data that is published by you in all supports.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Data that we obtain legally from third parties,</strong> for example, when we may need to confirm contact or financial information or to verify licensure of healthcare professionals.
In such case, we generally receive such Personal Data from third-parties that are authorized to do so in the framework of their own privacy and data protection policies or in accordance with the law.
As applicable, we will inform you in the Privacy Notice of the identity of those third-parties and will invite you to refer to their privacy and data protection policies to inquire on the origin of such Personal Data and the condition of their collection.

Where Personal Data may be transferred: SANOFI will ensure that transfers of your Personal Data outside EU are safeguarded

For that reason, SANOFI may need to transfer (via access, visualization, storage..) your Personal Data in other jurisdictions, including from the European Economic Area to outside the European Economic Area, in countries which may not be regarded as providing the same level of protection as the jurisdiction you are based in.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Safeguards for international transfers of Personal Data:</strong> In cases where SANOFI needs to transfer Personal Data outside the European Union, it shall ensure that adequate safeguards, as required under applicable data protection legislation, will be implemented (including, notably, the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses, as applicable).
</p>
<p>In this respect and in particular, for intra-group transfers of Personal Data implemented for clinical studies and pharmacovigilance purposes, SANOFI has implemented and shall apply its “Binding Corporate Rules” validated by the EU Data Protection Authorities.</p>
How secure: SANOFI will implement security measures to protect your Personal Data
<p>We have implemented a variety of technological and organizational procedures and measures to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use and disclosure.
These measures shall take into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons.</p>
<p>For instance, we store your Personal Data on servers that have various types of technical and physical access controls, which may include, for instance, if appropriate, encryption.
We may also aggregate, pseudonymize or anonymize Personal Data to ensure that no personally identifiable information is communicated to third parties.
</p>
How long: we will retain your Personal Data for no longer than necessary
<p>SANOFI will retain your Personal Data only for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy.
</p>

<li>

<li>
<strong>to receive your Personal Data for transmission</strong> from SANOFI to a third-party or to have your Personal Data directly transferred by SANOFI to the third-party of your choice, where technically feasible (data portability right allowed only where the processing is based on your consent) </li>
</ul>
<p>If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us as described in the “How to Contact Us” section below and we will take necessary steps to respond as soon as possible.
