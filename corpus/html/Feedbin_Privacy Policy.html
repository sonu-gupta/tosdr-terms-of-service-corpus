<ul>
<li>
<strong>Feed data</strong>: Feedbin is an RSS reader, so its primary purpose is to keep track of the things you are subscribed to.
Feedbin also keeps track of which articles you have and have not read so it can display the read/unread status of articles.
If you star an article, Feedbin saves that too.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Email address</strong>: When you sign up, Feedbin asks for your email address and password.
Providing an email address will result in the best experience.
Things like password resets and email receipts depend on a valid email address.
However if you would prefer not to provide an email address, then you don't have to.</li>
<li>
<strong>Password</strong>: Your password is stored as a bcrypt hash.
It's an industry standard for storing passwords.
It means that even in the event that someone did obtain the bcrypt value, it would be very hard to derive your actual password from it.</li>
<li>
<strong>Billing information</strong>: If you choose to subscribe, your billing information is sent directly to Stripe, a leading online payments platform.
Billing information is not stored by Feedbin for your security.
