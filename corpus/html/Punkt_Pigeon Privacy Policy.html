</ul> Punkt has always made it a key priority to protect the privacy of its Users.<p>This document was drawn up in accordance with article 13 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (hereinafter “Regulation”), for users (hereinafter “Users” or “User”) of the products and services owned by <strong>Punkt Tronics AG</strong> VAT ID CHE-114.634.022 IVA, Reg.

CH-501.3.011.937-5, with registered office in Via Losanna 4, 6900 Lugano, Switzerland, in its capacity as <strong>Controller</strong> of the personal data (hereinafter “Controller”).</p>
<p>This document will explain how your personal information is managed when you use the Pigeon Application created specially for the MP02 telephone, and, if necessary, to enable you to give your express, informed consent to your personal data being processed for other apps or functions that require access and interaction.</p>
<p>Specific information is provided in the various sections of the website www.punkt.ch pursuant to article 13 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 which you will have to review before providing the data requested.</p>
<p>The information and data that you provide or that is otherwise acquired when using the various punkt.ch services will be processed in accordance with the principles of lawfulness, fairness, transparency, purpose limitation and storage limitation, data minimisation, accuracy, integrity and confidentiality.<br>&nbsp;</p>1.
The personal data that will be processed<p>The personal data is collected in order to distribute, maintain and update the Pigeon application.</p>
<p>Even though the entire focus of the MP02 telephone has always been to protect the privacy and personal domain of the User, Pigeon is an application specifically developed to permit the phone to interact with Signal, an instant messaging application where the contents of communications are end-to-end encrypted.</p>
<p>The end-to-end encryption of the data means that communications connected to the Signal account cannot be decoded by the platform managers and information that has to be shared for technical standpoint purposes is also used to the minimum extent possible, with said use informed by the principles of proportionality and necessity.</p>
<p>Communications are designed to be kept confidential throughout their entire life cycle in the MP02 – Pigeon – Signal circuit.</p>
<p>The MP02 phone encrypts data in the device, Pigeon maintains the security and integrity of the data during transmission and the Signal system provides end-to-end encryption.
This system allows the user to exchange synchronous and asynchronous confidential communication safely while always maintaining their own privacy and the privacy of others.</p>
<p>Pigeon makes the MP02 phone compatible with the Signal secure communication system.
By giving permission when you register, you give Pigeon permission to access your MP02 Contacts list, use and record audio, view SMS messages, access photos/media/files and make/manage phone calls.
You may also deny permission.
However, the permission is requested to enable certain features from Pigeon to Signal such as finding contacts, reading, receiving and sending messages, and making calls through secure end-to-end encryption communication on Pigeon.</p>
<p>The information and personal data processed to <strong>download and install </strong>the basic functions of Pigeon are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>browsing and usage data generated by the device when it interacts with the Punkt infrastructure that can be accessed through the Internet.
This concerns information that is not collected to be associated with specific data subjects, but which, by its very nature, could allow users to be identified through processing and association with data held by third parties.
IP addresses belong to this category, along with the addresses in URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) notation of the resources requested, the time of the request, the method used when submitting the request to the server, the size of the file obtained in response, the numerical code indicating the status of the data response from the server (successful, error, etc.) and other parameters relating to the operating system of the telephone and the User’s ICT environment.
This data is generally only used to obtain anonymous statistical information on the use of the resources that can be accessed, to ensure that it works properly and to identify any anomalies and/or abuse.
The data may also be used to ascertain responsibility in the event of computer offences.</li>
</ul>
<p>The optional information and personal data that can be processed for Pigeon to work at an <strong>advanced level</strong> are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal contact data such as name, surname and email address which are needed to receive notifications and respond to any faults in the application;</li>

</ul>
<p>In any case, the Controller can always be asked to clarify the legal basis behind any processing that is carried out on his or her data.</p>
<p>The User will always have the option to decide whether or not to provide his or her personal data, but it has to be given to ensure access to certain services such as downloading the application or assistance if any faults arise.
Any refusal, even though legitimate, to provide the data required in whole or in part, may make it impossible for Punkt to provide the services requested on a standard basis.</p>4.

These employees and business partners shall be authorised in accordance with article 29 of the GDPR for the sole purpose of performing the activities strictly related to achieving the purposes declared in paragraph 2 above.</p>
