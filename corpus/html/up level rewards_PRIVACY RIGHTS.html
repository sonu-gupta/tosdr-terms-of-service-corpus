<p>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>While we have endeavored to create a secure

risks associated with Information.
Given the nature of the Internet, your

In compliance with applicable federal

we learn of an information security breach of your Information.

the collection, use, disclosure, and sale of their information under the CCPA.
One of these rights, notice of collection of Information, is described above.

rights:</p>

<p>
<b>Exercising Your Rights, Verification, and
Timing.</b>&nbsp;To exercise your
CCPA rights, click on the “Do Not Sell MyPersonal Info” link on the bottom
of the Website page where we collect Information, or send an email to&nbsp;help@myprivacyrequest.com.
To prevent an unauthorized third party from
accessing or making decisions regarding a user’s Information, we verify all
requests to exercise these rights (a verifiable consumer request).
We do not
charge a fee to process or respond to a verifiable consumer request unless it
is excessive, repetitive, unfounded, or abusive.</p>
<p>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>In general, we will verify a request by
matching the identifying information supplied by the user with the Information
we already have for the user.
If we cannot verify the user using the foregoing
method, we may request additional information, which we will not retain or use
for any other purpose.</p>
<p>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>For all verifiable consumer requests, we
strive to respond within forty-five (45) days of receipt.
If we require
additional time, which can be up to ninety (90) days in the aggregate, we will
provide written notice.
Any disclosures we provide will cover only the 12-month
period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt and will be
delivered electronically in a secure fashion.
If, for some reason, we cannot
fulfill or comply with your request, our response will explain that
decision.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>
<b>Disclosure of Information Collected and Sold.</b>&nbsp;While users have the right to request
different levels of disclosure regarding the collection, use, disclosure, and
sale of Information, we have elected to treat all requests from California
residents as an exercise of expanded disclosure requests by businesses that
sell Information.
Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request,
we will disclose to you for the 12 months prior to your request:</p>
<p>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>The categories and sources of Information collected;</li>
<li>Our business and commercial purposes for collecting and selling that Information;</li>
<li>The categories of third parties with whom we shared that Information;</li>
<li>The specific pieces of Information collected;</li>
<li>If we sold or disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, we will disclose:</li>
<li>For sales - the Information categories for each category sold and the categories of third parties to whom the Information was sold.

the scope of our agreement with them, if a California user opts-out, we will
notify all third parties to whom we have sold or disclosed the California
user’s Information within the previous 90 days and remind them not to further
sell the Information.
We will not ask a California user who has opted out to
re-opt-in for one year after the California user opts-out.
If the user requests
a transaction with us that requires the sale of their Information, we will
inform them that they have opted out and if they want to proceed with the
transaction, we will offer the opportunity to opt-in by completing a two-step
process.</p>
