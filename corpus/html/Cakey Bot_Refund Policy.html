<p>This Refund Policy describes our policies regarding the handling of refunds in general and does not serve as a legal base, neither is it approved by professionals.

</li>
<li>
<p>Any situation in which you have not successfully received or are unable to access premium perks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By user request if the request is made within the first week of making the purchase.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All of the reasons above require viable proof in order to be accepted as possible inquires for the initiation of a refund.</p>

Important Notes
<p>In order to successfully come to an agreement please remember to behave, be patient and remain pleasant.</p>
<p>
<strong>Performing a chargeback on behalf of the payment processor your transaction was handled through will not work out in your favor! In most situations we are able to fight such cases in order to remain with our right.
Without prior contact to the team behind Cakey Bot you might end up being excluded from the usage of our services indefinitely.</strong>
</p>
<p>When staying friendly and courteous you might end up being served with a refund regardless of the non-application of stated above points.</p>
