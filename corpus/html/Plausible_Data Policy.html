         Plausible: GDPR, CCPA and cookie law compliant site analytics <p>Even though the purpose of Plausible Analytics is to track the usage of a website, this can still be done without collecting any personal data or personally identifiable information (PII), without using cookies and while respecting the privacy of the website visitors.</p>
<p>Here’s a closer look at our data policy, the information that we do collect, what we use it for and steps we’ve taken to comply with the cookie law and the privacy regulations such as the GDPR, CCPA and PECR.</p>
<ol>
<li>First thing first: What we collect and what we use it for</li>
<li>How we count unique users without cookies</li>
<li>Hosted in the EU powered by European-owned cloud infrastructure</li>
<li>Data ownership of your web analytics</li>
<li>Why should I trust you?</li>
<li>GDPR, CCPA and PECR compliant web analytics</li>
</ol> First thing first: What we collect and what we use it for <p>We do not track people across their devices and across websites and apps that they visit.
All the data is isolated to a single day, single website and single device only.
There is no way to know whether the same person visits a site from more than one device or visits another website.
See here the full list of what makes Plausible a privacy-first web analytics tool.</p>
<p>The goal of Plausible is to track overall trends in your website traffic, it is not to track individual visitors.
We don’t use cookies, we don’t generate any persistent identifiers and we don’t collect or store any personal or identifiable data.
All of the data is aggregated data only and it has no personal information.</p>
<p>By using Plausible Analytics, all the site measurement is carried out absolutely anonymously.
We measure only the most essential data points and nothing else.
All the metrics we do collect fit on one single page.
Here is the complete list of what we collect and store about your website visitors:</p> Data point Example Comment <strong>Page URL</strong>
<em>https://yoursite.com/pricing</em> We track the page URL of each page view on your website.
We use this to show you which pages have been viewed and how many times a particular page has been viewed.
<br>
<br>The hostname and path are collected.
Query parameters are discarded, except for these special query parameters: <code>ref=</code>, <code>source=</code>, <code>utm_source=</code>, <code>utm_medium=</code> and <code>utm_campaign=</code>.
<strong>HTTP Referer</strong>
<em>https://facebook.com</em> We use the referrer string to show you the number of visitors referred to your website from links on other sites.
<strong>Browser</strong>
<em>Chrome 86.0</em> We use this to show you what browsers and browser version numbers people use when visiting your website.
This is derived from the User-Agent HTTP header.
The full User-Agent is discarded.
<strong>Operating system</strong>
<em>macOS 10.15</em> We use this to show you what operating systems people use when visiting your website.
We show the brand of the operating system and the version number.
This is derived from the User-Agent HTTP header.
The full User-Agent is discarded.
<strong>Device type</strong>
<em>Desktop</em> We use this to show you what devices people use when visiting your website.
This is derived from window.innerWidth.
The actual width of the browser in pixels is discarded.
<strong>Country, region, city</strong>
<em>United Kingdom, England, London</em> We look up the visitor’s location using their IP address.
We do not track anything more granular than the city level and the IP address of the visitor is discarded.
We never store IP addresses in our database or logs.
How we count unique users without cookies <p>Counting unique visitors is an integral part of web analytics.
Plausible attempts to strike a reasonable balance between de-duplicating pageviews and staying respectful of visitor privacy.</p>
<p>We do not attempt to generate a device-persistent identifier because they are considered personal data under GDPR.
We do not use cookies, browser cache nor the local storage.
We do not store, retrieve nor extract anything from visitor’s devices.</p>
<p>Every single HTTP request sends the IP address and the User-Agent to the server so that’s what we use.
We generate a daily changing identifier using the visitor’s IP address and User-Agent.
To anonymize these datapoints and make them impossible to relate back to the user, we run them through a hash function with a rotating salt.</p>
<code>hash(daily_salt + website_domain + ip_address + user_agent)
</code>
<p>This generates a random string of letters and numbers that is used to calculate unique visitor numbers for the day.
The raw data IP address and User-Agent are never stored in our logs, databases or anywhere on disk at all.</p>
<p>Old salts are deleted every 24 hours to avoid the possibility of linking visitor information from one day to the next.
Forgetting used salts also removes the possibility of the original IP addresses being revealed in a brute-force attack.
The raw IP address and User-Agent are rendered completely inaccessible to anyone, including ourselves.</p>
<p>In our testing, using IP addresses to count visitors is remarkably accurate when compared to using a cookie.
In some cases it might even be more accurate than using a cookie because some visitors block cookies altogether.</p>
<p>The biggest limitation with this approach is that we cannot do good retention analysis with Plausible.
We cannot show stats like <em>New vs Returning visitors</em> because they rely on having a persistent user identifier.</p>
<p>If the same visitor visits your site five times in one day we will show that as one unique visitor.
But if the same visitor visits your site on five different days in a month we would show that as five unique visitors.</p>
<p>We’re happy to provide information on how Plausible is built to help you comply with the different privacy regulations.
We encourage you to discuss specific issues with your lawyer to help you decide whether our service allows you to fulfill the legal requirements that apply to you.</p> Hosted in the EU powered by European-owned cloud infrastructure <p>We’re a small team based in the EU.
