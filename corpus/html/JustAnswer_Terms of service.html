The Website</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>5.
JustAnswer Is a Venue.
Third-Party Content</strong>
<br>The JustAnswer Site is a venue for informational and educational purposes, owned and operated by JustAnswer, that exists solely to broker relationships between Experts and potential Customers of those Experts who are interested in purchasing their Expert services.
JustAnswer is not in the business of providing or selling information or education that is within any Expert’s area of Expertise.
Users of the Site, not JustAnswer, provide the content in Posts (defined below).
The Experts determine which questions to answer.
Experts are not employees or agents of JustAnswer but are independent service providers using the Site to sell their Expert knowledge to Customers and, as such, together with Customers, are simply Users of the Site.</p>
<p>JustAnswer is not involved in the conversations between Customers and Experts and does not refer Customers to or endorse or recommend particular Experts.
You understand and acknowledge that JustAnswer cannot and does not edit, modify, filter, screen, monitor, endorse or guarantee the content of Posts.
JustAnswer shall not be liable for any acts or omissions of Experts, content in Posts or the ability of Experts to answer questions.
We cannot ensure that an Expert will complete a transaction.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, JustAnswer reserves the right, but is not obligated, to refuse to post or to remove any content and/or remove any User’s access to the Site.
</p>
<p>EMERGENCY QUESTIONS AND CRISIS SITUATIONS (particularly regarding medical or mental health issues) should not be directed to the Site and should, instead be directed immediately by telephone or in-person to qualified professionals (e.g.
in the U.S., call 911).
The Site is not the appropriate venue to deal with such situations.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>6.
Posts Are Not Private or Confidential.
Anonymity</strong>
<br>The Site is an Internet-based forum.
<strong>Information and materials submitted in the content of your questions, answers, requests for information, responses, profiles, signatures, qualifications, comments, and posts in the Expert Forum and other places where Users communicate on the Site (collectively "Posts") <em>is not private or confidential, nor is it protected by attorney-client, doctor-patient, or any other privilege, and it may be read, collected, and used by others.</em>
</strong> For example, search engines may index your questions, answers, and other Posts to allow them to appear in search engine results (e.g.
if someone does a search on google.com or another search engine, your questions, answers, and other Posts on JustAnswer.com that relate to the search may appear in the search results list).
<strong>To help protect your privacy, use an anonymous user name and do not include information regarding your identity or contact information in your Posts.</strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>7.
Verification.
No Reliance on the Term “Expert”</strong>
<br>Every Expert on the Site has had at least one credential relevant to the category in which they are answering questions verified by a third-party verification service, unless the Expert is answering questions in a category that is still being tested by JustAnswer in "Beta" (indicated by the "Beta" graphic after the category name on the category's landing page and/or the URL beginning with www.justanswer.com/...).
Details regarding the credential(s) verified for each verified Expert can be found by clicking the "What’s This" link next to the "Verified" logo associated with each Expert.
Other information about an Expert, not shown as verified, has been provided by the Expert but has not been verified.
Use of the term "Expert" by JustAnswer and on the Site is only meant to describe Users who answer questions on the Site, and not to guarantee any particular level of expertise of these Experts.</p>
<p>Regarding the verification process, JustAnswer contracts with third-party service providers to perform the verifications described above.
JustAnswer does not itself verify the credentials of the Experts.
The results of the verifications are only as accurate as the information provided to and by the third-party verification services, as of the time of the providing of information to and by the third-party verification services.
JustAnswer makes effort to verify, including using a third-party identity verification service, but cannot warrant or guarantee an Expert's purported identity.
user identification on the Internet is difficult.
For these reasons, JustAnswer cannot and does not represent, warrant or guarantee the truthfulness or accuracy of the credentials or identities of Users and information provided by Users including Experts.
You acknowledge that JustAnswer will not be liable for any loss or damages caused by your reliance on any information or content contained in Posts.</p>

By answering questions, Experts do not intend to form, and do not form attorney-client or doctor-patient relationships with Users of the Site.
The laws, regulations, other governing authorities, standards, practices and procedures that apply to your particular question may differ depending on your location and information typically discovered through in-person evaluations or visits.
Experts in some categories may be licensed, certified, educated, employed by or have experience in only particular jurisdictions.</p>
<p>

Charges, Rating the Expert, Refund and Cancellation Policy</strong>
<br>JustAnswer’s platform allows Customers to post questions to Experts in subject-matter categories, facilitates communication with Experts via chat, emails, and online message boards, and enables delivery of answers to your questions, among other services (“Site Access Benefits”).
Customers on the Site or may be presented with one of three payment models: (1) pay-per-question model.
(2) membership model.
and (3) additional services model (which is explained in Section E below).</p>
<p>
<strong>Pay-Per-Question.</strong> With the pay-per-question model, you select the price that you are willing to pay for the Site Access Benefits related to a single question.
Once you have selected the price and submitted your payment information, your question may be posted on JustAnswer.
Customers are charged in one of three ways depending on the payment source, as described on the payment page: (i) when the question is posted.
(ii) at the time an Expert responds to the Customer’s question.
or (iii) $5 upon the posting of a question, with the remainder charged at the time an Expert responds.</p>
<p>
<strong>Membership.</strong> Memberships allow Customers to receive Site Access Benefits for multiple questions on the Site for a monthly or other-period recurring fee.
Some Customers may also charged a one-time $1.00 sign-up fee if not participating in a trial membership.
Customers who elect to pay for memberships are hereinafter referred to as “Members.” The fee is automatically charged to the Member’s payment source provided on the Site and placed in the Customer Payment Pool (account of all Members’ payments).
JustAnswer will send at least one email notice of upcoming auto-renewal prior to auto-renewing your membership.
Auto-renewal will remain in effect until withdrawn by you or terminated by JustAnswer.
You can stop auto-renewal of your membership by (1) clicking the cancel membership button on either the help center page or your account’s membership page.

</p>
<p>
<strong>Rating the Expert.</strong> Experts typically respond to Customers’ questions quickly.
If the Expert requests further information before answering your question, you may wish to take advantage of the opportunity to provide more information to the Expert to allow the Expert to help you better.</p>
<p>Once the Expert answers your question, you will be asked to rate the Expert.
If you provide a rating of 1 or 2, you will be asked to provide the Expert with feedback about why you are unsatisfied, so the Expert may try to help you better.
By posting a question and clicking to retrieve your answer, you are authorizing JustAnswer to charge your payment source (for example, the credit card or PayPal account you provided to JustAnswer).
A portion of your payments may be paid to the Expert instead of to JustAnswer.</p>
<p>JustAnswer does not guarantee that you will receive a response from an Expert, or that you will be satisfied with your communication with an Expert.
For Pay-Per-Question Customers, in the rare instance that no Expert responds at all to your question, you agree that any amount up to $5 that was charged upon posting of your question may be retained by JustAnswer in consideration for the Site Access Benefits received.
See Refunds section below for information on requesting a refund.</p>
<p>

Dispute Resolution</strong>
<br>
<strong>If you are an Expert (as defined in the Expert Agreement) with a dispute, claim or controversy of any sort and of any nature (collectively, “dispute”) against JustAnswer in your capacity as an Expert, then the arbitration agreement in the Expert Agreement applies instead of this one.
If your dispute with JustAnswer is made in your capacity as User who is not an Expert, then the following dispute resolution provisions apply.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>This Section D.21 may be referred to as the parties’ “Dispute Resolution Agreement.” If you have a dispute with JustAnswer or if JustAnswer has a dispute with you and such dispute cannot be resolved informally, such dispute will be resolved on an individual basis in accordance with the provisions set forth below:</strong>
</p>
<p>(a)Informal Resolution.
Prior to initiating mediation or arbitration, the party with a grievance must:</p>
<p> (i) Notify the other party, in writing, of the facts of the dispute and all damages claimed.
Such a writing must be sent to the User’s email address on file with JustAnswer, or JustAnswer LLC, P.O.
Box 29045, San Francisco, CA 94129 or legal@justanswer.com, whichever is applicable (“Dispute Notification”).
</p>
<p>(ii) The party receiving the Dispute Notification has thirty (30) days from receipt of the Dispute Notification to respond.</p>
<p>(iii) The other party then has 15 days to reply to the response.</p>
<p> (b)Mediation..
If the dispute is not resolved informally, either party may make a demand for mediation, with the other party’s consent, by filing a: (i) Request for AAA Online Mediation for Claims under $10,000 with the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”).
or (ii) Request for Mediation with the AAA.
To file a request for mediation for a claim under $10,000, you must go to the following website: http://services.adr.org/eroom/faces/welcome_and_steps.jspx.
If that link does not work, please contact legal@justanswer.com at JustAnswer for updated information.
If you are requesting mediation for a claim that is worth $10,000 or more, you must go to the following website to file such a claim: https://www.adr.org/aaa/faces/services/disputeresolutionservices/.
If that link does not work, please contact legal@justanswer.com at JustAnswer for updated information.
If either party requests mediation and both parties consent to mediation, the costs of mediation will be borne equally by the parties.
</p>
<p>
<strong>(c) ARBITRATION.
ANY DISPUTE NOT RESOLVED INFORMALLY OR THROUGH MEDIATION SHALL BE RESOLVED BY FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION SO LONG AS SUCH DISPUTES ARISE IN ANY WAY OUT OF THESE TERMS, ANY TRANSACTION WITH JUSTANSWER, YOUR USE OF THE SITE AND/OR ANY JUSTANSWER SERVICE, OR ANY AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND JUSTANSWER.
THE ARBITRATION PROVISION EXTENDS TO DISPUTES UNDER THE TELEPHONE CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT (“TCPA”).
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT, BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, THAT THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTION AGREEMENT IS MADE IN THE COURSE OF INTERSTATE COMMERCE.
AND THAT THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT, 9 U.S.C.
§1 ET.
SEQ.
(THE “FAA”) AND NOT STATE LAW GOVERNS THE INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCMENT OF THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTION AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE ARBITRABILITY OF DISPUTES, WHICH SHALL BE DECIDED BY THE ARBITRATOR.
THIS CHOICE OF LAW PROVISION APPLIES ONLY TO THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTION AGREEMENT, AND NOT TO THE REST OF THIS AGREEMENT OR TERMS.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>YOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU AND JUSTANSWER ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY REGARDING ANY DISPUTE.
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE ARBITRATOR’S DECISION WILL BE BINDING AND MAY BE ENTERED AS A JUDGMENT IN ANY COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Arbitration Procedures:</strong> Disputes shall be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with the arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) pursuant to its Consumer Arbitration Rules, as modified by the terms in this Dispute Resolution Agreement.
Copies of these rules can be obtained at the AAA’s website (www.adr.org) or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.
Either party can initiate a demand for arbitration.
Each party will be responsible for its own costs, including paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules.
The award rendered by the arbitrator may include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses.
In the event of any inconsistency between this Dispute Resolution Agreement and the applicable rules of the AAA, this Dispute Resolution Agreement shall govern.</p>
<p>
<strong>Consent to Jurisdiction in California:</strong> The parties agree that the arbitration will be conducted in San Francisco, California unless you and JustAnswer agree otherwise.</p>
<p>
<strong>(d) CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
YOU AND JUSTANSWER EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT: </strong>
</p>
<p>(i)<strong> ANY ARBITRATION PROCEEDING WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.
</strong>
</p>
<p>(ii)<strong>YOU EXPRESSLY WAIVE YOUR ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, MASS, COLLECTIVE, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
</strong>
</p>
<p>(iii)<strong>THERE SHALL BE NO CLASS CLAIMS, CONSOLIDATION, OR JOINDER ALLOWED IN ANY ARBITRATION BETWEEN THE PARTIES.
(iv) IF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IS FOUND INAPPLICABLE TO YOUR DISPUTE WITH JUSTANSWER, THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER WILL CONTINUE TO APPLY IN LITIGATION.
AND (v) YOU AGREE THAT THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF OUR CONTRACT AND THESE TERMS AND THAT IT MAY NOT BE SEVERED.
THE ARBITRATOR SHALL NOT CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS OF DIFFERENT USERS INTO ONE PROCEEDING, NOR SHALL THE ARBITRATOR HAVE THE POWER TO HEAR ARBITRATION AS A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.
SIMILARLY, ANY CLAIMS COVERED BY THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTION AGREEMENT THAT JUSTANSWER MAY HAVE AGAINST USER MAY NOT BE BROUGHT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION PROCEEDING.
</strong>
</p>
<p>(e) Survivability.

Agreement.
Assignment.
Miscellaneous</strong>
<br>The Terms constitute the complete and exclusive statement of the Agreement between you and us on the subject matter addressed herein.
It supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous agreement, oral or written, and any other communications, representations, warranties and understanding relating to the subject matter of the Terms.
For those Users who have become Experts, nothing in this Agreement supersedes the terms of the Expert Agreement, and in the event of a conflict between this Agreement (or later versions of this Agreement) and the Expert Agreement, the terms of the Expert Agreement shall prevail.
If there is a conflict between an oral or written representation of any JustAnswer employee or agent and the Terms (other than modifications to the Terms executed in writing by the CEO or authorized-in-fact representative of JustAnswer), the Terms will prevail.
To the extent the Terms are in conflict or inconsistent with one another, this Agreement and the Privacy Policy will prevail over other Terms of the Site.
also, this Agreement, the Privacy Policy, and disclaimers will prevail over FAQs, and other rules and policies on the Site.
If any provision(s) of the Terms is held by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, then such provision(s) shall be construed, as nearly as possible, to reflect the intentions of the parties and the other provisions shall remain in full force and effect.
JustAnswer’s failure to exercise or enforce any of the Terms shall not constitute a waiver of JustAnswer’s right to exercise or enforce the Terms as to the same or another instance.
Headings in this Agreement are for purposes of reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning of the Terms.</p>
<p>You agree that JustAnswer may assign the Terms to any other entity of its choosing, with or without notice to you.
You may not assign the Terms to any other party for any reason, including, but not limited to, because your interaction with other users of the Site, the pricing offered, and fraud mechanisms in place, are based upon individual usage.
JustAnswer shall not be deemed to have waived any of its rights or remedies unless such waiver is in writing and signed by an officer of JustAnswer.
No delay or omission on the part of JustAnswer in exercising any rights or remedies shall operate as a waiver of such rights or remedies or any other rights or remedies on future occasions.
The section titles in the Terms are solely used for the convenience of the parties and have no legal or contractual significance.</p>
<p>This Section, along with Sections 6, 10 (with respect to amounts remaining in your account as of termination), 11, 13, 16, 17, 18, 20, and 21 above will survive any termination of this Agreement.</p>

<strong>E.
Additional Services</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>You may be presented with an offer for services outside of the Site’s standard question-and-answer platform (“Additional Services”).</strong>
</p>
<p>JustAnswer is only a venue which facilitates communication between Experts and potential Users of Additional Services.
It does not provide any of the substance or content of any Additional Service initiated through JustAnswer’s platform.</p>
<p>
<strong>JustAnswer will in no way be liable for any acts or omissions of Experts in performing Additional Services (or any services) for you.</strong>
</p>
<p>Additional Services may be: (1) “Information Only;” or (2) “Beyond Information Only.” “Information Only” Additional Services are those additional services outside the Site’s standard question-and-answer platform and may be conducted off the Site (either by phone, chat, email, remote desktop or any other third-party tool) but remain for general informational services only.
Additional Services that are “Beyond Information Only” facilitate Users’ exchange of services that are more than informational and that could potentially evolve into a professional relationship.</p>
<p>Charges for Additional Services will be described in the particular offer.
Any amounts a Customer pays for Additional Services are divided into two distinct and equal parts: (i) JustAnswer’s fee for enabling the request, offer and/or fulfillment of Additional Services and related services (“Additional Site Access Benefits”).
and (ii) the Expert’s fee for the specific Additional Service provided to the User.
By accepting these Terms of Service, Experts agree that any charges to Customers for Additional Services will be divided into these two distinct and equal parts.
JustAnswer does not share in any Expert’s fee.
JustAnswer’s payment structures take into consideration fee sharing restrictions under various professional ethics rules.
Once you accept an offer for Additional Services, your payment method on file, if any, will be automatically charged the Additional Services amount.
If you have already asked a question, received a response and have not yet rated the Expert, if you then proceed to accept such Expert’s offer of Additional Services, you will be deemed to have accepted the response as if you had given such Expert a “5” rating (See Section 9, Rating the Expert, above).</p>
<p>
<strong>23.
Special Provisions Relating to Remote Desktop Users</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>If you agree to accept Remote Desktop services (whether such services are Information Only or Beyond Information Only) from an Expert, you understand and agree that by accepting such offer for services, you are agreeing to give the Expert full access to and control over your computer (including permission to download and use software on your computer, gather system data, modify settings, etc.) for computer diagnosis, service and repair.
You agree that any third-party software acquired, installed or used during the Remote Desktop session, by you or by the Expert, will be licensed to you, and that any terms of use relating to the third-party software are agreed to by you, that JustAnswer may record via video the Remote Desktop Session for internal purposes, and that you will not use the Expert’s services to do anything unlawful.</strong>

Additional Services that are “Beyond Information Only” in the Legal, Medical, Accounting, Health, Pet, and Large Animal categories facilitate Legal, Medical, Accounting, Health, Pet, and Large Animal Category Users’ exchange of services that are more than informational and that could potentially evolve into a professional relationship.</p>
<p>
<strong>Information Only Premium Services:</strong>
</p>
<p>If you decide to accept Information Only Additional Services, you understand that by receiving such Additional Services, you are agreeing to the following terms and conditions:</p>
<p>a.
Any Information Only Additional Services you receive from a legal, tax, medical or veterinary professional are for general informational purposes only.</p>
<p>b.
The legal, tax, medical or veterinary professional from whom you are receiving Information Only Additional Services is not acting as your attorney, tax advisor, doctor or veterinarian.</p>
<p>c.
The legal, tax, medical or veterinary professional from whom you are receiving Information Only Additional Services may not be licensed in the jurisdiction where you are located.</p>
<p>d.
The Information Only Additional Services are not subject to an attorney-client/ accountant-client/doctor-patient relationship or attorney-client/ accountant-client/doctor-patient privilege.
Before applying the Information Only Additional Services to your specific situation, you should consult with a professional licensed to practice in your jurisdiction.</p>
<p>
<strong>Beyond Information Only Additional Services</strong>
</p>
<p>If you decide to accept Beyond Information Only Additional Services, you understand that by receiving such Additional Services, you are agreeing to the following terms and conditions:</p>
<p>a.
JustAnswer is not involved in any agreements between you and any Experts from whom you choose to receive Beyond Information Only Additional Services.</p>
<p>b.
JustAnswer does not form any attorney-client/doctor-patient/accountant-client relationship with any User through its question-and-answer platform or by virtue of any Beyond Information Only Additional Services.</p>
<p>c.
JustAnswer will endeavor to find an Expert relevant to your request for Additional Services Beyond Information Only.
Nevertheless, JustAnswer does not guarantee that any Expert who contacts you can fulfill your request for Additional Services Beyond Information Only.
Providing a platform where potential Customers can engage the services of Experts who offer Additional Services Beyond Information Only does not imply an endorsement or recommendation for any particular Expert (except as specified in Section 7 above).</p>
<p>d.
JustAnswer is not a law firm and it does not provide any legal advice, counsel, or recommendation to Users, nor is JustAnswer a lawyer referral service.</p>
