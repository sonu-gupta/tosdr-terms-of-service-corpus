<p>back to top</p> Links to Other Sites <p>Our website has links to many other federal agencies, and, in a few cases, to private organizations, foreign governments and international organizations.
You should be aware that if you access another site through a link we provide, you are subject to the privacy policy of that site.</p>
<p>Reference in any referred (linked) website to commercial products, services, manufacturers, or companies does not constitute an endorsement by the U.S.
government, the Department of Health and Human Services, or FDA.</p>
<p>FDA is not responsible for the contents of any pages referred from its website.</p>
<p>back to top</p> Third-Party Websites and Applications <p>In addition to FDA’s official website on www.fda.gov, FDA uses social media and third-party (non-FDA) websites to share information and to engage with the public.&nbsp.
For example, there may be third-party applications and/or services linked to or embedded on www.fda.gov to improve its functionality.
Likewise, applications created by FDA may be embedded on third-party websites as a way to increase public awareness of FDA activities.
Our integration of these products is intended to provide a seamless user experience and to enhance users’ ability to access information and communicate with FDA.</p>
<p>Some third-party websites and applications may make personally identifiable information (PII) available to the public and/or FDA based on user controlled settings or the privacy policies of the third-party.
FDA will not collect, maintain, use, or share any PII that becomes available through FDA’s use of third-party websites or applications.</p>
<p>Please be aware that the privacy policy provided on social media and third-party websites that are not a part of the fda.gov domain may not be the same as the privacy policy described here.
PII or other information you share through social media, or a third-party website or application may be accessible by non-government third parties.
As described in these website policies, you can communicate directly with FDA without involving a third-party.</p>
<p>FDA conducts and publishes a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) for each use of a third-party website.
Each use of a third-party website may have unique functionality or practices.
To learn more, review the published PIAs at http://www.hhs.gov/pia/.</p>
<p>back to top</p> Website Content <p>The health and medical information on our website is not intended to take the place of advice or treatment from healthcare professionals.
It is also not intended to substitute for the users' relationships with their own health care/pharmaceutical providers.</p>
<p>The Code of Federal Regulations is the authoritative source for FDA regulations.</p>
<p>back to top</p> Information Quality <p>FDA is dedicated to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensuring that all information it publishes reflects a level of quality corresponding to the nature and timeliness of the information.</li>
<li>Disseminating all its data as broadly and promptly as possible so that the public can benefit from FDA's mission to promote and protect the public health.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: In keeping with this commitment and in accordance with Public Law 106-554 and Office of Management and Budget requirements, HHS and FDA have developed information quality guidelines establishing quality assurance policies, standards, and processes.</p>
<p>The HHS guidelines are available at http://www.hhs.gov/infoquality/.</p>
<p>back to top</p> Linking to or Copying Information on the FDA Website <p>Unless otherwise noted, the contents of the FDA website (www.fda.gov) — both text and graphics — are not copyrighted.
They are in the public domain and may be republished, reprinted and otherwise used freely by anyone without the need to obtain permission from FDA.
Credit to the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration as the source is appreciated but not required.</p>
<p>People are also free to link to any URL on FDA's site.
FDA's preference is that people link to the material on the FDA site (rather than copying it to their personal websites) because the agency continuously updates the information on the website as better information becomes available.
A person copying documents to another website, instead of linking to them, would then have to monitor the original documents to know when these documents were updated by FDA or else risk giving bad or incorrect advice to visitors to their website.
Providing consumers or health professionals with advice that is not fully up to date can lead to serious public health consequences.
Providing industry advice that is not fully up to date can lead to companies being out of compliance with regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>If a person, nonetheless, decides to copy content or images, FDA strongly recommends that the copied item lists the date that the material was copied and provides a link back to its source on the FDA website.
Users can then see for themselves if the copied material has been updated or changed.</p>
<p>FDA appreciates being informed about the use of website materials.
Please email us at webmail@oc.fda.gov.</p>
