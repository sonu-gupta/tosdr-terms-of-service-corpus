<p>This Cookie Policy lets you know what cookies are, what types of cookies are placed on your computer or other device when you visit our site and what they are used for.</p>
<strong>What are cookies?</strong>
<p> Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information that a user’s device (computer, tablet or mobile) downloads when it visits a website.
They allow the site to “remember” your computer, but not specifically who is using it, and improve your user experience.
By associating the identification numbers in the cookies with other customer information when, for example, you log-in to the site, then we know that the cookie information relates to you.
<br> Cookies can be "persistent" or "session" cookies.
</p>
<strong>How we use cookies?</strong>
<p>When you visit our Service, we may assign your device one or more cookies that facilitate personalisation to facilitate access to our Service and to personalise your experience.</p>
<p>We use cookies for the following purposes: to enable certain functions of the Service, to provide analytics, to store your preferences, to enable advertisements delivery, including behavioral advertising.</p>
<p>In particular we use:</p>
<p>
<strong>Session cookies</strong>, which only last for the duration of a browsing session.
They are usually used to facilitate the access to the services on our website, to authenticate you when you are a registered member, </p>
<p>
<strong>Persistent cookies</strong>, which last for more than one visit.
They are used to remember a user’s preferences and actions within the website.
In this case, when a user returns to our website, or visits sites that use the same cookies, the site reads the cookies and identifies the user’s browser.</p>
<p>
<strong>Pixel tags</strong>.&nbsp;We embed pixel tags (also called web beacons or clear GIFs) on web pages, ads, and emails.
These tiny, invisible graphics are used to access cookies and track user activities (such as how many times a page is viewed).
We use pixel tags to measure the popularity of our features and services.

Adobe utilise their own cookies, which are not manageable through your browser settings but are used by the Flash Player for similar purposes, such as storing preferences or tracking users.
&nbsp;<strong>Flash Cookies</strong> work in a different way to web browser cookies.
