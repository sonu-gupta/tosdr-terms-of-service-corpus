<p>We've tried hard to keep this Agreement as readable and straightforward as possible.
We’ve also added a series of short explanations of the legal language in plain English (they all start with "Basically...") to aid in understanding, but that part isn’t legally binding.
If you have suggestions that can help us improve it or any questions about this Agreement, please&nbsp;email us&nbsp;and let us know.
This Agreement explains our obligations to you, and your obligations to us.
Except as noted otherwise below, this Agreement is the entire Agreement between us.

Rules Your obligations to End Users <ol>
<li>
<strong>Roles.
</strong>Webflow is a “service provider” to you, and you are a “customer” of our Services irrespective of whether you pay fees to obtain the Services.
Any natural persons accessing or using your Webflow account, the websites, pages, features, or content created by you on our Services are deemed your “End Users.” Webflow does not have a direct relationship with any of your End Users, therefore Webflow is not responsible for how you handle End User information.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Applicable laws.</strong> You may have additional obligations under local law other than those described in this Terms of Service, particularly if you or your End Users are located outside of the United States.
Such obligations may be more restrictive than this Terms of Service.
Use of the Services does not ensure compliance with such laws, nor is Webflow responsible for your compliance with such laws.
To the extent Webflow has any obligations to assist you with handling End User information, such obligations are enumerated within a Data Processing Agreement executed between Webflow and you.
&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<strong>Security safeguards.
</strong>You will use all reasonable efforts to protect information collected from End Users via your use of the Services, including any personal information obtained from unauthorized access or use.

<li>
<strong>Privacy rights.

Webflow reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification by contacting us at&nbsp;contact@webflow.com.

Therefore, you should review these Terms of Service and any Updated Terms before using the Service.
The Updated Terms will be effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the Updated Terms, and will apply to your use of the Service from that point forward.

<strong>16.
Dispute resolution</strong>
<p>INFORMAL NEGOTIATIONS.
To expedite resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim related to this Agreement (“Dispute”), you and Webflow agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding.
Such informal negotiations will commence upon written notice.
Your address for such notices is your billing address, with an email copy to the email address you have provided to Webflow.
Webflow’s address for such notices is Webflow, Inc., 398 11th St., Floor 2, San Francisco, CA 94103.</p>
<p>BINDING ARBITRATION.
If you and Webflow are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, all claims arising from use of the Service (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.
Any election to arbitrate by one party will be final and binding on the other.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IF EITHER PARTY ELECTS TO ARBITRATE, NEITHER PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL.
The arbitration will be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the AAA website&nbsp;www.adr.org.
Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be governed by the AAA Rules (and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules).
If your claim for damages does not exceed $10,000, Webflow will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online.
The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party.
The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.
Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you and Webflow may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>
<p>EXCEPTIONS TO ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION.
Each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court or to seek injunctive or other equitable relief on an individual basis in a federal or state court located within the Central District of California with respect to any dispute related to the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party’s intellectual property or proprietary rights.</p>
<p>WAIVER OF RIGHT TO BE A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
You and Webflow agree that any arbitration will be limited to the Dispute between Webflow and you individually.
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND Webflow ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
Further, unless both you and Webflow otherwise agree, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.
If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” Section will be deemed null and void.</p>
<p>LOCATION OF ARBITRATION.
Arbitration will take place in San Francisco, California.
You and Webflow agree that for any Dispute not subject to arbitration (other than claims proceeding in any small claims court), or where no election to arbitrate has been made, the California state and Federal courts located in San Francisco, California have exclusive jurisdiction and you and Webflow agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.</p> Basically...
<p>We don’t want to fight.
If something goes wrong, contact us and we'll negotiate the problem.
If that doesn’t work, we will figure it out in arbitration in San Francisco.
</p> 17.

Attorneys’ and accountants’ fees, remedies <p>In any action to enforce the Terms of Service, the prevailing party shall be entitled to attorneys’ and accountants’ fees and costs.</p>
<p>You agree that Webflow's remedy at law for any actual or threatened breach of this Agreement would be inadequate and that Webflow shall be entitled to specific performance or injunctive relief, or both, in addition to any damages that Webflow may be legally entitled to recover, together with reasonable expenses of any form of dispute resolution, including, without limitation, attorneys' fees.</p>
<p>No right or remedy of Webflow shall be exclusive of any other, whether at law or in equity, including without limitation damages injunctive relief, attorneys' fees, and expenses.</p>
<p>No instance of waiver by Webflow of its rights or remedies under these terms and conditions shall imply any obligation to grant any similar, future, or other waiver.</p> Basically...
