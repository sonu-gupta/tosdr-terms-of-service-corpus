<strong>Introduction</strong>
<p>
<em>Last updated, December 2020</em>
</p>
<p>TikTok's mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy.
We are building a global community where people can create and share, discover the world around them, and connect with others across the globe.
As we grow, we are committed to maintaining a supportive environment for our community.
Our Community Guidelines define a set of norms and common code of conduct for TikTok.
they provide guidance on what is and is not allowed to make a welcoming space for everyone.</p>
<p>At TikTok, we prioritize safety, diversity, inclusion, and authenticity.
We encourage creators to celebrate what makes them unique and viewers to engage in what inspires them.
and we believe that a safe environment helps everyone express themselves openly.
We deeply value the global nature of our community, and we strive to take into account the breadth of cultural norms where we operate.
We also aim to cultivate an environment for genuine interactions by only allowing authentic content on TikTok.</p>
<p>Our Community Guidelines apply to everyone and to everything on TikTok.&nbsp;We proactively enforce them using a mix of technology and human moderation before content gets reported to us.
We also encourage our community members to use the tools we provide on TikTok to report any content they believe violates our Community Guidelines.</p>
<p>We will remove any content – including video, audio, livestream, images, comments, and text – that violates our Community Guidelines.
Individuals are notified of our decisions and can appeal if they believe no violation has occurred.
We will suspend or ban accounts and/or devices that are involved in severe or repeated violations.
we will consider information available on other platforms and offline in these decisions.
When warranted, we will report the accounts to relevant legal authorities.</p>
<p>Our algorithms are designed with trust and safety in mind.
For some content – such as spam, videos under review, or videos that could be considered upsetting or depict things that may be shocking to a general audience – we may reduce discoverability, including by redirecting search results or limiting distribution in the For You feed.</p>
<p>We recognize that some content that would normally be removed per our Community Guidelines could be in the public interest.
Therefore, we may allow exceptions under certain circumstances, such as educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic content, satirical content, content in fictional settings, counterspeech, and content in the public interest that is newsworthy or otherwise enables individual expression on topics of social importance.</p>
<p>In consultation with relevant stakeholders, we update our Community Guidelines from time to time to evolve alongside new behaviors and risks, as part of our commitment to keeping TikTok a safe place for creativity and joy.</p>
<p>
<br>

<strong>Violent extremism</strong>
<p>We take a firm stance against enabling violence on or off TikTok.
We do not allow people to use our platform to threaten or incite violence, or to promote dangerous individuals or organizations.
When there is a threat to public safety or an account is used to promote or glorify off-platform violence, we may suspend or ban the account.
When warranted, we will report threats to relevant legal authorities.
To effectively protect our community, we may consider information available on other platforms and offline to identify violent and extremist individuals and organizations on our platform.
If we find such individuals or organizations on TikTok, we will close their accounts.</p>Threats and incitement to violence<p>We consider incitement to violence as advocating for, directing, or encouraging other people to commit violence.
