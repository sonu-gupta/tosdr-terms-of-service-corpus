What information we collect from users
Custom Commands
<p>Your user ID may be added to custom commands created by guild leaders.
This is outside of our control.</p>
Browser Authentication
<p>When you authenticate to https://warbot.dev/, a cookie needs to be stored in your browser to authenticate you.</p>
<p>In the future, it is planned to store your preferred language, however, this feature is not implemented yet.</p>
What information we collect from guilds.
<ol>
<li>The number of members in a guild.
This is used to gauge how much load the bot may be under.</li>
<li>Errors related to your guild.
I will see messages for these situations:<ol>
<li>If we cannot deliver a critical message, a log will be created stating we could not deliver a message for guild "guild name"</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Guilds which have added or removed WarBOT.</li>
</ol>
How can you opt-out of collection
<p>Given, we do not collect or log any user information, there is nothing to opt-out of.</p>
<p>Any information which is collected, is high-level metrics.
IE, how many times has someone used a command, globally.</p>
