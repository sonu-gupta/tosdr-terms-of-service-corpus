We explain how we use your data in our Privacy Policy, which is legally part of these Terms of Service.</p>1.
Privacy.<p>Our
Privacy Policy
explains how XtraMath collects, uses and discloses user data.
It also covers our data storage, security, retention, and deletion practices.

<p>Student accounts can only be created by the student’s parent, guardian, or teacher.

<p>You agree that the information you provide to XtraMath, whether at registration or at any other time, will be true, accurate, current, and complete.
As a parent, guardian, or teacher, you represent and warrant that you will not provide us with information about any child/student unless you have the legal authority to do so.
By registering your child/student, you agree to be bound by the Terms on behalf of your child/student, including without limitation being liable for all use of XtraMath by the child/student.
You acknowledge that XtraMath cannot guarantee the accuracy of any information submitted by any user and that XtraMath is not obligated to verify the accuracy any such information, including any user’s claim to be the parent or teacher of a child/student.</p>

Some of these terms may still apply even after termination.</p>4.
Termination of Services.<p>
You may terminate the Terms, and any account you created for yourself or your child/student, at any time.
If an account for your child was created under the “school official” exception of the U.S.
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), you must request such termination from your child’s school that established the account.
To terminate an account, you must email
erika@xtramath.org
and discontinue your (or your child’s/student’s) use of any and all parts of XtraMath.</p>
<p>XtraMath, in its sole discretion, has the right to suspend or terminate any account and refuse any and all current or future use of XtraMath, with or without cause (such as a violation of these Terms).
Such termination will result in the deactivation or deletion of your account, or your access to your account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all records in your account.</p>
<p>XtraMath also reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any or all of XtraMath’s services.
You agree that XtraMath will not be liable to you or any third party for any such termination.</p>
<p>Upon termination of the Terms, any provision which, by its nature or express terms should survive, will survive such termination or expiration.</p>
<p>You may not abuse XtraMath’s brand, including our trademarks and copyrights.</p>5.
