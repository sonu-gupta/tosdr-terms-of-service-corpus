We use cookies and this page explains their use.</p>
<p>Our websites uses cookies and local storage (aka web storage) to distinguish users.
This helps us to provide you with a good experience when accessing our websites, and also allows us to improve our websites.</p>
<p>We use cookies to analyze how visitors use our websites and to help us provide a better experience for visitors.</p> General Information about cookies and local storage <p>Cookies can most easily be explained as leaving a small trail in your browser confirming where you have been on the internet or navigation from certain emails that you open.</p>
<p>A cookie is a small file typically consisting of a string of letters and numbers that is sent by a web server to a web browser (e.g.
Google Chrome), and stored by the browser.
This small file is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server.</p>
<p>Cookies can be used by web servers to distinguish and track users as they navigate different pages on a website and to improve the experience for returning users.</p>
<p>Cookies can be either session cookies or persistent cookies.
A session cookie will expire at the end of the user session, effectively when the web browser is closed.
A persistent cookie will be stored by the browser and will remain valid until a set expiry date (unless deleted by the user before the expiry date).</p>
<p>Local storage is a similar storage system to cookies but differs in many ways.
It is also used to store session and persistent data, but the data is not sent to the server by default, and it cannot be retrieved using basic HTTP methods, and so has some security advantages over cookies.</p> How we use cookies and local storage <p>We may use cookies and local storage for the following purposes:</p>
