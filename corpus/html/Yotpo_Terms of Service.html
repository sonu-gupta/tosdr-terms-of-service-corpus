Upon termination by Yotpo, you shall immediately cease using the Platform.
The following Sections shall survive termination or expiration of the Terms: 2, 3.2, 6, 8, 10-15.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>DISPUTE RESOLUTION<ol>
<li>If you reside outside of U.S.
or your business is located outside of U.S.: If the Yotpo contracting entity is Yotpo UK Limited, then the Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales, without regard to the principles of conflict of law.
If the contracting entity is SMSBump, the Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Bulgaria without regard to the principles of conflict of law therein.
Regardless of the contracting entity, the application of the United Nations Convention of Contracts for the International Sale of Goods or other international laws is expressly excluded.</li>
<li>If you reside in the US or your business is located in the US: You and we agree to arbitrate any claim, cause of action, or dispute between you and us that arises out of or relates to any access or use of the Services for business or commercial purposes (“commercial claim”).
This provision does not cover any commercial claims relating to violations of your or our intellectual property rights, including, but not limited to, copyright infringement, patent infringement, trademark infringement, or efforts to interfere with our Services or engage with our Services in unauthorized ways.</li>
<li>We and you agree that, by entering into this arbitration provision all parties are waiving their respective rights to a trial by jury or to participate in a class or representative action.
THE PARTIES AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING COMMERCIAL CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL PROCEEDING.
You may bring a commercial claim only on your own behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other parties.
If there is a final judicial determination that any particular commercial claim (or a request for particular relief) cannot be arbitrated in accordance with this paragraph’s limitations, then only that commercial claim (or only that request for relief) may be brought in court.
All other commercial claims (or requests for relief) remain subject to this paragraph.
The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision.
All issues are for an arbitrator to decide, except that only a court may decide issues relating to the scope or enforceability of this arbitration provision or the interpretation of the prohibition of class and representative actions.
If any party intends to seek arbitration of a dispute, that party must provide the other party with notice in writing.
This notice of dispute to us must be sent to the following address:<br> Yotpo, Inc.<br> 400 Layette Street, 4th Floor<br> New York, NY 10003</li>
<li>The arbitration will be governed by the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules (“AAA Rules”), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA.
If the AAA is unavailable, the parties will agree to another arbitration provider or the court will appoint a substitute.
The arbitrator will not be bound by rulings in other arbitrations in which you are not a party.
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any evidentiary submissions made in arbitration will be maintained as confidential in the absence of good cause for its disclosure.
The arbitrator’s award will be maintained as confidential only to the extent necessary to protect either party’s trade secrets or proprietary business information or to comply with a legal requirement mandating confidentiality.
Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA Rules, except that we will pay for your filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees if your commercial claim for damages does not exceed $75,000 and is non-frivolous (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
If you do not wish to be bound by this provision (including its waiver of class and representative claims), you must notify us as set forth below within 30 days of the first acceptance date of any version of these Terms containing an arbitration provision.
Your notice to us under this subsection must be submitted to the address above.</li>
<li>All commercial claims between us, whether subject to arbitration or not, will be governed by New York law, excluding New York’s conflict of laws rules, except to the extent that New York law is contrary to or preempted by federal law.
If a commercial claim between you and us is not subject to arbitration, you agree that the claim must be resolved exclusively in the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of New York or a state court located in New York, NY, and that you submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim.
If any term or provision of this Section is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this Section or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction.
If for any reason a Dispute proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the parties hereby waive any right to a jury trial.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>GENERAL<ol>
<li>If any provision of the Agreement is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make f enforceable and if such provision is determined to be invalid or unenforceable nonetheless, the provision shall be deemed to be severable from the remainder of the Agreement and shall not cause the invalidity or unenforceability of the remainder of the Agreement.</li>
<li>you acknowledge and agree that Yotpo has the right, at any time and for any reason, to redesign or modify the Yotpo Materials and other elements of the Platform or any part thereof.</li>
<li>Prior notice of changes: Yotpo may update these Terms of Service from time to time by providing you with prior written notice of material updates at least thirty (30) days in advance of the effective date.
Notice will be given in your account portal or via an email to the email address owner of your account.
This notice will highlight the intended updates.
Except as otherwise specified by Yotpo, updates will be effective upon the effective date indicated at the top of these Terms of Service.
The updated version of these Terms will supersede all prior versions.
Your acceptance: Following such notice, your continued access or use of the Services on or after the effective date of the changes to the Terms constitutes your acceptance of any updates.
If you do not agree to any updates, you should stop using the Services.
Exceptions: Yotpo may not be able to provide at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of updates to these Terms that result from changes in the law or requirements from telecommunications providers.</li>
<li>No failure, delay or default in performance of any obligation of a party (other than a payment obligation) shall constitute an event of default or breach of this Agreement to the extent that such failure to perform, delay or default arises out of a cause, existing or future, that is beyond the control of such party, including action or inaction of governmental, civil or military authority.
fire.
strike, lockout or other labor dispute.

The party affected by such cause shall take all reasonable actions to minimize the consequences of any such cause.</li>
<li>Neither party may assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party, not to be unreasonably withheld, provided that either party may assign or transfer this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the other party, to an affiliate or in connection with a sale or merger of all or substantially all of the assigning party’s business or assets.
Any unauthorized assignment will be void and of no force or effect.</li>
<li>Except as expressly stated herein, nothing in this Agreement shall be considered as granting any rights to third parties.
The failure of either party to enforce any rights granted hereunder or to take action against the other party in the event of any breach hereunder shall not be deemed a waiver by that party as to subsequent enforcement of rights or subsequent actions in the event of future breaches.</li>
<li>Yotpo may use subcontractors and permit them to exercise Yotpo’s rights (including without limitation the provision of customer support), but Yotpo remains responsible for their compliance with this Agreement and for its overall performance under this Agreement.</li>
<li>YOU AGREE THAT YOU MUST COMMENCE ANY CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST YOTPO ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SERVICES OR THE PLATFORM WITHIN THREE (3) MONTHS OF WHEN SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION AROSE.
OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.</li>
