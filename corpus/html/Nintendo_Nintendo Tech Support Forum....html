</ol> Nintendo Tech Support Forums Terms of Use <p>Last Updated: April 2016 </p>
<p>Welcome to the Nintendo Tech Support Forums (the “Support Forums”).
The Support Forums are offered by Nintendo of America Inc.
(“Nintendo”) as a friendly, helpful place for you (“you” or “your”) and the Nintendo community to share information about fixes and solutions to technical issues for Nintendo software and hardware.
</p>
<p>These Nintendo Support Forum Terms set forth the rules that apply to your use of the Support Forums.
By using or accessing the Support Forums, or by indicating your agreement when the option is made available to you (for example, when creating a Forum Account), you agree to be bound by these Nintendo Support Forum Terms, together with the Nintendo.com Terms of Use (collectively, the “Forum Terms”).
</p>
<p>Please review the Forum Terms carefully, as they create a binding legal agreement that applies to you.
If you do not agree to the Forum Terms, do not use the Support Forums.
If you are under the age of 18 (or the age of majority where you live) you must get your parent or legal guardian to read and accept the Forum Terms.
</p>
<p>All disputes related to your access and use of the Support Forums will be governed by the “Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability” and “Dispute Resolution.
Binding Individual Arbitration.
Class Action Waiver” provisions of the Nintendo.com Terms of Use.
Any additional terms posted by third party content providers do not modify these Forum Terms.
In the event of a conflict between the Forum Terms and the Nintendo.com Terms of Use, the Nintendo.com Terms of Use shall apply.
