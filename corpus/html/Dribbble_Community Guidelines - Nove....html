<li> I won’t spam other Dribbble Members <p>Dribbble provides many features that allow users to interact with one-another, including messages.
Please don’t use these tools indiscriminately to spam or send unsolicited messages to other members.
If you’re caught spamming other Dribbble members, your account may be suspended or removed.</p>
<p>
<strong>What do we consider spam?</strong>

<ul>
<li>Using likes, follows, and other disingenuous social gestures to draw attention to your account</li>
<li>Linking to your own work in comments on other members’ shots</li>
<li>Asking for likes and/or follows in exchange for a Dribbble invitation</li>

</ul>
<p>If you see a Dribbble member spamming others, report it by contacting us.
</p>
</li>

<li>Invitations should not be used as prizes for contests, but given genuinely based on your interest in following someone’s work</li>
<li>Invitation contests that require or suggest likes and follows for entry is prohibited</li>
<li>Dribbble’s invitation system aims to increase the number of talented designers and interesting work on Dribbble—not to draw attention to your profile</li>

</ul>
<p>
<strong> Your account may be suspended or removed if you engage in activity that violates these guidelines.

</p>
</li>
<li> I will give due credit <p>If your work is inspired by other work on Dribbble, make sure to give credit.
You can do this by mentioning the Dribbble member or creating a Rebound.

<p>If you’re the owner of work that has been posted on Dribbble without your consent, please review our Copyright Policy.</p>
<p>Please link back to Dribbble when posting Dribbble content elsewhere.</p>
</li>
<li> I will be constructive in my feedback <p>When providing criticism or feedback to other Dribbble members—be helpful, not mean.</p>
</li>
<li> I will use messages to contact Dribbble members about serious work inquires only <p>When sending a message to a designer, please follow these guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your message must be a work inquiry regarding a design job or project.</li>
<li>Please personalize the messages you send—don’t send boilerplate messages.
They tend to feel impersonal and lack the detail necessary to be appealing.
This means you should use their name, provide a brief description of the work or job for which you’re hiring, and any details you find compelling about the designer’s work on Dribbble.</li>
<li>Please make sure the designer you’re contacting is a good fit for your job or project as indicated by the work, bio and skills on their profile.
Many designers also declare the type work in which they’re interested on the message form—so make sure your message conforms with their stated preferences.</li>
<li>Have a specific job or project in mind when contacting a designer.
Don’t ask if someone is generally looking for new opportunities or if anyone they know is looking for new opportunities.
</li>
<li>Please don’t message designers to ask for an invitation.
Your messaging privileges will be revoked</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> I recognize that personal accounts are only to be used for posting my personal work <p>All work posted under an individual player account represents that account holders personal work and not the work of a team, collective, community or any other group of individuals.
If you would like to share work created by a team, create a Team account.</p>
</li>
<li> I recognize that Team accounts are for design agencies and in-house design teams <p>When creating a Team account please follow these guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Team account represents an agency or in-house design team</li>
<li>You are not selling, offering, promoting or receiving compensation of any kind in exchange for seats on your Team account</li>
<li>Each person invited to your team works as part of said agency or in-house design team</li>
<li>You are not using your Team profile to spam the Dribbble community (See Guideline #4)</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong> Failure to follow these guidelines will result in your messaging privileges being suspended or revoked.
</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li> I recognize that the Project Board is for appropriate projects for individuals seeking a freelance or contract designer <p>When posting a project to the Project Board, please follow these guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>The projects there are intended for individual hiring needs, not those of companies or agencies.
For those we recommend the job board.</li>
<li>As with content noted above, please don’t post inappropriate projects</li>
</ul>
<p>If you post an inappropriate project, it may be removed by Dribbble per our Terms of Service.
