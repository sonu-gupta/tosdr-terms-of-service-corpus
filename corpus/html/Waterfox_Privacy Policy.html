We are committed to being transparent and open.
This Waterfox Privacy Policy explains generally how we receive information about you, and what we do with that information once we have it.
You can also read our product privacy notices and FAQs to get more detail with respect to each of our products and services.</p>What do we mean by "personal information?"<p>For us, "personal information" means information which identifies you, like your name or email address.</p>
<p>Any information that falls outside of this is "non-personal information."</p>
<p>If we store your personal information with information that is non-personal, we will consider the combination as personal information.
If we remove all personal information from a set of data then the remaining is non-personal information.</p>How do we learn information about you?<p>We learn information about you when: </p>
<ul>
<li>you give it to us directly (e.g., when you choose to send us crash reports);</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>What do we do with your information once we have it?<p>When you give us information, we will use it in the ways for which you've given us permission.
Generally, we use your information to help us provide and improve our products and services for you.</p>When do we share your information with others?<p>Even though we don't collect any such information, just in-case: </p>
<ul>
<li>If our organizational structure or status changes (if we undergo a restructuring, are acquired, or go bankrupt) we may pass your information to a successor.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>What if we change this privacy policy or any of our privacy notices?<p>We may need to change this policy and our notices.
The updates will be posted online.
If the changes are substantive, we will announce the update through Waterfox's usual channels for such announcements such as blog posts and forums.
Your continued use of the product or service after the effective date of such changes constitutes your acceptance of such changes.
To make your review more convenient, we will post an effective date at the top of the page.</p>WebsiteMarch 14, 2018<p>We care about your privacy.

<p>We may use cookies, third party web analytics, device information, and IP addresses for functionality and to better understand user interaction with our products, services, and communications.

<li>Functionality: We may use cookies and/or device information to enhance functionality of certain products, services, and communications.
For example: <ul>
<li>Cookies are used to remember your Waterfox language preference and Waterfox add-ons.

We use: <ul>
<li>Matomo, which is self hosted.
Self-hosting means that no third party (not even Matomo) ever has access to your data.
<ul>
<li>No IP address storage: Matomo doesn’t store any IP address, but rather converts IP to user’s country and then discarding the IP.</li>
<li>GDPR also stipulates that individuals have a right to ‘block’ or suppress processing of personal data.
If an individual decides not to be tracked, Matomo has a function to support this.
If it is invoked, then we do not track that user at all.</li>
