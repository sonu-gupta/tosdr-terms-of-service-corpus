In particular, you have the following rights under CCPA:</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>You have the right to request information about the categories of personal information we have collected about you in the preceding 12 months, as well as the categories of sources from which such information is collected, the purpose for collecting such information, and the categories of third parties with whom we share such information.</li>
<li>You have the right to request the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you in the preceding 12 months.</li>
<li>You have the right to request information about our sale or disclosure for business purposes of your personal information to third parties.</li>
<li>You have the right to opt out of the sale of your personal information to third parties.</li>
<li>You have the right to request the deletion of your personal information.</li>
<li>You have the right to not be discriminated against for exercising any of these rights.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>Only you, or an agent that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request to access or delete your personal information.
For any requests made by an authorized agent, we will require written authorization from you in order to process.</p>
<p>We must verify your identity prior to processing a request to access or delete your personal information.
To do so, we will ask that you confirm two or three points of information that we have in our records, such as an email address or phone number.
Once your identity has been verified, the request will proceed.
Jack in the Box will store personal information for as long as we are required to keep it because of legal obligations, professional accounting and audit standards, legal or insurance claims, or regulatory proceedings.</p>
<p>If you, or your authorized agent, would like to exercise one or more of the above rights, please submit a request using our Jack in the Box Privacy Portal or contact us at 1-800-378-5225.</p> COLLECTION AND DISCLOSURE OF CALIFORNIA PERSONAL INFORMATION <p>We describe the personal information we have collected from consumers in the preceding twelve (12) months and the sources from which we have collected such personal information in the Information We Collect About You and How We Collect It section above.</p>

Some of these third parties may retain rights to use this data for their own purposes.
While this may not be deemed a sale of personal information in the traditional sense, this sharing of information with these third-party providers may be deemed a “sale” of personal information under CCPA.
This includes data relating to internet or other similar network activity, commercial information, identifiers, and information under the California Customer Records statute, such as email address, mobile phone number, whether you use our mobile application or your zip code, purchase and transactional history (including dates and items purchase) and whether you have registered with us.
This information may be provided to companies which help us target advertisements and in our other digital marketing efforts.</p>
<p>To opt out of this sale of your personal information, please submit a request using our Jack in the Box Privacy Portal or contact us at 1-800-378-5225.</p>
