## INTEREST BASED<br>
ADVERTISING We may directly or through a third party vendor use non-personally identifiable information in<br>
connection with our own or our vendors’ information to display or deliver targeted advertising to you on our Site<br>
and to manage our advertising on other sites.
Cookies, clickstream data, web beacons and other similar technologies<br>
may be used to collect information in order to provide personalized advertising.
For example, if you are searching<br>
for information on a particular product, we or our vendors may cause an advertisement to appear on other websites<br>
you view with information on that product.
This form of advertising, sometimes called “interest based advertising,”<br>
is based on anonymous information and not on any personal information.
As a result, we and our vendors know your<br>
interests, but do not personally identify you in connection with the delivery of that specific ad.
We believe that<br>
such advertising is helpful because you will see advertisements that are relevant to your interests.
However, if you<br>
would like to opt-out of these interest-based advertisements, please follow the opt-out process described below<br>
under “Interest Based Advertising Opt-Out.” ## COOKIES We may place small data files on your device or device hard<br>
drive known as “cookies” or a similar type of file (such as clear gifs, web beacons, tags, etc.) for the purpose of<br>
facilitating and enhancing your communication and interaction with the Site.
Many websites use cookies for these<br>
purposes.
Cookies are also used to collect general usage and volume statistical information.
We use this information<br>
internally, to help us maintain and enhance the efficiency and usefulness of the Site.
We may also use and place<br>
cookies on your device from our third party service providers in connection with the Site, such as an analytics<br>
provider that helps us manage and analyze Site usage.
We also use session ID cookies and persistent cookies.
A<br>
session ID cookie expires when you close your browser.
Our persistent cookies may remain active on your device for<br>
up to 1-3 years (depending upon the purpose of the cookie) or until you delete them manually.
We set a persistent<br>
cookie to enable us to track and target the interests of users to enhance the services we provide.
Cookies and<br>
similar items are not used by us to automatically retrieve personal information from your device without your<br>
knowledge.
If you do not wish to receive cookies or want to restrict them or flush them from your device, you may do<br>
so by changing the settings on your computer or browser accordingly, in which case you may still use our Site, but<br>
it may interfere with some of its functionality.
## CLICKSTREAM DATA As you use the Internet, a trail of electronic<br>
information is left at each website you visit.
This information, which is sometimes referred to as “clickstream<br>
data,” can be collected and stored by a website’s server.
Clickstream data can tell us the type of device and<br>
browsing software you use and the address of the website from which you linked to the Site.
We may collect and use<br>
clickstream data to anonymously determine how much time visitors spend on websites, how visitors navigate throughout<br>
websites and how we may tailor our Site to better meet consumer needs.
This information will be used to improve our<br>
Site and our Services.
Any collection or use of clickstream data will be anonymous, and will not intentionally<br>
contain any personal data.
## SECURITY We have implemented technical and organizational measures, appropriate to the<br>
risk, to protect your personal information against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration and<br>
unauthorized disclosure or access.
However, due to the inherent open nature of the Internet, we cannot ensure or<br>
warrant the security of any information provided online.
## DATA RETENTION We retain your personal information, if<br>
provided by you through the Site, for as long as your inquiry is active (as determined by us) and for a reasonable<br>
time thereafter, or if applicable, for as long as you remain on our marketing list.
We also may retain your personal<br>
information for a longer period of time on the basis of our legitimate interests in providing our Services to you or<br>
as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce our agreements.
Even if we<br>
delete some or all of your personal information, we may continue to retain and use aggregated or anonymous data<br>
previously collected so that it can no longer be used for personal identification and/or anonymize or aggregate your<br>
personal information.
Please note that we will not be liable for disclosures of your data due to errors or<br>
unauthorized acts of third parties.
## OTHER SITES As a convenience to you, we may provide links to third party<br>
websites from within the Site.
We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these third party<br>
sites, and by providing a link we are not endorsing or promoting such third party sites.
When you link away from our<br>
Site, you do so at your own risk.
We encourage you to read the policies and terms of every website you visit.
##<br>
SOCIAL NETWORKING SERVICES The Site may integrate with social networking services.
You understand that we do not<br>
control such services and are not liable for the manner in which they operate.
While we may provide you with the<br>
ability to use such services in connection with our Site, we are doing so merely as an accommodation and, like you,<br>
are relying upon those third party services to operate properly and fairly.
You should be aware that personal<br>
information which you voluntarily include and transmit online in a publicly accessible blog, social network or<br>
otherwise online may be viewed and used by others.
We are unable to control such uses of your personal information,<br>
and by using such services you assume the risk that the personal information provided by you may be viewed and used<br>
by third parties.
## INFORMATION RELATING TO CHILDREN Our Site is designed for those 13 years of age and older.
We<br>
do not knowingly collect information from anyone under the age of 13.
If we are made aware that we have received<br>
such information, or any information in violation of this Privacy Policy, we will use reasonable efforts to locate<br>
and remove that information from our records.
In the case of residents of the European Union, we do not collect<br>
information from anyone under the age of 16 except with parental consent, subject to an EU member state providing by<br>
law for a lower age (not below 13 years).
## COMMUNICATIONS WITH REPRESENT By providing your email address to us,<br>
you expressly consent to receive emails from us.
We may use email to communicate with you, to send information that<br>
you have requested or to send information about other services provided by us, provided that, we will not give your<br>
email address to another party to promote their products or services directly to you except as set forth in this<br>
Privacy Policy.
## OPT-OUT PROCESS If you do not want your personal information shared with any third party who may<br>
use such information for direct marketing purposes, then send an email to<br>
support@represent.com stating that you want to opt-out of such disclosures.
However,<br>
we are not responsible for removing your personal information from the lists of any third party who has previously<br>
been provided with your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
If you receive a promotional email from<br>
us, you may unsubscribe from promotional emails through a link, typically at the bottom of the email.
As noted<br>
above, you may opt-out of or restrict the placement of cookies on your device or remove them from your browser by<br>
adjusting your web browser preferences.
Please note that cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on many mobile<br>
devices.
However, on many mobile devices, application users may opt out of certain mobile ads via their device<br>
settings.
If you do not want us to use your personal information for our marketing purposes, send us an email at<br>
support@represent.com stating that you withdraw your consent to such use.
##<br>
INTEREST BASED ADVERTISING OPT-OUT We may, and may work with third parties, to use non-personal information to<br>
deliver targeted advertisements to you based upon your online activities and other information.
The online<br>
advertising industry provides a service through which you may opt-out of receiving targeted ads from certain data<br>
partners and other advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs.
We comply with the<br>
Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising set forth by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA).<br>
You can opt-out of targeted advertising from certain providers at www.aboutads.info/consumers.
Please note that by<br>
opting out, you will continue to see generic advertising that is not tailored to your specific interests and<br>
activities.
To be clear, whether you are using our opt-out or an online industry opt-out, these cookie-based<br>
opt-outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out.
For example, if you have<br>
opted out on your device browser, that opt-out will not be effective on your mobile device.
You must separately opt<br>
out on each device.
