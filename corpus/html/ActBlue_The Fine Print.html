These terms of use apply to your use of the ActBlue.com website and
all associated services (including, but not limited to, e-mail received
from ActBlue, and content embedded on other websites) provided by ActBlue and its associated entities (including ActBlue Civics and ActBlue Charities).

If you browse or donate through ActBlue.com,

</p> Privacy Policy <p>
These terms of use include our privacy policy,
which describes how we use your personal information.
</p> Accuracy <p>
We work hard to make sure all information provided by ActBlue is as accurate as possible.
However, this information is presented without warranty, either express or implied, as to its accuracy, timeliness or completeness, and is not intended to replace any official versions of that information, where applicable, such as information provided by a candidate or government office.
</p> Other Websites <p>
We provide links to other web sites, but we can't control what those
sites say or do.
In particular, websites to which we link may request
your personal and/or financial information.
ActBlue is not responsible
for other sites' content, information collection practices, or use of
the information they collect.
ActBlue's links to other web sites do not
constitute an endorsement of those sites or their content, owners, or posters.
</p>
<p>
ActBlue encourages third parties and individuals to link to ActBlue.com and content posted herein.
Such links do not constitute an endorsement by ActBlue of these third party web sites or their content, owners, or posters.
</p> Campaign Finance Laws
<p>
Political contributions are governed by campaign finance laws.
ActBlue
makes its best efforts to ensure that all contributions made on the
ActBlue site are in accordance with these laws.
Nonetheless, you have
final responsibility for ensuring your own compliance.
</p>
<p>
For example: ActBlue will not permit users to make donations larger
than $2,800 to any federal candidate.
However, ActBlue does not track
users' contributions through other avenues (e.g.
fundraisers,
candidates' websites).
Therefore you (and not ActBlue) are
responsible for ensuring that your total contributions through these
different avenues do not exceed your contribution limits.
If you are in a position to make these kinds of large contributions,
please be careful and don't give these campaigns' accountants any more
headaches than they already have.
</p> Other Laws
<p>
Donations to charities (501(c)(3) organizations) and social welfare groups (501(c)(4) organizations) are not subject to any contributions limits.
You may make unlimited donations to these groups on the site.
ActBlue cannot be responsible for your treatment of these donations on your tax returns.
Charitable donations are tax-deductible for federal income tax purposes.
Social welfare donations are not tax deductible as charitable contributions.
We will do our best to provide you with all relevant information regarding tax treatment of donations to the entities on our site, such as what percentage of your donation might be used for lobbying activities (check your receipt).
However, it is your responsibility to report your donations accurately as required and to pay your taxes.
We recommend consulting your tax adviser or tax preparer if you have any questions.

</p> Refund policy
<p>
ActBlue does everything we can to accommodate requests for refunds.
We do our best to honor refunds requested for reasons such as input error, when a contributor accidentally donates twice or enters the wrong donation amount.
ActBlue will not consider refunds for other reasons such as a change in political or personal opinion or the cancellation of an event.
ActBlue reserves the right to refuse a refund request for these or other reasons.
</p>
<p>
All refund requests are subject to the availability of the contribution funds.
Because ActBlue forwards contributions to the candidate, cause, or committee to whom you choose to contribute, ActBlue will only refund a contribution if we still have the funds or can recover the funds from the recipient.
For this reason, it is of the utmost importance that you make your request for a refund as soon after contributing as possible.
</p>
<p> All refunds issued by ActBlue will be credited back to the card used to make the contribution.
In all cases where we are not able to accommodate a refund request, we will be happy to refer you to the recipient of your contribution so that you may request a refund directly from them.
</p>
<p>
Our state of the art fraud detection software constantly monitors the site for fraudulent activity using stolen cards.
When our software identifies a fraudulent transaction, the contribution will be refunded automatically regardless of whether a refund has been requested.
</p>
<p>
If you are with a campaign, committee, or organization that has received a contribution through ActBlue and would like to request that we refund that contribution, please contact us at info@actblue.com or leave us a message at (617) 517-7600 and we will do our best to assist you.
</p> Cancellation policy
<p>
For your convenience, ActBlue offers the ability to make a recurring contribution to one or more recipients using a stored payment method.
When you sign up for a recurring contribution, ActBlue will charge the amount you designated to your stored account once each month and forward that contribution to the recipient you have chosen.
All payment information is stored securely in our system, and we will never change the amount, frequency, or recipient of your recurring contribution.
If you wish to cancel future instances of a recurring contribution, or change the payment method used for future charges, you can do so by clicking on the appropriate link in your original receipt, by looking up your contribution on the ActBlue website, or by sending us an email with your request.
</p> Re-designation of Contributions <p>In the event that a campaign or committee (a) fails for 60 days
to cash a check from ActBlue which includes your contribution (after
ActBlue makes repeated attempts to work with the campaign to ensure
all checks are cashed), or (b) affirmatively refuses a contribution
earmarked through ActBlue, your contribution will be re-designated as
a contribution to ActBlue.
Contributions to social welfare organizations which are similarly not cashed or affirmatively refused will be kept by ActBlue and used generally to support its social welfare activities.
Contributions to charitable organizations which are not cashed or affirmatively refused will go to ActBlue Charities.</p>
