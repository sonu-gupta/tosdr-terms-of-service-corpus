<b>FOR RESIDENTS OF CERTAIN COUNTRIES, YOU AGREE TO THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER DESCRIBED IN SECTION 15 OF THE ELECTRONIC ARTS USER AGREEMENT, available at terms.ea.com.</b>
</p>
<p>EA and its subsidiaries (collectively, “EA,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) provides these SMS Terms and Conditions (the “SMS Terms”), which govern the provision and delivery of text messages by us and/or our text message service providers to you.
We provide this text message service to: (1) provide you with information you requested from us and/or (2) inform you of our products or offers that may be of interest to you.</p>
<p>
<b>E-SIGN DISCLOSURE</b>
</p>
<p>By agreeing to receive text messages, you also consent to the use of an electronic record to document your agreement.
You may withdraw your consent to the use of the electronic record by sending an email to the administrator for your territory listed at privacyadmin.ea.com&nbsp;with “Revoke Electronic Consent” in the subject line.
To view and retain a copy of this disclosure or any information regarding your enrollment in this program, you will need (i) a device (such as a computer or mobile phone) with a web browser and Internet access and (ii) either a printer or storage space on such device.
For a free paper copy, or to update our records of your contact information, send an email to the administrator for your territory listed at privacyadmin.ea.com&nbsp;with contact information and the address for delivery.</p>
<p>
<b>SIGNING UP FOR OUR TEXT MESSAGES</b>
</p>
<p>By signing up to receive text messages, you agree to these SMS Terms, as well as and EA’s User Agreement, incorporated herein by reference.&nbsp.
We will send text messages only to those who subscribe to receive such text messages via our web forms.
By signing up to receive our text messages, you agree that we or our agents may use any automated or non-automated technology to send you promotional and/or informational text messages.
You understand that you are not required to receive our text messages as a condition of using services or products made available by EA.
EA’s Privacy and Cookie Policy applies.</p>
<p>
<b>COSTS OF SIGNING UP FOR OUR TEXT MESSAGES</b>
</p>
<p>We do not charge you for our text message program.
But message and data rates may apply, so depending on your plan with your wireless or other applicable provider, you may be charged by your carrier or other applicable provider.</p>
<p>
<b>FREQUENCY OF TEXT MESSAGES</b>
</p>
<p>The specific amount of text messages may vary depending on how you use our services and the types of text messages you registered to receive.
The number of text messages you receive may depend upon factors including how you use our services and whether you take steps to generate additional text messages from us (such as by sending a&nbsp;<b>HELP</b>&nbsp;request).</p>
<p>
<b>PARTICIPATING CARRIERS</b>
</p>
<p>Content is not available on all carriers and carrier participation could change.
As of May 24, 2017, our text messages can be sent through all major carriers, including AT&amp;T, Boost Mobile, T-Mobile, Metro PCS, Verizon Wireless, Sprint, U.S.
Cellular, NTelos, Cricket, O2, Vodafone, and Virgin Mobile.
The list of participating carriers may be changed at EA’s sole discretion without prior notice, and we are not responsible if a carrier’s coverage changes so that our text messages cannot be sent through that carrier.
The content is not compatible with all cell/mobile phone models.
We will not be liable for any delays in the receipt of any SMS messages or changes to the participating carriers as delivery is subject to effective transmission from your carrier with active participation at that time.
T-Mobile is not liable for delayed or undelivered messages.</p>
<p>

<b>OPTING OUT OF OUR ONGOING TEXT MESSAGE PROGRAMS</b>
</p>
<p>If you do not want to receive future text messages, you may contact us via the methods listed below, or reply to one of our text messages with <b>STOP </b>or <b>QUIT</b>.
If you subscribe to multiple services through a single phone number, we may unsubscribe you from the service that most recently sent you a message and/or respond to your&nbsp;<b>STOP/QUIT</b>&nbsp;message by texting you a request to identify services you wish to stop.
After unsubscribing, we may send you confirmation of your opt-out via text message.
If you have revoked consent and want to re-enroll in our text message program, you can resume your enrollment through the web form you signed up on.</p>
