Compliance with CAN SPAM Act, Children Online Privacy Protection Act, California Online Privacy Protection Act <p>9.1.
California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA) is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy.
The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.
- See more at:<u> http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/</u>

Children Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).
When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control.
The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.
We do not specifically market to children under 13.</p>
<p>9.3.
The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe.
Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>
<p>9.3.1.
In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp.

<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp.

<p>9.3.2.
