<p>6.4 Data Protection and Privacy Role of Sellers.
Sellers acknowledge that they have their own data protection and privacy compliance responsibilities with respect to personal information of Buyers or other individuals that the Seller processes.
Sellers represent and warrant, and undertake to Alibaba.com to ensure, that in relation to such personal information they are and will be fully compliant with all applicable data protection and privacy laws, including without limitation maintaining their own records of such personal information independently of the platform (to the extent required under applicable laws), complying with direct marketing laws, and responding to requests by individuals to exercise their rights under such laws.
Neither Alibaba.com nor any of its affiliates is responsible or liable for a Seller's fulfilment of their obligations under applicable data protection and privacy laws.
For the avoidance of doubt, in relation to such personal information the liability and obligations of Alibaba.com and its affiliates under applicable data protection and privacy laws are entirely independent of and separate from the liability and obligations of Sellers under such laws.
Alibaba.com shall have no liability to any Sellers for the compliance, by Alibaba.com or its affiliates, with its or their own obligations under applicable data protection or privacy laws, including without limitation in relation to the exercise by Buyers or other individuals of their rights regarding their personal information processed in connection with any services and products provided by Alibaba.com.</p>
