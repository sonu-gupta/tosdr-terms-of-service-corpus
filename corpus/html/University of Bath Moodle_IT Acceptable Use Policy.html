<p>f) Exemptions from Unacceptable Use:
There are a number of legitimate academic activities that may be carried out using University information systems that could be considered unacceptable use, as defined at 2a-e.
For example, research involving defamatory, discriminatory or threatening material, the use of images which may depict violence, the study of hate crime, terrorism-related material or research into computer intrusion techniques.
In such circumstances, advice should be sought from the University’s Legal Office (if potentially illegal material is involved) and/or notification made to the University Secretary via the procedure outlined in the University’s Prevent Policy if the material relates to the promotion of extremism/terrorism prior to the introduction of said material onto the University network.</p>
<p>Any potential research involving obscene or indecent material must always be discussed in advance with the University’s Legal Office.
If a member of the University community believes they may have encountered breaches of any of the above, they should make this known to an appropriate University authority (such as the University Secretary, Director of HR, Director of DDaT or Head of Security Services).</p> 3 Consequences of Breach <p>In the event of a breach of this Acceptable Use Policy by a User the University may in its sole discretion:</p>
<p>a) restrict or terminate a User’s right to use the University Network;</p>
<p>b) withdraw or remove any material uploaded by that User in contravention of this Policy.
or</p>
<p>c) where appropriate, disclose information to law enforcement agencies and take any legal action against a User for breach of this Policy, including but not limited to claiming all costs, fees and disbursements (including but not limited to legal fees) connected therewith.</p>
<p>In addition, where the User is also a member of the University community, the University may take such action, disciplinary or otherwise as it deems appropriate and which is in accordance with its Charter, Statute, Ordinances and Regulations.</p> 4 Other notes <p>Students are additionally reminded of Regulations for Students, particularly section 10.
