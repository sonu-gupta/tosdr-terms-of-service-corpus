</p>
<p>Users of our Services may be permitted to upload, post or transmit or otherwise make available content through our Services including, without limitation, any text, photographs, user videos, sound recordings and the musical works embodied therein ("User Content").
We may also from time to time make available functionalities that enable users of our Services to extract all or any portion of User Content created by another user to produce additional User Content, including collaborative User Content with other users, that combine and intersperse User Content generated by more than one user, or enable users to overlay music, graphics, stickers, virtual items, and other elements provided by Pico ("Pico Elements") onto User Content and transmit this User Content through our Services.
The information and materials in the User Content, including User Content that includes Pico Elements, have not been verified or approved by us.
The views expressed by other users on our Services do not represent our views or values.</p>
<p>Whenever you access or use a feature that allows you to upload or transmit User Content through our Services (including to third party platforms), or to make contact with other users of our Services, you must comply with the standards set out at "Your Access to and Use of Our Services" above.
You may also choose to upload or transmit your User Content, including User Content that includes Pico Elements, on sites or platforms hosted by third parties.
If you decide to do this, you must comply with their content guidelines as well as with the standards set out at "Your Access to and Use of Our Services" above.
You warrant that any such upload, transmission, and/or contact complies with those standards, and you shall be liable to us and fully indemnify us for any breach of that warranty -- this means you shall be fully responsible for any loss or damage we suffer as a result of your breach of this warranty.</p>
<p>You must not post any User Content on or through our Services or transmit to us any User Content that is confidential or proprietary.
Any User Content shall be deemed to be non-confidential and non-proprietary.</p>
<p>When you submit User Content through our Services, you agree and represent that you own that User Content, or that you have received all necessary permissions, clearances from, or are authorized by, the owner of any part of the content to submit it to our Services for all purposes contemplated under these Terms, to transmit it from our Services to other third party platforms, adopt or integrate any third party content (as the case may be), and grant us all licenses in User Content as contemplated under these Terms.
For example, if you only own the rights in and to a sound recording, but not to the underlying musical works embodied in such sound recordings, then you must not submit such sound recordings to our Services unless you have all permissions, clearances from, or are authorized by, the owner of any part of the content to submit it to our Services.
You must not expose us or other users to any intellectual property or other claims relating to User Content that you submit through our Services.</p>
<p>

<p>We may from time to time make available features that may allow you to control whether your User Content is made publicly available on our Services to all other users of our Services or only available to people you designate.
To restrict access to your User Content accordingly, it is your responsibility to select the appropriate setting, if available, within Pico or on such channel as we may designate.</p>
<p>Despite the above, we do not represent or warrant the accuracy, integrity, appropriateness, quality of any User Content, nor that the User Content does not infringe intellectual property rights, and under no circumstances shall we be liable in any way for any User Content (including for the avoidance of doubt any third party materials incorporated in User Content).
