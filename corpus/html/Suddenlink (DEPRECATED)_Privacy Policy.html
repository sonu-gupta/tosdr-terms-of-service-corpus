<li>
<strong>To Generate De-identified Information.</strong> We may use Customers’ PII to generate De-identified Information that cannot be reasonably linked to the Customer individually.
Subject to Section 8 below, our collection, use, and disclosure of De-identified Information is subject to our discretion and is not subject to any of the restrictions in this Policy.
For example, we may use De-identified Information for purposes such as measurement of viewership of programming and advertising, creation of tuning and viewing cohorts or segmentations, providing targeted content for our services or facilitating delivery of relevant third party advertising/promotional messages through our Services and on third party websites and other platforms.
However, we do provide you with the choice to opt out of the use of your De-identified Information to facilitate Targeted Third Party Advertising (see Section 5.c below).</li>
<li>
<strong>To Provide Advertising, Marketing and Recommendations.</strong> We use the Information we collect about Customers and their use of the Services and cable system to make program and content recommendations, to send promotional communications about the Services or other Altice product and service offerings, and for other First Party Advertising and Third Party Advertising purposes.
These promotional communications and advertisements may be directed to you because you subscribe to the Services, because of the way you use the Services, or because you live in a certain geographic area, or may be based on demographic and interest information that we collect or obtain from other sources.
For example, we may use Information to facilitate the display of First Party Advertising to you on other websites, mobile applications and devices.
When we do this, we may provide service providers with access to certain PII in order to facilitate the creation of de-identified audiences (for example, based on IP address, cookie ID, device ID or other persistent identifiers) and the placement of Targeted First Party Advertising.
If you are a Video or internet subscriber, we may also use these service providers to create similar audiences based in part on de-identified viewing or usage data and/or the IP address(es) we assign to facilitate the sending of Targeted Third Party Advertising that we think may be of interest to you.
Our sharing of information to facilitate Targeted Third Party Advertising is described in Sections 4.b and 4.c below.

Where we offer our own location-based applications, we provide you with notice and choice about whether specific location-tracking features available on your device are turned on.
Many types of wireless applications and services use device location data, including applications provided by other companies and wireless device operating systems.
When you are considering new third party applications or services, you should carefully review the location-based services' or application providers' privacy policies to learn how they collect and use your information.</li>
<li>
<strong>Retention of Information.</strong> We generally keep some or all Customer and User Information for as long as necessary for the purpose(s) for which it was collected or other business, tax or legal purposes.

<strong>SPECIAL RULES AND RIGHTS UNDER FEDERAL LAW</strong>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Cable Act and PII.</strong> The Cable Act imposes limitations with respect to the collection and disclosure of personally identifiable information by cable operators, unless you provide us consent to collect or disclose information in another fashion, such as by accepting this Privacy Policy as part of the sign-up process for our Services.
Generally speaking, cable operators may not use the cable system to collect personally identifiable information concerning subscribers without their prior consent except to obtain information necessary to render our cable service or other services to our subscribers or to detect unauthorized reception of cable communications.
In addition, subject to certain specified exceptions, cable operators generally may not disclose personally identifiable information without consent of the subscriber concerned.
Also, cable operators must take such actions as are necessary to prevent unauthorized access to such information by a person other than the subscriber or cable operator.
If we violate your rights, you may be entitled to bring a civil action in a federal court, which may award actual, liquidated, and punitive damages, fees and costs, and other remedies that may be available.
In addition, if anyone asks us to provide information about you, we may have to notify you, and you may have the right to appear in court.</li>
<li>
<strong>Communications Act and CPNI.</strong> Under federal law, you have a right as a VoIP Customer, and we have a duty, to protect the confidentiality of your CPNI data.
We restrict access to your CPNI.
For example, call detail records, which contain information about the calls you make are available online.
In order to access call detail records online, you must have a Suddenlink ID and password.
All other CPNI is restricted by requiring a password and/or by requiring that you provide certain non-public verification information over the phone to confirm your identity.
A written request may also be used to obtain your CPNI.
You must send the written request to Suddenlink at 200 Jericho Quadrangle, Jericho, NY 11753, Attn.
Shared Services - CDR.
All requests will be verified.<br>
<br> Altice also restricts the use of your telephone CPNI.

We may, however, use telephone CPNI or share de-identified information to tailor your service and to market related Optimum Voice products and services to you.</li>

<strong>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS.</strong> The California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA), Cal.
Civ.
Code §§ 1798.100-1798.199, requires that "Businesses" (as defined in the CCPA) provide CA Residents with information regarding the personal information collected, disclosed and sold about them.
The CCPA definition of personal information ("CA Personal Information") is broader than the definition of PII in Section 1.i above and may include information we collect when you use the Services or visit the Website, such as IP addresses, cookie IDs, and device IDs, to the extent such information is reasonably capable of being associated with or linked to a particular consumer or household.
We consider ourselves to be a Business with respect to the CA Personal Information we collect from Subscribers who are CA Residents when they provide it to us, use our Services, or visit our Website as described in Section 2 above.
We also consider ourselves to be a Business with respect to certain licensed demographic data we collect from third parties (see Section 2.c) as well as information we collect from non-Customer Users of the Website (see Section 2.d).
The CCPA provides CA Residents the right to know about the CA Personal Information collected, disclosed or sold about them by us as a Business, the right to request that we delete their CA Personal Information (subject to certain exceptions), and the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by us for exercising any of these privacy rights.
<ol>

<strong>Disclosure and Sale of CA Personal Information.</strong> The CCPA distinguishes between the disclosure of CA Personal Information for business or commercial purposes and the "sale" of CA Personal Information.
We consider our sharing of CA Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy and summarized in the chart above to the disclosure of such information for business or commercial purposes.
We do not sell Customers’ or Website Users’ CA Personal Information.</li>
<li>
<strong>Right to Know and Deletion Requests.</strong> CA Residents have the right to request that we disclose the categories and/or specific information of CA Personal Information we have collected about them, the categories of sources of that information, the business or commercial purposes for which the information was collected, and the categories of third parties with whom it was shared ("Right to Know Requests").
CA Residents also have the right to request that we delete the CA Personal Information that we have collected from them subject to certain exceptions, such as maintaining the information to continue to provide our services ("Deletion Requests").<br>
<br> We will only be able to honor Right to Know and Deletion Requests for CA Residents whose identities we can verify, which is limited to current or former Customers.
We have no reasonable way to verify the identity of a CA Resident Website User who is not a current or former Customer, as the CA Personal Information we collect about these Users as a Business is limited to the information automatically collected on the Website as described in Section 2.d.<br>
<br> CA Residents who are existing or former Customers, or their authorized agents (see Section 8.d below), may submit Right to Know and Deletion Requests by using the online form (available here), or may contact us at 1-806-418-8888.</li>
<br>
<li>
<strong>Authorized Agents.</strong> CA Residents may use an authorized agent to submit a Right to Know or Deletion Request on their behalf provided that the CA Resident gives the authorized agent written permission to do so, the authorized agent submits verifiable proof of such written permission and their identity to us, and the CA Resident subsequently verifies to us that permission has been provided.
In the event a request is received by an authorized agent, we will follow up with both the agent and CA Resident seeking additional information to verify identities and ensure that a signed Authorized Agent permission form (available here) has been completed and submitted.</li>
<li>
<strong>CCPA Questions.</strong> If you are a CA Resident or authorized agent with questions regarding your rights under the CCPA you may contact us at CCPA@alticeusa.com or at the mailing address set forth in Section 9&nbsp;below.</li>
<li>
<strong>Shine the Light Law (Cal.
Civ.
Code § 1798.83).</strong> A separate California law requires that we provide CA Residents with notice and choice with respect to the disclosure of their personal information to third parties for marketing purposes.
If you request it, we will provide you with a notice of your right to prevent sharing of your personal information as well as a cost-free means of doing so.
You may request such a notice by submitting a written request to customer.service@suddenlink.net specifying that you seek your "California Customer Choice Notice." Please allow thirty days for a response.</li>
