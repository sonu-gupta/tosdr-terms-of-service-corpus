<br>
<br> We may also disclose account information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms and Conditions of Use or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, other users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.

<b>What is your policy on allowing me to update, correct, or delete my personally identifiable information?</b>
</p> You may edit your account information at any time by using your User ID and password.
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>

<b>What security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of my information?</b>
</p> Your account information is password protected so that you and only you have access to this personal information.
You may edit your account information by using your User ID and password.
<br>
<br> We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone.
We will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email.
Also remember to sign out of your account and close your browser window when you have finished your work.
This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe.
<br>
<br> Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk.
Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>What else should I know about my privacy?</b>
</p> Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online, for example on message boards, through email, or in chat areas that information can be collected and used by others.
In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.
<br>
<br> Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information.
Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online.
