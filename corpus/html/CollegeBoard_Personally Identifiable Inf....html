</ol> Personally Identifiable Information Collected <p>You don’t need to create an online account to view most of our website, but you do need an account to register for tests, view and send scores, personalize your web experience, or use certain tools on our site.</p>

Students can also give us a parent or guardian’s first and last name and email address to include parent or guardian information in Student Search Service, opt in to CC a Parent, or the parent newsletter.
Do not share your preferred first name with us if you do not want your parent/guardian to see it.
