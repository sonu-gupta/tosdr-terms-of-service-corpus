Links<p>The Services may integrate with and/or provide links to various other independent third-party products and/or services (“Linked Sites”) that may be of interest to you and are for your convenience only.&nbsp.
PandaDoc does not control and/or endorse such Linked Sites and is not responsible for their content nor is it responsible for the accuracy and/or reliability of any information, data, opinions, advice and/or statements contained within such Linked Sites.&nbsp.

Miscellaneous<p>16.1.
Entire Agreement.
Conflict.&nbsp.

(“JAMS”) by three arbitrators appointed in accordance with such Rules.

The prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce the Terms shall be entitled to costs and attorneys’ fees.&nbsp.

<p>(i)&nbsp.
Waiver of Jury Trial.
THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration.&nbsp.
Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court.

<p>16.4.
Reference.
You agree that we may reference you as our customer, and that we may reasonably use, on a royalty-free basis, your trademark and/or logo for such purpose.</p>

<p>16.6.
Assignment.
&nbsp.
You may not assign your rights under the Terms to any other party without PandaDoc’s express prior written consent.
PandaDoc may assign its rights under the Terms without condition.
