<br>
<strong>9.
Cookies and Tracking.</strong>
<br>
<br> Herbalife, as well as certain third parties that provide content and other functionality on our Sites, use cookies, web beacons, session replay/screen capture, and other similar technologies for various purposes, including to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the Sites and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.<br>
<br> Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored on computer hard drives.
A cookie enables the entity that put the cookie on your device to recognize it across different websites, services, devices, and browsing sessions.
For example, we may use cookies to recognize you when you return to the Sites in order to provide you with a better user experience.
We may allow third parties to use cookies on the Sites, but we do not control the use or contents of third-party cookies.
Web browsers often allow you to configure the browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is sent.
If you elect to reject cookies, please note that you may not be able to take full advantage of the features and functions of the Sites.
To learn more about cookies and how to manage them, please visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org/.<br>
<br> Web beacons and similar technologies are small bits of code, which are embedded in web pages, advertisements, and emails, that communicate with third parties.
We use web beacons, for example, to count the number of users who have visited a particular webpage, to deliver or communicate with cookies, and to understand usage patterns.
We also may include web beacons in emails to understand whether messages have been opened, acted on, or forwarded.<br>
<br> There are other local storage and internet technologies, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as “Flash cookies”), HTML5 local storage and embed scripts, which can operate similarly to the cookies discussed above.
Please note that these technologies are distinct from cookies, and you may not be able to control them using standard browser tools and settings.
For information about managing Flash cookies, please click www.adobe.com/privacy.html.

<br> We may use Bluetooth beacon technology to improve the Nutrition Club experience.
Mobile devices that have enabled Bluetooth can receive a signal when in range of a beacon.
The signals will not be received unless the user has turned on Bluetooth, installed an Herbalife mobile application and enabled push notifications.
The beacon functionality may allow for notifications, customer check-ins, and payments.
You can disable the beacon functionality in the app’s settings.<br>
<br>
<strong>10.
Do Not Track.</strong>
<br>
<br> Web browsers may allow you to send “Do Not Track” requests.
We do not currently take actions to respond to Do Not Track signals because there is no current industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals.
We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard if and when one is created.<br>
<br>
<strong>11.
Online Advertising.</strong>
<br>
<br> We may display advertising on our website and partner with third parties to manage advertising on other websites for our products and services.
We may also partner with third parties, including business partners, advertising networks, and other advertising service providers, who gather information about you on our Sites and other sites to provide you with advertisements on the Sites and elsewhere online based on your browsing history and tailored to your interests, preferences, and characteristics.
Cookies or other similar technologies may be used to provide you with advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests.
We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties, and the information practices of these third parties are not covered by this Policy.<br>
<br> Some third parties collect information about users of our Sites to provide interest-based advertising on our Sites and elsewhere, including across browsers and devices.
These third parties may use the information they collect on our Sites to make predictions about your interests in order to provide you ads (from us and other companies) across the internet.
Some of these third parties may participate in industry-developed programs designed to provide consumers with choices about whether to receive targeted advertising.
Due to differences between using apps and websites on mobile devices, you may need to take additional steps to disable targeted ad technologies in mobile apps.
Many mobile devices allow you to opt out of targeted advertising for mobile apps using the settings within the mobile app or your mobile device.
For more information, please check your mobile settings.
You also may uninstall our apps using the standard uninstall process available on your mobile device or app marketplace.<br>
<br> To opt out of interest-based advertising across browsers and devices from companies that participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance or Network Advertising Initiative opt-out programs, please visit the websites operated by the Network Advertising Initiative (//www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (//www.aboutads.info/choices/).
You may also be able to opt out of interest-based advertising through the settings within the mobile app or your mobile device, but your opt-out choice may apply only to the browser or device you are using when you opt out, so you should opt out on each of your browsers and devices if you want to disable all cross-device linking for interest-based advertising.
Further information in local languages may be available at www.youronlinechoices.com/.
If you are located in the European Union, more information is available at http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/.
Please note that even if you use an industry-based opt-out for interest-based advertising, you will continue to receive generic advertisements and your experience on our Sites may be degraded.<br>
<br>
<strong>12.
Online Forums.</strong>
<br>
<br> The Sites may offer publicly accessible community forums.
You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas is public and may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.

In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information.<br>

<br>
<br> The Sites may contain links to websites operated and maintained by third parties over which we have no control.
Any information you provide to third-party websites will be governed under the terms of each websites' privacy policy and we encourage you to investigate such policies before disclosing any information to the operators of third-party websites.
We have no responsibility or liability for the content, actions or policies of third-party websites.
The inclusion of links to third-party websites on our Sites in no way constitutes an endorsement of such websites' content, actions or policies.<br>
<br>
<strong>14.
Third-Party Functionality.</strong>
<br>
<br> Some of the functionality on the Sites may be provided by third parties that are not affiliated with Herbalife.
These entities may collect or receive certain information about your use of the Sites, including through the use of cookies, Web beacons, and similar technologies.
Herbalife is not responsible for the privacy practices of these entities.<br>
<br> If you access third-party services, such as Facebook, Google, or Twitter, through the Sites, to log in to the Sites or to share information about your experience on the Sites with others, these third-party services may be able to collect information about you, including information about your activity on the Site, and they may notify your connections on the third-party services about your use of the Site, in accordance with their own privacy policies.<br>
<br>
<strong>15.

<strong>Rights</strong>
<br>
<br>
If you are a California resident, you may have certain rights.
California law may permit you to request that we:
<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Provide you the categories of personal information we collect or disclose about you.
the categories of sources of such information.
the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information.
and the categories of third parties with whom we share personal information</li>
<br>
<br>
<li>Provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you</li>
<br>
<br>
<li>Delete certain information we have about you</li>
</ul>
<br>
You may have the right to receive information about the financial incentives that we offer to you.
You also have the right to not be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for certain exercising of your rights.
Certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law.
We need certain types of information so that we can provide the services to you.
If you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access or use the Site.
<br>
<br>
Some of our Sites allow you to review and update your personal information or cancel certain provisions of your Herbalife Nutrition Distributorship.
If you are a California resident and you want to exercise any of the rights listed in this provision or for assistance with any of these rights, please make your request at privacy@herbalife.com or call 1-888-926-8905.
This line is open Monday to Friday from 8:00 a.m.
to 5:00 p.m.
Pacific Standard Time.
<br>
<br>
If you are asserting your right to access a copy of certain information or your right to delete certain information, you will be asked to verify your identity before we fulfill your request.
This verification process may require you to provide your Distributorship ID, or other pieces of personal information that we already hold on you, or, in certain circumstances, a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that you are the consumer whose personal information is the subject of the request.
<br>
<br>
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.
If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
<br>
<br>
You can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf.
To do so, you must provide us with written authorization or a power of attorney, signed by you, for the agent to act on your behalf.
You will still need to verify your identity directly with us.
<br>
<br>
The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) sets forth certain obligations for businesses that “sell” personal information.
Based on the definition of “sell” under the CCPA and under current regulatory guidance, we do not believe we engage in such activity and have not engaged in such activity in the past 12 months.

<br>
<br>
Residents of the State of California also have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties, if any, to which the company has disclosed personal information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes (e.g., requests made in 2016 will receive information about 2015 sharing activities).
We comply with this law by offering California residents the ability to tell us not to share your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
To make such a request, please email us at privacy@herbalife.com.
You must include the name of this Site and “California Resident” as the subject line, and your full name, email address, and postal address in your message.
Please note that any request under this paragraph will be limited to Herbalife's use and disclosure of your personal information.
You will need to make the same request of your Herbalife Independent Distributor if you would like to obtain information about any disclosure that he or she has made of your personal information.
<br>
<br>

<br>
We do not engage in such activity.
