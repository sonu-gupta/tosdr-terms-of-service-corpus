LIMITATION OF LIABILITY <p>You understand that when using the Services, you will be exposed to other users and to User Content from a variety of sources, and that users or User Content may be inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or objectionable.
You may also access third party content or services.&nbsp.
MediaLab does not control you or other users’ conduct or the User Content, nor any third party content or services, and therefore we are not responsible for them.
MediaLab also does not endorse any user or User Content or any opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed therein.
You assume all risk arising from your use of the Services, including but not limited to all of the risks associated with any online or offline interactions with other users or with any third party content or services.
You agree to take any and all necessary precautions when interacting with other users and with third party content and services.</p>

This includes, without limitation, Losses from your use of or inability to use the Services or the Service Materials, from reliance on any information obtained through the Services or that result from the online or offline conduct of you or anyone else in connection with the Services (including without limitation bodily injury, death or property damage), from deletion of files, accounts, or User Content, and/or from mistakes, omissions, interruptions, errors, defects, viruses, delays in operation or transmission, or any failure of performance, whether or not resulting from acts of God, communications failure, theft, destruction or unauthorized access to MediaLab’s or the MediaLab Parties’ records, programs or Services.</p>
<p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the aggregate liability of MediaLab or the MediaLab parties for any Losses, whether in contract, warranty, tort (including negligence, whether active, passive or imputed), product liability, strict liability or other theory, arising out of or relating to the use of or inability to use the Services or to these Terms exceed the greater of:&nbsp.
(i) any compensation you paid, if any, to MediaLab for access to or use of the Services for the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the Loss.
or (ii) the amount of $100.00.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages, so some or all of the exclusions and limitations in this Section may not apply to you.
If you do not agree to this limitation of liability, your remedy is to terminate your account and discontinue using the Services.</p> 14.&nbsp.
MODIFICATIONS TO THE SERVICES <p>MediaLab reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Services, or any features or portions of the Services or Service Materials, without prior notice.
You agree that MediaLab will not be liable for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Services or Service Materials, or any part thereof.</p> 15.&nbsp.
DISPUTES—ARBITRATION <p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.&nbsp.
IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM MEDIALAB.</p>
<p>Any dispute, claim, or cause of action arising out of or relating in any way to these Terms, the Services, or Service Materials (we call these “Disputes”), shall be resolved by confidential binding arbitration on an individual basis, rather than in court, except as otherwise stated herein.&nbsp.
You and MediaLab each waive your respective rights to a jury trial for Disputes.
This arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
<p>As an exception to the arbitration requirement, the following disputes may be brought in court:&nbsp.
(i) any dispute that seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property (such as copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents) may be brought in court.
(ii) any claim of interference or attempted interference with our Services.
and (iii) disputes regarding the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision.&nbsp.
In addition, either party may assert the Dispute in small claims court if the Dispute qualifies.</p>
<p>You and MediaLab agree that Disputes are personal and therefore, class actions and class arbitrations are not permitted.
Neither you nor MediaLab will commence against the other a class action, class arbitration or other representative action or proceeding that would affect other users of the Services.
The arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.</p>
<p>Any arbitration under this provision shall be held in Los Angeles, California (or, alternatively, via telephone or video conference) before and in accordance with the applicable rules of JAMS, which are available on the JAMS website.
You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS or waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.
Arbitrations shall be conducted in English.&nbsp.
All documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.</p>
<p>As limited by the Federal Arbitration Act, these Terms, and the applicable JAMS rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any individual Dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court (excluding class arbitrations or representative actions as noted above).&nbsp.
Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>
<p>You and MediaLab agree that you will notify each other in writing of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises before filing for arbitration.
Notice to MediaLab must be sent to kiklawenforcement@medialab.la.&nbsp.
If the Dispute is not resolved informally between the parties within thirty (30) days of the date of notice, then either party may initiate arbitration in accordance with these Terms.</p>
<p>Any Dispute must be filed within eighteen months after it arose.
otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.</p>
<p>Opt-Out of Arbitration:&nbsp.
You have the right within thirty (30) days of first accepting these Terms to decline this agreement to arbitrate.&nbsp.
To do so, you must send written notice with your name, address, username, email address or phone number that you use for your Service account, identify the Service(s) you use, and clearly state that you want to opt out of the Terms of Service arbitration agreement.&nbsp.
Send this notice to: 1222 6th St., Santa Monica, CA 90401.</p>
<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding after providing MediaLab the required notice, MediaLab will pay the filing fees, administration and hearing costs, and arbitrator fees if the arbitration seeks less than US $10,000 and the Dispute is not determined to be frivolous or improper by the arbitrator.
We will also pay the fees and costs for any arbitration that we initiate.
For all other Disputes, the fees and costs shall be paid according to the JAMS rules, including rules regarding frivolous or improper claims.&nbsp.
The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.</p> 16.&nbsp.
APPLICABLE LAW AND VENUE <p>These Terms and your use of the Services shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of California without resort to its conflict of law provisions.
To the extent the arbitration requirement does not apply (if ever), you agree that any action at law or in equity for any Dispute shall be filed only in the state and federal courts located in Los Angeles County, California and you hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts over any suit, action or proceeding for any Dispute.</p> 17.&nbsp.
