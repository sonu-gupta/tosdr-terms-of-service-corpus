The Privacy Policy on our child-directed Services will automatically link to this section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
CHILDREN’S PRIVACY POLICY
<p>PRH respects the privacy of children and we are committed to complying with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).
This Children’s Privacy Policy describes our practices with respect to the collection of Personal Information and Other Information (as defined above, see section labeled What Personal Information We Collect About You) from children under the age of 13.
This Site does not knowingly collect, use, or disclose Personal Information from children under the age of 13 without prior parental consent, except as permitted by COPPA.</p>
<p>
<b>What Information We Collect and How We Use It</b>
</p>
<p>We do not require children to share any Personal Information in order to participate on this Site.&nbsp.
On occasion, however, we may collect Personal Information, such as an email address from a child as part of an activity, in accordance with COPPA.&nbsp.
For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>
<i>Email address</i>
</b>: We may collect a child’s email address in order to respond to a one-time request from the child, such as if the child asks us or one of our authors a question.&nbsp.
In such case, we promptly delete the child’s email address from our system once we have responded, and we do not use the child’s email address for any other purpose.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<b>
<i>Send-a-friend</i>
</b>: In the case of send-a-friend email or card, we only collect a child’s first name and the friend’s email address to send the friend the email or card.<b>&nbsp.
</b>We do not store the friend’s email address for any longer than reasonably necessary to send the email or card to the friend.
<b>
</b>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<b>
<i>Contests or Sweepstakes</i>
</b>: We may collect a child’s email address to enter the child in a sweepstakes or contest or to notify the child that he or she has won or lost a contest or sweepstakes or contest.&nbsp.
We will not keep the child’s email address after the promotion or use the child’s email address for any other purpose other than for the promotion.&nbsp.
For certain promotions, we may ask that a child give us his/her parent’s email address so we can obtain more personalized information for prize fulfillment purposes if the child wins the promotion or to notify the parent if we need more than the child’s email address to enter the child in the promotion.
In the latter event,<b>
</b>parents will be sent a notice along with instructions on how they may provide their consent for their child to participate in such promotion.
</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also collect Other Information automatically from your child’s computer or device, such as the frequency with which the child visits our Site and the pages visited, to support the internal operations of the Site.&nbsp.
We collect this information so we can understand and monitor usage of the Site, customize content on the Site and improve the performance of the Site.<b>
</b>This information is collected using technologies such as cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies.&nbsp.
This information is not used to behaviorally target children and we do not permit behavioral targeting on any of our Services that are directed to children.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>Special Circumstances for Information Sharing and Security</b>
<b>&nbsp;</b>
</p>
<p>We may share children’s personal information with “Third Party Service Providers” and “Other Third Parties When Required by Law” as disclosed above (see “With Whom We Share Your Personal Information”).</p>
<p>
<b>Parent’s Rights</b>&nbsp.
<br>
Under COPPA, you have the right to review and have any of your child’s information deleted from our records.&nbsp.
You also have the right to tell us to stop collecting or using your child’s personal information.
If you have questions concerning our information practices with respect to children, or if you would like to review, have deleted, or stop the further collection of your child’s personal information in connection with the transaction for which it was originally collected, you may email us at privacy@penguinrandomhouse.com.
