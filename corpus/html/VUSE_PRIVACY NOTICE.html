or (ii) where we do not need to do this because we already have this information, from the date we received your request.<br>
<br>
Right to object<br>
<br>
This right enables you to object to us processing your personal information where we do so for one of the following reasons: <br>
<br>
•	where we rely on our legitimate interests to do process your information;<br>
•	to enable us to perform a task in the public interest or exercise official authority.

Otherwise we will provide you with our justification as to why we need to continue using your personal information.<br>
<br>
Right to withdraw consent <br>
<br>
Where we have obtained your consent to process your personal information for certain activities (for example, for marketing), you may withdraw this consent at any time and we will cease to use your personal information for that purpose unless we consider that there is an alternative legal basis to justify our continued processing of your data for this purpose, in which case we will inform you of this condition.
If you withdraw your consent, our use of your personal information before you withdraw is still lawful.<br>
<br>
To withdraw your consent to marketing communications, please use the unsubscribe tool in the relevant communication.<br>
<br>
Right of access (‘Data Subject Access Requests’)<br>

You may ask us for a copy of the information we hold about you at any time, and request us to modify, update or delete such information.

<br>

<br>
•	the data is no longer necessary.
<br>
•	you have withdrawn your consent to us using your data, and there is no other valid reason for us to continue.
<br>
•	the data has been processed unlawfully.
<br>
•	it is necessary for the data to be erased in order for us to comply with our obligations under law.
or <br>
•	you object to the processing of your data and we are unable to demonstrate overriding legitimate grounds for our continued processing.
<br>
<br>
We would only be entitled to refuse to comply with your request for erasure in limited circumstances and we will always tell you our reason for doing so.<br>
<br>
When complying with a valid request for the erasure of data we will take all reasonably practicable steps to delete the relevant data.
<br>
<br>
Right to restrict processing <br>
<br>
You have the right to request that we restrict our processing of your personal information in certain circumstances, for example if you dispute the accuracy of the personal information that we hold about you, you object to our processing of your personal information for our legitimate interests or you require us to keep it in connection with legal proceedings.
If we have shared your personal information with third parties, we will notify them about the restricted processing unless this is impossible or involves disproportionate effort.
We will, of course, notify you before lifting any restriction on processing your personal information.<br>

Where we think that it is reasonable for us not to comply with your request, we will explain our reasons for this decision.<br>
<br>
Right of data portability <br>
<br>
If you wish, you have the right to transfer your personal information between service providers where we rely on your consent or the performance of your contract as the lawful basis to use that information.
In effect, this means that you are able to transfer the details we hold on you to another third party.
To allow you to do so, we will provide you with your data in a commonly used machine-readable format so that you can transfer the data.
Alternatively, we may directly transfer the data for you if technically possible.<br>
<br>
Rights relating to automated decisions<br>
<br>
In certain circumstances, you may contest a decision made about you based purely on automated processing and where the processing is not required by law.
