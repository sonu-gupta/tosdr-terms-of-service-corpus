<strong>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</strong>These Terms are governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State of California, without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of laws of such state, and are binding upon the parties hereto in the United States and worldwide.
You and Halloweenville agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to the interpretation or construction of these Terms.<strong>YOU AND HALLOWEENVILLE AGREE THAT ALL CLAIMS WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION IN THE MANNER SPECIFIED IN THIS SECTION 10 AND THAT YOU AND HALLOWEENVILLE WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO BRING SUCH CLAIMS BEFORE ANY COURT OF LAW.</strong>
<strong>YOU AND HALLOWEENVILLE FURTHER AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.
OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT, SUCH AS ACCESS TO DISCOVERY, ALSO MAY BE UNAVAILABLE OR LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.</strong>Any dispute between you and Halloweenville and its agents, employees, officers, directors, principals, successors, assigns, subsidiaries or affiliates (collectively for purposes of this Section 10, “Halloweenville Parties”) arising from or relating to these Terms and their interpretation or the breach, termination or validity thereof, the relationships which result from these Terms, including disputes about the validity, scope or enforceability of this agreement to arbitration (collectively, “Covered Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration in the U.S.
State of California administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) in accordance with its International Arbitration Rules in effect on the date thereof.
<p>Prior to initiating any arbitration, the initiating party will give the other party at least 60 days’ advanced written notice of its intent to file for arbitration.
Halloweenville will provide such notice by mail or e-mail using the contact information on file with Halloweenville and you must provide such notice by mail to My Treat Bag LLC, Attn: Arbitration Team / ESQgo, PC, 303 North Glenoaks Blvd, Suite 200, Burbank, CA 91502.</p>
<p>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules.
If, however, you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be cost-prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, Halloweenville will pay as much of the filing, administration and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive for you.
If the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration are frivolous, you agree to reimburse Halloweenville for all fees associated with the arbitration that Halloweenville paid on your behalf, which you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA’s rules.</p>
<p>A single arbitrator will be selected in accordance with the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules.
The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language.
The arbitrator will have the power to grant whatever relief would be available in court under law or in equity and any award of the arbitrator will be final and binding on each of the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
The arbitrator will not, however, have the power to award punitive or exemplary damages, the right to which each party hereby waives.
The arbitrator will apply applicable law and the provisions of these Terms and the failure to do so will be deemed an excess of arbitral authority and grounds for judicial review.
The arbitrator’s decision must be with written explanation and remain confidential.</p>
<p>Halloweenville and you agree that any Covered Dispute will be submitted to arbitration on an individual basis only.
<strong>Neither Halloweenville nor you are entitled to arbitrate any Covered Dispute as a class, representative or private-attorney action and the arbitrator will have no authority to proceed on a class, representative or private attorney general basis.</strong> If any provision of the agreement to arbitrate in this Section 10 is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced (but in no case will there be a class, representative or private attorney general arbitration).
Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, notice on any claim arising from or related to these Terms must be made within one (1) year after such claim arose or be forever barred.
For purposes of this Section 10, these Terms and related transactions will be subject to and governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.
sec.
1-16 (FAA).</p>
<p>
<strong>Please Note:</strong> By agreeing to these Terms, you explicitly agree that any claims or actions that you may otherwise have against Halloweenville under the laws of any jurisdiction outside the United States are hereby waived, including without limitation, any claims or actions under the laws of your own country, and that your sole location and applicable law for any dispute is in the United States according to the terms of this Section 10.</p>
