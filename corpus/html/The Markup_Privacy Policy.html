        
<p>The Markup investigates how powerful institutions use technology to change our society.
We make a promise to you, our readers: The Markup will collect as little personal information about you as possible when you visit our site, and we will never monetize this data.
We do not intend to display advertisements on our site, because they so often contain tracking technology.</p>
<p>We do want to collect some basic information so we can better serve you.
The data we collect includes information about the device and software you use to access our Website (user-agent header), the time of your visit, and the page you were visiting before arriving at our Website (referrer header).
We generally attempt to prevent the logging of your IP addresses.
However, we may need to log them from time to time, for example to mitigate abuse or investigate issues with our site.
We will keep such data only for as long as is needed.</p>
<p>Some of you voluntarily share some personal information with us when you sign up for newsletters or to be contacted by us.
We will not rent, lease, or sell this voluntarily submitted data to third parties without your explicit consent, unless required by law.
If we are compelled to share data about users with law enforcement, we will attempt to give notice to those users.</p>
<p>We will, by necessity, share your email address with our email service provider, Revue.
Please consult Revue’s privacy policy for further details.</p>
<p>We also collect data from donors when they donate to support our work.
As with all other personal information, we do not share, loan, trade, rent, or sell donor information to third parties, nor will we send mailings to our donors on behalf of any other organization.
If you share personal information with The Markup, it stays with The Markup.</p>
<p>Our donor payment processor is Stripe, whose privacy policy is here.
In order to comply with credit card processing requirements, The Markup’s Website includes third-party javascript from Stripe that may contain other tracking.
However, this content is only loaded upon clicking the “Donate!” button on the donations page.
We also use hCaptcha (whose privacy policy is here) to minimize credit card testing fraud on our website.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We maintain historical records of donor giving histories for certain types of gifts.
This information is gathered so The Markup can properly acknowledge gifts for IRS purposes and is also used by The Markup to analyze giving histories.
This applies to donations and donor information received both online and offline.</p>
<p>We take reasonable steps to protect the data that we collect.
The data that we store is encrypted.
We use HTTPS to encrypt the data sent to and from our Website.</p>
<p>We do not use “cookies,” a technology that would allow us to identify unique users by a temporary device-related ID.
We host our Website on Amazon Web Services, whose privacy policy is here.</p>
<p>Our privacy policy will likely evolve as our Website evolves.
We promise to update it when our practices change and to be transparent about what we’ve changed and why we’ve made those changes.</p>

“Legitimate interest” also references our use of your data in ways you would reasonably expect.
We have a legitimate interest in collecting and processing personal information, for example, to administer and generally conduct business within The Markup, to prevent fraud, and to ensure that our networks and information are secure.</p> ↩ link <strong>How We Share Your&nbsp;Information</strong>

These entities have access to the personal information needed to perform their functions and are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of any personal information collected from the Website.
They are restricted from using, selling, distributing, or altering this data in any way other than to provide the requested services to The Markup.</p>

Third-Party&nbsp;Websites</strong>
<p>Much of the Website and communications infrastructure, including donations, is operated by third-party service providers (“Service Providers”), and we may share your information with these Service Providers in order to operate the Website.
You can find a list of Service Providers we are currently using at the bottom of this page.</p>
<p>The Markup cannot control how our Service Providers may collect, use, and share your personal information.
We recommend you familiarize yourself with their policies, especially if you have privacy concerns.</p>
<p>The Website may contain links to websites operated by third parties (collectively, “Third-Party Sites”).

<p>We maintain historical records of donor giving histories for certain types of gifts.
This information is gathered so The Markup can properly acknowledge gifts for IRS purposes and is also used by The Markup to analyze giving histories.
Donor information may be made available to Service Providers but only as necessary to process the donation or for The Markup to provide its services.
This section applies to donations and donor information received online or offline.</p>
<p>See also The Markup’s Donation Policy.</p> ↩ link <strong>Updating or Removing Your&nbsp;Information</strong>

<p>In your request, please state what personal information you would like to have changed, or otherwise let us know what limitations you would like to put on our use of your personal information.
For your protection, we only implement requests with respect to the personal information associated with the particular email address that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request.
We will respond to your request consistent with applicable law.</p>
<p>Your consent to our use of your information is very important to us.

A list of EU data protection authorities is available at https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/item-detail.cfm?item_id=612080.</p> ↩ link <strong>Children’s&nbsp;Privacy</strong>
<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important.
The Website is intended for general audiences and is not directed to children under 13.
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>
<p>If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under 13 years old may have provided personally identifiable information through the Website, please contact us at privacy@themarkup.org.</p> ↩ link <strong>Data Storage and&nbsp;Retention</strong>
<p>We retain personal information for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was obtained and consistent with applicable law.</p>
<p>The criteria used to determine our retention periods include: whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example, certain laws require us to keep records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete them), or whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (for example, in light of applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).</p>
<p>The Markup’s server logs are stored and retained indefinitely.</p>
<p>Email subscription information is retained until you unsubscribe from the mailing list(s).</p>
<p>If you communicate by email with The Markup, we may keep records of those communications indefinitely.</p>
<p>Financial records of donations and other transactions are kept indefinitely.
Check copies and payment distribution details are normally kept for up to seven years.
Accompanying donor information is kept indefinitely unless the individual requests that it be removed.</p>
<p>If we inadvertently collect more personal information than intended, we endeavor to delete the extraneous information.
When we no longer need to retain information or when deleting information on request, we endeavor to remove all copies.
However, please understand that deleted information may continue to persist on backup media.</p> ↩ link <strong>Security</strong>
<p>The Markup employs reasonable measures to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control, including appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.
We use HTTPS to encrypt the data sent to and from our Website.</p>
<p>Although we make good faith efforts to store information collected by The Markup in a secure operating environment, we cannot guarantee complete security.</p> ↩ link <strong>EU Users—International&nbsp;Transfers</strong>
<p>The Markup is based in the United States.
Information you provide to us is collected in your country and then transferred to the United States or to another country in which we have facilities or in which we engage Service Providers.</p>
<p>Third parties with whom we share your data may be based outside the EEA, and their processing of your personal data may involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.</p>
<p>When your data is transferred outside the EEA, we take steps to make sure it has the same level of protection as it would have in the EEA.
Our agreements with third parties make clear the standards we expect of them in order to safeguard your information and your legal rights.</p> ↩ link <strong>Changes to This&nbsp;Policy</strong>
<p>The Markup’s Privacy Policy will change from time to time without notice, and your continued use of the Website following any revision to the Privacy Policy will be deemed to be your consent to any revised Privacy Policy.
