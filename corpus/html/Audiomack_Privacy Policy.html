<strong>10 - Changes to the Privacy Policy</strong>
</p>
<p>Since day one, Audiomack has cared deeply about privacy and respecting our users.
Protecting your data is extremely important to us, and this page will help you understand how and why we collect, store, transmit, protect, and delete your data.</p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy is designed to do two things: protect individual user privacy, and support free listening that pays artists, labels, and content creators.</p>
<p>Listeners deserve a great music service even if they can’t afford a monthly subscription.
To make this work on Audiomack, we use digital advertising to pay artists for plays and invest in improving our service.
This model is designed to provide access to streaming music without compromising individual privacy.
Our users are anonymous to advertisers, and can delete their data from our system completely whenever they decide to.</p>
<p>Before we get into all the details, let’s talk about your rights as an Audiomack user.
We’ve put together a User Bill of Rights, written in plain english, that clearly outlines how and when your data is used on our platforms.</p>User Bill of Rights1 - Audiomack will only collect the minimum amount of data necessary.<p>Audiomack will only collect and store <strong>the absolute minimum amount of data possible</strong> to effectively run our platform.
We will, for example, store data on what songs you play on our platform to enable better recommendations in the future, let artists know when their music is being listened to, and provide our label partners with aggregate stream counts necessary for accounting.</p>2 - Audiomack does not sell data.<p>Many apps, both ad-supported and subscription based, take their user data and sell it to data brokers, location companies, and other third parties for a lump sum or recurring payment.
<strong>Audiomack does not sell your personal data to third parties, period.</strong>
</p>3 - Audiomack does not transmit private or sensitive data to ad providers.<p>We need to run ads to keep our service alive.
When you stream a song on Audiomack, a rightsholder (artist, record label, etc) gets paid out on that stream, meaning we must create some revenue in exchange for your usage of the platform.
For users who do not want to subscribe, this means we must run ads.</p>
<p>Examples of data we may transfer to advertisers are IDFA or Android Advertising ID for app users, non-identifiable browser information for web users (language, browser name, e.g.
Chrome or Safari, etc), genre of a song being listened to, and location to ensure ads reach a user in the correct country and city.</p>
<p>
<strong>Most importantly, we do not allow ad providers to tie an ad request (when your mobile device or browser “requests” an ad on page load) to your Audiomack profile.</strong> An ad provider does not, for example, receive your name, username, email address, photo, listening history, or phone number as part of the ad request.</p>4 - You may request account and data deletion at any time, for any reason.<p>If you want to delete your account and your personal data, you can contact us by sending an email to privacy@audiomack.com from the email address associated with your account OR by logging into your account and submitting a support ticket requesting that Audiomack erase any and all personal data tied to your account.
Alternatively, you may delete your account using our user dashboard.</p>5 - Audiomack will take all reasonable steps to protect your account and data.<p>We use best-in-class data storage systems, encryption, and vendors to ensure your data and account on Audiomack stay secure.
</p>
<p>In the next sections, we’ll dive into a lot more detail about how data is collected, stored, and protected on our platform.
If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to support@audiomack.com.</p>1 - Introduction/Overview<p>This Privacy Policy explains how Audiomack, a music service and mobile app owned and operated by Audiomack Inc., collects, uses, and manages your personal data.
