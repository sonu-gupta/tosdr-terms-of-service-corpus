         California "Do Not Sell My Info" Notice <p>
<em>Effective date: April 1, 2020</em>
<br>
</p>
<p>‍</p>
<p>As discussed in more detail in our Webflow Privacy Policy, we do not sell our users’ personal information in the traditional sense (i.e., in exchange for payment).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) defines the term “sale” very broadly, including in such a way that transfers of information relating to advertising cookies could be considered a sale.&nbsp.
As described in our Cookie Policy, we work with certain third party services to assist us in delivering interest-based advertisements to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are a California resident, and to the extent that any of these services are considered a “sale” of personal information under the CCPA, then you have the right to opt-out of the sale.&nbsp.
Below please find a description of the ways in which you may do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For further information on how California residents may exercise their rights, please see our Privacy Policy.&nbsp.
California residents’ CCPA sale opt-outs include:</p>
