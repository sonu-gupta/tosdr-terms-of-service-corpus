In addition, the third party providing the Third Party Service may use other parties to provide portions of the application or service to you, such as technology, development or payment services.
Company is not responsible for and makes no warranties, express or implied, as to the Third Party Services or the providers of such Third Party Services (including, but not limited to, the accuracy or completeness of the information provided by such Third Party Service or the privacy practices thereof).
