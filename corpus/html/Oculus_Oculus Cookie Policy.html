<i>Date of Last Revision: October 11, 2020</i>
</p>
<p>Cookies are small pieces of text used to store information on web browsers.
Cookies are used to store and receive identifiers and other information on computers, phones, and other devices.
Other storage technologies are used for similar purposes, such as storing data on your web browser or device, placing identifiers on your device and other software.
In this policy, we refer to all of these technologies as "cookies."</p>
<p>We use cookies if you access and use Oculus websites, Oculus Browser or Oculus mobile apps (“Oculus Services”).
Cookies enable us to offer Oculus Services to you and to understand the information we receive about you, whether or not you are registered or logged in.</p>
<p>This policy explains how we use cookies and the choices you have.
Except as otherwise stated in this policy, the Supplemental Oculus Data Policy or the Oculus Privacy Policy (as applicable) will apply to our processing of the data we collect via cookies.</p>
<p>
<b>Why do we use cookies?</b>
</p>
<p>Cookies help us provide, protect and improve the Oculus Services, such as by remembering your choices and settings, personalizing content, tailoring and measuring ads, and providing a safer experience.
While the cookies that we use may change from time to time as we improve and update the Oculus Services, we use them for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<b>Authentication</b>
</p>
<p>We use cookies to verify your account and determine when you're logged in so we can make it easier for you to access the Oculus Services and show you the appropriate experience and features.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<i>For example:</i> We use cookies to keep you logged in as you navigate between Oculus webpages.
Cookies also help us remember your browser so you do not have to keep logging into your account when you are browsing the Oculus website.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Security, site and integrity</b>
</p>
<p>We use cookies to help us keep your account, data and the Oculus Services safe and secure.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<i>For example:</i> Cookies can help us identify and impose additional security measures when someone may be attempting to access an Oculus account without authorization, for instance, by rapidly guessing different passwords.
We also use cookies to store information that allows us to recover your account in the event that you forget your password or to require additional authentication if you tell us that your account has been hacked.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We also use cookies to combat activity that violates our policies or otherwise degrades our ability to provide the Oculus Services.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<i>For example:</i> Cookies help us fight spam and phishing attacks by enabling us to identify computers that are used to create large numbers of fake Oculus accounts.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Advertising, recommendations, insights and measurement</b>
</p>
<p>Cookies are used to help show you relevant content and ads, and to measure the performance of ad campaigns, including on third-party websites.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<i>For example:</i> Cookies allow us to help deliver ads about Oculus and recommend products and services based on your activity on the Oculus Services.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Providing features and remembering preferences</b>
</p>
<p>We use cookies to remember your settings and preferences and to enable the functionality that helps us provide the Oculus Services.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<i>For example:</i> Cookies help us store preferences and provide you with customized content and experiences.
For instance, cookies allow us to remember your language choice and locale.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Performance</b>
</p>
<p>We use cookies to provide you with the best experience possible.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<i>For example:</i> Cookies help us route traffic between servers and understand how quickly our Oculus Services load for different people.
Cookies also help us record the ratio and dimensions of your screen and windows and know whether you've enabled high-contrast mode, so that we can render our sites and apps correctly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Analytics and research</b>
</p>
<p>We use cookies to better understand how people use the Oculus Services so that we can improve them.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<i>For example:</i> Cookies can help us understand how people use the Oculus Services, analyze which parts of the Oculus Services people find most useful and engaging, and identify features that could be improved.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Do other parties use cookies in connection with the Oculus Services?</b>
</p>
<p>Yes, other parties may use cookies on the Oculus Services for the purposes described above.</p>
<p>For example, our measurement partners use cookies on the Oculus Services to help us understand the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns and to compare the performance of those campaigns to ads displayed on other websites and apps.
