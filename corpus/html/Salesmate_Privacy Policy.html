<strong>Update:</strong> On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “CJEU”) issued a judgment in the Schrems II case (case C-311/18), which invalidated the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework as a valid basis for transferring data from the EU to the United States.
The CJEU further concluded that the Standard Contractual Clauses (the “SCCs”) issued by the European Commission for the transfer of personal data to data processors established outside of the EU continue to serve as a valid transfer basis.
Salesmate’s Terms of Service automatically applies the protections of SCCs to all Salesmate’ EU-based customers.
Customers wishing for a signed copy of the SCCs can obtain one by contacting privacy@salesmate.io.
Salesmate continues to monitor the impact of the Schrems II decision and related legal developments and intends to update its practices and customer terms as appropriate.
