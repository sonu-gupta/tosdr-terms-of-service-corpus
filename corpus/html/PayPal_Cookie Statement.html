<strong>What are cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies?</strong>
<p>Like most sites, we use technologies that are essentially small data files placed on your computer, tablet, mobile phone, or other devices (referred to collectively as a “device”) that allow us to record certain pieces of information whenever you visit or interact with our sites, services, applications, messaging, and tools.</p>
<p>The specific names and types of the cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies we use may change from time to time.
In order to help you better understand this Policy and our use of such technologies we have provided the following limited terminology and definitions:</p>

There are several types of cookies:</p>
<ul>

<li>Persistent cookies are stored on your device in between browser sessions, allowing us to remember your preferences or actions across multiple sites.</li>
<li>First-party cookies are set by the site you are visiting.</li>
<li>Third-party cookies are set by a third party site separate from the site you are visiting.</li>

<strong>“Do Not Track”</strong>
<p>California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser Do Not Track (DNT) signals.
Because there currently isn't an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we don't respond to them at this time.
We await the result of work by the privacy community and industry to determine when such a response is appropriate and what form it should take.</p>
