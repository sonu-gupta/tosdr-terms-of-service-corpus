</ul> TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SALEPaid Products
<p>Some of the Products provided on AdTranquility, as part of the Service, are provided on the basis of payment.</p>
<p>The fees, duration and conditions applicable to the purchase of such Products are described below and in the dedicated sections of AdTranquility.</p>
Product description
<p>Prices, descriptions or availability of Products are outlined in the respective sections of AdTranquility and are subject to change without notice.</p>
<p>While Products on AdTranquility are presented with the greatest accuracy technically possible, representation on AdTranquility through any means (including, as the case may be, graphic material, images, colors, sounds) is for reference only and implies no warranty as to the characteristics of the purchased Product.</p>
<p>The characteristics of the chosen Product will be outlined during the purchasing process.</p>
Purchasing process
<p>Any steps taken from choosing a Product to order submission form part of the purchasing process.
The purchasing process includes these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>By clicking on the checkout button, Users open the Stripe checkout section, wherein they will have to specify their contact details and a payment method of their choice.</li>
<li>After providing all the required information, Users must carefully review the order and, subsequently, confirm and submit it by using the relevant button or mechanism on AdTranquility, hereby accepting these Terms and committing to pay the agreed-upon price.</li>
</ul>
<p>All notifications related to the described purchasing process shall be sent to the email address provided by the User for such purposes.</p>
Prices
<p>Users are informed during the purchasing process and before order submission, about any fees, taxes and costs (including, if any, delivery costs) that they will be charged.</p>
<p>Prices on AdTranquility are displayed:</p>
<ul>
<li>including all applicable fees, taxes and costs;</li>
</ul> Offers and discounts
<p>The Owner may offer discounts or provide special offers for the purchase of Products.
Any such offer or discount shall always be subject to the eligibility criteria and the terms and conditions set out in the corresponding section of AdTranquility.</p>
<p>Offers and discounts are always granted at the Owner’s sole discretion.</p>
<p>Repeated or recurring offers or discounts create no claim/title or right that Users may enforce in the future.</p>
<p>Depending on the case, discounts or offers shall be valid for a limited time only or while stocks last.
If an offer or discount is limited by time, the time indications refer to the time zone of the Owner, as indicated in the Owner’s location details in this document, unless otherwise specified.</p>
Methods of payment
<p>Information related to accepted payment methods are made available during the purchasing process.</p>
<p>Some payment methods may only be available subject to additional conditions or fees.
In such cases related information can be found in the dedicated section of AdTranquility.</p>
<p>All payments are independently processed through third-party services.
Therefore, AdTranquility does not collect any payment information – such as credit card details – but only receives a notification once the payment has been successfully completed.</p>
<p>If payment through the available methods fail or is refused by the payment service provider, the Owner shall be under no obligation to fulfil the purchase order.
Any possible costs or fees resulting from the failed or refused payment shall be borne by the User.</p>
Purchase via app store
<p>AdTranquility or specific Products available for sale on AdTranquility must be purchased via a third-party app store.
To access such purchases, Users must follow the instructions provided on the relevant online store (such as "Apple App Store" or "Google Play"), which may vary depending on the particular device in use.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise specified, purchases done via third-party online stores are also subject to such third-parties’ terms and conditions, which, in case of any inconsistency or conflict, shall always prevail upon these Terms.</p>
<p>Users purchasing through such third-party online stores must therefore read such terms and conditions of sale carefully and accept them.</p>

<p>The trial period shall automatically convert into the equivalent paid Product, unless the User cancels the purchase before the trial period expires.</p>

</p>
<p>
<strong>The renewed subscription will last for a period equal to the original term.</strong>
</p>

</p> User rightsRight of withdrawal
<p>Unless exceptions apply, the User may be eligible to withdraw from the contract within the period specified below (generally 14 days), for any reason and without justification.
Users can learn more about the withdrawal conditions within this section.</p>
Who the right of withdrawal applies to
<p>The right of withdrawal is a right designed for European Consumers in the case of distance contracts (because the User is not able to see or try the Products before closing the contract).
Withdrawal from the contract terminates the obligation of the contracting parties to perform the contract.</p>
<p>On AdTranquility the right of withdrawal applies to all Users.</p>
<p>Unless any exception mentioned below applies, if any, Users have a right to withdraw from the contract within the specified period applicable to their case, for any reason and without justification.</p>
Exercising the right of withdrawal
<p>To exercise their right of withdrawal, Users must send to the Owner an unequivocal statement of their intention to withdraw from the contract.</p>
<p>To this end, Users may use the model withdrawal form available from within the “definitions” section of this document.
Users are, however, free to express their intention to withdraw from the contract by making an unequivocal statement in any other suitable way.
In order to meet the deadline within which they can exercise such right, Users must send the withdrawal notice before the withdrawal period expires.</p>
<p>When does the withdrawal period expire?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Regarding the purchase of a service</strong>, the withdrawal period expires 14 days after the day that the contract is entered into, unless the User has waived the withdrawal right.</li>
</ul> Effects of withdrawal
<p>Users who correctly withdraw from a contract will be reimbursed by the Owner for all payments made to the Owner, including, if any, those covering the costs of delivery.</p>
<p>However, any additional costs resulting from the choice of a particular delivery method other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by the Owner, will not be reimbursed.</p>
<p>Such reimbursement shall be made without undue delay and, in any event, no later than 14 days from the day on which the Owner is informed of the User’s decision to withdraw from the contract.
Unless otherwise agreed with the User, reimbursements will be made using the same means of payment as used to process the initial transaction.
In any event, the User shall not incur any costs or fees as a result of such reimbursement.</p>
…on the purchase of services
<p>Where a User exercises the right of withdrawal after having requested that the service be performed before the withdrawal period expires, the User shall pay to the Owner an amount which is in proportion to the part of service provided.</p>
<p>Such payment shall be calculated based on the fee contractually agreed upon, and be proportional to the part of service provided until the time the User withdraws, compared with the full coverage of the contract.</p> GuaranteesMoney-back-guarantee
<p>Without prejudice to any applicable statutory rights, the Owner grants Users the right to cancel a purchase they are unsatisfied with and obtain a refund.</p>
<p>The terms and conditions applicable to such offer can be found in the dedicated section of AdTranquility.</p> Liability and indemnificationUS UsersDisclaimer of Warranties
