See the <strong>Copyright Policy</strong> for more details on how we handle copyright.</p>
<p>When requested to do so by the authorities, we may apply filters on specific content that is considered illegal within their country.
These filters will be applied so that they do not impact viewing of the content in other countries where the content is still considered legal.</p>Content Sensitivity<p>To help users control the content that is presented to them, they can adjust the content sensitivity level via their account settings.
By default, all content will be marked as <strong>Normal</strong> sensitivity and will be visible to all users.
Creators are expected to mark their content as <strong>Not Safe For Work (NSFW)</strong> or <strong>Not Safe For Life (NSFL)</strong> if appropriate before making the content public.
<strong>Content Moderation</strong> processes will be employed to ensure the appropriate sensitivity level is applied to content, and inappropriately marked content should be flagged via those processes when encountered.</p>
