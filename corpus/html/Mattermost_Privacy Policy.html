If you are located in the European Economic Area or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S.

<ul>
<li>
<strong>European Union Standard Contractual Clauses:</strong> Where this is the case, we will enter into guarantees to ensure that the right security measures are taken so that your privacy rights continue to be protected as outlined in this Privacy Policy.
If we transfer information from the European Economic Area to third parties outside the European Economic Area and to countries not subject to schemes which are considered as providing an adequate data protection standard, we will enter into contracts which are based on the EU Standard Contractual Clauses with these parties, unless any such transfer is permitted for other reasons under the GDPR.</li>

For example, if you provide your information in connection with a forum or blog post or comment, we may display that information even if you have deleted your account as we do not automatically delete community posts.
Also, if you contribute to a Mattermost project and provide your personal information in connection with that contribution, that information (including your name) will be embedded and publicly displayed with your contribution and we will not be able to delete or erase it because doing so would break the project code.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we are involved in litigation or a governmental or regulatory investigation, then we keep personal information throughout the period of litigation or investigation and for a reasonable amount of time thereafter.
If a settlement means that we have to keep personal information for longer, then we keep personal information for the period required to administer the settlement.
If we provide personal information to law enforcement agencies, then we keep a record of this for one year beyond the end of the investigation.</p> Your European Union Privacy Rights Regarding Your Personal Information<p>If the provision of the GDPR is applicable, then you have certain rights with respect to the use of personal information on the Sites and Services.
