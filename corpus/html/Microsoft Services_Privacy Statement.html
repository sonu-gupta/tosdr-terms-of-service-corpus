</i>How we use personal dataHow we use personal data<p>Microsoft uses the data we collect to provide you with rich, interactive experiences.
In particular, we use data to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide our products, which includes updating, securing, and troubleshooting, as well as providing support.
It also includes sharing data, when it is required to provide the service or carry out the transactions you request.</li>
<li>Improve and develop our products.</li>
<li>Personalize our products and make recommendations.</li>
<li>Advertise and market to you, which includes sending promotional communications, targeting advertising, and presenting you with relevant offers.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also use the data to operate our business, which includes analyzing our performance, meeting our legal obligations, developing our workforce, and doing research.</p>
<p>In carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect from different contexts (for example, from your use of two Microsoft products) or obtain from third parties to give you a more seamless, consistent, and personalized experience, to make informed business decisions, and for other legitimate purposes.</p>
<p>Our processing of personal data for these purposes includes both automated and manual (human) methods of processing.
Our automated methods often are related to and supported by our manual methods.
For example, our automated methods include artificial intelligence (AI), which we think of as a set of technologies that enable computers to perceive, learn, reason, and assist in decision-making to solve problems in ways that are similar to what people do.
To build, train, and improve the accuracy of our automated methods of processing (including AI), we manually review some of the predictions and inferences produced by the automated methods against the underlying data from which the predictions and inferences were made.
For example, we manually review short snippets of voice data that we have taken steps to de-identify to improve our speech recognition technologies.
This manual review may be conducted by Microsoft employees or vendors who are working on Microsoft’s behalf.</p>

<p>We also use the data to operate our business, which includes analyzing our performance, meeting our legal obligations, developing our workforce, and doing research.</p>
<p>For these purposes, we combine data we collect from different contexts (for example, from your use of two Microsoft products).
For example Cortana may use information from your calendar to suggest action items in a heads-up email, and Microsoft Store uses information about the apps and services you use to make personalized app recommendations.
However, we have built in technological and procedural safeguards designed to prevent certain data combinations where required by law.
For example, where required by law, we store data we collect from you when you are unauthenticated (not signed in) separately from any account information that directly identifies you, such as your name, email address, or phone number.</p>
<p>Our processing of personal data for these purposes includes both automated and manual (human) methods of processing.

<p> When we process personal data about you, we do so with your consent and/or as required to provide the products you use, operate our business, meet our contractual and legal obligations, protect the security of our systems and our customers, or fulfill other legitimate interests of Microsoft as described in this section and in the Reasons we share personal data&nbsp;section of this privacy statement.
When we transfer personal data from the European Economic Area, we do so based on a variety of legal mechanisms, as described in the Where we store and process personal data section of this privacy statement.
</p>
<p>
<strong>More on the purposes of processing:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Provide our products</strong>.
We use data to operate our products and provide you with rich, interactive experiences.
For example, if you use OneDrive, we process the documents you upload to OneDrive to enable you to retrieve, delete, edit, forward, or otherwise process it, at your direction as part of the service.
Or, for example, if you enter a search query in the Bing search engine, we use that query to display search results to you.
Additionally, as communications are a feature of various products, programs, and activities, we use data to contact you.
For example, we may contact you by phone or email or other means to inform you when a subscription is ending or discuss your licensing account.
We also communicate with you to secure our products, for example by letting you know when product updates are available.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Product improvement</strong>.
We use data to continually improve our products, including adding new features or capabilities.
For example, we use error reports to improve security features, search queries and clicks in Bing to improve the relevancy of the search results, usage data to determine what new features to prioritize, and voice data to develop and improve speech recognition accuracy.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Personalization</strong>.
Many products include personalized features, such as recommendations that enhance your productivity and enjoyment.
These features use automated processes to tailor your product experiences based on the data we have about you, such as inferences we make about you and your use of the product, activities, interests, and location.
For example, depending on your settings, if you stream movies in a browser on your Windows device, you may see a recommendation for an app from the Microsoft Store that streams more efficiently.
If you have a Microsoft account, with your permission, we can sync your settings on several devices.
Many of our products provide controls to disable personalized features.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Product activation</strong>.
We use data—such as device and application type, location, and unique device, application, network, and subscription identifiers—to activate products that require activation.
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<strong>Help secure and troubleshoot</strong>.
We use data to help secure and troubleshoot our products.
This includes using data to protect the security and safety of our products and customers, detecting malware and malicious activities, troubleshooting performance and compatibility issues to help customers get the most out of their experiences, and notifying customers of updates to our products.
This may include using automated systems to detect security and safety issues.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Safety</strong>.
We use data to protect the safety of our products and our customers.
Our security features and products can disrupt the operation of malicious software and notify users if malicious software is found on their devices.
For example, some of our products, such as Outlook or OneDrive, systematically scan content in an automated manner to identify suspected spam, viruses, abusive actions, or URLs that have been flagged as fraud, phishing, or malware links.
and we reserve the right to block delivery of a communication or remove content if it violates our terms.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Updates</strong>.
We use data we collect to develop product updates and security patches.
For example, we may use information about your device’s capabilities, such as available memory, to provide you a software update or security patch.
Updates and patches are intended to maximize your experience with our products, help you protect the privacy and security of your data, provide new features, and ensure your device is ready to process such updates.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Promotional communications</strong>.
We use data we collect to deliver promotional communications.
You can sign up for email subscriptions and choose whether you wish to receive promotional communications from Microsoft by email, SMS, physical mail, and telephone.
For information about managing your contact data, email subscriptions, and promotional communications, see the How to access and control your personal data section of this privacy statement.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Relevant offers</strong>.
Microsoft uses data to provide you with relevant and valuable information regarding our products.
We analyze data from a variety of sources to predict the information that will be most interesting and relevant to you and deliver such information to you in a variety of ways.
For example, we may predict your interest in gaming and communicate with you about new games you may like.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Advertising</strong>.
Microsoft does not use what you say in email, chat, video calls, or voice mail, or your documents, photos, or other personal files to target ads to you.
We use data we collect through our interactions with you, through some of our products, and on third-party web properties, for advertising in our products and on third-party properties.
We may use automated processes to help make advertising more relevant to you.
For more information about how your data is used for advertising, see the Advertising section of this privacy statement.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Prize promotions and events</strong>.
We use your data to administer prize promotions and events available in our physical Microsoft Stores.
For example, if you enter into a prize promotion, we may use your data to select a winner and provide the prize to you if you win.

We may use automated processes to detect and prevent activities that violate our rights and the rights of others, such as fraud.
</li>
<li>

<strong>Your communications preferences</strong>
</p>
<p> You can choose whether you wish to receive promotional communications from Microsoft by email, SMS, physical mail, and telephone.
If you receive promotional email or SMS messages from us and would like to opt out, you can do so by following the directions in that message.
You can also make choices about the receipt of promotional email, telephone calls, and postal mail by signing in with your personal Microsoft account, and viewing your communication permissions where you can update contact information, manage Microsoft-wide contact preferences, opt out of email subscriptions, and choose whether to share your contact information with Microsoft partners.
If you do not have a personal Microsoft account, you can manage your Microsoft email contact preferences by using this web form.
These choices do not apply to mandatory service communications that are part of certain Microsoft products, programs, activities, or to surveys or other informational communications that have their own unsubscribe method.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Your advertising choices</strong>
</p>
<p>To opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from Microsoft, visit our opt-out page.
When you opt out, your preference is stored in a cookie that is specific to the web browser you are using.
The opt-out cookie has an expiration date of five years.
If you delete the cookies on your device, you need to opt out again.</p>
<p>You can also link your opt-out choice with your personal Microsoft account.
It will then apply on any device where you use that account and will continue to apply until someone signs in with a different personal Microsoft account on that device.
If you delete the cookies on your device, you will need to sign in again for the settings to apply.</p>
<p>For Microsoft-controlled advertising that appears in apps on Windows, you may use the opt-out linked to your personal Microsoft account, or opt out of interest-based advertising by turning off the advertising ID in Windows settings.</p>
<p>Because the data used for interest-based advertising is also used for other required purposes (including providing our products, analytics, and fraud detection), opting out of interest-based advertising does not stop that data collection.
You will continue to get ads, although they may be less relevant to you.</p>
<p>You can opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from third parties we partner with by visiting their sites (see above).</p>
<p>
<strong>Browser-based controls </strong>
</p>
<p>When you use a browser, you can control your personal data using certain features.
For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Cookie controls</strong>.
You can control the data stored by cookies and withdraw consent to cookies by using the browser-based cookie controls described in the Cookies section of this privacy statement.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Tracking protections</strong>.
You can control the data third-party sites can collect about you using Tracking Protection in Internet Explorer (versions 9 and up) and Microsoft Edge.
This feature will block third-party content, including cookies, from any site that is listed in a Tracking Protection List you add.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Browser controls for "Do Not Track."</strong> Some browsers have incorporated "Do Not Track" (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked.
Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, Microsoft services do not currently respond to browser DNT signals.
We continue to work with the online industry to define a common understanding of how to treat DNT signals.
In the meantime, you can use the range of other tools we provide to control data collection and use, including the ability to opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from Microsoft as described above.</li>

<strong>Our use of web beacons and analytics services</strong>
</p>
<p>Some Microsoft webpages contain electronic tags known as web beacons that we use to help deliver cookies on our websites, count users who have visited those websites, and deliver co-branded products.
We also include web beacons or similar technologies in our electronic communications to determine whether you open and act on them.</p>
<p>In addition to placing web beacons on our own websites, we sometimes work with other companies to place our web beacons on their websites or in their advertisements.

<strong>What is Xbox?</strong> Xbox is the gaming and entertainment division of Microsoft.
Xbox hosts an online network that consists of software and online experiences crossing multiple platforms.
This network lets your child find and play games, view content, and connect with friends on Xbox and other gaming and social networks.
Children can connect to the Xbox network using Xbox consoles, Windows 10 PCs, and mobile devices (Android and iPhone).</p>
<p>Xbox consoles are devices your child can use to find and play games, movies, music, and other digital entertainment.
When they sign in to Xbox, in apps, games or on a console, we assign a unique device identifier.
For instance, when their Xbox console is connected to the internet and they sign in to the console, we identify which console and which version of the console’s operating system they are using.</p>
<p>Xbox continues to provide new experiences in client apps that are connected to and backed by services such as Xbox network and cloud gaming.
To ensure these connected experiences remain reliable, up to date, secure, and performing as expected, required service data may be collected whenever your child uses a connected experience.</p>
<p>
<strong>Data we collect when you create an Xbox profile</strong>.
You as the parent or guardian are required to consent to the collection of personal data from a child under 13 years old.
With your permission, your child can have an Xbox profile and use the online Xbox network.
During the child Xbox profile creation, you will sign in with your own Microsoft account to verify that you are an adult organizer in your Microsoft family group.
We collect an alternate email address or phone number to boost account security.
If your child needs help accessing their account, they will be able to use one of these alternates to validate they own the Microsoft account.</p>
<p>We collect limited information about children, including name, birthdate, email address, and region. When you sign your child up for an Xbox profile, they get a gamertag (a public nickname) and a unique identifier.
When you create your child’s Xbox profile you consent to Microsoft collecting, using, and sharing information based on their privacy and communication settings on the Xbox online network. Your child’s privacy and communication settings are defaulted to the most restrictive.</p>
<p>
<strong>Data we collect</strong>.
 We collect information about your child’s use of Xbox services, games, apps, and consoles including:</p>
<ul>
<li>When they sign in and sign out of Xbox, the games they play and apps they use, their game progress, achievements, and play statistics, purchase history, and content they obtain.</li>
<li>Performance data about Xbox consoles, Xbox Game Pass and other Xbox apps, the Xbox network, connected devices, and network connection, including software or hardware errors.</li>
<li>Content they add, upload, or share through the Xbox network, including text, pictures, and video they capture in games and apps.</li>
<li>Social activity, including chat data and interactions with other gamers, and connections they make (friends they add and people who follow them) on the Xbox network.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your child uses an Xbox console or Xbox app on another device capable of accessing the Xbox network, and that device includes a storage device (hard drive or memory unit), usage data will be stored on the storage device and sent to Microsoft the next time they sign in to Xbox, even if they have been playing offline.</p>
<p>
<strong>Xbox console diagnostic data</strong>.
If your child uses an Xbox console, the console will send required data to Microsoft.
Required data is the minimum data necessary to help keep Xbox safe, secure, up to date, and performing as expected.</p>
<p>
<strong>Game captures</strong>.
Any player in a multiplayer game session can record video (game clips) and capture screenshots of their view of the game play.
Other players’ game clips and screenshots can capture your child’s in-game character and gamertag during that session.
If a player captures game clips and screenshots on a PC, the resulting game clips might also capture audio chat if your child’s privacy and communication settings on the Xbox online network allow it.</p>
<p>
<strong>Captioning</strong>.
During Xbox real-time (“party”) chat, players may activate a voice-to-text feature that lets them view that chat as text.
If a player activates this feature, Microsoft uses the resulting text data to provide captioning of chat for players who need it.
This data may also be used to provide a safe gaming environment and enforce the Community Standards for Xbox.</p>
<p>
<strong>Data use</strong>.
Microsoft uses the data we collect from your child’s use of Xbox consoles, Xbox apps, games, and the Xbox network to provide them with experiences—and make it safer and more fun over time.
Data we collect includes device information and game play statistics, such as the number of unique players and play time per game.
Data we collect also enables us to provide your child with personalized, curated experiences.
This includes connecting them to games, content, services, and recommendations.</p>
<p>
<strong>Xbox data viewable by others</strong>.
When your child is using the Xbox network, their online presence (which can be set to “appear offline” or “blocked”), gamertag, game play statistics, and achievements are visible to other players on the network.
Depending on how you set your child’s Xbox safety settings, they might share information when playing or communicating with others on the Xbox network. </p>
<p>The Xbox network includes communications features such as text and voice, direct messaging, and real-time text and voice chat.
In order to help provide a safe gaming environment and enforce the Community Standards for Xbox, we collect and monitor text communications during hosted multiplayer game sessions, direct messages, and other features of the service, including activity feeds and clubs.</p>
<p>
<strong>Xbox data shared with game and apps publishers</strong>.
When your child uses an Xbox online game or any network-connected app on their Xbox console, PC, or mobile device, the publisher of that game or app has access to data about their usage to help the publisher deliver, support, and improve its product.
This data may include: your child’s Xbox user identifier, gamertag, limited account info such as country and age range, data about your child’s in-game communications, any Xbox enforcement activity, game-play sessions (for example, moves made in-game or types of vehicles used in-game), your child’s presence on the Xbox network, the time they spend playing the game or app, rankings, statistics, gamer profiles, avatars, or gamerpics, friends lists, activity feeds for official clubs they belong to, official club memberships, and any content they create or submit in the game or app.</p>
<p>Third-party publishers and developers of games and apps have their own distinct and independent relationship with users and their collection and usage of personal data is subject to their specific privacy policies.
You should carefully review their policies to determine how they use your child’s data.
For example, publishers may choose to disclose or display game data (such as on leaderboards) through their own services.
You may find their policies linked from the game or app detail pages in our stores.</p>
<p>Learn more at Data Sharing with Games and Apps.</p>
<p>To stop sharing game or app data with a publisher, remove its games or app from all devices where they have been installed.
Some publisher access to your child’s data may be revoked at microsoft.com/consent.</p>
<p>
<strong>Managing child settings</strong>.
As the organizer of a Microsoft family group, you can manage a child’s information and settings on their Family Safety page, as well as their Xbox profile privacy settings from their Xbox Privacy &amp.
online safety page.</p>
<p>You can also use the Xbox Family Settings app to manage your child’s experience on the Xbox Network including: spending for Microsoft and Xbox stores, viewing your child’s Xbox activity, and setting age ratings and the amount of screen time.</p>
<p>Learn more about managing Xbox profiles at Xbox online safety and privacy settings.</p>
<p>Learn more about Microsoft family groups at Simplify your family’s life.</p>
<p>
<strong>Accessing child data</strong>.  As the organizer of a Microsoft family group, a parent can view and delete a child’s data on their privacy dashboard.
The dashboard allows you to review your child's personal information, have it deleted, and refuse to permit further collection or use of your child's information.</p>
<p>To close your child’s account, sign in with their account info at  account.microsoft.com/profile and select ”How to close your account.” </p>

<strong>Xbox 360</strong>.
This Xbox console collects limited required diagnostic data.
This data helps ensure your child’s console is functioning as expected.</li>
<li>
<strong>Kinect</strong>.
The Kinect sensor is a combination of camera, microphone, and infrared sensor that can enable motions and voice to be used to control game play.
For example: <ul>
<li>If you choose, the camera can be used to sign in to the Xbox network automatically using facial recognition.
This data stays on the console, is not shared with anyone, and can be deleted at any time.</li>
<li>For game play, Kinect will map distances between the joints on your child’s body to create a stick figure representation to enable play.</li>
<li>The Kinect microphone can enable voice chat between players during play.
The microphone also enables voice commands for control of the console, game, or app, or to enter search terms.</li>
<li>The Kinect sensor can also be used for audio and video communications through services such as Skype.</li>

</i>Security of personal dataSecurity of personal data<p>Microsoft is committed to protecting the security of your personal data.
We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
For example, we store the personal data you provide on computer systems that have limited access and are in controlled facilities.
When we transmit highly confidential data (such as a credit card number or password) over the internet, we protect it through the use of encryption.
Microsoft complies with applicable data protection laws, including applicable security breach notification laws.</p>Top of page<i>
</i>Where we store and process personal dataWhere we store and process personal data<p>Personal data collected by Microsoft may be stored and processed in your region, in the United States, and in any other country where Microsoft or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers operate facilities.
Microsoft maintains major data centers in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Singapore, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
Typically, the primary storage location is in the customer’s region or in the United States, often with a backup to a data center in another region.
The storage location(s) are chosen in order to operate efficiently, to improve performance, and to create redundancies in order to protect the data in the event of an outage or other problem.
We take steps to ensure that the data we collect under this privacy statement is processed according to the provisions of this statement and the requirements of applicable law wherever the data is located.</p>
<p>We transfer personal data from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to other countries, some of which have not yet been determined by the European Commission to have an adequate level of data protection.
For example, their laws may not guarantee you the same rights, or there may not be a privacy supervisory authority there that is capable of addressing your complaints.
When we engage in such transfers, we use a variety of legal mechanisms, including contracts such as the standard contractual clauses published by the European Commission under Commission Decision 2004/915/EC, to help ensure your rights and protections travel with your data.
To learn more about the European Commission’s decisions on the adequacy of the protection of personal data in the countries where Microsoft processes personal data, see this article on the European Commission website.</p>
<p>Microsoft Corporation complies with the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S.
Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to the United States, although Microsoft does not rely on the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework as a legal basis for transfers of personal data in light of the judgment of the Court of Justice of the EU in Case C-311/18.
Microsoft Corporation has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.
If third-party agents process personal data on our behalf in a manner inconsistent with the principles of either Privacy Shield framework, we remain liable unless we prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
The controlled U.S.
subsidiaries of Microsoft Corporation, as identified in our self-certification submission, also adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles—for more info, see the list of Microsoft U.S.
entities or subsidiaries adhering to the Privacy Shield Principles.</p>
<p>If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.
To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, visit the Privacy Shield website.</p>
<p>If you have a question or complaint related to participation by Microsoft in the EU-U.S.
or Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield, we encourage you to contact us via our web form.
For any complaints related to the Privacy Shield frameworks that Microsoft cannot resolve directly, we have chosen to cooperate with the relevant EU Data Protection Authority, or a panel established by the European data protection authorities, for resolving disputes with EU individuals, and with the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) for resolving disputes with Swiss individuals.
Please contact us if you’d like us to direct you to your data protection authority contacts.
As further explained in the Privacy Shield Principles, binding arbitration is available to address residual complaints not resolved by other means.

</i>Our retention of personal dataOur retention of personal data<p>Microsoft retains personal data for as long as necessary to provide the products and fulfill the transactions you have requested, or for other legitimate purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements.
Because these needs can vary for different data types, the context of our interactions with you or your use of products, actual retention periods can vary significantly.</p>
<p>Other criteria used to determine the retention periods include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Do customers provide, create, or maintain the data with the expectation we will retain it until they affirmatively remove it?</strong> Examples include a document you store in OneDrive, or an email message you keep in your Outlook.com inbox.
In such cases, we would aim to maintain the data until you actively delete it, such as by moving an email from your Outlook.com inbox to the Deleted Items folder, and then emptying that folder (when your Deleted Items folder is emptied, those emptied items remain in our system for up to 30 days before final deletion).
(Note that there may be other reasons why the data has to be deleted sooner, for example if you exceed limits on how much data can be stored in your account.)</li>
<li>
<strong>Is there an automated control, such as in the Microsoft privacy dashboard, that enables the customer to access and delete the personal data at any time?</strong> If there is not, a shortened data retention time will generally be adopted.</li>
<li>
<strong>Is the personal data of a sensitive type?</strong> If so, a shortened retention time would generally be adopted.</li>
<li>
<strong>Has Microsoft adopted and announced a specific retention period for a certain data type?</strong> For example, for Bing search queries, we de-identify stored queries by removing the entirety of the IP address after 6 months, and cookie IDs and other cross-session identifiers that are used to identify a particular account or device after 18 months.</li>
<li>
<strong>Has the user provided consent for a longer retention period?</strong> If so, we will retain data in accordance with your consent.</li>
<li>
<strong>Is Microsoft subject to a legal, contractual, or similar obligation to retain or delete the data?</strong> Examples can include mandatory data retention laws in the applicable jurisdiction, government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation, or data retained for the purposes of litigation.
Conversely, if we are required by law to remove unlawful content, we will do so.</li>

</i>AdvertisingAdvertising<p>Advertising allows us to provide, support, and improve some of our products.
Microsoft does not use what you say in email, chat, video calls or voice mail, or your documents, photos, or other personal files to target ads to you.
We use other data, detailed below, for advertising in our products and on third-party properties.
For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft may use data we collect to select and deliver some of the ads you see on Microsoft web properties, such as Microsoft.com, MSN, and Bing.</li>
<li>When the advertising ID is enabled in Windows 10 as part of your privacy settings, third parties can access and use the advertising ID (much the same way that websites can access and use a unique identifier stored in a cookie) to select and deliver ads in such apps.</li>
<li>We may share data we collect with partners, such as Verizon Media, AppNexus, or Facebook (see below), so that the ads you see in our products and their products are more relevant and valuable to you.</li>
<li>Advertisers may choose to place our web beacons on their sites, or use similar technologies, in order to allow Microsoft to collect information on their sites such as activities, purchases, and visits.
we use this data on behalf of our advertising customers to provide ads.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ads that you see may be selected based on data we process about you, such as your interests and favorites, your location, your transactions, how you use our products, your search queries, or the content you view.
For example, if you view content on MSN about automobiles, we may show advertisements about cars.
if you search “pizza places in Seattle” on Bing, you may see advertisements in your search results for restaurants in Seattle.</p>
<p>The ads that you see may also be selected based on other information learned about you over time using demographic data, location data, search queries, interests and favorites, usage data from our products and sites, and the information we collect about you from the sites and apps of our advertisers and partners.
We refer to these ads as "personalized advertising" in this statement.
For example, if you view gaming content on xbox.com, you may see offers for games on MSN.
To provide personalized advertising, we combine cookies placed on your device using information that we collect (such as IP address) when your browser interacts with our websites.
If you opt out of receiving personalized advertising, data associated with these cookies will not be used.</p>
<p>We may use information about you to serve you with personalized advertising when you use Microsoft services.

But even if you use this privacy setting to turn off connected experiences, certain functionality will remain available, such as syncing your mailbox in Outlook, as well as essential services described below.
</p>
<p>If you choose to disable certain types of connected experiences, either the ribbon or menu command for those connected experiences will be grayed out or you will get an error message when you try to use those connected experiences.</p>
<p> There are a set of services that are essential to how Microsoft 365 functions and cannot be disabled.
For example, the licensing service that confirms that you are properly licensed to use Microsoft 365 is essential.
Required service data about these services is collected and sent to Microsoft, regardless of any other settings that you have configured.
See Essential Services for more information.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Required service data for connected experiences</strong>.
As you use a connected experience, data is sent to and processed by Microsoft to provide you that connected experience.
This data is necessary because this information enables us to deliver these cloud-based connected experiences.
We refer to this data as required service data.
</p>
<p>Required service data can include information related to the operation of the connected experience that is needed to keep the underlying service secure, up to date, and performing as expected.
If you choose to use a connected experience that analyzes your content, for example Translate in Word, the text you typed and selected to translate is also sent and processed to provide you the connected experience.
Your text and the translation are not stored by our service.
Required service data can also include information needed by a connected experience to perform its task, such as configuration information about the Office app.</p>

</i>OneDriveOneDrive<p>OneDrive lets you store and access your files on virtually any device.
You can also share and collaborate on your files with others.
Some versions of the OneDrive application enable you to access both your personal OneDrive by signing in with your personal Microsoft account and your OneDrive for Business by signing in with your work or school Microsoft account as part of your organization's use of Microsoft 365 or Office 365.</p>
<p>When you use OneDrive, we collect data about your usage of the service, as well as the content you store, to provide, improve, and protect the services.
Examples include indexing the contents of your OneDrive documents so that you can search for them later and using location information to enable you to search for photos based on where the photo was taken.
We also collect device information so we can deliver personalized experiences, such as enabling you to sync content across devices and roam customized settings.</p>
<p>When you store content in OneDrive, that content will inherit the sharing permissions of the folder in which you store it.
For example, if you decide to store content in the public folder, the content will be public and available to anyone on the internet who can find the folder.
If you store content in a private folder, the content will be private.</p>
<p>When you share content to a social network like Facebook from a device that you have synced with your OneDrive account, your content is either uploaded to that social network, or a link to that content is posted to that social network.
Doing this makes the content accessible to anyone on that social network.
To delete the content, you need to delete it from the social network (if it was uploaded there, rather than a link to it) and from OneDrive.</p>
<p>When you share your OneDrive content with your friends via a link, an email with the link is sent to those friends.
The link contains an authorization code that allows anyone with the link to access your content.
If one of your friends sends the link to other people, they will also be able to access your content, even if you did not choose to share the content with them.
To revoke permissions for your content on OneDrive, sign in to your account and then select the specific content to manage the permission levels.
Revoking permissions for a link effectively deactivates the link.
No one will be able to use the link to access the content unless you decide to share the link again.</p>
<p>Files managed with OneDrive for Business are stored separately from files stored with your personal OneDrive.
OneDrive for Business collects and transmits personal data for authentication, such as your email address and password, which will be transmitted to Microsoft and/or to the provider of your Microsoft 365 or Office 365 service.</p>Top of page<i>

<p>To add an account, you must provide permission for Outlook to access data from the email or file storage services.</p>
<p>When you add an account to Outlook, your mail, calendar items, files, contacts, settings and other data from that account will automatically sync to your device.
If you are using the mobile Outlook application, that data will also sync to Microsoft servers to enable additional features such as faster search, personalized filtering of less important mail, and an ability to add email attachments from linked file storage providers without leaving the Outlook application.
If you are using the desktop Outlook application, you can choose whether to allow the data to sync to our servers.
At any time, you can remove an account or make changes to the data that is synced from your account.</p>
<p>If you add an account provided by an organization (such as your employer or school), the owner of the organizational domain can implement policies and controls (for example, requiring multi-factor authentication or the ability to remotely wipe data from your device) that can affect your use of Outlook.</p>

Bing services are also included within other Microsoft services, such as Microsoft 365, Cortana, and certain features in Windows (which we refer to as Bing-powered experiences).
</p>
<p> When you conduct a search, or use a feature of a Bing-powered experience that involves conducting a search or entering a command on your behalf, Microsoft will collect the searches or commands you provide (which may be in the form of text, voice data, or an image), along with your IP address, location, the unique identifiers contained in our cookies or similar technologies, the time and date of your search, and your browser configuration.
For example, if you use Bing voice-enabled services, your voice input and performance data associated with the speech functionality will be sent to Microsoft.
To learn more about how Microsoft manages your voice data, see Speech recognition technologies.
And, if you use Bing image-enabled services, the image you provide will be sent to Microsoft.
When you use Bing-powered experiences, such as Bing Lookup to search a particular word or phrase within a webpage or document, that word or phrase is sent to Bing along with some surrounding content in order to provide contextually relevant search results.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Search suggestions</strong>.
For the search suggestions feature, the characters that you type into a Bing-powered experience (such as search and site suggestions in the Microsoft Edge browser) to conduct a search and what you click on will be sent to Microsoft.
This allows us to provide you with relevant suggestions as you type your searches.
To turn this feature on or off, while using Bing Search, go to Bing Settings.
There are other methods to control this feature in other Bing-powered experiences, such as the Microsoft Edge browser.
Search Suggestions cannot be turned off in the Windows 10 search box.
On Windows, you can always hide the search box so as not to use the feature.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bing experience improvement program for Bing Desktop and Bing Toolbar</strong>.
If you are using Bing Desktop or Bing Toolbar and choose to participate in the Bing Experience Improvement Program, we also collect additional data about how you use these specific Bing apps, such as the addresses of the websites you visit, to help improve search ranking and relevance.
To help protect your privacy, we do not use the data collected through the Bing Experience Improvement Program to identify or contact you or target advertising to you.
You can turn off the Bing Experience Improvement Program at any time in the Bing Desktop or Bing Toolbar settings.
Finally, we delete the information collected through the Bing Experience Improvement Program after 18 months.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Retention and de-identification</strong>.
We de-identify stored search queries by removing the entirety of the IP address after 6 months, and cookie IDs and other cross-session identifiers that are used to identify a particular account or device after 18 months.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Personalization through Microsoft account</strong>.
Some Bing services provide you with an enhanced experience when you sign in with your personal Microsoft account, for example, syncing your search history across devices.
You can use these personalization features to customize your interests, favorites, and settings, and to connect your account with third-party services.
Visit Bing Settings to manage your personalization settings, or the Microsoft privacy dashboard to manage your data.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Managing search history</strong>.
When you’re signed-in to a personal Microsoft account, you can erase your search history on the Microsoft privacy dashboard.
The Search History service from Bing, located in Bing Settings, provides another method of revisiting the search terms you've entered and results you've clicked when using Bing search through your browser.
You may clear your search history on a device through this service.
Clearing your history prevents that history from being displayed on the Search History site, but does not delete information from our search logs, which are retained and de-identified as described above or as you have instructed through the privacy dashboard.
If you are signed-in to a work or school Microsoft account using Microsoft Search in Bing, you can export your Microsoft Search in Bing search history, but you cannot delete it.
Your Microsoft Search in Bing service administrator can see aggregated search history across all enterprise users but cannot see specific searches by user.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Third-party services that use Bing</strong>.
You may access Bing-powered experiences when using third-party services, such as those from Yahoo!.
In order to provide these services, Bing receives data from these and other partners, including your search query and related data (such as date, time, IP address, and a unique identifier).
This data will be sent to Microsoft to provide the search service.
Microsoft will use this data as described in this statement or as further limited by our contractual obligations with our partners.
You should refer to the privacy policies of the third-party services for any questions about how they collect and use data.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Data passed to destination website</strong>.
When you select a search result or advertisement from a Bing search results page and go to the destination website, the destination website will receive the standard data your browser sends to every web site you visit—such as your IP address, browser type and language, and the host name of the site you came from (in this case, https://www.bing.com/).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Sharing data from Bing and Bing-powered experiences with third parties</strong>.
We share some de-identified data (data where the identity of a specific person is not known) from Bing and Bing-powered experiences with selected third parties.
Before we do so, we run the data through a process designed to remove certain sensitive data that users may have included in the search terms themselves (such as social security numbers or credit card numbers).
Additionally, we require these third parties to keep the data secure and to not use the data for purposes other than for which it is provided.

</i>SwiftKeySwiftKey<p> The Microsoft Swiftkey keyboard and related cloud-based services (collectively, the “SwiftKey Services”) process data about words you use and how you type and use this data to learn your writing style and provide personalized autocorrection and predictive text that adapts to you.
We also use this data to offer a range of other features, such as hashtag and emoji predictions.
</p>
<p> SwiftKey prediction technology learns from the way you use language to build a personalized language model.
This model is an optimized view of the words and phrases that you use most often in context and reflects your unique writing style.
The model itself contains the words you commonly type arranged in a way that enables SwiftKey’s algorithms to make predictions, based on text you have already entered.
The model draws from all scenarios in which you use your keyboard, including when you type while using apps or visiting websites.
The SwiftKey keyboard and model attempt to avoid collecting sensitive data, by not collecting data from certain fields such as those recognized as containing password or payment data.
SwiftKey Services do not log, store, or learn from data you type, or the data contained in your model, unless you choose to share your data with us (as described further below).
When you use SwiftKey Services, we also collect device and usage data.
We use de-identified device and usage data to analyze service performance and help improve our products.
</p>
<p> The SwiftKey Services also include an optional cloud component called a SwiftKey Account.
If you choose to create a SwiftKey Account, your language model will be synced with the SwiftKey Account cloud service, so you can benefit from that model on the different devices you use and access additional services such as prediction synchronization and backup.
When you create a SwiftKey Account, Microsoft will also collect your email address and basic demographic data.
All data collected is transferred to our servers over encrypted channels.
</p>
<p> You may also opt in to share your language, typing data, and/or voice clips for the purposes of improving Microsoft products and services.
Depending on the opt-ins you choose, SwiftKey may send short snippets of data about what and how you type and/or your voice clips, and related correction data to our servers for processing.
These text snippets and/or voice clips are used in various automated processes to validate that our prediction services are working correctly and to make product improvements.
To preserve your privacy, SwiftKey Services de-identify these text snippets, and even if you have a SwiftKey Account, these text snippets and/or voice clips will not be linked to it.
To learn more about how Microsoft manages your voice data, see Speech recognition technologies.
</p>
<p> If you sign into your SwiftKey Account and opt to share your language and typing data or voice clips, Microsoft will process your shared data in order to look for new patterns of language usage across our user base.
This allows us to improve our basic models for individual languages.
Language and typing data used in this process is aggregated and any words or combinations of words that might be personal to individuals or small groups of users are filtered out.
</p>
<p> You can withdraw your consent to share your language and typing data or voice clips for product improvement at any time in SwiftKey Settings.
You can also withdraw your consent for SwiftKey Services to retain your personal data in SwiftKey Settings.
When you withdraw consent for SwiftKey to retain your personal data, all personal data collected through your use of the SwiftKey Services will be deleted.
</p>
<p> You may receive occasional notifications on your device alerting you to product updates and features that may be of interest to you.
You can disable these notifications at any time in the SwiftKey Settings.

</i>WindowsWindows<p>Windows is a personalized computing environment that enables you to seamlessly roam and access services, preferences, and content across your computing devices from phones to tablets to the Surface Hub.
Rather than residing as a static software program on your device, key components of Windows are cloud-based, and both cloud and local elements of Windows are updated regularly, providing you with the latest improvements and features.
In order to provide this computing experience, we collect data about you, your device, and the way you use Windows.
And because Windows is personal to you, we give you choices about the personal data we collect and how we use it.
Note that if your Windows device is managed by your organization (such as your employer or school), your organization may use centralized management tools provided by Microsoft or others to access and process your data and to control device settings (including privacy settings), device policies, software updates, data collection by us or the organization, or other aspects of your device.
Additionally, your organization may use management tools provided by Microsoft or others to access and process your data from that device, including your interaction data, diagnostic data, and the contents of your communications and files.
For more information about data collection and privacy in Windows, see Windows 10 and your online services.

</i>ActivationActivation<p>When you activate Windows, a specific product key is associated with the device on which your software is installed.
The product key and data about the software and your device is sent to Microsoft to help validate your license to the software.
This data may be sent again if there is a need to re-activate or validate your license.
On phones running Windows, device and network identifiers, as well as device location at the time of the first power-up of the device, are also sent to Microsoft for the purpose of warranty registration, stock replenishment, and fraud prevention.</p>Top of page<i>
</i>Activity historyActivity history<p>Activity history helps keep track of the things you do on your device, such as the apps and services you use, the files you open, and the websites you browse.
Your activity history is stored locally on your device when using different apps and features such as Microsoft Edge, some Microsoft Store apps, and Microsoft 365 apps.
If you've signed in to your device with a Microsoft account and given your permission, Windows sends your activity history to Microsoft.
Once your activity history is in the cloud, Microsoft uses that data to enable cross-device experiences, to provide you with the ability to continue those activities on other devices, to provide personalized experiences (such as ordering your activities based on duration of use) and relevant suggestions (such as anticipating what your needs might be based on your activity history), and to help improve Microsoft products.</p>
<p>Activity history is also created and sent to Microsoft when you use Microsoft apps, such as Microsoft Edge, and Office apps like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, on mobile devices such as iOS and Android phones and tablets.
If you are signed in with your Microsoft account, you can continue activities on your Windows&nbsp;10 device that you started in Microsoft apps on your Android or iOS device.

</i>Advertising IDAdvertising ID<p>Windows generates a unique advertising ID for each person using a device, which app developers and advertising networks can then use for their own purposes, including providing relevant advertising in apps.
When the advertising ID is enabled, both Microsoft apps and third-party apps can access and use the advertising ID in much the same way that websites can access and use a unique identifier stored in a cookie.
Thus, your advertising ID can be used by app developers and advertising networks to provide more relevant advertising and other personalized experiences across their apps and on the web.
Microsoft collects the advertising ID for the uses described here only when you choose to enable the advertising ID as part of your privacy setting.</p>
<p>The advertising ID setting applies to Windows apps using the Windows advertising identifier.
You can turn off access to this identifier at any time by turning off the advertising ID in Settings.
If you choose to turn it on again, the advertising ID will be reset and a new identifier will be generated.
When a third-party app accesses the advertising ID, its use of the advertising ID will be subject to its own privacy policy.
Learn more about advertising ID in Windows 10.</p>
<p>The advertising ID setting does not apply to other methods of interest-based advertising delivered by Microsoft or third parties, such as cookies used to provide interest-based display ads on websites.
Third-party products accessed through or installed on Windows may also deliver other forms of interest-based advertising subject to their own privacy policies.
Microsoft delivers other forms of interest-based ads in certain Microsoft products, both directly and by partnering with third-party ad providers.

</i>DiagnosticsDiagnostics<p>Microsoft collects Windows diagnostic data to solve problems and to keep Windows up to date, secure, and operating properly.
It also helps us improve Windows and related Microsoft products and services and, for customers who have turned on the “Tailored experiences” setting, to provide more relevant tips and recommendations to tailor Microsoft and third-party products and services for Windows to the customer’s needs.
This data is transmitted to Microsoft and stored with one or more unique identifiers that can help us recognize an individual user on an individual device and understand the device's service issues and use patterns.</p>
<p>There are two levels of diagnostic and activity data: Required diagnostic data and Optional diagnostic data.
Certain product documentation and other materials refer to Required diagnostic data as Basic diagnostic data and to Optional diagnostic data as Full diagnostic data.</p>
<p>If an organization (such as your employer or school) uses Microsoft management tools or engages Microsoft to manage your device, we and the organization will use and process diagnostic and error data from your device to allow the management, monitoring, and troubleshooting of the organization's devices, and for other purposes of the organization.</p>
<p>
<strong>Required diagnostic data</strong> includes information about your device, its settings and capabilities, and whether it is performing properly.
We collect the following Required diagnostic data:</p>
<ul>
<li> Device, connectivity, and configuration data: <ul>
<li>Data about the device such as the processor type, OEM manufacturer, type of battery and capacity, number and type of cameras, firmware, and memory attributes.</li>
<li>Network capabilities and connection data such as the device’s IP address, mobile network (including IMEI and mobile operator), and whether the device is connected to a free or paid network.</li>
<li>Data about the operating system and its configuration such as the OS version and build number, region and language settings, diagnostics data settings, and whether the device is part of the Windows Insider program.</li>
<li>Data about connected peripherals such as model, manufacturer, drivers, and compatibility data.</li>
<li>Data about the applications installed on the device such as application name, version, and publisher.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Whether a device is ready for an update and whether there are factors that may impede the ability to receive updates, such as low battery, limited disk space, or connectivity through a paid network.</li>
<li>Whether updates complete successfully or fail.</li>
<li>Data about the reliability of the diagnostics collection system itself.</li>
<li>Basic error reporting, which is health data about the operating system and applications running on your device.
For example, basic error reporting tells us if an application, such as Microsoft Paint or a third-party game, hangs or crashes.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Optional diagnostic data</strong> includes more detailed information about your device and its settings, capabilities, and device health.
Optional diagnostic data also includes data about the websites you browse, device activity (also sometimes referred to as usage), and enhanced error reporting that helps Microsoft to fix and improve products and services for all users.
When you choose to send Optional diagnostic data, Required diagnostic data will always be included, and we collect the following additional information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Additional data about the device, connectivity, and configuration, beyond that collected under Required diagnostic data.</li>
<li>Status and logging information about the health of operating system and other system components beyond that collected about the update and diagnostics systems under Required diagnostic data.
</li>
<li>App activity, such as which programs are launched on a device, how long they run, and how quickly they respond to input.
</li>
<li>Browser activity, including browsing history and search terms, in Microsoft browsers (Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer).
</li>
<li>Enhanced error reporting, including the memory state of the device when a system or app crash occurs (which may unintentionally contain user content, such as parts of a file you were using when the problem occurred).
Crash data is never used for Tailored experiences as described below.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the data described above may not be collected from your device even if you choose to send Optional diagnostic data.
Microsoft minimizes the volume of Optional diagnostic data it collects from all devices by collecting some of the data from only a subset of devices (sample).
By running the Diagnostic Data Viewer tool, you can see an icon which indicates whether your device is part of a sample and also which specific data is collected from your device.

For example, to ensure Microsoft can troubleshoot the latest performance issue impacting users’ computing experience or update a Windows 10 device that is new to the market, Microsoft may need to collect data items that were not collected previously.
For a current list of data types collected at <strong>Required diagnostic data</strong> and <strong>Optional diagnostic data</strong>, see Windows Required (Basic level) diagnostic events and fields or Windows 10 Optional (Full level) diagnostic data.
We provide limited portions of error report information to partners (such as the device manufacturer) to help them troubleshoot products and services which work with Windows and other Microsoft product and services.
They are only permitted to use this information to repair or improve those products and services.
We may also share some aggregated, de-identified diagnostic data, such as general usage trends for Windows apps and features, with selected third parties.

<p>
<strong>Inking and typing Recognition</strong>.
You also can choose to help Microsoft improve inking and typing recognition by sending inking and typing diagnostic data.
If you choose to do so, Microsoft will collect samples of the content you type or write to improve features such as handwriting recognition, autocompletion, next word prediction, and spelling correction in the many languages used by Windows customers.
When Microsoft collects inking and typing diagnostic data, it is divided into small samples and processed to remove unique identifiers, sequencing information, and other data (such as email addresses and numeric values) which could be used to reconstruct the original content or associate the input to you.
It also includes associated performance data, such as changes you manually make to text, as well as words you've added to the dictionary.

<p>If you choose to turn on <strong>Tailored experiences</strong>, we will use your Windows diagnostic data (Basic or Full as you have selected) to offer you personalized tips, ads, and recommendations to enhance Microsoft experiences.
If you have selected Basic as your diagnostic data setting, personalization is based on information about your device, its settings and capabilities, and whether it is performing properly.
If you have selected Full, personalization is also based on information about how you use apps and features, plus additional information about the health of your device.
However, we do not use information about the websites you browse, the content of crash dumps, speech, typing, or inking input data for personalization when we receive such data from customers who have selected Full.</p>
<p>Tailored experiences include suggestions on how to customize and optimize Windows, as well as ads and recommendations for Microsoft and third-party products and services, features, apps, and hardware for your Windows experiences.
For example, to help you get the most out of your device, we may tell you about features you may not know about or that are new.
If you are having a problem with your Windows device, you may be offered a solution.
You may be offered a chance to customize your lock screen with pictures, or to be shown more pictures of the kind you like, or fewer of the ones you don’t.
If you stream movies in your browser, you may be recommended an app from the Microsoft Store that streams more efficiently.
Or, if you are running out of space on your hard drive, Windows may recommend you try OneDrive or purchase hardware to gain more space.

</i>Location services, motion sensing, and recordingLocation services, motion sensing, and recording<p>
<strong>Windows location service</strong>.
Microsoft operates a location service that helps determine the precise geographic location of a specific Windows device.
Depending on the capabilities of the device, the device’s location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy and may in some cases be determined precisely.
When you have enabled location on a Windows device, or you have given permission for Microsoft apps to access location information on non-Windows devices, data about cell towers and Wi-Fi access points and their locations is collected by Microsoft and added to the location database after removing any data identifying the person or device from which it was collected.
This de-identified copy of location information is used to improve Microsoft's location services and, in some instances, shared with our location service provider partners, currently HERE (see https://www.here.com/), to improve the location services of the provider.</p>
<p>Windows services and features (such as browsers and Cortana), apps running on Windows, and websites opened in Windows browsers can access the device’s location through Windows if your settings allow them to do so.
Some features and apps request location permission when you first install Windows, some ask the first time you use the app, and others ask every time you access the device’s location.
For information about certain Windows apps that use the device’s location, see the Windows apps section of this privacy statement.</p>
<p>When an app or feature accesses the device’s location and you are signed in with a Microsoft account, your Windows device will also upload its location to the cloud where it is available across your devices to other apps or services that use your Microsoft account and for which you’ve granted permission.
We will retain only the last known location (each new location replaces the previous one).
Data about a Windows device's recent location history is also stored on the device even if not using a Microsoft account, and certain apps and Windows features can access this location history.
You can clear your device's location history at any time in the device's Settings menu.
</p>
<p>In Settings, you can also view which apps have access to the device’s precise location or your device's location history, turn off or on access to the device’s location for particular apps, or turn off access to the device’s location.
You can also set a default location, which will be used when the location service can’t detect a more exact location for your device.</p>
<p>Even when you’ve turned off access to the device’s location, some third-party desktop apps and services could use other technologies (such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, cellular modem, etc.) to determine the device’s precise location.
Learn more about third-party desktop apps and how they may still be able to determine your device’s location when the device’s location setting is off.</p>
<p>In addition, to facilitate getting help in an emergency, whenever you make an emergency call, Windows will attempt to determine and share your precise location, regardless of your location settings.
If your device has a SIM card or is otherwise using cellular service, your mobile operator will have access to your device’s location.
Learn more about location in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
<strong>General Location</strong>.
If you turn on the General Location feature, apps that cannot use your precise location will have access to your general location, such as your city, postal code, or region.</p>
<p>
<strong>Find My Phone</strong>.
The Find My Phone feature allows you to find the location of your Windows phone from the Microsoft account website, even if you have turned off all access to the location service on the phone.
If you have turned on the "save my location every few hours" feature in the Find My Phone settings on your phone, the Find My Phone feature will periodically send and store a single last-known location of your phone, even if you have turned off location services on your phone.
Each time a new location is sent, it replaces the previously-stored location.</p>
<p>
<strong>Find my device</strong>.
The Find my device feature allows an administrator of a Windows portable device to find the location of that device from account.microsoft.com/devices.
To enable Find my device, an administrator needs to be signed in with a Microsoft account and have the location setting enabled.
This feature will work even if other users have denied access to location for all their apps.
When the administrator attempts to locate the device, users will see a notification in the notification area.

<p>
<strong>Windows motion sensing</strong>.
Windows devices with motion activity detection can collect motion activity.
This data can enable features such as a pedometer to count the number of steps you take, so a fitness application can estimate how many calories you burn.
This data and history is stored on your device and can be accessed by applications you give permission to access and use that data.</p>
<p>
<strong>Recording</strong>.
Some Windows devices have a recording feature that allows you to capture audio and video clips of your activity on the device, including your communications with others.
If you choose to record a session, the recording will be saved locally on your device.
In some cases, you may have the option to transmit the recording to a Microsoft product or service that broadcasts the recording publicly.
<strong>Important: You should understand your legal responsibilities before recording and/or transmitting any communication.
This may include obtaining the prior consent of everyone participating in the conversation or any other authorizations as required.</strong> Microsoft is not responsible for how you use recording features or your recordings.</p>Top of page<i>

<strong>Device encryption</strong>.
Device encryption helps protect the data stored on your device by encrypting it using BitLocker Drive Encryption technology.
When device encryption is on, Windows automatically encrypts the drive Windows is installed on and generates a recovery key.
The BitLocker recovery key for your personal device is automatically backed up online in your personal Microsoft OneDrive account.
Microsoft doesn't use your individual recovery keys for any purpose.</p>
<p>
<strong>Malicious Software Removal Tool</strong>.
The Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT) runs on your device at least once per month as part of Windows Update.
MSRT checks devices for infections by specific, prevalent malicious software ("malware") and helps remove any infections found.
When the MSRT runs, it will remove the malware listed on the Microsoft Support website if the malware is on your device.
During a malware check, a report will be sent to Microsoft with specific data about malware detected, errors, and other data about your device.
If you do not want MSRT to send this data to Microsoft, you can disable MSRT's reporting component.</p>
<p>
<strong>Microsoft Family</strong>.
Parents can use Microsoft Family to understand and set boundaries on how their child is using their device.
There are many features available to Family members, so please carefully review the information provided when you create or join a Family.
When Family activity reporting is turned on for a child, Microsoft will collect details about how the child uses their device and provide parents with reports of that child's activities.
Activity reports are routinely deleted from Microsoft servers after a short period of time.</p>
<p>
<strong>Microsoft Defender SmartScreen</strong>.
Microsoft Defender SmartScreen helps protect you when using our services by checking downloaded files and web content for malicious software, potentially unsafe web content, and other threats to you or your device.
When checking a file, data about that file is sent to Microsoft, including the file name, a hash of the file's contents, the download location, and the file's digital certificates.
If Microsoft Defender SmartScreen identifies the file as unknown or potentially unsafe, you will see a warning prior to opening the file.
When checking web content, data about the content and your device is sent to Microsoft, including the full web address of the content.
If Microsoft Defender SmartScreen detects that content is potentially unsafe, you will see a warning in place of the content.
Microsoft Defender SmartScreen can be turned on or off in Settings.</p>
<p>
<strong>Microsoft Defender Antivirus</strong>.
Microsoft Defender Antivirus looks for malware and other unwanted software, potentially unwanted apps, and other malicious content on your device.
Microsoft Defender Antivirus is automatically turned on to help protect your device if no other antimalware software is actively protecting your device.
If Microsoft Defender Antivirus is turned on, it will monitor the security status of your device.
When Microsoft Defender Antivirus is turned on, or is running because Limited Periodic Scanning is enabled, it will automatically send reports to Microsoft that contain data about suspected malware and other unwanted software, potentially unwanted apps, and other malicious content, and it may also send files that could contain malicious content, such as malware or unknown files for further inspection.
If a report is likely to contain personal data, the report is not sent automatically, and you'll be prompted before it is sent.
You can configure Microsoft Defender Antivirus not to send reports and suspected malware to Microsoft.</p>Top of page<i>

<strong>Speech</strong>.
Microsoft provides both a device-based speech recognition feature and cloud-based (online) speech recognition technologies.
</p>
<p> Turning on the online speech recognition setting lets you use Microsoft’s cloud-based speech recognition technologies in Cortana, the Mixed Reality Portal, dictation in Windows, supported Microsoft Store apps, and over time in other parts of Windows.
</p>
<p> Turning on speech while setting up a HoloLens device or installing Windows Mixed Reality allows you to use your voice for commands, dictation, and app interactions.
Both device-based speech recognition and online speech recognition settings will be enabled.
With both settings enabled, while your headset is turned on the device will always be listening to your voice input and will send your voice data to Microsoft’s cloud-based speech recognition technologies.
</p>
<p> When you use Microsoft’s cloud-based speech recognition technologies, Microsoft collects and uses your voice recordings to create a text transcription of the spoken words in the voice data.
To learn more about how Microsoft manages your voice data, see Speech recognition technologies.
</p>
<p> You can use device-based speech recognition without sending your voice data to Microsoft.
However, Microsoft’s cloud-based speech recognition technologies provide more accurate recognition than the device-based speech recognition.
When the online speech recognition setting is turned off, speech services that don’t rely on the cloud and only use device-based recognition—like the Narrator app or the Windows Speech Recognition app—will still work.
</p>
<p> If you’ve given permission in Cortana, we also collect additional information, like your name and nickname, your recent calendar events, and the names of the people in your appointments, information about your contacts including names and nicknames, names of your favorite places, apps you use, and information about your music preferences.
This additional data enables us to better recognize people, events, places, and music when you dictate commands, messages, or documents.
</p>
<p> You can turn off online speech recognition at any time.
This will stop your voice data from being sent to Microsoft.
If you are using a HoloLens or mixed reality headset, you can also turn off device-based speech recognition at any time.
This will stop the device from listening for your voice input.
Learn more about speech recognition in Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Voice Activation</strong>.
Windows provides supported apps with the ability to respond and take action based on voice keywords that are specific to that app—for example allowing Cortana to listen and respond to “Hey Cortana.”
</p>
<p>If you’ve given permission for an app to listen for voice keywords, Windows 10 will be actively listening to the microphone for these keywords.
Once a keyword is recognized, the app will have access to your voice recording, can process the recording, take action, and respond, such as with a spoken answer.
The app may send the voice recording to its own services in the cloud to process the commands.
Each app should ask you for permission before accessing voice recordings.</p>
<p>Additionally, voice activation can be enabled when the device is locked.
If enabled, the relevant app will continue listening to the microphone for voice keywords when you have locked your device and can activate for anyone who speaks near the device.
When the device is locked, the app will have access to the same set of capabilities and information as when the device is unlocked.</p>
<p> You can turn off voice activation at any time.
Learn more about voice activation in Windows 10.
</p>
<p> Even when you’ve turned off voice activation, some third-party desktop apps and services could still be listening to the microphone and collect your voice input.

To augment your media information, Windows Media player will send a request to Microsoft which contains standard computer information, an identifier for the media content, and the media information already contained in your Windows Media Player library (including information you may have edited or entered yourself) so that Microsoft can recognize the track and then return additional information that is available.</p>
<p>Windows Media Player also allows you to play back content that is streamed to you over a network.
To provide this service, it is necessary for Windows Media Player to communicate with a streaming media server.
These servers are typically operated by non-Microsoft content providers.
During playback of streaming media, Windows Media Player will send a log to the streaming media server or other web server(s) if the streaming media server requests it.
The log includes such details as: connection time, IP address, operating system version, Windows Media Player version, Player identification number (Player ID), date, and protocol.
To protect your privacy, Windows Media Player defaults to sending a Player ID that is different for each session.</p>Top of page<i>

</i>XboxXbox<p>The Xbox network is the online gaming and entertainment service from Microsoft that consists of software and online experiences across different platforms.
This service lets you find and play games, view content, and connect with friends on Xbox and other gaming and social networks.
You can connect to the Xbox network using Xbox consoles, Windows 10 PCs, and mobile devices (Android and iPhone).
</p>
<p>When you sign up for an Xbox profile, we assign a gamertag (a public nickname) and a unique identifier.
When you sign in on Xbox devices, apps, and services, the data we collect about your use is stored using these unique identifier(s).</p>
<p>Xbox consoles are devices you can use to find and play games, movies, music, and other digital entertainment.
When you sign in to Xbox experiences—in apps or on a console—we also assign a unique device identifier.
When your Xbox console is connected to the internet, for instance, and you sign in to the console, we identify which console and which version of the console’s operating system you’re using.</p>
<p>Xbox continues to provide new experiences in client apps that are connected to and backed by services such as the Xbox network and cloud gaming.
To ensure these connected experiences remain reliable, up to date, secure, and performing as expected, required service data may be collected whenever you use a connected experience.</p>
<p>
<strong>Data we collect</strong> about your use of Xbox services, games, apps, and consoles includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you sign in and sign out of Xbox, the games you play and apps you use, your game progress, achievements, and play statistics, any purchases you make, and content you obtain.</li>
<li>Performance data about Xbox consoles, Xbox Game Pass and other Xbox apps, the Xbox network, connected devices, and your network connection, including software or hardware errors.</li>
<li>Content you add, upload, or share through the Xbox network, including text, pictures, and video you capture in games and apps.</li>
<li>Social activity, including chat data and interactions with other gamers, and connections you make (friends you add and people who follow you) on the Xbox network.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use an Xbox console or Xbox app on another device capable of accessing the Xbox network, and that device includes a storage device (hard drive or memory unit), usage data will be stored on the storage device and sent to Microsoft the next time you sign in to Xbox, even if you’ve been playing offline.</p>
<p>
<strong>Xbox console diagnostic data</strong>.
Diagnostic data has two categories: required and optional.
If you use an Xbox console, the console will send required data to Microsoft.
Optional data is additional data that you choose to share with Microsoft.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Required</strong>.
The minimum data necessary to help keep Xbox safe, secure, up to date, and performing as expected.</li>
<li>
<strong>Optional</strong>.
Optional data includes additional details about your console, its settings, its health, its use, and enhanced error reporting to help us detect, diagnose, and fix problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Learn more at Manage settings for optional data sharing.</p>
<p>
<strong>Game captures</strong>.
Any player in a multiplayer game session can record video (game clips) and capture screenshots of their view of the game play.
Other players’ game clips and screenshots can capture your in-game character and gamertag during that session.
If a player captures game clips and screenshots on a PC, the resulting game clips might also capture audio chat.</p>
<p>
<strong>Captioning</strong>.
During Xbox real-time (“party”) chat, players may activate a voice-to-text feature that lets them view that chat as text.
If a player activates this feature, all voice communication in the party is captioned for the player.
Microsoft uses the resulting text data to provide captioning of chat for players who need it, as well as the other purposes described in this statement.</p>
<p>
<strong>Data use</strong>.
Microsoft uses the data we collect from your use of Xbox consoles, Xbox apps, Xbox store and the Xbox network to provide you with those experiences—and make them safer and more fun over time.
Data we collect includes device information and game play statistics, such as the number of unique players and play time per game.</p>
<p>Data we collect also enables us to provide you with personalized, curated experiences.
This includes connecting you to games, content, and services, as well as presenting you with offers, discounts, and recommendations.</p>
<p>
<strong>Xbox data viewable by others</strong>.
Your gamertag, game and play statistics, achievements, presence (whether you are currently signed in to Xbox), content you share, and other data about your activity on Xbox can be seen by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Other players signed in to Xbox.</li>
<li>Customers of third-party services you’ve linked your profile to, or</li>
<li>Other services associated with Xbox (including those of partner companies).</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, your gamertag and scores that show on game leaderboards are considered public and cannot be hidden.
For other data, you can adjust your privacy settings on consoles and at Xbox.com to limit or block what is shared with the public or with friends.</p>
<p>Learn more at Use your safety settings.</p>
<p>
<strong>Xbox data shared with third parties including game and apps publishers</strong>.

<p>Third-party publishers and developers of games and apps have their own distinct and independent relationship with users and their collection and usage of personal data is subject to their specific privacy policies.
You should carefully review their policies to determine how they use the data.
For example, publishers may choose to disclose or display game data (such as on leaderboards) through their own services.
You may find their policies linked from game or app detail pages in the Microsoft Store.</p>
<p>Learn more at Data Sharing with Games and Apps.</p>

<p>Product-specific sections below describe data collection practices applicable to use of those products.</p>How we use personal dataHow we use personal datamainhowweusepersonaldatamoduleSummary<p>Microsoft uses the data we collect to provide you with rich, interactive experiences.
In particular, we use data to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide our products, which includes updating, securing, and troubleshooting, as well as providing support.
It also includes sharing data, when it is required to provide the service or carry out the transactions you request.</li>
<li>Improve and develop our products.</li>
<li>Personalize our products and make recommendations.</li>
<li>Advertise and market to you, which includes sending promotional communications, targeting advertising, and presenting you with relevant offers.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also use the data to operate our business, which includes analyzing our performance, meeting our legal obligations, developing our workforce, and doing research.</p>
<p>In carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect from different contexts (for example, from your use of two Microsoft products) or obtain from third parties to give you a more seamless, consistent, and personalized experience, to make informed business decisions, and for other legitimate purposes.</p>
<p>Our processing of personal data for these purposes includes both automated and manual (human) methods of processing.
Our automated methods often are related to and supported by our manual methods.
For example, our automated methods include artificial intelligence (AI), which we think of as a set of technologies that enable computers to perceive, learn, reason, and assist in decision-making to solve problems in ways that are similar to what people do.
To build, train, and improve the accuracy of our automated methods of processing (including AI), we manually review some of the predictions and inferences produced by the automated methods against the underlying data from which the predictions and inferences were made.
For example, we manually review short snippets of voice data that we have taken steps to de-identify to improve our speech recognition technologies.
This manual review may be conducted by Microsoft employees or vendors who are working on Microsoft’s behalf.</p>Full text<p>Microsoft uses the data we collect to provide you rich, interactive experiences.

<p>We also use the data to operate our business, which includes analyzing our performance, meeting our legal obligations, developing our workforce, and doing research.</p>
<p>For these purposes, we combine data we collect from different contexts (for example, from your use of two Microsoft products).
For example Cortana may use information from your calendar to suggest action items in a heads-up email, and Microsoft Store uses information about the apps and services you use to make personalized app recommendations.
However, we have built in technological and procedural safeguards designed to prevent certain data combinations where required by law.
For example, where required by law, we store data we collect from you when you are unauthenticated (not signed in) separately from any account information that directly identifies you, such as your name, email address, or phone number.</p>
<p>Our processing of personal data for these purposes includes both automated and manual (human) methods of processing.
Our automated methods often are related to and supported by our manual methods.

<p> When we process personal data about you, we do so with your consent and/or as required to provide the products you use, operate our business, meet our contractual and legal obligations, protect the security of our systems and our customers, or fulfill other legitimate interests of Microsoft as described in this section and in the Reasons we share personal data&nbsp;section of this privacy statement.
When we transfer personal data from the European Economic Area, we do so based on a variety of legal mechanisms, as described in the Where we store and process personal data section of this privacy statement.

Or, for example, if you enter a search query in the Bing search engine, we use that query to display search results to you.
Additionally, as communications are a feature of various products, programs, and activities, we use data to contact you.
For example, we may contact you by phone or email or other means to inform you when a subscription is ending or discuss your licensing account.
We also communicate with you to secure our products, for example by letting you know when product updates are available.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Product improvement</strong>.
We use data to continually improve our products, including adding new features or capabilities.

Microsoft does not use what you say in email, chat, video calls, or voice mail, or your documents, photos, or other personal files to target ads to you.
We use data we collect through our interactions with you, through some of our products, and on third-party web properties, for advertising in our products and on third-party properties.
We may use automated processes to help make advertising more relevant to you.
For more information about how your data is used for advertising, see the Advertising section of this privacy statement.

<p>
<strong>Your communications preferences</strong>
</p>
<p> You can choose whether you wish to receive promotional communications from Microsoft by email, SMS, physical mail, and telephone.
If you receive promotional email or SMS messages from us and would like to opt out, you can do so by following the directions in that message.
You can also make choices about the receipt of promotional email, telephone calls, and postal mail by signing in with your personal Microsoft account, and viewing your communication permissions where you can update contact information, manage Microsoft-wide contact preferences, opt out of email subscriptions, and choose whether to share your contact information with Microsoft partners.
If you do not have a personal Microsoft account, you can manage your Microsoft email contact preferences by using this web form.
These choices do not apply to mandatory service communications that are part of certain Microsoft products, programs, activities, or to surveys or other informational communications that have their own unsubscribe method.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Your advertising choices</strong>
</p>
<p>To opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from Microsoft, visit our opt-out page.
When you opt out, your preference is stored in a cookie that is specific to the web browser you are using.
The opt-out cookie has an expiration date of five years.
If you delete the cookies on your device, you need to opt out again.</p>
<p>You can also link your opt-out choice with your personal Microsoft account.
It will then apply on any device where you use that account and will continue to apply until someone signs in with a different personal Microsoft account on that device.
If you delete the cookies on your device, you will need to sign in again for the settings to apply.</p>
<p>For Microsoft-controlled advertising that appears in apps on Windows, you may use the opt-out linked to your personal Microsoft account, or opt out of interest-based advertising by turning off the advertising ID in Windows settings.</p>
<p>Because the data used for interest-based advertising is also used for other required purposes (including providing our products, analytics, and fraud detection), opting out of interest-based advertising does not stop that data collection.
You will continue to get ads, although they may be less relevant to you.</p>
<p>You can opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from third parties we partner with by visiting their sites (see above).</p>
<p>
<strong>Browser-based controls </strong>
</p>
<p>When you use a browser, you can control your personal data using certain features.
For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Cookie controls</strong>.
You can control the data stored by cookies and withdraw consent to cookies by using the browser-based cookie controls described in the Cookies section of this privacy statement.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Tracking protections</strong>.
You can control the data third-party sites can collect about you using Tracking Protection in Internet Explorer (versions 9 and up) and Microsoft Edge.
This feature will block third-party content, including cookies, from any site that is listed in a Tracking Protection List you add.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Browser controls for "Do Not Track."</strong> Some browsers have incorporated "Do Not Track" (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked.
Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, Microsoft services do not currently respond to browser DNT signals.
We continue to work with the online industry to define a common understanding of how to treat DNT signals.
In the meantime, you can use the range of other tools we provide to control data collection and use, including the ability to opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from Microsoft as described above.</li>

<p>Below is additional information about the collection of data from children as related to Xbox.</p>
<p>
<strong>What is Xbox?</strong> Xbox is the gaming and entertainment division of Microsoft.
Xbox hosts an online network that consists of software and online experiences crossing multiple platforms.
This network lets your child find and play games, view content, and connect with friends on Xbox and other gaming and social networks.
Children can connect to the Xbox network using Xbox consoles, Windows 10 PCs, and mobile devices (Android and iPhone).</p>
<p>Xbox consoles are devices your child can use to find and play games, movies, music, and other digital entertainment.
When they sign in to Xbox, in apps, games or on a console, we assign a unique device identifier.
For instance, when their Xbox console is connected to the internet and they sign in to the console, we identify which console and which version of the console’s operating system they are using.</p>
<p>Xbox continues to provide new experiences in client apps that are connected to and backed by services such as Xbox network and cloud gaming.
To ensure these connected experiences remain reliable, up to date, secure, and performing as expected, required service data may be collected whenever your child uses a connected experience.</p>
<p>
<strong>Data we collect when you create an Xbox profile</strong>.
You as the parent or guardian are required to consent to the collection of personal data from a child under 13 years old.
With your permission, your child can have an Xbox profile and use the online Xbox network.
During the child Xbox profile creation, you will sign in with your own Microsoft account to verify that you are an adult organizer in your Microsoft family group.
We collect an alternate email address or phone number to boost account security.
If your child needs help accessing their account, they will be able to use one of these alternates to validate they own the Microsoft account.</p>
<p>We collect limited information about children, including name, birthdate, email address, and region. When you sign your child up for an Xbox profile, they get a gamertag (a public nickname) and a unique identifier.
When you create your child’s Xbox profile you consent to Microsoft collecting, using, and sharing information based on their privacy and communication settings on the Xbox online network. Your child’s privacy and communication settings are defaulted to the most restrictive.</p>
<p>
<strong>Data we collect</strong>.
 We collect information about your child’s use of Xbox services, games, apps, and consoles including:</p>
<ul>
<li>When they sign in and sign out of Xbox, the games they play and apps they use, their game progress, achievements, and play statistics, purchase history, and content they obtain.</li>
<li>Performance data about Xbox consoles, Xbox Game Pass and other Xbox apps, the Xbox network, connected devices, and network connection, including software or hardware errors.</li>
<li>Content they add, upload, or share through the Xbox network, including text, pictures, and video they capture in games and apps.</li>
<li>Social activity, including chat data and interactions with other gamers, and connections they make (friends they add and people who follow them) on the Xbox network.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your child uses an Xbox console or Xbox app on another device capable of accessing the Xbox network, and that device includes a storage device (hard drive or memory unit), usage data will be stored on the storage device and sent to Microsoft the next time they sign in to Xbox, even if they have been playing offline.</p>
<p>
<strong>Xbox console diagnostic data</strong>.
If your child uses an Xbox console, the console will send required data to Microsoft.
Required data is the minimum data necessary to help keep Xbox safe, secure, up to date, and performing as expected.</p>
<p>
<strong>Game captures</strong>.
Any player in a multiplayer game session can record video (game clips) and capture screenshots of their view of the game play.
Other players’ game clips and screenshots can capture your child’s in-game character and gamertag during that session.
If a player captures game clips and screenshots on a PC, the resulting game clips might also capture audio chat if your child’s privacy and communication settings on the Xbox online network allow it.</p>
<p>
<strong>Captioning</strong>.
During Xbox real-time (“party”) chat, players may activate a voice-to-text feature that lets them view that chat as text.
If a player activates this feature, Microsoft uses the resulting text data to provide captioning of chat for players who need it.
This data may also be used to provide a safe gaming environment and enforce the Community Standards for Xbox.</p>
<p>
<strong>Data use</strong>.
Microsoft uses the data we collect from your child’s use of Xbox consoles, Xbox apps, games, and the Xbox network to provide them with experiences—and make it safer and more fun over time.
Data we collect includes device information and game play statistics, such as the number of unique players and play time per game.
Data we collect also enables us to provide your child with personalized, curated experiences.
This includes connecting them to games, content, services, and recommendations.</p>
<p>
<strong>Xbox data viewable by others</strong>.
When your child is using the Xbox network, their online presence (which can be set to “appear offline” or “blocked”), gamertag, game play statistics, and achievements are visible to other players on the network.
Depending on how you set your child’s Xbox safety settings, they might share information when playing or communicating with others on the Xbox network. </p>
<p>The Xbox network includes communications features such as text and voice, direct messaging, and real-time text and voice chat.
In order to help provide a safe gaming environment and enforce the Community Standards for Xbox, we collect and monitor text communications during hosted multiplayer game sessions, direct messages, and other features of the service, including activity feeds and clubs.</p>
<p>
<strong>Xbox data shared with game and apps publishers</strong>.
When your child uses an Xbox online game or any network-connected app on their Xbox console, PC, or mobile device, the publisher of that game or app has access to data about their usage to help the publisher deliver, support, and improve its product.
This data may include: your child’s Xbox user identifier, gamertag, limited account info such as country and age range, data about your child’s in-game communications, any Xbox enforcement activity, game-play sessions (for example, moves made in-game or types of vehicles used in-game), your child’s presence on the Xbox network, the time they spend playing the game or app, rankings, statistics, gamer profiles, avatars, or gamerpics, friends lists, activity feeds for official clubs they belong to, official club memberships, and any content they create or submit in the game or app.</p>
<p>Third-party publishers and developers of games and apps have their own distinct and independent relationship with users and their collection and usage of personal data is subject to their specific privacy policies.
You should carefully review their policies to determine how they use your child’s data.
For example, publishers may choose to disclose or display game data (such as on leaderboards) through their own services.
You may find their policies linked from the game or app detail pages in our stores.</p>
<p>Learn more at Data Sharing with Games and Apps.</p>
<p>To stop sharing game or app data with a publisher, remove its games or app from all devices where they have been installed.
Some publisher access to your child’s data may be revoked at microsoft.com/consent.</p>
<p>
<strong>Managing child settings</strong>.
As the organizer of a Microsoft family group, you can manage a child’s information and settings on their Family Safety page, as well as their Xbox profile privacy settings from their Xbox Privacy &amp.

You can find more information on Microsoft and our commitment to protecting your privacy at Microsoft Privacy.</p>Security of personal dataSecurity of personal datamainsecurityofpersonaldatamoduleSummary<p>Microsoft is committed to protecting the security of your personal data.
We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
For example, we store the personal data you provide on computer systems that have limited access and are in controlled facilities.
When we transmit highly confidential data (such as a credit card number or password) over the internet, we protect it through the use of encryption.
Microsoft complies with applicable data protection laws, including applicable security breach notification laws.</p>Where we store and process personal dataWhere we store and process personal datamainwherewestoreandprocessdatamoduleSummary<p>Personal data collected by Microsoft may be stored and processed in your region, in the United States, and in any other country where Microsoft or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers operate facilities.
Microsoft maintains major data centers in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Singapore, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
Typically, the primary storage location is in the customer’s region or in the United States, often with a backup to a data center in another region.
The storage location(s) are chosen in order to operate efficiently, to improve performance, and to create redundancies in order to protect the data in the event of an outage or other problem.
We take steps to ensure that the data we collect under this privacy statement is processed according to the provisions of this statement and the requirements of applicable law wherever the data is located.</p>
<p>We transfer personal data from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to other countries, some of which have not yet been determined by the European Commission to have an adequate level of data protection.
For example, their laws may not guarantee you the same rights, or there may not be a privacy supervisory authority there that is capable of addressing your complaints.
When we engage in such transfers, we use a variety of legal mechanisms, including contracts such as the standard contractual clauses published by the European Commission under Commission Decision 2004/915/EC, to help ensure your rights and protections travel with your data.
To learn more about the European Commission’s decisions on the adequacy of the protection of personal data in the countries where Microsoft processes personal data, see this article on the European Commission website.</p>
<p>Microsoft Corporation complies with the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S.
Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to the United States, although Microsoft does not rely on the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework as a legal basis for transfers of personal data in light of the judgment of the Court of Justice of the EU in Case C-311/18.
Microsoft Corporation has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.
If third-party agents process personal data on our behalf in a manner inconsistent with the principles of either Privacy Shield framework, we remain liable unless we prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
The controlled U.S.
subsidiaries of Microsoft Corporation, as identified in our self-certification submission, also adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles—for more info, see the list of Microsoft U.S.
entities or subsidiaries adhering to the Privacy Shield Principles.</p>
<p>If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.
To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, visit the Privacy Shield website.</p>
<p>If you have a question or complaint related to participation by Microsoft in the EU-U.S.
or Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield, we encourage you to contact us via our web form.
For any complaints related to the Privacy Shield frameworks that Microsoft cannot resolve directly, we have chosen to cooperate with the relevant EU Data Protection Authority, or a panel established by the European data protection authorities, for resolving disputes with EU individuals, and with the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) for resolving disputes with Swiss individuals.
Please contact us if you’d like us to direct you to your data protection authority contacts.
As further explained in the Privacy Shield Principles, binding arbitration is available to address residual complaints not resolved by other means.
Microsoft is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S.
Federal Trade Commission (FTC).</p>Our retention of personal dataOur retention of personal datamainOurretentionofpersonaldatamoduleSummary<p>Microsoft retains personal data for as long as necessary to provide the products and fulfill the transactions you have requested, or for other legitimate purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements.
Because these needs can vary for different data types, the context of our interactions with you or your use of products, actual retention periods can vary significantly.</p>
<p>Other criteria used to determine the retention periods include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Do customers provide, create, or maintain the data with the expectation we will retain it until they affirmatively remove it?</strong> Examples include a document you store in OneDrive, or an email message you keep in your Outlook.com inbox.
In such cases, we would aim to maintain the data until you actively delete it, such as by moving an email from your Outlook.com inbox to the Deleted Items folder, and then emptying that folder (when your Deleted Items folder is emptied, those emptied items remain in our system for up to 30 days before final deletion).
(Note that there may be other reasons why the data has to be deleted sooner, for example if you exceed limits on how much data can be stored in your account.)</li>
<li>
<strong>Is there an automated control, such as in the Microsoft privacy dashboard, that enables the customer to access and delete the personal data at any time?</strong> If there is not, a shortened data retention time will generally be adopted.</li>
<li>
<strong>Is the personal data of a sensitive type?</strong> If so, a shortened retention time would generally be adopted.</li>
<li>
<strong>Has Microsoft adopted and announced a specific retention period for a certain data type?</strong> For example, for Bing search queries, we de-identify stored queries by removing the entirety of the IP address after 6 months, and cookie IDs and other cross-session identifiers that are used to identify a particular account or device after 18 months.</li>
<li>
<strong>Has the user provided consent for a longer retention period?</strong> If so, we will retain data in accordance with your consent.</li>
<li>
<strong>Is Microsoft subject to a legal, contractual, or similar obligation to retain or delete the data?</strong> Examples can include mandatory data retention laws in the applicable jurisdiction, government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation, or data retained for the purposes of litigation.
Conversely, if we are required by law to remove unlawful content, we will do so.</li>
</ul>California Consumer Privacy ActCalifornia Consumer Privacy ActmaincaliforniaconsumerprivacyactmoduleSummary<p>If you are a California resident, we process your personal data in accordance with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).

<p>See our CCPA Notice for additional information.</p>AdvertisingAdvertisingmainadvertisingmoduleSummary<p>Advertising allows us to provide, support, and improve some of our products.
Microsoft does not use what you say in email, chat, video calls or voice mail, or your documents, photos, or other personal files to target ads to you.
We use other data, detailed below, for advertising in our products and on third-party properties.
For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft may use data we collect to select and deliver some of the ads you see on Microsoft web properties, such as Microsoft.com, MSN, and Bing.</li>
<li>When the advertising ID is enabled in Windows 10 as part of your privacy settings, third parties can access and use the advertising ID (much the same way that websites can access and use a unique identifier stored in a cookie) to select and deliver ads in such apps.</li>
<li>We may share data we collect with partners, such as Verizon Media, AppNexus, or Facebook (see below), so that the ads you see in our products and their products are more relevant and valuable to you.</li>
<li>Advertisers may choose to place our web beacons on their sites, or use similar technologies, in order to allow Microsoft to collect information on their sites such as activities, purchases, and visits.
we use this data on behalf of our advertising customers to provide ads.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ads that you see may be selected based on data we process about you, such as your interests and favorites, your location, your transactions, how you use our products, your search queries, or the content you view.
For example, if you view content on MSN about automobiles, we may show advertisements about cars.
if you search “pizza places in Seattle” on Bing, you may see advertisements in your search results for restaurants in Seattle.</p>
<p>The ads that you see may also be selected based on other information learned about you over time using demographic data, location data, search queries, interests and favorites, usage data from our products and sites, and the information we collect about you from the sites and apps of our advertisers and partners.
We refer to these ads as "personalized advertising" in this statement.
For example, if you view gaming content on xbox.com, you may see offers for games on MSN.
To provide personalized advertising, we combine cookies placed on your device using information that we collect (such as IP address) when your browser interacts with our websites.
If you opt out of receiving personalized advertising, data associated with these cookies will not be used.</p>
<p>We may use information about you to serve you with personalized advertising when you use Microsoft services.
If you are logged in with your Microsoft account and have consented to allow Microsoft Edge to use your online activity for personalized advertising, you will see offers for products and services based on your online activity while using Microsoft Edge.

<strong>Office Roaming Service</strong>.
The Office Roaming Service helps keep your Microsoft 365 settings up to date across your devices running Microsoft 365.
When you sign in to Microsoft 365 with your Microsoft account or an account issued by your organization, the Office Client Policy Service is turned on and syncs some of your customized Microsoft 365 settings to Microsoft servers (such as a list of most recently used documents and the last location viewed within a document).
When you sign in to Microsoft 365 on another device with the same account, the Office Roaming Service downloads your settings from Microsoft servers and applies them to the additional device.
The Office Roaming Service also applies some of your customized Microsoft 365 settings when you sign in to Office.com.
When you sign out of Microsoft 365, the Office Roaming Service removes your Microsoft 365 settings from your device.
Any changes you make to your customized Microsoft 365 settings are sent to Microsoft servers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Microsoft Updates</strong>.
Microsoft uses services such as Click-to-Run or Microsoft AutoUpdate to provide you with security and other important updates.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Click-to-Run Update Service</strong>.
The Click-to-Run Update Service allows you to install certain Microsoft 365 products over the internet.
The Click-to-Run Update Service also automatically detects online updates to Click-to-Run-enabled products on your device and downloads and installs them automatically.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Translator</strong>.
Translator used in Office apps is designed as a no-trace connected experience.
With no trace connected experience, no portion of your translation request that gets sent to Microsoft Translator API service will be logged, your submitted text will not be used to improve the quality of the Microsoft Translator service, and there will not be any record of any portion of your data retained by Microsoft.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Diagnostic Data</strong>.
Diagnostic data is used to (i) keep your Office apps secure and up to date.
(ii) detect, diagnose, and remediate problems.
and (iii) make product improvements.
This data does not include a user's name or email address, the content of the user's files, or information about apps unrelated to Office.
Users have a choice between two different levels of diagnostic data collection, Required and Optional.
</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p> See Diagnostic Data in Office for more information.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Connected Experiences</strong>.
Microsoft 365 continues to provide more experiences in client applications that are connected to and backed by cloud-based services.
If you choose to use connected experiences, required service data will be collected to ensure that all these connected experiences will be reliable, up to date, remain secure, and perform as expected.
See below for additional information about required service data.
</p>
<p>Microsoft 365 consists of client software applications and connected experiences designed to enable you to create, communicate, and collaborate more effectively.
Working with others on a document stored on OneDrive for Business or translating the contents of a Word document into a different language are examples of connected experiences.
There are two types of connected experiences.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Experiences that analyze your content</strong>.
Experiences that use your Office content to provide you with design recommendations, editing suggestions, data insights, and similar features.
For example, PowerPoint Designer or Editor in Word.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Experiences that download online content</strong>.
Experiences that allow you to search and download online content including templates, images, 3D models, videos, and reference materials to enhance your documents.
For example, templates or PowerPoint QuickStarter.
</li>
</ul>
<p> You can access the privacy controls within your Office apps by selecting <strong>File</strong> &gt.
<strong>Account</strong> &gt.
<strong>Account Privacy</strong>.
These privacy settings allow you to configure your connected experiences.
For example, you can choose to enable connected experiences that download online content, but not connected experiences that analyze content.
Turning off connected experiences will also turn off additional experiences, such as document co-authoring and online file storage.
But even if you use this privacy setting to turn off connected experiences, certain functionality will remain available, such as syncing your mailbox in Outlook, as well as essential services described below.
</p>
<p>If you choose to disable certain types of connected experiences, either the ribbon or menu command for those connected experiences will be grayed out or you will get an error message when you try to use those connected experiences.</p>
<p> There are a set of services that are essential to how Microsoft 365 functions and cannot be disabled.
For example, the licensing service that confirms that you are properly licensed to use Microsoft 365 is essential.
Required service data about these services is collected and sent to Microsoft, regardless of any other settings that you have configured.
See Essential Services for more information.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Required service data for connected experiences</strong>.
As you use a connected experience, data is sent to and processed by Microsoft to provide you that connected experience.
This data is necessary because this information enables us to deliver these cloud-based connected experiences.
We refer to this data as required service data.
</p>
<p>Required service data can include information related to the operation of the connected experience that is needed to keep the underlying service secure, up to date, and performing as expected.
If you choose to use a connected experience that analyzes your content, for example Translate in Word, the text you typed and selected to translate is also sent and processed to provide you the connected experience.
Your text and the translation are not stored by our service.
Required service data can also include information needed by a connected experience to perform its task, such as configuration information about the Office app.</p>
<p> See Required service data for Office for more information.

Teams lets you stay organised and connected across your entire life.
Teams allows you to call people with voice or video calling.
Teams allows you to easily find people, files, photos, conversations, tasks, and calendars in one convenient and secure place.
Teams allows you to store confidential information like passwords, rewards numbers, or login information and share it with others within Teams.
With your consent, you can share your location with friends and family.</p>
<p>As part of providing these features, Microsoft collects data about the usage of the features as well as information about your communications, including the time and date of the communication and users that are part of the communication.</p>
<p>
<strong>Teams profile</strong>.
Your Teams profile includes information you provided when you set up a Microsoft account.
To enable other people to find you on Teams (or products that interact with Teams for personal use, including Teams for enterprise) your display name and picture are visible to other users on Teams that have your contact information.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Teams contacts</strong>.
With your permission, Teams will sync your device contacts periodically and check for other Teams users that match contacts in your device’s address book.
You are always in control of your contacts and can stop syncing at any time.
If you choose to stop syncing your device contacts, any device contacts that have not been matched during the synchronization process will be deleted from Teams.
If you wish to invite any of your device contacts to join a conversation, you can invite users to a 1:1 directly, or Microsoft can send an invitation on your behalf via SMS or email for invitations to group conversations.
You can block users if you don’t want to receive their communications.
additionally you can report a concern to Microsoft.</p>
<p>
<strong>Location sharing</strong>.
You can share your static or live location with individuals or groups within Teams.
You are in control and can stop sharing at any time.
Sharing location for children is permitted with parental consent and in groups where an adult from the Microsoft family group is present.</p>
<p>
<strong>Push notifications</strong>.
To let you know of incoming calls, chats, and other messages, Teams uses the notification service on your device.
For many devices, these services are provided by another company.
To tell you who is calling, for example, or to give you the first few words of the new chat, Teams has to tell the notification service so that they can provide the notification to you.
The company providing the notification service on your device will use this information in accordance with their own terms and privacy policy.
Microsoft is not responsible for the data collected by the company providing the notification service.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to use the notification services for incoming Teams calls and messages, turn it off in the settings found on your device.</p>OneDriveOneDrivemainonedrivemoduleSummary<p>OneDrive lets you store and access your files on virtually any device.
You can also share and collaborate on your files with others.
Some versions of the OneDrive application enable you to access both your personal OneDrive by signing in with your personal Microsoft account and your OneDrive for Business by signing in with your work or school Microsoft account as part of your organization's use of Microsoft 365 or Office 365.</p>
<p>When you use OneDrive, we collect data about your usage of the service, as well as the content you store, to provide, improve, and protect the services.
Examples include indexing the contents of your OneDrive documents so that you can search for them later and using location information to enable you to search for photos based on where the photo was taken.
We also collect device information so we can deliver personalized experiences, such as enabling you to sync content across devices and roam customized settings.</p>
<p>When you store content in OneDrive, that content will inherit the sharing permissions of the folder in which you store it.
For example, if you decide to store content in the public folder, the content will be public and available to anyone on the internet who can find the folder.
If you store content in a private folder, the content will be private.</p>
<p>When you share content to a social network like Facebook from a device that you have synced with your OneDrive account, your content is either uploaded to that social network, or a link to that content is posted to that social network.
Doing this makes the content accessible to anyone on that social network.
To delete the content, you need to delete it from the social network (if it was uploaded there, rather than a link to it) and from OneDrive.</p>
<p>When you share your OneDrive content with your friends via a link, an email with the link is sent to those friends.
The link contains an authorization code that allows anyone with the link to access your content.
If one of your friends sends the link to other people, they will also be able to access your content, even if you did not choose to share the content with them.
To revoke permissions for your content on OneDrive, sign in to your account and then select the specific content to manage the permission levels.
Revoking permissions for a link effectively deactivates the link.
No one will be able to use the link to access the content unless you decide to share the link again.</p>
<p>Files managed with OneDrive for Business are stored separately from files stored with your personal OneDrive.
OneDrive for Business collects and transmits personal data for authentication, such as your email address and password, which will be transmitted to Microsoft and/or to the provider of your Microsoft 365 or Office 365 service.</p>OutlookOutlookmainoutlookmoduleSummary<p>Outlook products are designed to improve your productivity through improved communications and include Outlook.com, Outlook applications, and related services.</p>

Outlook.com provides features that let you connect with your friends on social networks.
You will need to create a Microsoft account to use Outlook.com.</p>
<p>When you delete an email or item from a mailbox in Outlook.com, the item generally goes into your Deleted Items folder where it remains for approximately 7 days unless you move it back to your inbox, you empty the folder, or the service empties the folder automatically, whichever comes first.
When the Deleted Items folder is emptied, those emptied items remain in our system for up to 30 days before final deletion, unless we are legally required to retain the data for longer.</p>
<p>

<p>To add an account, you must provide permission for Outlook to access data from the email or file storage services.</p>
<p>When you add an account to Outlook, your mail, calendar items, files, contacts, settings and other data from that account will automatically sync to your device.
If you are using the mobile Outlook application, that data will also sync to Microsoft servers to enable additional features such as faster search, personalized filtering of less important mail, and an ability to add email attachments from linked file storage providers without leaving the Outlook application.
If you are using the desktop Outlook application, you can choose whether to allow the data to sync to our servers.
At any time, you can remove an account or make changes to the data that is synced from your account.</p>
<p>If you add an account provided by an organization (such as your employer or school), the owner of the organizational domain can implement policies and controls (for example, requiring multi-factor authentication or the ability to remotely wipe data from your device) that can affect your use of Outlook.</p>

Bing services collect and process data in many forms, including text that has been inked or typed, voice data, and images.
Bing services are also included within other Microsoft services, such as Microsoft 365, Cortana, and certain features in Windows (which we refer to as Bing-powered experiences).
</p>
<p> When you conduct a search, or use a feature of a Bing-powered experience that involves conducting a search or entering a command on your behalf, Microsoft will collect the searches or commands you provide (which may be in the form of text, voice data, or an image), along with your IP address, location, the unique identifiers contained in our cookies or similar technologies, the time and date of your search, and your browser configuration.
For example, if you use Bing voice-enabled services, your voice input and performance data associated with the speech functionality will be sent to Microsoft.
To learn more about how Microsoft manages your voice data, see Speech recognition technologies.
And, if you use Bing image-enabled services, the image you provide will be sent to Microsoft.
When you use Bing-powered experiences, such as Bing Lookup to search a particular word or phrase within a webpage or document, that word or phrase is sent to Bing along with some surrounding content in order to provide contextually relevant search results.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Search suggestions</strong>.
For the search suggestions feature, the characters that you type into a Bing-powered experience (such as search and site suggestions in the Microsoft Edge browser) to conduct a search and what you click on will be sent to Microsoft.
This allows us to provide you with relevant suggestions as you type your searches.
To turn this feature on or off, while using Bing Search, go to Bing Settings.
There are other methods to control this feature in other Bing-powered experiences, such as the Microsoft Edge browser.
Search Suggestions cannot be turned off in the Windows 10 search box.
On Windows, you can always hide the search box so as not to use the feature.

To help protect your privacy, we do not use the data collected through the Bing Experience Improvement Program to identify or contact you or target advertising to you.
You can turn off the Bing Experience Improvement Program at any time in the Bing Desktop or Bing Toolbar settings.
Finally, we delete the information collected through the Bing Experience Improvement Program after 18 months.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Retention and de-identification</strong>.
We de-identify stored search queries by removing the entirety of the IP address after 6 months, and cookie IDs and other cross-session identifiers that are used to identify a particular account or device after 18 months.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Personalization through Microsoft account</strong>.
Some Bing services provide you with an enhanced experience when you sign in with your personal Microsoft account, for example, syncing your search history across devices.

</p>
<p>
<strong>Sharing data from Bing and Bing-powered experiences with third parties</strong>.
We share some de-identified data (data where the identity of a specific person is not known) from Bing and Bing-powered experiences with selected third parties.
Before we do so, we run the data through a process designed to remove certain sensitive data that users may have included in the search terms themselves (such as social security numbers or credit card numbers).
Additionally, we require these third parties to keep the data secure and to not use the data for purposes other than for which it is provided.

Cortana can process the demographic data (such as your age, address, and gender) associated with your Microsoft account and data collected through other Microsoft services to provide personalized suggestions.
Cortana also learns your favorite places from the Microsoft Maps app, and what you view and purchase in Microsoft Store to improve suggestions.
Your interests in the Cortana Notebook can be used by other Microsoft services, such as Bing or MSN, to customize your interests, preferences, and favorites in those experiences as well.</p>
<p>When you sign in to Cortana, in addition to the information described above, we also collect:</p>
<p>
<strong>Location data</strong>.
You can choose whether Cortana processes your location information to give you relevant notices and results and to make suggestions such as local traffic information and location-based reminders.
If you grant permission, Cortana will regularly collect and use your current location, location history, and other location signals (such as locations tagged on photos you upload to OneDrive).
Location data Cortana collects is used to provide you with personalized experiences across our products, such as making Bing search results more relevant.
It may also be used in de-identified form to improve Microsoft’s location services.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Contacts, communications, and other inputs</strong>.

</p>SwiftKeySwiftKeymainswiftkeymoduleSummary<p> The Microsoft Swiftkey keyboard and related cloud-based services (collectively, the “SwiftKey Services”) process data about words you use and how you type and use this data to learn your writing style and provide personalized autocorrection and predictive text that adapts to you.
We also use this data to offer a range of other features, such as hashtag and emoji predictions.
</p>
<p> SwiftKey prediction technology learns from the way you use language to build a personalized language model.
This model is an optimized view of the words and phrases that you use most often in context and reflects your unique writing style.
The model itself contains the words you commonly type arranged in a way that enables SwiftKey’s algorithms to make predictions, based on text you have already entered.
The model draws from all scenarios in which you use your keyboard, including when you type while using apps or visiting websites.
The SwiftKey keyboard and model attempt to avoid collecting sensitive data, by not collecting data from certain fields such as those recognized as containing password or payment data.
SwiftKey Services do not log, store, or learn from data you type, or the data contained in your model, unless you choose to share your data with us (as described further below).
When you use SwiftKey Services, we also collect device and usage data.
We use de-identified device and usage data to analyze service performance and help improve our products.
</p>
<p> The SwiftKey Services also include an optional cloud component called a SwiftKey Account.
If you choose to create a SwiftKey Account, your language model will be synced with the SwiftKey Account cloud service, so you can benefit from that model on the different devices you use and access additional services such as prediction synchronization and backup.
When you create a SwiftKey Account, Microsoft will also collect your email address and basic demographic data.
All data collected is transferred to our servers over encrypted channels.
</p>
<p> You may also opt in to share your language, typing data, and/or voice clips for the purposes of improving Microsoft products and services.
Depending on the opt-ins you choose, SwiftKey may send short snippets of data about what and how you type and/or your voice clips, and related correction data to our servers for processing.
These text snippets and/or voice clips are used in various automated processes to validate that our prediction services are working correctly and to make product improvements.
To preserve your privacy, SwiftKey Services de-identify these text snippets, and even if you have a SwiftKey Account, these text snippets and/or voice clips will not be linked to it.
To learn more about how Microsoft manages your voice data, see Speech recognition technologies.
</p>
<p> If you sign into your SwiftKey Account and opt to share your language and typing data or voice clips, Microsoft will process your shared data in order to look for new patterns of language usage across our user base.
This allows us to improve our basic models for individual languages.
Language and typing data used in this process is aggregated and any words or combinations of words that might be personal to individuals or small groups of users are filtered out.
</p>
<p> You can withdraw your consent to share your language and typing data or voice clips for product improvement at any time in SwiftKey Settings.
You can also withdraw your consent for SwiftKey Services to retain your personal data in SwiftKey Settings.
When you withdraw consent for SwiftKey to retain your personal data, all personal data collected through your use of the SwiftKey Services will be deleted.
</p>
<p> You may receive occasional notifications on your device alerting you to product updates and features that may be of interest to you.
You can disable these notifications at any time in the SwiftKey Settings.
</p>WindowsWindowsmainwindowsmoduleSummary<p>Windows is a personalized computing environment that enables you to seamlessly roam and access services, preferences, and content across your computing devices from phones to tablets to the Surface Hub.
Rather than residing as a static software program on your device, key components of Windows are cloud-based, and both cloud and local elements of Windows are updated regularly, providing you with the latest improvements and features.
In order to provide this computing experience, we collect data about you, your device, and the way you use Windows.
And because Windows is personal to you, we give you choices about the personal data we collect and how we use it.
Note that if your Windows device is managed by your organization (such as your employer or school), your organization may use centralized management tools provided by Microsoft or others to access and process your data and to control device settings (including privacy settings), device policies, software updates, data collection by us or the organization, or other aspects of your device.
Additionally, your organization may use management tools provided by Microsoft or others to access and process your data from that device, including your interaction data, diagnostic data, and the contents of your communications and files.
For more information about data collection and privacy in Windows, see Windows 10 and your online services.
Earlier versions of Windows (including Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1) are subject to their own privacy statements.</p>ActivationActivationmainactivationmoduleSummary<p>When you activate Windows, a specific product key is associated with the device on which your software is installed.
The product key and data about the software and your device is sent to Microsoft to help validate your license to the software.
This data may be sent again if there is a need to re-activate or validate your license.
On phones running Windows, device and network identifiers, as well as device location at the time of the first power-up of the device, are also sent to Microsoft for the purpose of warranty registration, stock replenishment, and fraud prevention.</p>Activity historyActivity historymainactivityhistorymoduleSummary<p>Activity history helps keep track of the things you do on your device, such as the apps and services you use, the files you open, and the websites you browse.
Your activity history is stored locally on your device when using different apps and features such as Microsoft Edge, some Microsoft Store apps, and Microsoft 365 apps.
If you've signed in to your device with a Microsoft account and given your permission, Windows sends your activity history to Microsoft.
Once your activity history is in the cloud, Microsoft uses that data to enable cross-device experiences, to provide you with the ability to continue those activities on other devices, to provide personalized experiences (such as ordering your activities based on duration of use) and relevant suggestions (such as anticipating what your needs might be based on your activity history), and to help improve Microsoft products.</p>
<p>Activity history is also created and sent to Microsoft when you use Microsoft apps, such as Microsoft Edge, and Office apps like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, on mobile devices such as iOS and Android phones and tablets.
If you are signed in with your Microsoft account, you can continue activities on your Windows&nbsp;10 device that you started in Microsoft apps on your Android or iOS device.

Learn more about diagnostic data in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
<strong>Inking and typing Recognition</strong>.
You also can choose to help Microsoft improve inking and typing recognition by sending inking and typing diagnostic data.
If you choose to do so, Microsoft will collect samples of the content you type or write to improve features such as handwriting recognition, autocompletion, next word prediction, and spelling correction in the many languages used by Windows customers.
When Microsoft collects inking and typing diagnostic data, it is divided into small samples and processed to remove unique identifiers, sequencing information, and other data (such as email addresses and numeric values) which could be used to reconstruct the original content or associate the input to you.
It also includes associated performance data, such as changes you manually make to text, as well as words you've added to the dictionary.
Learn more about improving inking and typing in Windows 10.</p>
<p>If you choose to turn on <strong>Tailored experiences</strong>, we will use your Windows diagnostic data (Basic or Full as you have selected) to offer you personalized tips, ads, and recommendations to enhance Microsoft experiences.
If you have selected Basic as your diagnostic data setting, personalization is based on information about your device, its settings and capabilities, and whether it is performing properly.
If you have selected Full, personalization is also based on information about how you use apps and features, plus additional information about the health of your device.
However, we do not use information about the websites you browse, the content of crash dumps, speech, typing, or inking input data for personalization when we receive such data from customers who have selected Full.</p>
<p>Tailored experiences include suggestions on how to customize and optimize Windows, as well as ads and recommendations for Microsoft and third-party products and services, features, apps, and hardware for your Windows experiences.

<strong>Windows location service</strong>.
Microsoft operates a location service that helps determine the precise geographic location of a specific Windows device.
Depending on the capabilities of the device, the device’s location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy and may in some cases be determined precisely.
When you have enabled location on a Windows device, or you have given permission for Microsoft apps to access location information on non-Windows devices, data about cell towers and Wi-Fi access points and their locations is collected by Microsoft and added to the location database after removing any data identifying the person or device from which it was collected.
This de-identified copy of location information is used to improve Microsoft's location services and, in some instances, shared with our location service provider partners, currently HERE (see https://www.here.com/), to improve the location services of the provider.</p>
<p>Windows services and features (such as browsers and Cortana), apps running on Windows, and websites opened in Windows browsers can access the device’s location through Windows if your settings allow them to do so.
Some features and apps request location permission when you first install Windows, some ask the first time you use the app, and others ask every time you access the device’s location.
For information about certain Windows apps that use the device’s location, see the Windows apps section of this privacy statement.</p>
<p>When an app or feature accesses the device’s location and you are signed in with a Microsoft account, your Windows device will also upload its location to the cloud where it is available across your devices to other apps or services that use your Microsoft account and for which you’ve granted permission.
We will retain only the last known location (each new location replaces the previous one).
Data about a Windows device's recent location history is also stored on the device even if not using a Microsoft account, and certain apps and Windows features can access this location history.
You can clear your device's location history at any time in the device's Settings menu.
</p>
<p>In Settings, you can also view which apps have access to the device’s precise location or your device's location history, turn off or on access to the device’s location for particular apps, or turn off access to the device’s location.
You can also set a default location, which will be used when the location service can’t detect a more exact location for your device.</p>
<p>Even when you’ve turned off access to the device’s location, some third-party desktop apps and services could use other technologies (such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, cellular modem, etc.) to determine the device’s precise location.
Learn more about third-party desktop apps and how they may still be able to determine your device’s location when the device’s location setting is off.</p>
<p>In addition, to facilitate getting help in an emergency, whenever you make an emergency call, Windows will attempt to determine and share your precise location, regardless of your location settings.
If your device has a SIM card or is otherwise using cellular service, your mobile operator will have access to your device’s location.
Learn more about location in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
<strong>General Location</strong>.
If you turn on the General Location feature, apps that cannot use your precise location will have access to your general location, such as your city, postal code, or region.</p>
<p>
<strong>Find My Phone</strong>.
The Find My Phone feature allows you to find the location of your Windows phone from the Microsoft account website, even if you have turned off all access to the location service on the phone.
If you have turned on the "save my location every few hours" feature in the Find My Phone settings on your phone, the Find My Phone feature will periodically send and store a single last-known location of your phone, even if you have turned off location services on your phone.
Each time a new location is sent, it replaces the previously-stored location.</p>
<p>
<strong>Find my device</strong>.
The Find my device feature allows an administrator of a Windows portable device to find the location of that device from account.microsoft.com/devices.
To enable Find my device, an administrator needs to be signed in with a Microsoft account and have the location setting enabled.
This feature will work even if other users have denied access to location for all their apps.
When the administrator attempts to locate the device, users will see a notification in the notification area.
Learn more about Find my device in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
<strong>Windows motion sensing</strong>.
Windows devices with motion activity detection can collect motion activity.
This data can enable features such as a pedometer to count the number of steps you take, so a fitness application can estimate how many calories you burn.
This data and history is stored on your device and can be accessed by applications you give permission to access and use that data.</p>
<p>
<strong>Recording</strong>.
Some Windows devices have a recording feature that allows you to capture audio and video clips of your activity on the device, including your communications with others.

<strong>Device encryption</strong>.
Device encryption helps protect the data stored on your device by encrypting it using BitLocker Drive Encryption technology.
When device encryption is on, Windows automatically encrypts the drive Windows is installed on and generates a recovery key.
The BitLocker recovery key for your personal device is automatically backed up online in your personal Microsoft OneDrive account.
Microsoft doesn't use your individual recovery keys for any purpose.</p>
<p>
<strong>Malicious Software Removal Tool</strong>.
The Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT) runs on your device at least once per month as part of Windows Update.
MSRT checks devices for infections by specific, prevalent malicious software ("malware") and helps remove any infections found.
When the MSRT runs, it will remove the malware listed on the Microsoft Support website if the malware is on your device.
During a malware check, a report will be sent to Microsoft with specific data about malware detected, errors, and other data about your device.
If you do not want MSRT to send this data to Microsoft, you can disable MSRT's reporting component.</p>

<strong>Speech</strong>.
Microsoft provides both a device-based speech recognition feature and cloud-based (online) speech recognition technologies.
</p>
<p> Turning on the online speech recognition setting lets you use Microsoft’s cloud-based speech recognition technologies in Cortana, the Mixed Reality Portal, dictation in Windows, supported Microsoft Store apps, and over time in other parts of Windows.
</p>
<p> Turning on speech while setting up a HoloLens device or installing Windows Mixed Reality allows you to use your voice for commands, dictation, and app interactions.
Both device-based speech recognition and online speech recognition settings will be enabled.
With both settings enabled, while your headset is turned on the device will always be listening to your voice input and will send your voice data to Microsoft’s cloud-based speech recognition technologies.
</p>
<p> When you use Microsoft’s cloud-based speech recognition technologies, Microsoft collects and uses your voice recordings to create a text transcription of the spoken words in the voice data.
To learn more about how Microsoft manages your voice data, see Speech recognition technologies.
</p>
<p> You can use device-based speech recognition without sending your voice data to Microsoft.
However, Microsoft’s cloud-based speech recognition technologies provide more accurate recognition than the device-based speech recognition.
When the online speech recognition setting is turned off, speech services that don’t rely on the cloud and only use device-based recognition—like the Narrator app or the Windows Speech Recognition app—will still work.
</p>
<p> If you’ve given permission in Cortana, we also collect additional information, like your name and nickname, your recent calendar events, and the names of the people in your appointments, information about your contacts including names and nicknames, names of your favorite places, apps you use, and information about your music preferences.
This additional data enables us to better recognize people, events, places, and music when you dictate commands, messages, or documents.
</p>
<p> You can turn off online speech recognition at any time.
This will stop your voice data from being sent to Microsoft.
If you are using a HoloLens or mixed reality headset, you can also turn off device-based speech recognition at any time.
This will stop the device from listening for your voice input.
Learn more about speech recognition in Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Voice Activation</strong>.
Windows provides supported apps with the ability to respond and take action based on voice keywords that are specific to that app—for example allowing Cortana to listen and respond to “Hey Cortana.”
</p>
<p>If you’ve given permission for an app to listen for voice keywords, Windows 10 will be actively listening to the microphone for these keywords.
Once a keyword is recognized, the app will have access to your voice recording, can process the recording, take action, and respond, such as with a spoken answer.
The app may send the voice recording to its own services in the cloud to process the commands.
Each app should ask you for permission before accessing voice recordings.</p>
<p>Additionally, voice activation can be enabled when the device is locked.
If enabled, the relevant app will continue listening to the microphone for voice keywords when you have locked your device and can activate for anyone who speaks near the device.
When the device is locked, the app will have access to the same set of capabilities and information as when the device is unlocked.</p>
<p> You can turn off voice activation at any time.
Learn more about voice activation in Windows 10.
</p>
<p> Even when you’ve turned off voice activation, some third-party desktop apps and services could still be listening to the microphone and collect your voice input.
Learn more about third-party desktop apps and how they may still be able to access your microphone even with these settings turned off.
