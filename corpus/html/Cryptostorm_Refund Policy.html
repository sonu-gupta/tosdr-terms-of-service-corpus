</ul> Our refund policy is pretty simple.<br>
<br>
If you're unsatisifed with our service and have used 50% or less of your token's duration, and your order was placed less than 180 days ago, then we'll refund your order.<br>
For example, if you bought a one week token three months ago, but you've only first connected with the token 2 days ago (and are unsatisified with the service), we'll refund the order.<br>
<br>
Send an email to support@cryptostorm.is to begin the refunding process.<br>
Be sure to include the payment processor used (PayPal, CCBill, or BitPay), the email address associated with the order, and the invoice/transaction ID.<br>
<br>
For obvious reasons, the number of refunds will be limited per customer.<br>
Also, due to high processing fees, lifetime tokens cannot be refunded.<br>
<br>
Orders processed by CoinPayments.net will also not be refundable, since they don't offer merchants a way to do that.<br>
(see https://www.coinpayments.net/supwiz, under "What We Can't Help You With" - "4.
Refunds for completed transactions - all transactions are final and cannot be refunded.")
