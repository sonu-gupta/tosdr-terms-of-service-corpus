<strong>Summary</strong>
</p>
<p>The Zooniverse is a suite of citizen science projects operated by research groups in several institutions which support scientific research by involving members of the public - you - in the processes of analyzing and discussing data.
Data from these projects is used to study online community design and theory, interface design, and other topics.
This document describes what will happen to your contributions if you choose to contribute and what data we collect, how we use it and how we protect it.</p>
<p>
<strong>What you agree to if you contribute to the Zooniverse</strong>
</p>
<p>Projects involving the public are needed to enable researchers to cope with the otherwise unmanageable flood of data.
The web provides a means of reaching a large audience willing to devote their free time to projects that can add to our knowledge of the world and the Universe.</p>
<p>The major goal for this project is for the analyzed data to be available to the researchers for use, modification and redistribution in order to further scientific research.
Therefore, if you contribute to the Zooniverse, you grant us and our collaborators permission to use your contributions however we like to further this goal, trusting us to do the right thing with your data.
However, you give us this permission non-exclusively, meaning that you yourself still own your contribution.</p>
<p>We ask you to grant us these broad permissions, because they allow us to change the legal details by which we keep the data available.
this is important because the legal environment can change and we need to be able to respond without obtaining permission from every single contributor.</p>
<p>Finally, you must not contribute data to the Zooniverse that you do not own.
For example, do not copy information from published journal articles.
If people do this, it can cause major legal headaches for us.</p>
<p>
<strong>What you may do with Zooniverse data</strong>
</p>
<p>You retain ownership of any contribution you make to the Zooniverse, and any recorded interaction with the dataset associated with the Zooniverse.
You may use, distribute or modify your individual contribution in any way you like.
However, you do not possess ownership of the dataset itself.
This license does not apply to data about you, covered in the Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>

Privacy Policy
<p>In addition to the contributions you make towards the scientific goals of the Zooniverse, we collect additional data about you to support and improve the operation of the project.
We also conduct experiments on the design of the website that we evaluate based on your reactions and behavior.
This Privacy Policy describes what data we collect, how we use it and how we protect it.</p>
<p>We respect the privacy of every individual who participates in the Zooniverse.
We operate in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation and the Freedom of Information Act 2000, as well as with United Kingdom and United States regulations regarding protection of human subjects in research.</p>

<strong>Data we collect</strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>Identifying information</em>: If you register with the Zooniverse, we ask you to create a username and supply your e-mail address.
Your e-mail address is not visible to other users, but others will see your username in various contexts.
Notably, your username is associated with any classifications or other contributions you make, including on comments submitted to Talk, the discussion forums hosted by the Zooniverse.
You may optionally provide your real name to be included when we publically thank participants, e.g., in presentations, publications or discoveries.</p>
<p>
<em>Usage information</em>: We also monitor how people use our website, and aggregate general statistics about users and traffic patterns as well as data about how users respond to various site features.
This includes, among other things, recording:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When you log in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pages you request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Classifications you make.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other contributions, such as posts on Talk pages.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you register and log in, the logs associate these activities with your username.
Otherwise, they are solely associated with your IP address.
In order to collect this data, we may use software such as Google Analytics that collects statistics from IP data.
This software can determine what times of day people access our site, which country they access the websites from, how long they visit for, along with technical details of their computer (browser, screen type, processor).</p>
<p>
<strong>What we do with the information we gather</strong>
</p>
<p>Usage information is collected to help us improve our website, and for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Internal record keeping.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you agree, we will periodically send email promoting new research-related projects or other information relating to our research.
Information about these contacts is given below.
We will not use your contact information for commercial purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will use the information to customize the website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To conduct experiments regarding the use of site features.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>What is shared with third parties</strong>
</p>
<p>We will never release e-mail addresses to third parties without your express permission.
We will also never share data we collect about your use of the site unless (a) it cannot be associated with you or your username, and (b) it is necessary to accomplish our research goals.
Specifically, we can share your anonymized data with research study participants, other researchers, or in scholarly work describing our research.
For example, we might use one of your classifications as an illustration in a paper, show some of your classifications to another user to see if they agree or disagree, or publish statistics about user interaction.</p>
<p>If you choose to give us a `Publishable Name' on registration, this is available to research teams in projects you have participated in for purposes of giving credit for your work in published papers and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Contributions you make to the Talk pages are widely available to others.
Aside from the above, information is held within our secured database.
Passwords are hashed rather than being stored in plain text.</p>
