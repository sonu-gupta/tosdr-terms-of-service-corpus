<strong>8.
Product-specific data processing details</strong>
</p>
<p>The following are product-specific details to supplement the information in this Privacy Notice.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Play! Pokémon</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>If you participate in the Play! Pokémon tournament ratings
and rankings portion of our websites, we will use personal information about
you to track your tournament results, player ranking, rating, and player status
(e.g., active, terminated, winner, etc.).
Except for those jurisdictions where
privacy law specifies a different age, (a) if you are 13 or older, we will post
your full name or first name and last initial (as you direct us), as well as
your state and country/region with your player ranking.
and (b) if you are
under 13, your parent or guardian can choose to post your screen name, full
name, or first name and last initial in the player rankings.
If you choose not
to create a Pokémon Trainer Club account after participating in Play! Pokémon
events, we will retain your first name, first initial of last name, date of
birth, and any championship points earned for participating in any event where
this information alone cannot identify you and is not considered personal
information.</p>
<p>Also, if you participate in the Play! Pokémon tournament
ratings and rankings portion of our websites, we will share your personal
information with independent third parties (such as League Leaders and
Tournament Organizers) who run Play! Pokémon events that you may participate
in.
In most cases, these are independent third parties and not Pokémon
employees.</p>
<p>If you've signed up to play our products or participate in
competitions and provide us with non-Pokémon account information (e.g., a
Nintendo Account) where that function is available, we will receive your date
of birth and account ID from the other account operator.
If participating in
competitions to be awarded Play! Pokémon championship points, the date of birth
from your non-Pokémon account will be verified against your Pokémon Trainer
Club (“PTC”) Account, and information about whether there was a match or not, and
your PTC ID will be shared with the other account operator.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Pokémon Apps</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Pokémon will keep your personal information within a Pokémon
app for as long as you keep the app on your device.
If you create an account,
the app sends your personal information to our servers.
We keep your data for
as long as you maintain an account and for 90 days after you disable the
account, in case you choose to reactivate the account or in case the request to
disable the account was in error.
Certain apps may give you the option to
receive push notifications.
You can turn push notifications on or off through
settings within the app or your device.
You may disable our access to your
precise geolocation data through settings in your device.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>PokemonCenter.com</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>If you provide information to create an account or as part
of a transaction, payment, or other account action, Pokémon may deliver marketing
communications to you about similar goods or services if you have not opted out
of such marketing when given the chance to do so.
We may also use third
parties, such as Authorize.net and PayPal, to process payment transactions and
facilitate fraud protection.
PayPal and other third-party entities may use your
information for their own purposes, including to service accounts you have with
them and for fraud prevention.
Please review their respective privacy notices
to understand how they use your information.
PokemonCenter.com's services are
intended for customers in the United States and Canada.

</li>
<li>
<p>A right to bring your complaint to a regulator.
If you are based in the European Economic Area (EEA) and believe that we have not complied with data protection laws, you can complain to our regulator, the UK Information Commissioner's Office, or your local supervisory authority.

<p>A right to object to the processing of your personal data or obtain a restriction of such processing under certain circumstances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A right to have your personal data transferred to another organization should it be technically feasible for Pokémon to do so.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>There may be exceptions to these rights in certain circumstances, and where you cannot exercise a right due to an exception, we will provide that explanation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To make such requests, contact us at privacyquestions@pokemon.com or https://support.pokemon.com/hc/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000012406.</p>
<p>If you submit a
request, we will require you to verify your identity either by making the
request through your existing account and/or by providing a form of
governmental identification through our customer service portal, where, if
feasible, we may match your identification information with personal
information we have about you, depending on the type of request made and
verification measures proportional to the risk of the personal information
involved with the request(s).
There is no reasonable method by which we can
verify your identity to the degree of certainty required by law for certain
pieces of personal information, for example: unique identifiers such as cookie
IDs, device ID, and IP address (where that information is not held by us in
connection with directly identifiable information).
There may be exceptions to
these rights in certain circumstances, and where you cannot exercise a right
due to an exception, Pokémon will provide that information.

reasonable efforts to fulfil your request within the response times of the
applicable laws.</p>
<p>We transfer personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom
(UK), and Switzerland to other countries or regions, some of which have not
been determined by the European Commission to have an adequate level of data
protection.
This may include a requirement for Pokémon to release personal information
in response to a legal obligation or legal process.
Such obligations may
include lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national
security and law enforcement requirements.
When we disclose your personal data
to comply with a legal obligation or legal process, we will take reasonable steps
to ensure that we disclose only the minimum personal data necessary for the
specific purpose and circumstances to comply with legal obligations or valid
legal processes such as search warrants, subpoenas, or court orders.
When we
do, transfer your personal data we use a variety of legal mechanisms, including
contracts and standard contractual clauses / model clauses, so that your rights
and protections travel with your data.
</p>
<p>We also participate in the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework
and Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework.
Although the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield
has been ruled invalid as a legal basis for data transfers to the U.S., we
continue to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to all
personal information transferred from the European Union, the United Kingdom,
and/or Switzerland to the United States in reliance on the Privacy Shield.
If
there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Notice and the Privacy
Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.
</p>
<p>We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers
of the U.S.
Federal Trade Commission.
If third-party agents process personal
data on our behalf in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles,
we remain liable unless we prove we are not responsible for the event giving
rise to any damages.
European Union,
United Kingdom, or Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our
adherence to Privacy Shield Principles should first contact us at privacyquestions@pokemon.com, or
by certified mail (return receipt requested) at The Pokémon Company
International, Inc., Attention Privacy Notice Administrator, 10400 NE 4th
Street, Suite 2800, Bellevue, WA 98004 USA.
Pursuant with the Privacy Shield
Principles, EU, UK and Swiss individuals have the right to access their
personal data that is transferred into the United States.
Individuals can update or correct inaccurate
information or request erasure of data that has been processed in violation of
the Frameworks.
Individuals wishing to exercise this right may do so by
contacting Pokémon using the details in this section.
</p>
<p>For any complaints that cannot be resolved with us directly,
you may refer the matter to the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, operated by BBB National
Programs, Inc.

address your complaint,
visit http://www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers for more
information and to file a complaint with the BBB EU Privacy Shield.
This
service is provided free of charge to you.
If your complaint remains unresolved
after contacting Pokémon, and the BBB EU Privacy Shield, you also have a right
to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
</p>
<p>If your Privacy Shield complaint cannot be resolved through
the above channels, under certain conditions, a binding arbitration option may
be available to you.</p>
<p>If you are an employee of Pokémon and your personal human
resource related data is transferred from the EEA, United Kingdom and/or
Switzerland to the United States, and you have a complaint regarding the transfer of your personal
human resource data that is within the context of your employment relationship to
other countries or regions, some of which have not been determined by the
European Commission to have an adequate level of data protection, please refer
to your Employee Privacy Notice for further instructions on filing a complaint.</p>

<strong>12.
California Privacy Rights</strong>
</p>
<p>This section provides you with additional disclosures
required under California law.</p>
<p>If you are a California consumer whose personal information
is collected through the Services (“customer”), the California Consumer Privacy
Act (“CCPA”) provides you with certain rights including those described in
Section 9 together with the rights and disclosures set forth below.
You have a
right not to be discriminated against for exercising any of these rights.</p>
<p>Pokémon does not sell your personal information as defined
by the CCPA and has not done so in the past 12 months.</p>
<p>If you have authorized an agent to submit a request to know
or a request to delete, Pokémon may require that you (i) provide written
permission for a named agent to do so.
(ii) verify your identity directly with
Pokémon.
or (iii) provide the authorized agent with a valid power of attorney.
Pokémon may deny a request made on your behalf if the agent does not submit
proof authorizing such request.</p>
<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits customers who
are California residents to request certain information regarding disclosure of
personal information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.
We do not share our customers' personal information with unaffiliated third
parties for their own direct marketing purposes without your consent.
For
inquiries about our disclosure policy, please contact us at the email address
or postal address listed above.</p>
<p>If you are a California resident under the age of 18, and a
registered user of any Service where this privacy notice is posted, you may
request and obtain removal of content or information you have publicly posted.
To make such a request, please send an email with a detailed description of the
specific content or information to privacyquestions@pokemon.com.

removal of the content or information you have posted, and that there may be
circumstances in which the law does not require or allow removal even if
requested.</p>

What types of information do we collect about kids?</strong>
</p>
<p>Our guests can use some of our Services, view content, and
enjoy many features without registering for an account or our collection of any
personal information subject to COPPA.</p>
<p>If a user has indicated that they are a kid when trying to
create a Pokémon account, we will collect a parent's email address and obtain
verifiable parental consent before allowing the kid to provide any additional
personal information.
See below to learn how we seek parental consent.</p>
<p>Once we obtain parental consent, a kid can use our services
much like any other user.
And we may collect from the kid the same types of
personal information, and use and share that information for the same purposes,
as described in the general Privacy Notice with the exception that Pokémon does
not, nor does it allow third parties to, collect kids' personal data (including
persistent identifiers) for behavioral advertising, amassing a profile, or any purpose
other than to support its internal operations unless we have obtained explicit
prior parental consent.</p>
<p>We receive information from our guests directly and from
third parties such as Play! Pokémon Tournament Organizers.
We collect personal
information from parents on behalf of their kids to create an account for
Pokémon's Services.</p>
<p>Pokémon does not condition participation in any of its
Services for kids on the collection of more personal information than is
reasonably necessary.</p>
<p>
<strong>2.
How do we use and share the personal information that we collect from kids?</strong>
</p>
<p>As noted above, once we obtain parental consent, a kid can
use our Services much like any other user.
And we may collect from the kid the
same types of personal information, and use and share that information for the
same purposes, as described in the general Privacy Notice, unless otherwise
specified in this Supplemental Kids' Privacy Notice.
For example, once a parent
has provided consent to create an account, a kid can:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Link an account from one of Pokémon's Services with an account from another Service operated by Pokémon or an affiliate of Pokémon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Participate in games, reward programs, contests, sweepstakes, events, or promotions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Send us questions or correspond with us via email or our customer support portal concerning the Services or the kid's participation in organized events</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Participate in polls, surveys, or questionnaires</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use our Email-a-Friend feature and participate in “canned chat,” where a kid can select words from a list prepared by Pokémon to send messages to other website users</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable push notifications (you can turn push notification on or off by modifying the settings within the applicable Service, or within your device's settings)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that some Services may enable a
kid to publicly disclose personal information and/or communicate with other users.
We do not have control over third parties (e.g., other users) who may have
copied or reposted publicly posted information.</p>
<p>Until we receive verifiable parental consent, the parent's
contact information gathered from a kid is used only to obtain the parent's
consent for our information collection practices.</p>
<p>With parental consent, we may also use a kid's contact
information to send the kid emails and messages with promotional information
about new products and features, special offers, contests, and sweepstakes, as
well as other interesting information concerning new products, events, and
updates about Pokémon.
Parents can always choose whether their kid may receive
these promotional messages by visiting their account profile settings or
contacting us.</p>
<p>If a kid wins a prize from a sweepstakes, contest, or other
promotional event, we will notify the parent at the parent's email address and
request that the parent provide their postal address for the purpose of
delivering the prize.
With the appropriate consent, we may publish a winner's
first name, city, state of residence, and country/region.</p>
<p>Pokémon shares kids' personal information with the same
entities and for the same purposes described in the general Privacy Notice.</p>
<p>Also, if a parent chooses to allow a kid to participate in
the Play! Pokémon tournament ratings and rankings portion of our websites, we
will use personal information about the kid to track the kid's tournament
results, player ranking, rating, player status (e.g., active, terminated,
winner, etc.).
A parent can choose to post a kid's screen name, full name, or
first name and last initial in the player rankings.
We will also share the
kid's personal information with independent third parties (such as League
Leaders and Tournament Organizers) so they can run offline Play! Pokémon events
that the kid may participate in.
If a parent doesn't want their kid's personal
information shared with independent third parties who run Play! Pokémon events,
then they should not allow their kid to participate in the Play! Pokémon
tournament ratings and rankings portion of our websites.</p>
<p>
<strong>3.
How do we notify and obtain consent from parents for the collection of personal information from their kids?</strong>
</p>
<p>When a kid seeks to register with our Services, we will
email their parent.
This email notifies the parent that their kid wishes to
register, and it asks the parent to create an account to grant consent for
their kid to register.
If the parent ignores or refuses to register their kid,
we will delete the kid and parent's contact information within 14 days of such
notice.
If the parent permits the registration, we will grant the kid access to
the features described in the email and this Privacy Notice.</p>
<p>To help verify that the parent is the person providing
consent, Pokémon (in the US in conjunction with Veratad, a leading age and
identity verification company) asks for the sum of the first and last digit of
the parent's Social Security number, as well as other pieces of information to
verify the parent's identity, such as name, birth date, and physical address.
Note that Pokémon does NOT store this information anywhere in our records.</p>
<p>Parents can revoke consent at any time by contacting our
customer service department and submitting a request on the https://support.pokemon.com/hc/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000012406 website or emailing privacyquestions@pokemon.com.</p>
<p>
<strong>4.
How can parents access, change, or delete personal information about their kids?</strong>
</p>
<p>At any time, a parent can log into their Pokémon Trainer
Club account to access their “Edit Profile” section or contact our customer
service department to access or change the personal information in their kid's
account.</p>
<p>A parent may delete the personal information that we have
collected from their kid by submitting a request on the https://support.pokemon.com/hc/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000012406
website or emailing privacyquestions@pokemon.com.
The parent should include their kid's username and the parent's email address
in the email so that we can better assist with the inquiry or request.
</p>
<p>
<strong>5.
How will we notify parents if our Kids' Privacy Notice changes?</strong>
</p>
<p>We may amend our Kids' Privacy Notice at any time.
when we
do so, we will change the last updated date.
We will notify parents of any
material changes in the way we intend to process kids' personal information.
We
will apply material changes to our Kids' Privacy Notice only when the changes
are in compliance with applicable law, including any parental consent
requirements.</p>
