<p>Last modified date: January 14, 2016</p>
1.
Acceptance of the Terms of Service
<p>The following terms and conditions, together with any documents they expressly incorporate by reference (collectively, these “Terms of Service”), govern your access to and use of https://www.youporn.com/ (“YouPorn” or the “Website”), including any content, functionality and services offered on or through the Website, whether as a guest or a registered user.
These Terms of Service apply to the Website, web pages, interactive features, applications, widgets, blogs, social networks, social network “tabs”, or other online or wireless offerings that post a link to these Terms of Service, whether accessed via computer, mobile device or other technology, manner or means</p>
<p>Please read the Terms of Service carefully before you start to use the Website.
By using the Website or by clicking to accept or agree to the Terms of Service when this option is made available to you, you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy, found at https://www.youporn.com/information/#privacy, incorporated herein by reference.
If you do not want to agree to these Terms of Service or the Privacy Policy, you must not access or use the Website.</p>
<p>If you access or use the Website, whether you click to accept or not, you agree to all of the various terms in these Terms of Service.
If you do not understand all of these Terms of Service, you should consult an attorney before agreeing to any of the Terms of Service.</p>
<p>You consent to entering these Terms of Service electronically, and to storage of records related to these Terms of Service in electronic form.</p>

Ability to Accept Terms of Service
<p>You affirm that you are at least 18 years of age or the age of majority in the jurisdiction you are accessing the Website from, and are fully able and competent to enter into the terms, conditions, obligations, affirmations, representations, and warranties set forth in these Terms of Service, and to abide by and comply with these Terms of Service.
If you are under 18 or the applicable age of majority, you are not permitted to submit personal information to us or use the Website.
You also represent that the jurisdiction from which you access the Website does not prohibit the receiving or viewing of sexually explicit content.</p>
<p>All changes are effective immediately when we post them, and apply to all access to and use of the Website thereafter.
The updated version supersedes any prior versions immediately upon being posted, and the prior version(s) shall have no continuing legal effect.
If you do not review new terms as posted, then you agree that you have waived your right to do so, and you are therefore bound by the updated conditions, even if you failed to review the new ones.
You are on notice of changes, and your failure to review the amended terms is your own omission.

Changes to the Terms of Service
<p>We may modify or revise these Terms of Service from time to time in our sole discretion and you agree to be bound by such modifications or revisions.
Although we may attempt to notify you when major changes are made to these Terms of Service, you are expected to periodically review the most up-to-date version found at https://www.youporn.com/information/#terms, so you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you.</p>
<p>If we change anything in these Terms of Service, the change will be reflected in the “last modified date”.
You agree that you will periodically review these terms and refresh the page when doing so.
You agree to note the date of the last revision of these terms.
If the “last modified” date is unchanged from the last time you reviewed these terms, then they are unchanged.
On the other hand, if the date has changed, then there have been changes, and you agree to re-review the terms, and you agree to the new ones.</p>

Reporting Claims of Copyright Infringement
<p>
We take claims of copyright infringement seriously.
We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the <strong>“DMCA”</strong> ) or any other applicable intellectual property legislation or laws.
Responses may include removing, blocking or disabling access to material claimed to be the subject of infringing activity, terminating the user’s access to https://www.youporn.com/ (“<strong>YouPorn</strong>”), or all of the foregoing.
</p>
<p>
If you believe any material accessible on YouPorn infringes your copyright, you may submit a copyright infringement notification (see below, “Filing a DMCA Notice of Copyright Infringement” for instructions on filing such a notice).
These requests should only be submitted by the copyright owner or an agent authorized to act on the owner’s behalf.
</p>
<p>
If we remove or disable access to material in response to such a notice, we will take reasonable steps to notify the user that uploaded the affected content material that we have removed or disabled access to so that the user has the opportunity to submit a counter notification (see below, “Counter-Notification Procedures” for instructions on filing a counter notification).
It is our policy to document all notices of alleged infringement on which we act.
</p>
<p>
All copyright infringement notifications and counter-notifications must be written in English.
Any attempted notifications written in foreign languages or using foreign characters may, at our discretion, be deemed non-compliant and disregarded.
</p>
Filing a DMCA Notice of Copyright Infringement

Please include the URL(s)&nbsp;of the exact video(s).</li>

If you have received a DMCA Notice and believe that material you posted on YouPorn was removed or access to it was disabled by mistake or misidentification, you may file a counter-notification with us (a <strong>“Counter-Notice”</strong>).
Counter notifications must be submitted by the video’s original uploader or an agent authorized to act on their behalf.</p>
<p>Counter-notices must be sent to our designated agent:</p>
<p>
Lawrence G.
Walters<br>
<strong>Walters Law Group</strong>
<br>
195 W.
Pine Ave.<br>
Longwood, FL 32750<br>
Email: copyright@youporn.com<br>
</p>
<p>Please do not send other inquiries or requests to our designated copyright agent.
Absent prior express permission, our designated copyright agent is not authorized to accept or waive service of formal legal process, and any agency relationship beyond that required to receive valid DMCA Notices or Counter-Notices is expressly disclaimed.</p>
<p>
Pursuant to the DMCA, the Counter-Notice must include substantially the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Your name, address, phone number and physical or electronic signature;</li>
<li>Identification of the allegedly infringing content and its location before removal or access to it was disabled;</li>
<li>A statement under penalty of perjury that you believe in good faith that the content was removed by mistake or misidentification.
and </li>
<li>A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the U.S.
Federal District Court for the judicial district in which you are located (or if you are outside the U.S., for any judicial district in which the operator of YouPorn may be found), and that you will accept service of process from the person who originally provided us with the DMCA Notice or an agent of such person.</li>
</ul>
<p>
We will not respond to Counter-Notices that do not meet the requirements set out above.
</p>
<p>
After we receive your Counter Notice, we will forward it to the party who submitted the original DMCA Notice and inform that party that the removed material may be restored after 10 business days but no later than 14 business days from the date we received your Counter Notice, unless our Designated Agent first receives notice from the party who filed the original DMCA Notice informing us that such party has filed a court action to restrain you from engaging in infringing activity related to the material in question.
</p>
<p>
Please note that when we forward your Counter Notice, it will include your personal information.
By submitting a counter notification, you consent to having your information revealed in this way.
We will not forward the counter notification to any party other than the original claimant or to law enforcement or parties that assist us with enforcing and protecting our rights.
</p>
<p>
Please be aware that if you knowingly materially misrepresent that material or activity on YouPorn was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, you may be held liable for damages (including costs and attorneys’ fees)&nbsp;under Section 512(f)&nbsp;of the DMCA.
