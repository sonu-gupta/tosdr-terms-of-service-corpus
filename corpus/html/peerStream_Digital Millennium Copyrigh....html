&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>Digital Millennium Copyright Act AnnouncementNotification of Infringement<p>It is our policy to respond to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
In addition, we will promptly terminate without notice the accounts of those determined by us to be "repeat infringers".
If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof, and you believe that any content hosted on our web site (www.Peer-Stream.com) infringes your copyrights, then you may submit a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") by providing Peer-Stream's Designated Copyright Agent with the following information in writing (please consult your legal counsel or see 17 U.S.C.
Section 512(c)(3) to confirm these requirements):</p>
<ol>
<li>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works on the Peer-Stream web site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit Peer-Stream to locate the material.
Providing a broadcaster’s feed and the time on such feed at which you believe there has been an infringement is the best way to help us locate content quickly.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Information reasonably sufficient to permit Peer-Stream to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which you may be contacted.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please note that under Section 512(f) of the DMCA, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be subject to liability.</p>
<p>Please note that Peer-Stream may, at our discretion, send a copy of such notices to a third-party for publication.
As such, your letter (with personal information removed) may be forwarded to Chilling Effects (http://www.chillingeffects.org) for publication.</p>Counter-Notification<p>If you elect to send us a counter notice, to be effective it must be a written communication that includes the following (please consult your legal counsel or see 17 U.S.C.

<ol>
<li>Your physical or electronic signature.</li>
<li>Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>The subscriber’s name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in which Peer-Stream may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification under subsection (c)(1)(C) or an agent of such person.</li>
