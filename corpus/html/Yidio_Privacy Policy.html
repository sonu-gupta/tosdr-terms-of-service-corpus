<b>Collection of your Yidio Information</b>

Your "Yidio information" includes certain technical information gathered
or received when you use Yidio.
Some of the technical information that may
be collected or received includes: the type of browser you are using
(e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are

are a limited number of optional services (for example, saving a video
list) that require an "account".

provided by the Yidio Network.

will need to register with and provide information to Yidio.
You will then
obtain a Screen Name or other credential issued by Yidio (collectively,
"Screen Name") in order to access and use these optional services, and
your Screen Name and associated services account will be subject to the
Yidio Terms of Service Agreement and Privacy Practices indicated in your
registration process.<br>

publicly available), other online users may obtain access to any
information you provide.

your Yidio information, they are required to protect this information in a
manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy by, for example, not
using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services
they are performing for Yidio.<br>
