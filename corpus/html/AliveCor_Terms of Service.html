<strong>Clinician Review Service.</strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
<strong>General.</strong> AliveCor arranges for a third party medical professional ECG analysis group to provide professional ECG analysis services (“<strong>Clinician Review Service</strong>”) to you through the AliveCor Service for an additional fee.
You have two options to have your ECG reviewed: (i) a board-certified cardiologist interpretation of your ECG (“<strong>Cardiologist Interpretation</strong>”).
and (ii) a certified cardiographic technician review of your ECG (“<strong>Technician Review</strong>”).
With your request and consent AliveCor sends the Clinician Review Service your data necessary to perform the requested service: the Cardiologist Interpretation or the Technician Review.
The Clinician Review Service performs the requested service and electronically transmits the Cardiologist Interpretation or the Technician Review back to AliveCor’s systems, and we make the report available to you within the AliveCor Service.
By accepting these Terms, you hereby agree to enrollment in the Clinician Review Service, although your use of the Clinician Review Service is optional.
You will only be charged for the Clinician Review Service when and if you use the service.
AliveCor reserves the right to change the Clinician Review Service providers or discontinue one or more of the Clinician Review Service offerings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Reports.</strong> You may use the AliveCor Service to generate reports of algorithmic outputs from AliveCor’s FDA-cleared algorithms using your data.
Any reports from AliveCor’s FDA-cleared algorithms or from the Clinician Review Service serve the same purpose: to provide you more information with which to consult your healthcare professional, not as a substitute to consulting your healthcare professional and do not suggest a diagnosis.
These reports are intended as information for you and to be used as a tool by your physician to provide proper diagnosis and treatment, taking into account your complete medical history.
Diagnosis based on your data can only be accomplished by your physician.
It is your responsibility to present your medical data to your physician for proper analysis and diagnosis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>ECG Recordings.</strong> You have the option to obtain an ECG recording from your device at any time.
Your ECG recordings are subject to multiple factors related to your health and activities.
AliveCor and the Clinician Review Service providers make no guarantees of the accuracy or clinical significance of the interpretation of your data.
Please be aware that your physician may disagree with the interpretation of your data.
If you decide to use the Clinician Review Service, we will share your information with the Clinician Review Service when you give permission through the AliveCor Service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Restrictions.</strong> Due to telemedicine restrictions, your local jurisdiction may restrict your ability to use the Clinician Review Service.
Since you are using a mobile device to collect your data, it is your responsibility to ensure the Clinician Review Service is legal according to your local telemedicine laws.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Personalized Surveillance Service.</strong> Under some circumstances, AliveCor may present you with notifications or suggested actions based on AliveCor’s analysis of your historical data and other information you have provided to AliveCor such as ‘medications’, ‘symptoms’ or ‘activities’.
For example, AliveCor may suggest that you periodically submit your data to the Clinical Interpretation Service for continued surveillance of your heart health.
Those notifications or suggested actions, or lack thereof, are not an indication of your health, nor are those notifications or suggested actions intended to replace the opinion of your physician.
It is your responsibility to present your data to your physician, and to discuss with your physician what the proper course of action is based on your medical history.
AliveCor may also allow you to schedule reminder notices using the AliveCor Service, such as reminders to take medication.
AliveCor makes no representations about accuracy, reliability, completeness, or timeliness of any push notifications, as parts of the process are outside of AliveCor’s control.
You accept that any reliance on these reminders will be at your own risk, and AliveCor disclaims all liability arising from your use of them.
You agree that AliveCor may send push notifications to your mobile device for AliveCor Service-related or marketing purposes, if they are enabled and in accordance with the Privacy Policy.
You may turn off push notifications through your device settings.</p>

<p>
<strong>Governing Law and Competent Courts</strong>.
To the fullest extent permitted pursuant to applicable law, these Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to conflict of law principles.
If a lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted under these Terms, then you and AliveCor agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within Santa Clara County, California for the purpose of litigating any dispute.
If you are a consumer located in the EU, such jurisdiction of the Santa Clara County courts will be non-exclusive.
We operate the AliveCor Service from our offices in the United States, and we make no representation that Materials included in the AliveCor Service are appropriate or available for use in other locations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>General</strong>.
These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference into these Terms, are the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and AliveCor regarding your use of the AliveCor Service.
Except as expressly permitted above, these Terms may be amended only by a written agreement signed by authorized representatives of all parties to these Terms.
You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent, which may be granted or withheld at AliveCor’s sole discretion.
Any attempted assignment by you without such consent shall be null and void.
We may assign these Terms at any time without notice or consent, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law.
The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself.
Use of section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision.
If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.

<p>
<strong>Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</strong>
</p>
<p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRE YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH US AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU MAY SEEK RELIEF FROM US.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Generally</strong>.
To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law and in the interest of resolving disputes between you and AliveCor in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and AliveCor agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration, unless you are a consumer located in a jurisdiction that prohibits the exclusive use of arbitration for dispute resolution.</p>
<p>Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court.
Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts.
Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.
This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms.
YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND ALIVECOR ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Opt-Out of Agreement to Arbitrate</strong>: You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by contacting support@alivecor.com within 30 days of first accepting these Terms of Service and stating that you (include your first and last name, and email address used to register for the AliveCor Service) decline this arbitration agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Exceptions</strong>.
Despite the provisions of Section 24A, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court.
(b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available.
(c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law.
or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Arbitrator</strong>.
To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, any arbitration between you and AliveCor will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act, and governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “<strong>AAA Rules</strong>”) of the American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA.
The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting AliveCor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Notice.
Process</strong>.
A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S.
Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if such other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“<strong>Notice</strong>”).
AliveCor’s address for Notice is: AliveCor, Inc., 444 Castro Street, Suite 600 Mountain View, CA 94041 USA.
The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.
and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“<strong>Demand</strong>”).
The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or AliveCor may commence an arbitration proceeding.
During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or AliveCor must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.
If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, AliveCor will pay you the highest of the following: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any.
(ii) the last written settlement amount offered by AliveCor in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award.
or (iii) $1,000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Fees</strong>.
If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, AliveCor will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules.
Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location, to be agreed upon, in Santa Clara County, California, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.
(b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing.
or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.
If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
In that case, you agree to reimburse AliveCor for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.
Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.
The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>No Class Actions</strong>.
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND ALIVECOR AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
Further, unless both you and AliveCor agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding, to the fullest extent permissible pursuant to applicable law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Claims</strong>.
To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, no action arising out of, in connection with, or relating to these Terms shall be brought by you more than one (1) year after the accrual of the cause of action.
This period shall not be extended for any reason, except by the written consent of both parties.
All statutes or provisions of law which would toll or otherwise affect the running of the period of limitation are hereby waived, and no such statute or provision of law shall operate to extend the period limited in this paragraph, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Modifications to this Arbitration Provision</strong>.
If AliveCor makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to AliveCor’s address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to AliveCor’s address for Notice, in which case your account with AliveCor will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Enforceability</strong>.
If Section 24G is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 24 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 24 will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 22 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.</p>
