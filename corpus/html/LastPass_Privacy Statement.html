</ul> Who We Are and Scope of this Privacy Policy
<p>We are the LogMeIn group of companies, when visiting our webpages from: (a) the European Union and/or European Economic Area, the primary controller shall be LogMeIn Ireland Unlimited Company, an Irish company headquartered at The Reflector, 10 Hanover Quay, Dublin 2, D02R573, Republic of Ireland.
and for (b) all other non-United States locations, the primary controller shall be the applicable LogMeIn affiliate identified here (in each case, referred to in this Privacy Policy as “LogMeIn,” “we” or similar pronouns).
Our Software-as-a-Service products&nbsp;("Services") are used to simplify how people connect with each other and the world around them to drive meaningful interactions, deepen relationships, and create better outcomes for professionals and businesses.</p>
<p>In this Privacy Policy, we explain what personal data we collect from visitors to the LogMeIn websites and/or properties that link to this Privacy Policy (including our digital properties listed here) and how we use such personal data.</p>
<p>It is important to note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any other data, such as any personal data that may be included in the files, documents, recordings, chat logs, transcripts, and similar data that we maintain on our customers’ behalf, as well as any other information our customers may upload to their LogMeIn account(s) in connection with their use of our Services (which we refer to as “Content” in our Terms of Service) or information gathered from other channels, such as publicly available sources.
For the avoidance of doubt, we process customer Content, including any personal data which may be included therein, solely for the purpose of providing and operating our Services to our customers and only in accordance with their written instructions, which typically take the form of our Terms of Service, a Data Processing Addendum and/or any similar written agreement between LogMeIn and our customer.</p>
<p>Our affiliates in other countries have posted additional privacy notices with different scopes, as required by law or where we believe appropriate for transparency purposes, which may be found here.</p>
Data Categories and Collection Purposes
<p>When you visit our website(s) and/or use our Services, you provide the following categories of personal data to us:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Customer Account and Registration Data</strong> is data you provide when you create your account with us, request support or technical assistance, or register for events, webinars, whitepapers and surveys, which typically includes first and last name, billing data, and a valid email address.
We need this data to provide the Services to you, to maintain and support your account, as well as to collect payment.
Legal basis for the processing of this data is our legitimate interest to do business with you, your employer or business and perform our contractual obligations under the applicable Services agreement.</li>
<li>
<strong>Service Data (including Session, Location and Usage data):</strong> When you visit our websites and use our Services, we receive data that you or others voluntarily enter, including on schedules and attendee lists, as well as data automatically logged by the website or Service, for example, duration of session, connections made, hardware, equipment and devices used, IP addresses, location, language settings, operating system used, unique device identifiers and other diagnostic data.
We need this information to provide, operate, and improve our Services.
We collect location-based data for the purpose of providing, operating, and supporting the service and for fraud prevention and security monitoring.
you can disable location data transmission on mobile devices at any time by disabling location services from the settings menu on your device.
Legal basis for the processing of this data is our legitimate interest to do business with you, your employer or business, or customers that use our Services to communicate with you and your business and perform our contractual obligations under the applicable Services agreement.</li>
</ul>
<p>We strive to limit the types and categories of personal&nbsp;data&nbsp;that is collected from, and processed on behalf of, our users to include only information which is necessary to achieve the purpose(s) for which it was collected and we do not use personal data for additional purpose(s) which are incompatible with their initial collection.
In other words, we have measures and policies in place designed to ensure that we only collect and process information from our users that we believe is necessary to operate and provide them with a world-class Service.</p>
<p>We also process your personal data to comply with applicable laws, including those of the European Union ("EU") and/or individual European Economic Area ("EEA") Member States and such compliance obligations are the legal basis for such processing.</p>
<p>If you grant consent to our placement of cookies or for us to contact you for marketing purposes, we may also use your personal data for marketing purposes and the legal basis for such processing is your consent.

Cross Border Data Transfers
