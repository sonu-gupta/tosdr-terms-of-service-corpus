<p>Whenever you visit or interact with the Service or Site, we, as well as similar third-party vendors and/or service providers alike, we may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how the Service is accessed and used (“<strong>Usage Information</strong>”).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Usage Information may include, in part, browser type, operating system, device type, an estimation of your geographic location associated with your IP address, the page served, the time, referring URLs and other information normally transmitted in HTTP requests.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This <strong>statistical data</strong> provides us with information about the use of the Service, such as how many visitors visit a specific web-page on which the Service is used, how long they stay on that page, the type of content on that page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but to the extent Usage Information may be associated with you as a specific and identifiable person (for example, because you have registered for the Service) and thereby provided us with personal information (such as name, e-mail address, telephone number or home address) we treat such information as “<strong>Personal Information”</strong> and will only use it for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may also automatically collect the internet protocol (“<strong>IP</strong>“) address or other identifier (“<strong>Device Identifier</strong>“) for each computer, mobile device, technology or other device (collectively, “<strong>Device</strong>“) you use to access the Service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
