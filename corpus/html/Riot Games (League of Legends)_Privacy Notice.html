INFO WE COLLECT <p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> We collect info in three main ways: </p>
<ul>
<li>You provide some of it directly (such as by registering for an account).</li>
<br>
<li>We record some of it automatically (including with technologies like cookies).</li>
<br>
<li>We receive some of it from third parties (like social media companies).</li>
</ul> The particular kinds of info we gather usually depend on how you interact with us, like which Riot services you use and how you do so.
<p>
</p>
<br> A.
Info You Provide <p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> We collect info you choose to provide or give to us in any manner.
You don’t have to share info when we ask you for it, but if you decline, you might not be able to access certain Riot services or take advantage of their full functionality.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Expand</strong>
</p>
<p> We collect info you enter or otherwise provide on the Riot services, including: </p>
<ul>
<li>Your email address, date of birth, in-game name (e.g.
Summoner Name), and similar contact info (like when you register for an account);</li>
<br>
<li>Your username, password, and other details that help us secure and provide access to the Riot services (like when you login to our games or websites);</li>
<br>
<li>Your name, billing address, telephone number, payment method, and other details we collect to help process purchases you make (like when you buy Riot Points or shop at our Merch Store);</li>
<br>
<li>Your support-related info, including the nature of your concern and your account or order details (like when you request help from us, such as by submitting a Player Support ticket).
</li>
<br>
<li>Your preferences, interests, and general demographic info (such as your hobbies, favorite games, or other info you share, like when you respond to a survey);</li>
<br>
<li>Info you share with us in connection with contests or promotions (like to submit an entry, prove your eligibility, or claim a prize if you win);</li>
<br>
<li>Your Riot Games account info (like your preferred game settings, key bindings, friends list, and mastery and rune pages).
and</li>
<br>
<li>Info you decide to give us (which may include info about your health) so that we can better make the Riot services accessible to you by accommodating specific needs you may have, such as being deaf, hard of hearing, blind or visually impaired.</li>
</ul>
<p> The Riot services also offer social features like forums and chat.
When you use these features, the info you share is viewable by others – this means we may collect and use the info you provide (including to enforce our Terms of Service, such as described in Anti-Cheat &amp.
Fraud Prevention and Chat &amp.
Player Behavior below), and in some cases it may also be collected or used by others without your knowledge (for example, if you’re chatting with another player while they stream a match).</p>
<p>When you play multiplayer games like League of Legends, note that some info will be publicly accessible to others, such as your game statistics and performance.
We may record gameplay and related info (such as Summoner Name, build order, and in-game actions), and replay or otherwise make it available to other players without further notice to you.
For example, players can watch each other play League of Legends using Spectator Mode, and we may use gameplay footage to help promote the Riot services.</p>
<p>If you disclose any information relating to other people to us or to our service providers in connection with the Riot services, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this privacy notice.</p>

<br> C.
Info We Collect From Third Parties <p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> Sometimes we obtain info from third parties to use along with the info we collect.
For example, if you link your Facebook account with your Riot Games account, Facebook may share info with us in accordance with Facebook’s privacy notice and your privacy settings on it.
Facebook also shares info with us about your use of our official Riot Games and game specific fan pages on Facebook.
We also, for example, gather advertising and analytics info from third parties to help support our marketing initiatives, improve the Riot services, and better manage our ad campaigns.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Expand</strong>
</p>
<p> We may collect info from third parties to supplement the info you provide and the info we collect automatically for our legitimate purposes.
For example: </p>
<ul>
<li>We obtain info from third parties if you use their services in connection with the Riot services (such as linking your Facebook account with the Riot services via the Add Friends feature).
Your privacy settings on the third party’s service control what info they can share with us – it can include info like your name, profile picture, gender, age range, username, language, country, your friends and other info you have made available on the platform.
Please make sure you’re comfortable with what they might share by reviewing their posted policies, and if applicable, modifying your privacy settings directly on their service.</li>
<br>
<li>We gather advertising and analytics info from third parties to help support our marketing initiatives, improve the Riot services, and better manage our ad campaigns (like by displaying more personalized ads and measuring how effective they are).
To learn more about these companies, see Analytics &amp.
Interest-Based Ads.</li>
<br>
<li>We collect info from third parties to help us identify from where you’re using the Riot services (like your approximate location based on your IP address).
This helps us, for example, process purchases (like assessing tax obligations), prevent fraud or abuse of the Riot services (such as identifying suspicious transactions or activity), and customize your visit (like displaying the Riot services in your local language).</li>
<br>
<li>We’ll also receive info from third-party platforms (like the Apple appstore or Google Play) if you download the Riot services (such as the League Friends app) on your mobile device.
This might include, for example, technical details (like device IDs) and the fact that you’ve downloaded one of our apps.</li>

HOW WE COLLECT INFO <p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> In addition to info you provide, we and our partners automatically record some info about how you use and navigate the Riot services.
We may combine this info with other info we gather from or about you as described in this notice, including to enforce our Terms of Service and for analytics and advertising purposes.
</p>
<br> A.
Cookies &amp.
Related Technologies <p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> We use our own servers and technologies like cookies to automatically collect and store info about how you interact with the Riot services, as well as the device you use to do so.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Expand</strong>
</p>
<p>“Cookies” are small pieces of data that online services you use place on your device for record-keeping and identification purposes.
“Web beacons” are transparent pixel images that allow online services to collect info about the ways you interact with them (like whether you’ve opened an email or clicked on an ad).
Similar common technologies include things like tags, scripts, local shared objects (e.g., Flash cookies), local storage (e.g., HTML5), and related tools.</p>
<p>The Riot services use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to automatically collect, store, and read files on your device.
They may be delivered in a first-party (i.e., by Riot Games) or third-party (i.e., by other companies) context.
These tools help the Riot services work and operate more efficiently, as well as capture info about how you interact with us (see Info We Collect).
</p>
<p>We also use our servers in connection with these technologies to collect info about the ways you interact with the Riot services and store it in log files.
This may include, for example, info that your device, browser, or operating system sends to us when you access the Riot services (like device IDs, IP addresses, and hardware or software specifications) and details about how you use your Riot Games account (like the particular features you use, your in-game interactions and statistics, and other similar info).</p>
<p>We use info gathered through our servers and technologies like cookies for several reasons based on Riot Games’, third parties’ or players’ legitimate interest, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>To monitor, secure, and maintain the Riot services (like preventing fraud);</li>
<br>
<li>To enhance your browsing experience (such as allowing you to log-in to your account);</li>
<br>
<li>To analyze and improve our operations (like aggregating traffic and usage patterns);</li>
<br>
<li>To control the display of ads (including providing you with targeted offers);</li>
<br>
<li>To support and gauge the effectiveness of our communications and marketing campaigns (like letting us know if you’ve clicked on our ads or opened our emails);</li>
<br>
<li>To better personalize your visit and store your preferences and settings (for example, displaying content in your local language).
and</li>
<br>
<li>To otherwise manage our relationship with players and provide the Riot services under the Terms of Service (including help prevent toxicity and ensure a fair gaming environment, such as described in Anti-Cheat &amp.
Fraud Prevention and Chat &amp.
Player Behavior below).
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can learn more about cookies and similar technologies, including details of how to manage or disable them, by reading our Cookies Policy, and by visiting http://aboutcookies.org/ or consulting your browser’s privacy features.
Some ways of managing traditional cookies may not impact the use of other technologies, but certain browsers may offer their own tools for removing HTML5.
For additional details about managing Flash cookies, click here.
We do not currently respond to browser do-not-track signals.
</p>
<p>Please note that disabling technologies like cookies may prevent you from using the full functionality of the Riot services and the Riot services may not work as we intended.

<strong>Collapse</strong>
</p> B.
Analytics &amp.
Interest-Based Ads <p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> We partner with third parties (like content providers, analytics companies, and advertising networks) to help us improve the Riot services and better understand how you interact with them, as well as support our marketing initiatives.
These companies may collect info from you automatically in connection with your visit.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Expand</strong>
</p>
<p> In addition to the technologies we place, other companies may set their own cookies or similar tools when you visit the Riot services.
This includes vendors we’ve engaged to provide services on our behalf (like website analytics), as well as third parties that deliver content (like videos from YouTube) or offers (like ads from ad networks) contained on the Riot services.
We may receive reports based on our partners’ use of these tools on an individual or aggregate basis.
</p>
<p> For example, we use third-party analytics providers (like Google Analytics) to help evaluate and report on use of the Riot services.
We also partner with ad companies to support our marketing efforts, including by serving you ads better tailored to your likely interests (such as based on your browsing activity on the Riot services and when visiting other online services).
These companies may set and read their own cookies and similar technologies to gather info about your online activities across websites and services.
</p>
<p> Some analytics providers and ad companies offer you choices about how they collect and use info directly on their websites.
To learn more about opting out of Google Analytics, click here.
For a representative list of third-party advertising and analytics partners that operate on the Riot services, as well as information about how to opt-out to the extent applicable, click here.
You may also be able to opt-out in some cases by visiting http://www.aboutads.info or http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/, or if you’re located in the EU or Canada, http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/ or http://youradchoices.ca/ respectively.
You can learn more about cookies and similar technologies, including details of how to manage or disable them, by reading our Cookies Policy.</p>
<p> Please note that opting-out of interest-based advertising won’t necessarily entirely prevent info from being collected automatically on the Riot services, and it doesn’t mean you’ll receive fewer ads or stop them from being displayed.
Instead, the ads you do receive won’t be interest-based any longer and therefore might be less relevant to your interests.</p>

Facebook Fan Pages <p>

We don’t sell your information to independent third parties.
We do share non-contact info (like your Summoner Name, match history, game stats, and other aggregate or anonymous info), including publicly via the Riot Games API.
</p>
<p> If we ever stop providing Riot services or certain parts of them (like if we’re bought out or invaded by Yordles), we may share your info with the buyer.
Lastly, remember the stuff you share in social features (like chat and forums) is public -- please be careful about how you use them! </p>
<br>

<strong>Expand</strong>
</p>
<p> We share the info we collect with Riot Games-controlled subsidiaries and affiliates that provide services to us so we can more seamlessly operate, support, and improve the Riot services (such as to facilitate account transfers and provide Player Support in your local language).
Since we’re a global company, this means your info may be transferred to or stored in locations outside your country of residence (see International Data Processing).
To learn more about the Riot Games entity or, where applicable, entities that control and are responsible for your info, see Contact Us below.
</p>
<p> We also share info with service providers that operate on our behalf for the purposes discussed in this notice (see III.
B.
above).
For example, when you buy something on the Riot services, we’ll share your payment-related info with entities we’ve engaged to process payments and provide similar financial services (like fraud prevention).
Other common examples include partners that help us store data, send marketing emails, and provide Player Support services, assist with research and analysis of our services (like research institutions or universities), third party social media platforms or apps we permit to link to our products or Riot services.
We may also transfer your info in some cases to our professional advisers (who are sometimes independent ‘data controllers’) such as lawyers and accountants (e.g.
when enforcing our contract with you).
</p>
<p> If you share info publicly through interactive features we control, such as forums and chat, you should understand that this info becomes viewable to others.
We reserve the right (but have no obligation) to monitor your use of them, including for purposes like enforcing our Terms of Service and applicable player behavior requirements (see Chat &amp.

<p> Please note that your in-game name (e.g.
Summoner Name) and gameplay statistics (like your match history, item builds, and average number of kills and deaths) are viewable to others and may be shared in-game and out-of-game with players and other third parties.

Chat &amp.
Player Behavior <p> We’ve empowered our players to help police compliance with our policies (including, for example, our Summoner Codes of Conduct) related to certain in-game behavior.
For example, players may report each other and submit descriptions of their in-game activity and actions to help us determine if the reported behavior constituted a violation of rules and procedures that apply to player conduct, as well as any potential repercussions (such as temporary or permanent account suspensions or chat restrictions).
</p>
<p> We also record and store, and reserve the right (but have no obligation) to monitor, chat and similar details about in-game interactions for a period we determine is appropriate to help us, among other things, detect and prevent toxicity, enforce our rules and policies and Terms of Services, and foster a more positive gaming community for our players.
We engage in these activities to manage our contractual relationship with you, comply with a legal obligation (e.g.
to keep the Riot Services safe and secure), and/or because we have a legitimate interest (e.g.
understanding how the Riot Services are used, keep them secure and improve them).
</p>
<p>We use both manual (like enabling you to report such behaviour through Player Support tickets) and automated (such as machine learning) tools and techniques to support these efforts.
</p>
<p>To enable us to monitor compliance with our policies, we develop template patterns of inappropriate behaviour (e.g.
verbal abuse, hate speech, cheating, offensive or inappropriate name calling), which we consider indicative of prohibited behaviours.
We do this based upon an analysis of actual behaviours on the Riot services.
We grade these patterns of inappropriate behaviour based upon their severity with different consequences (e.g.
temporary or permanent account restrictions or chat restrictions) for players based upon how serious their conduct is.
If another player makes a complaint about your behaviour, our automated tools use these patterns of inappropriate behaviour and grading system to compare your behaviour over time with these patterns of inappropriate behaviour and, if you have engaged in inappropriate behaviour, make a decision as to the consequences for you of your behaviour.
This primarily helps us enforce our rules and policies, secure the Riot services, detect and prevent unauthorized activity, and maintain the competitive integrity of our games.
</p>
<p>Our complaints procedure allow you to appeal a decision.
In this case, we will provide you a report showing the thought process and method behind the decision along with some tips on how to avoid repeating such behaviour in the future.
If you are still unhappy, you can request one of our agents to review your case who will make a final determination as to the correct outcome manually, based on the available evidence.

<p> Please be kind to other players, observe our policies related to player behavior (including our Terms of Service), and always be careful what you share in chat! </p>

to keep the Riot Services secure), and/or because we have a legitimate interest (e.g.
understanding how the Riot Services are used, keep them secure and improve them).

YOUR RIGHTS, CHOICES AND CONTROLS <p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> You have choices regarding your use of the Riot services and the ways we process info.
Since you can interact with us in many different ways, the particular controls available to you often depend on the nature of our relationship.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Expand</strong>
</p>
<p> You can use many parts of the Riot services without ever creating an account, purchasing our products or services, or otherwise submitting info like your name or email address to us.
If you do choose to visit or use the Riot Services, we generally retain the related personal information as long as your account is active or as is otherwise necessary to provide the Riot services, operate our business (including for legitimate purposes like complying with our legal obligations, managing internal books and records, preventing fraud, resolving disputes, and enforcing our contracts and terms, such as this notice and the Terms of Service or to achieve the purposes set out in this notice, unless a longer retention period is permitted or required by law.</p>
<p> The precise periods for which we keep your personal information vary depending on the nature of the information, why we need it and relevant legal or operational retention needs.
Factors we consider in determining these periods include the minimum required retention period prescribed by law or recommended as best practice, the period during which a claim can be made with respect to a contract or other matter, whether the personal information has been aggregated or pseudonymized, and other relevant criteria.
For example, the retention period applicable for your personal data needed to provide the Riot service to you (such as accessing the games) is limited to your account life.
When your account is deleted, Riot will delete the relevant information for that purpose (providing the service to you) but will keep some personal information (summoner name for instance) for other defined purposes such as security and fraud detection.
As another example, chat logs/history data is retained for a period of two years from its creation.
This is to enable Riot to properly investigate infringements of our rules and policies such as fraud, toxicity, cheating and harmful behaviour.
</p>
<p> You can also limit the info you share with third parties, such as by choosing not to link your Riot Games account with third-party services (see Third-Party Websites and Services).
</p>
<p> We offer players choices about the types of communications they receive from Riot Games.
If you choose to receive marketing and promotional emails from us but later change your mind, simply “unsubscribe” by following the instructions in the relevant email.
These choices don’t apply to mandatory communications that are part of the Riot services, like important account-related notices.
</p>
<p> The Riot services also have many built-in tools to help players exercise control over their info directly.
For example, you can generally delete old forum posts, mute or disable voice chat functionality, and change other preferences from your account settings.
If you need help with any of these options, be sure to Contact Us.
</p>
<p> Many Internet browsers allow you to reject, manage, and delete cookies.
You may also be able to manage other similar technologies, like HTML5, by changing your browser settings (see Info We Collect Automatically).
</p>
<p> If you don’t want to take advantage of the services that third-party analytics and advertising companies provide on the Riot services, you may be able to opt-out of some of them by visitin http://www.aboutads.info or http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/, or if you’re located in the EU or Canada, http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/ or http://youradchoices.ca/ respectively, or if you’re located in Australia, http://www.your.onlinechoices.com.au.

</p>
<p> If you withdraw your consent (including for marketing purposes), it does not affect the lawfulness of what we did up until that point.</p>
<p>Before we process such requests, we may ask you to verify your identity (like by logging-in to your account or providing us with certain info to help us confirm ownership) and we may request payment where allowed by law.
Note that asking us to remove personal info or refrain from processing it may also result in account suspension or termination where this info is necessary to make Riot services available to you (we normally tell you this at the point we collect the info), in which case you’ll no longer be able to access those Riot services.
We may also retain certain info associated with your account for purposes like complying with our legal obligations, managing internal books and records, preventing fraud, resolving disputes, and enforcing our contracts and terms, such as this notice and the Terms of Service.</p>
