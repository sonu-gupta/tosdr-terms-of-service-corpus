Upwork provides such information solely for the convenience of Users.</b>You acknowledge and agree that User feedback benefits the marketplace, all Users, and the efficiency of the Site and you specifically request that Upwork post composite or compiled feedback about Users, including yourself, on User Profiles and elsewhere on the Site.

CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CLIENT AND FREELANCER</b>
<i>Section 3 discusses the relationship you may decide to enter into with another User, including Service Contracts between Users, as detailed below.</i>
<b>3.1 SERVICE CONTRACTS</b>If a Client and Freelancer decide to enter into a Service Contract, the Service Contract is a contractual relationship directly between the Client and Freelancer.
Client and Freelancer have complete discretion both with regard to whether to enter into a Service Contract with each other and with regard to the terms of any Service Contract.
You acknowledge, agree, and understand that Upwork is not a party to any Service Contract, that the formation of a Service Contract between Users will not, under any circumstance, create an employment or other service relationship between Upwork and any User or a partnership or joint venture between Upwork and any User.With respect to any Service Contract, Clients and Freelancers may enter into any written agreements that they deem appropriate (e.g., confidentiality agreements, invention assignment agreements, assignment of rights, etc.) provided that any such agreements do not conflict with, narrow, or expand Upwork’s rights and obligations under the Terms of Service, including this Agreement and the applicable Escrow Instructions.
The parties to a Service Contract can, if the parties prefer, agree to the Optional Service Contract Terms in whole or in part, in addition to or instead of other such agreements.
Only to the extent that they have not entered into another agreement or terms with respect to a Service Contract, the parties to a Service Contract agree that the Optional Service Contract Terms apply to their Service Contract.The Optional Service Contract Terms are provided as a sample only and may not be appropriate for all jurisdictions or all contracts.
Users are responsible for complying with any local requirements, including applicable laws, rules, and regulations.
Upwork does not assume any responsibility for any consequence of using the Optional Service Contract Terms.
The Optional Service Contract Terms are not intended to and do not (a) constitute legal advice, (b) create an attorney-client relationship, or (c) constitute advertising or a solicitation of any type.
Each situation is highly fact-specific and requirements vary by situation and jurisdiction and therefore any party should seek legal advice from a licensed attorney in the relevant jurisdictions.
Upwork expressly disclaims any and all liability with respect to actions or omissions based on the Optional Service Contract Terms.Please refer to the Upwork Payroll Agreement for Service Contracts using Upwork Payroll.<b>3.2 DISPUTES AMONG USERS</b>For disputes arising between Clients and Freelancers, you agree to abide by the dispute process that is explained in the Escrow Instructions that apply to your particular Service Contract.
If the dispute process does not resolve your dispute, you may pursue your dispute independently, but you acknowledge and agree that Upwork will not and is not obligated to provide any dispute assistance beyond what is provided in the Escrow Instructions.If Freelancer or Client intends to obtain an order from any arbitrator or any court that might direct Upwork, Upwork Escrow, or our Affiliates to take or refrain from taking any action with respect to an Escrow Account, that party will (a) give us at least five business days’ prior notice of the hearing.
(b) include in any such order a provision that, as a precondition to obligation affecting Upwork or Upwork Escrow, we be paid in full for any amounts to which we would otherwise be entitled.
and (c) be paid for the reasonable value of the services to be rendered pursuant to such order.<b>3.3 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION</b>Users may agree to any terms they deem appropriate with respect to confidentiality, including those set forth in the Optional Service Contract Terms.
If and to the extent that the Users do not articulate any different agreement with regard to confidentiality, then they agree that this Section 3.3 (Confidential Information) applies.To the extent a User provides Confidential Information to the other, the recipient will protect the secrecy of the discloser’s Confidential Information with the same degree of care as it uses to protect its own Confidential Information, but in no event with less than due care.
On a User’s written request, the party that received Confidential Information will promptly destroy or return the disclosing party’s Confidential Information and any copies thereof contained in or on its premises, systems, or any other equipment otherwise under its control.<b>4.
WORKER CLASSIFICATION AND UPWORK PAYROLL</b>
<b>
</b>
<i>Section 4 discusses what you agree to concerning whether a Freelancer is an employee or independent contractor and when you agree to use Upwork Payroll, as detailed below.</i>
<b>4.1 WORKER CLASSIFICATION</b>Nothing in this Agreement is intended to or should be construed to create a partnership, joint venture, franchisor/franchisee or employer-employee relationship between Upwork and a User.Client is solely responsible for and has complete discretion with regard to selection of any Freelancer for any Project.
Client is solely responsible for and assumes all liability for determining whether Freelancers should be engaged as independent contractors or employees of Client and engaging them accordingly.
Client warrants its decisions regarding classification are correct and its manner of engaging Freelancers complies with applicable laws, regulations, and rules.
Upwork will have no input into, or involvement in, worker classification as between Client and Freelancer and Users agree that Upwork has no involvement in and will have no liability arising from or relating to the classification of a Freelancer generally or with regard to a particular Project.<b>4.2 UPWORK PAYROLL SERVICES</b>Client agrees to enroll in Upwork Payroll if it will receive services from a Freelancer under terms and conditions that would give rise to an employment relationship (unless Client elects instead to pay the Conversion Fee (see Section 7)).
When the Client enrolls in Upwork Payroll, Client will engage Upwork’s third-party staffing vendor (the “<b>Staffing Provider</b>”), which is an Agency on Upwork, through the Site.
The Staffing Provider will hire Freelancer at the request of Client and Freelancer according to the terms described on the Site and otherwise agreed to by the Staffing Provider and Client and/or Freelancer, and subject to the Upwork Payroll Agreement.
For all purposes with Upwork Payroll, the employer of Freelancer will be the Staffing Provider and not Upwork under any circumstances.Freelancer, acknowledges, understands, and agrees that Upwork will have no control over, or involvement in determining or influencing, the terms and conditions of any employment relationship that may arise between Freelancer and Staffing Provider or Client, including the selection of an employee, pay rate, work hours, employment dates and working conditions.
Freelancer will not have any contract on the Site or contact with Upwork regarding such employment terms.

<strong>Service Fees.</strong> Freelancers will pay Upwork a service fee for the use of the Site Services as set forth in the Fee and ACH Authorization Agreement and the Direct Contract Terms, for using the Site Services, including the communication, invoicing, reporting, dispute resolution and payment services, including facilitating arbitration services and Hourly Payment Protection, as described in the applicable Escrow Instructions (the “<b>Service Fees</b>”).
The Service Fees (to use the Site Services) are paid solely by Freelancer.
When a Client pays a Freelancer for a Project or when funds related to a Project are otherwise released to a Freelancer as required by the applicable Escrow Instructions (See Section 6.1), Upwork Escrow will credit the Freelancer Escrow Account for the full amount paid or released by the Client, and then subtract and disburse to Upwork the Service Fee.
Freelancer hereby irrevocably authorizes and instructs Upwork Escrow to deduct the Service Fee from the Freelancer Escrow Account and pay Upwork on Freelancer’s behalf.
In the event the Freelancer chooses to withdraw funds in a currency other than U.S.
dollars, there may also be a foreign currency conversion charge imposed by Upwork Escrow or an affiliate and the rate may differ from rates that are in effect on the date of the payment and you may be able to obtain a better rate from your bank or financial institution.<br>
<strong>Membership Fees and Connects.
</strong>Freelancers may subscribe to different levels of participation and privileges on the Site to access additional features and Site Service, by payment of subscription membership fees and by purchasing "Connects" as described in and subject to the terms of the Freelancer Membership Agreement.<strong>Disbursement Fees.
</strong>Freelancers will pay Upwork a disbursement fee for remitting payments to their preferred payment method (“<b>Disbursement Fee</b>”).
The Disbursement Fee is paid to Upwork in consideration of costs incurred and administration of disbursements via the disbursement method requested by Freelancer and varies by disbursement method.
The Disbursement Fee for each disbursement method is listed under Fees and Schedules on the Site as revised from time to time.In addition to fees charged by Upwork, your disbursement method may also charge activation, maintenance, or other account fees.<b>5.2 CLIENT FEES</b>Clients pay Upwork a fee for payment processing and administration related to the Freelancer Fees they pay to Freelancers they engage through the Site, as described in the Fee and ACH Authorization Agreement.
Clients may also choose to pay for a premium membership plan to access additional features and Site Services, as described in the Fee and ACH Authorization Agreement.
Clients do not pay fees if they use the Site solely for Direct Contracts.<b>5.3 VAT AND OTHER TAXES</b>Upwork may be required by applicable law to collect taxes or levies including, without limitation, withholding income tax or VAT (while some countries may refer to VAT using other terms, e.g.
GST, we’ll just refer to VAT, GST and any local sales taxes collectively as “<b>VAT</b>”) in the jurisdiction of the Freelancer (the "<b>Taxes</b>").
In such instances, any amounts Upwork is required to collect or withhold for the payment of any such Taxes shall be collected in addition to the fees owed to Upwork under the Terms of Service.<b>5.4 NO FEE FOR INTRODUCING OR FOR FINDING PROJECTS</b>
<b>
</b>Upwork does not introduce Clients to Freelancers and does not help Freelancers secure Projects.
Upwork merely makes the Site and Site Services available to enable Freelancers to do so themselves and may from time to time highlight Projects that may be of interest.
Therefore, Upwork does not charge a fee when a Freelancer finds a suitable Client or finds a Project.
In addition, Upwork does not charge any fee or dues for posting public feedback and composite or compiled feedback, including Composite Information.<b>6.

We have the right to rely upon, and will not be liable for acting or refraining from acting upon, any written notice, instruction, or request furnished to us by Client or Freelancer in accordance with this Agreement or the applicable Escrow Instructions, if we reasonably believe that such notice, instruction, or request is genuine and that it is signed or presented by the proper party or parties.

<strong>Hourly Contracts.

<b>6.3 DISBURSEMENTS TO FREELANCERS ON SERVICE CONTRACTS</b>Under the relevant Escrow Instructions, Upwork Escrow disburses funds that are available in the applicable Freelancer Escrow Account and payable to a Freelancer upon Freelancer’s request.

If Freelancer does not request a disbursement, Upwork will automatically disburse available funds no more than 90 days after the Freelancer Fees are released to the Freelancer Escrow Account, unless the amount in the Escrow Account is less than the Minimum Threshold.
For purposes of the Terms of Service, a “<b>Minimum Threshold</b>” is either (a) $100 for Freelancers within the United States, or (b) $1,000 for Freelancers outside the United States.
When the funds in the Freelancer Escrow Account are below the Minimum Threshold, the automatic disbursement schedule is paused and the available and payable funds are released on the earlier of: (i) Freelancer’s request.
(ii) on the first scheduled automatic disbursement occurring after the amount exceeds the Minimum Threshold.
or (iii) 180 days after the funds are available in the Freelancer Escrow Account.<strong>Hourly Contracts.</strong> Freelancer Fees become available to Freelancers following the expiration of the dispute period and the five-day security period.

The security period begins after Client accepts and approves work submitted by Freelancer.Notwithstanding any other provision of the Terms of Service or the Escrow Instructions, Upwork Escrow, in its sole discretion and except as prohibited by applicable law, may refuse to process, may hold the disbursement of the Freelancer Fees or any other amounts and offset amounts owed to us, or take such other actions with respect to the Escrow Account as we deem appropriate in our sole discretion if: (a) we require additional information, such as Freelancer’s tax information, government-issued identification or other proof of identity, address, or date of birth.
(b) we have reason to believe the Freelancer Fees may be subject to dispute or chargeback.
(c) we suspect a User has committed or attempted to commit fraud or other illicit acts on or through the Site.
(d) we believe there are reasonable grounds for insecurity with respect to the performance of obligations under this Agreement or other Terms of Service.

<b>13.1 TERMINATION</b>
<b>
</b>Unless both you and Upwork expressly agree otherwise in writing, either of us may terminate this Agreement in our sole discretion, at any time, without explanation, upon written notice to the other, which will result in the termination of the other Terms of Service as well, except as otherwise provided herein.
You may provide written notice to legalnotices@upwork.com.

If you attempt to terminate this Agreement while having one or more open Projects, you agree (a) you hereby instruct Upwork to close any open contracts.
(b) you will continue to be bound by this Agreement and the other Terms of Service until all such Projects have closed on the Site.
(c) Upwork will continue to perform those Site Services necessary to complete any open Project or related transaction between you and another User.

If you attempt to use the Site under a different Account, we reserve the right to reclaim available funds in that Account and/or use an available Payment Method to pay for any amounts owed by you to the extent permitted by applicable law.You acknowledge and agree that the value, reputation, and goodwill of the Site depend on transparency of User’s Account status to all Users, including both yourself and other Users who have entered into Service Contracts with you.
You therefore agree as follows: <b>IF UPWORK DECIDES TO TEMPORARILY OR PERMANENTLY CLOSE YOUR ACCOUNT, UPWORK HAS THE RIGHT WHERE ALLOWED BY LAW BUT NOT THE OBLIGATION TO: (A) NOTIFY OTHER USERS THAT HAVE ENTERED INTO SERVICE CONTRACTS WITH YOU TO INFORM THEM OF YOUR CLOSED ACCOUNT STATUS, (B) PROVIDE THOSE USERS WITH A SUMMARY OF THE REASONS FOR YOUR ACCOUNT CLOSURE.
YOU AGREE THAT UPWORK WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO ANY NOTICE THAT IT MAY PROVIDE TO ANY USER REGARDING CLOSED ACCOUNT STATUS OR THE REASON(S) FOR THE CLOSURE.</b>
<b>13.2 ACCOUNT DATA ON CLOSURE</b>Except as otherwise required by law, if your Account is closed for any reason, you will no longer have access to data, messages, files, or other material you keep on the Site and any closure of your Account may involve deletion of any content stored in your Account for which Upwork will have no liability whatsoever.
Upwork, in its sole discretion and as permitted or required by law, may retain some or all of your Account information.<b>13.3 SURVIVAL</b>After this Agreement terminates, the terms of this Agreement and the other Terms of Service that expressly or by their nature contemplate performance after this Agreement terminates or expires will survive and continue in full force and effect.
For example, the provisions requiring arbitration, permitting audits, protecting intellectual property, requiring non-circumvention, indemnification, payment of fees, reimbursement and setting forth limitations of liability each, by their nature, contemplate performance or observance after this Agreement terminates.
Without limiting any other provisions of the Terms of Service, the termination of this Agreement for any reason will not release you or Upwork from any obligations incurred prior to termination of this Agreement or that thereafter may accrue in respect of any act or omission prior to such termination.<b>14.

UTC) during the five days following the close of the weekly invoice period (Monday 12:00 a.m.
midnight UTC to Friday 11:59 p.m.
UTC) (the “<strong>Dispute Period</strong>“).
It is Client’s responsibility to review the Hourly Invoice of every Hourly Contract on a weekly basis and to file any disputes during the Dispute Period.
Once the Dispute Period expires, Client will be deemed to have accepted the Freelancer Services and Freelancer Fees and can no longer dispute them.
Disputes handled by Upwork can only address the hours billed, not the quality of the Freelancer Services or the Work Product provided under Hourly Contracts.
If Client disputes Freelancer’s hours invoiced in the Hourly Invoice under an Hourly Contract during the Dispute Period, Client and Freelancer are encouraged to resolve the dispute between themselves.
If Client and Freelancer fail to come to a resolution, Upwork will promptly investigate the Hourly Invoice and determine, in our sole discretion, whether an adjustment is appropriate consistent with Client’s and Freelancer’s instructions in these Escrow Instructions.
Upwork's determination of such dispute shall be final.<br>If Client’s payment is unsuccessful, Upwork will review the Weekly Invoice to determine if it qualifies for Hourly Payment Protection.
If Upwork, in its sole discretion, determines that the Weekly Invoice qualifies for Hourly Payment Protection, it will make payment to the Freelancer to cover the Hourly Invoice on behalf of the Client.
In the event that Upwork makes payment on behalf of the Client, Freelancer hereby irrevocably assigns any right, title or interest in any payment from Client to Upwork for the amount paid by Upwork.
<br>Client may choose to approve Freelancer’s Weekly Invoice prior to the end of the Dispute Period thereby releasing payment for the Weekly Invoice.
If Client releases payment to Freelancer prior to the end of the Dispute Period, Client certifies that it approves the Weekly Invoice, accepts the work, and waives any further right to dispute the work or Weekly Invoice through Upwork's Dispute Assistance (defined below).You acknowledge and agree that Upwork Escrow or its Affiliates may, at its sole discretion, withhold or delay payment in the event of dispute between a Client and a Freelancer.

Funds deposited by Clients remain in the Client Escrow Account until they are released to the Freelancer Escrow Account or released to the Client.
Upwork Escrow will not release funds held in escrow except as described in these Escrow Instructions.<br>
<strong>3.
RELEASE AND DELIVERY OF AMOUNTS IN ESCROW</strong>Client and Freelancer irrevocably authorize and instruct Upwork Escrow Inc.
(“<strong>Upwork Escrow</strong>“) to release applicable portions of the Direct Contract Escrow Account (each portion, a “<strong>Release</strong>”) to their Freelancer Escrow Account or Client Escrow Account, as applicable, upon the occurrence of and in accordance with one or more Release Conditions provided below or as otherwise required by applicable law or the Terms of Service.

FUNDING ESCROW</b>By accepting an Hourly Direct Contract, Client agrees to deposit funds totaling the Freelancer’s hourly rate as agreed to by the parties multiplied by the weekly hourly limit agreed to by the parties (“Direct Contract Deposit”).

(“Upwork Escrow”) to hold the Direct Contract Deposit in escrow through the term of the Hourly Direct Contract and further authorizes Upwork Escrow to release funds from the Direct Contract Deposit to the Freelancer in any instance(s) where the Freelancer invoices hours of work and the invoice is neither disputed or funded for payment by Client in accordance with these Hourly Escrow Instructions.
In any such instance(s), Client agrees that Upwork Escrow may charge to Client’s Payment Method or Client will otherwise deposit additional funds into the Client Escrow Account to replenish the Direct Contract Deposit.
Freelancer and Client agree and authorize Upwork Escrow to hold an amount equal to the Direct Contract Deposit in escrow through the termination of the Direct Contract, at which point the parties agree the Direct Contract Deposit will be released to Client if all payments due under the Hourly Direct Contract have been paid to Freelancer.
In addition to the Direct Contract Deposit, Client agrees to fund through Client Escrow Account payments to Freelancer on a weekly basis for the amount of Freelancer’s applicable weekly invoices (“Direct Contract Weekly Funds”).
If Client approves the submitted invoices in accordance with the below provisions, Upwork Escrow will release the Direct Contract Weekly Funds to Freelancer.
2.1 WEEKLY HOURLY INVOICESFor Hourly Direct Contracts, the weekly billing cycle starts Monday at 00:00 midnight UTC and ends Sunday at 23:59 UTC.
Invoices for hours recorded by the Freelancer on Upwork within the weekly billing cycle (the "Hourly Invoice Deadline") will be generated each Monday following the week in which the hours were billed (such invoice, the "Hourly Invoice").
Freelancer irrevocably authorizes and instructs Upwork, as its agent, to (i) create an invoice on behalf of Freelancer for payment due based upon the hours that the freelancer recorded before the Hourly Invoice Deadline.
and (ii) submit the Hourly Invoice on behalf of Freelancer to Freelancer's Client for payment.
By recording time on Upwork and allowing an Hourly Invoice to be created based on the time recorded, Freelancer represents and warrants that (y) Freelancer has completed the applicable Freelancer Services fully and satisfactorily.

Payments will be held in escrow during the Dispute Period (defined below), providing four days for Client to review and dispute the Hourly Invoice before funds are released.
During the Dispute Period, Client may initiate a Dispute as to some or all of the time invoiced on the Hourly Invoice.On the Friday following the Sunday deadline for submission of the Hourly Invoice, Client will be deemed to have approved all undisputed amounts on the Hourly Invoice, and irrevocably instructed Upwork’s Affiliate, Upwork Escrow, to release escrow funds as described in these Hourly Direct Contract Escrow Instructions.<br>

Such instruction is also Client’s representation that Client has received, inspected, and accepted the subject work or expense.
Client acknowledges and agrees that upon receipt of Client’s instruction to pay Freelancer, Upwork Escrow will release funds to the Freelancer and that Upwork, Upwork Escrow, and other Affiliates have no responsibility to and may not be able to recover such funds.
Therefore, and in consideration of services described herein, Client agrees that once Upwork Escrow has charged Client’s Payment Method, the charge is non-refundable and any funds will only be returned pursuant to a Release Condition (see below).<br>
<br>
<b>4.
RELEASE AND DELIVERY OF AMOUNTS IN ESCROW</b>Upwork Escrow is authorized to and will release applicable portions of the Client Escrow Account (each portion, a “Release”) to the Freelancer Escrow Account, upon the occurrence of and in accordance with one or more Release Conditions provided below or as otherwise required by applicable law or the Terms of Service.
The amount of the Release will be delivered to the Freelancer Escrow Account, in accordance with Freelancer’s and Client’s instructions (as applicable), these Hourly Direct Contract Escrow Instructions, and the other Terms of Service.4.1 RELEASE CONDITIONSAs used in these Escrow Instructions, “Release Condition” means any of the following:<ol>

Fees Charged to Freelancers</b>Pursuant to the User Agreement, we charge Freelancers a Service Fee for each payment their Client makes to the Freelancer on a Service Contract.
Depending on certain features of the Service Contract, the Service Fees will be charged either as "tiered" or "straight" pricing, as discussed in further detail in this Section 2.
Where applicable, Upwork Global, Elance Ltd., or Upwork Escrow may also collect taxes (such as value added tax (VAT) in Europe) on Service Fees.Pursuant to the Freelancer Membership Agreement, we charge Freelancers a Membership Fee.
These Membership Fees automatically renew until they are cancelled as described on the Site.Additionally, the use of various Payment Methods offered through the Site and the Site Services may incur added fees or charges.

<b>Tiered Pricing</b>We will charge you a Service Fee based on the total Freelancer Fees collected by you from your Client (less any refunds or reversals) for the duration of your relationship with your Client (the “<strong>Engagement Relationship</strong>”).
Unless different pricing described in Section 2.2, 2.3, or 2.4 applies, the Service Fee rates decrease as the total Freelancer Fees you have collected from your Client for the Engagement Relationship meet certain thresholds as follows (“<strong>Tiered Pricing</strong> ”):<b> TOTAL FREELANCER FEES COLLECTED FROM CLIENT</b>

For example, if the Freelancer has collected a total of $15,000 in Freelancer Fees during the Engagement Relationship and the Freelancer and Client enter into a new Fixed-Price Contract for $1,000, the Service Fee would be determined as follows:<br>

INFORMATION COLLECTION</b>Users of the Service may be <b>Clients</b>, <b>Freelancers</b>, or <b>Agencies</b> (as each is defined in the <u>User Agreement</u>).
<b>
<i>Information You Provide to Us</i>
</b>
<i>When you use the Service, you may provide us with information about you.
This may include your name and contact information, financial information to make or receive payment for services obtained through the Upwork platform, or information to help us fill out tax forms.
When you use the Service, we may also collect information related to your use of the Service and aggregate this with information about other users.
This helps us improve our Services for you.
You may also provide us with information about your contacts or friends if, for example, you’d like to add those contacts to a message room.
Agencies may also provide us with information about Freelancers associated with the Agency.</i>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Personal Information:</b> In the course of using the Service (whether as a Client or Freelancer or Agency), we may require or otherwise collect information that identifies you as a specific individual and can be used to contact or identify you (“<b>Personal Information</b>”).
Examples of Personal Information include your name, email address, company address, billing address, and phone number.
</li>
<li>
<b>Payment Information:</b> If you use the Service to make or receive payments, we will also collect certain payment information, such as credit card or other financial account information, and billing address.
</li>
<li>
<b>Identity Verification:</b> We may collect Personal Information, such as your date of birth or taxpayer identification number, to validate your identity or as may be required by law, such as to complete tax filings.
We may request documents to verify this information, such as a copy of your government-issued identification or photo or a billing statement.
</li>
<li>
<b>General Audience Service:</b> The Service is general audience and intended for users 18 and older.
We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from anyone younger than age 18.
If we become aware that a child younger than 18 has provided us with Personal Information, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete such information from our files.
If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child younger than age 18 and believe that Upwork has collected Personal Information from your child, please contact us at: <u>legalnotices@upwork.com</u>
<u>
</u>.
</li>
<li>
<b>Non-Identifying Information/Usernames:</b> We also may collect other information, such as zip codes, demographic data, information regarding your use of the Service, and general project-related data (“<b>Non-Identifying Information</b>”).
We may aggregate information collected from Upwork registered and non-registered users (“<b>Upwork Users</b>”).
In some cases, we may render Personal Information (generally, email address) into a form of Non-Identifying Information referred to in this Privacy Policy as “<b>Hashed Information</b>.” This is typically accomplished using a mathematical process (commonly known as a hash function) to convert information into a code.
The code does not identify you directly, but it may be used to connect your activity and interests.</li>
<li>
<b>Combination of Personal and Non-Identifying Information:</b> Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers in a way that enables you to be identified (for example, combining information with your name).
But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your viewing preferences).
We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information, but Upwork will treat the combined information as Personal Information.
</li>
<li>
<b>Collection of Third Party Personal Information:</b> We collect the following personal information from you about your contacts or friends: First name, last name, and email address when you provide it to us for the purpose of adding your contacts to a message room.
</li>
</ul>You do not have a statutory obligation to provide us with any information, but you may have a contractual obligation to do so, and if we do not receive certain information from you, then we will not be able to provide our Service to you.
If you have any questions regarding whether provision of information is mandatory and the consequences for withholding such information, please contact us using the contact information below.<b>
<i>Information Received from Third Parties</i>
</b>
<b>
</b>
<i>Third parties may also give us information about you.
If we combine that information with information about you collected through the Service, we will still treat that combined information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
</i>We also may receive information about you from third parties.
For example, we may supplement the information we collect with outside records or third parties may provide information in connection with a co-marketing agreement or at your request (such as if you choose to sign in with a third-party service).
If we combine the information we receive from others with information we collect through the Service, we will treat the combined information as described in this Privacy Policy.<b>
<i>Information Collected Automatically</i>
</b>
<i>Like other online companies, we receive technical information when you use our Services.
We use these technologies to analyze how people use the Service, to improve how our Site functions, to save your log-in information for future sessions, and to serve you with advertisements that may interest you.</i>We and our third party service providers, including analytics and third party content providers, may automatically collect certain information from you whenever you access or interact with the Service.
This information may include, among other information, the browser and operating system you are using, the URL or advertisement that referred you to the Service, the search terms you entered into a search engine that led you to the Service, areas within the Service that you visited, which links you clicked on, which pages or content you viewed and for how long, other similar information and statistics about your interactions, such as content response times, download errors and length of visits to certain pages and other information commonly shared when browsers communicate with websites.
We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.
We do this to improve services we offer you, and to improve marketing, analytics, and site functionality.The information we collect also includes the Internet Protocol (“<b>IP</b>”) address or other unique device identifier (“<b>Device Identifier</b>”) for any device (computer, mobile phone, tablet, etc.) used to access the Service.
A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned or connected to the device you use to access the Service, and our servers identify your device by its Device Identifier.
Some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third party service providers with information regarding the physical location of the device used to access the Service.<b>
<i>Upwork and its partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movement around the website, the desktop app, and the mobile app, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
The technology used to collect information automatically from Upwork Users may include the following:</i>
</b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Cookies: </b>Like many websites, we and our marketing partners, affiliates, analytics, and service providers use “cookies” to collect information.
A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes.
We use both persistent cookies that remain on your computer or similar device (such as to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Service and to track your compliance with the Upwork Terms of Service) and session ID cookies, which expire at the end of your browser session (for example, to enable certain features of the Service, to better understand how Upwork Users interact with the Service and to monitor aggregate usage by Upwork Users and web traffic routing on the Service).
You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functionality of the Service.
For further information on cookies and how they are used for the Service, please visit our Cookie Policy at <u>https://www.upwork.com/legal#cookie-policy.</u>
</li>
<li>
<b>Web Beacons: </b>We and our marketing partners, affiliates, analytics, and service providers may also employ software technology known as “web beacons” and/or “tracking tags” to help us keep track of what content on our Service is effective and to serve relevant advertising to you.
Web beacons are small graphics with a unique identifier that may be invisible to you, and which are used to track the online activity of Internet users.
Web beacons are embedded in the web pages you review or email messages you receive.
Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to our Service, to monitor how Upwork Users navigate the Service, to count how many emails that were sent were actually opened, or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.
</li>
<li>
<b>Embedded Scripts:</b> We and our marketing partners, affiliates, analytics, and service providers may also employ software technology known as an Embedded Script.
An Embedded Script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Service, such as the links you click on.
The code is temporarily downloaded onto your computer or other device and is deactivated or deleted when you disconnect from the Service.
</li>
</ul>In addition, we and our marketing partners, affiliates, analytics, and service providers may use a variety of other technologies (such as tags) that collect similar information for security and fraud detection purposes and we may use third parties to perform these services on our behalf.<b>
<i>HOW WE RESPOND TO DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS</i>
</b>
<i>Upwork does not respond to Do-Not-Track signals.</i>Please note that your browser setting may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to websites and online services you visit.
There is no consensus among industry participants as to what “Do Not Track” means in this context.
Like many websites and online services, Upwork does not alter its practices when it receives a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor’s browser.
To find out more about “Do Not Track,” please visit <u>http://www.allaboutdnt.com</u>.<b>
<i>The General Data Protection Regulation: Data Processing Agreement</i>
</b>To streamline compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), Upwork has posted a <u>Data Processing Agreement (“DPA”)</u> governing the relationship between the Customer (as defined in the DPA) acting as a data controller or processor, as applicable (and as defined in the DPA), of personal data under European Data Protection Legislation.
and Upwork (acting as a data processor or subprocessor, as applicable).Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by you and Upwork, to the extent Upwork processes any EU personal data for you as a controller (as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679) in your role as a Customer, the Data Processing Agreement applies.<b>
<i>Work Diaries and Work View</i>
</b>
<br>
<i>We collect information about a Freelancer’s work for a Client, including automatically collected information about work on a particular project.
If a Freelancer enables Work Diaries, we will share Work Diaries with the relevant Client and Agency.
We tell Freelancers when we are capturing information for the Work Diary and allow Freelancers to block such data sharing.</i>As part of the Service, when enabled by a Freelancer, we collect information about a Freelancer’s work on a project for a Client.
This feature is known as Work Diary.
Work Diaries include information provided by the Freelancer, such as a memo, as well as automatically gathered information about work on a project, such as number of mouseclicks and keyboard strokes and regularly taken screenshots (which may include a webcam picture of you if you have enabled this feature in your settings).
In order to use Work Diaries, you must download and install the Team App software from <u>www.upwork.com</u>.We will share information contained in Work Diaries with the relevant Client and with any manager or administrator of any applicable Freelancer Agency.
We inform Freelancers each time we capture information for Work Diary.
As set forth in our Terms of Service, End User License Agreement, and help pages on the Site, a Freelancer may choose to block or delete the screen shot and associated data for a recorded work interval, but then the Freelancer may not be paid for that work interval.
Upwork may use de-identified or aggregated information from Work Diaries for statistical analysis, product development, marketing and research.<b>
<i>User Profiles</i>
</b>
<i>Freelancers may create a profile, with certain or all information publicly available.
Clients and Agencies may also create organization profiles.</i>You may have the opportunity to create a profile, which consists of information about you, and may include Personal Information, photographs, examples of your work, information on work previously performed via the Service and outside the Service, skills, tests taken, test scores, hourly pay rates and earnings information, feedback/rating information and other information, including your username (“<b>Profile</b>”).
The information in your Profile may be visible to all Upwork Users and the general public subject to the privacy choices you make within your Upwork Profile.
You may edit certain information in your Profile via your account and may choose to limit who is able to view certain content you post to your Profile.
Clients and Agencies of associated individual users or companies may also have the opportunity to create an organization Profile.
If, in any case, you believe that an unauthorized profile has been created about you, you can request for it to be removed by contacting us at <u>https://support.upwork.com</u> or legalnotices@upwork.com.<b>
<i>Identity Verification</i>
</b>
<i>We place a premium on trust in our Service, so we may take steps to verify your identity.</i>Before a Freelancer can complete registration on the Service, or at any time thereafter, we may request or re-request identity verification.
Without limiting the manner in which we request identify verification, we may require Freelancers to participate in a video call after submitting their government issued ID to enable us to confirm that the Freelancer is indeed the individual in the ID.
We may record such video calls and take screenshots of the user during the call.
Upwork may use the information obtained from Identity Verification for purposes of verifying your identity, enforcing our Terms of Service and other agreements, and preventing fraud.<b>
<i>Messaging</i>
</b>Freelancers, Agencies, and Clients may communicate with each other through the Service.
For example, Freelancers, Agencies, and Clients may wish to discuss Client needs and Freelancer work proposals.
If you communicate with an Agency or Client, that Agency or Client will also be a “data controller” with respect to such communications.<b>
<i>Community Forums</i>
</b>
<i>We may offer public forums or blogs.
If you participate, your comments and questions will be publicly displayed.</i>The Service may provide you the opportunity to participate and post content publicly in forums, on blogs, through interactive features on Upwork and through other communication functionality (“<b>Community Forums</b>”).

Please note that your use of Community Forums is subject to the Upwork Forum Rules and our Terms of Service.<b>Note that anything you post to a Community Forum is public <i>— </i>others will have access to your User Forum Content and may use it or share it with third parties.
If you choose to voluntarily disclose Personal Information in your User Forum Content or use Community Forums to link to your Profile, that information will be considered public information and the protections of this Privacy Policy will not apply</b>.<i>To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at </i>

With your consent we may post your testimonial along with your name.
If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at https://support.upwork.com or legalnotices@upwork.com.<b>

<i>Social Networking Services</i>
</b>
<i>You may register for an account directly with our Site, or through a social networking service.
If you register with a social networking service (or later link your account to one), we will collect certain information about you from that social networking service, and what we collect depends on your privacy settings with that social networking service.
The Service may also allow you to “like” or share content with social networking services.</i>You may register to join the Service directly via the Service or by logging into your account with a third party social networking service (“<b>SNS</b>”) via our Service (e.g., Facebook, Github and other third party services that let you sign in using your existing credentials with those services).

Other than what we may share with the SNS as described below, the Personal Information an SNS has about you is obtained by the SNS independent of our Service, and Upwork is not responsible for it.The Upwork Service also may permit additional interactions between it and a third party website, service, or other content provider, such as enabling you to “like” or share content to a third party SNS.
If you choose to “like” or share content, or to otherwise share information from or via our Service with a third party site or service, that information may be publicly displayed, and the third party may have access to information about you and your use of our Service (and we may have access to information about you from that third party).
These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.
Your interactions with third parties through an SNS or similar features are governed by the respective privacy policies of those third parties.You represent that you are entitled to use your SNS account for the purposes described herein without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern the SNS, and without obligating Upwork to pay any fees or making Upwork subject to any usage limitations imposed by such SNS.
You can disable the link between your Upwork account and your SNS account at any time through the “Settings” section of our Service.
Please note that your relationship with any SNS is governed solely by your agreement(s) with such SNS.
If your SNS account terminates, then functions enabled through the link between your Upwork account and your SNS account will terminate as well.<b>2.

Subscriber acknowledges and agrees that in the event Subscriber fails to approve or reject a submitted milestone approval request within such 14 calendar day period, then (i) the Freelancer Services or Freelancer Work Product reflected in the milestone approval request will be deemed irrevocably accepted by Subscriber, and any payment associated with the milestone will be deemed irrevocably approved by Subscriber and (ii) Upwork will be authorized and instructed to make payment to Freelancer for such milestone.<strong>

If Subscriber decides to Upgrade or Downgrade (as those terms are defined below), then, in addition to such other terms as the parties may need to agree to in connection with such Upgrade or Downgrade, Subscriber authorizes and directs Upwork to migrate Freelancer contracts related to existing Engagements between service tiers by opening a new contract on the new service tier and then closing the old contract on the old service tier.
If no end date is indicated on the old contract, the new contract will be established with a six-month duration.
In the event the old contract is either (i) a fixed price contract with no incomplete milestones or (ii) an hourly contract that has not had payments made under it over the past six months, then the old contract will only be closed on the old service tier and a new contract will not be entered into on the new service tier.
Subscriber acknowledges that it may not be able to leave feedback for Freelancers for Engagements under contracts that are closed by Upwork pursuant to this provision.
For the purposes of this provision, <strong>“Upgrade”</strong> means Subscriber’s election to utilize the Platform in a higher service tier and <strong>“Downgrade”</strong> means Subscriber’s election to utilize the Platform in a lower service tier.

<li>
<strong>FEES AND PAYMENTS.</strong>

All amounts specified in the Order Form are in U.S.
dollars.
All amounts hereunder will be invoiced in, and must be paid in, U.S.
dollars.
The pricing during any Renewal Term will be the same as that during the prior Term period unless Upwork provides written notice of a price change at least 30 days before any renewal notice is due, in which case the pricing increase will be effective upon the commencement of the subsequent Renewal Term.
Billing for any pricing increases will commence in the month following the renewal month in which the Order Form was renewed.<strong>
</strong>3.3 <strong>Freelancer Service Fee</strong>.<strong>
</strong>Upwork normally charges Freelancers a fee stated on the Platform.
However, if a Freelancer is a BYO Freelancer or if the Freelancer is engaged via Upwork Payroll Services, Upwork will not charge such fee to the Freelancer for any work the Freelancer performs for Subscriber as a BYO Freelancer or via Upwork Payroll Services.<strong>
</strong>3.4 <strong>Fees Related to Upwork Payroll Services</strong>.
The flat rate Service Fees set forth in the Order Form for BYO Freelancers and Platform Freelancers only applies to Freelancers located in the United States who are engaged using Upwork Payroll Services.
A separate Upwork Payroll Fee, which varies by country, will apply to international Freelancer Engagements.
For Upwork Payroll Service Engagements with respect to Freelancers located outside of the United States, the Upwork Payroll Fee and all Employment-Related Costs will be provided to Subscriber for approval prior to the Employment Provider hiring the relevant Freelancer as further detailed in Section 6.3 (Upwork Payroll Services).3.5 <strong>Taxes</strong>.
All fees and charges payable in connection with this Agreement or an Order Form are exclusive of Taxes.
Subscriber will be responsible for promptly paying or reimbursing, as the case might be, all Taxes arising in connection with this Agreement (without any offset or deduction to the fees paid to Upwork).
For countries where Upwork is not registered to collect indirect Taxes (e.g., VAT or GST), Subscriber will pay such Taxes via reverse charge mechanism to the appropriate tax authority.
Subscriber will reimburse Upwork for any deficiency relating to Taxes that are Subscriber’s responsibility under this Agreement.
The parties will cooperate in good faith to minimize Taxes to the extent legally permissible and will provide each other with any applicable Tax exemptions or certificates as reasonably requested and notify the other party if any such exemption or certificate is subsequently revoked or modified.
If applicable, Subscriber shall communicate to Upwork its VAT or GST identification number(s) attributed by (i) the country where Subscriber has established its business or (ii) any other country where Subscriber has established a fixed establishment to which Upwork’s Services are provided.

Upon request, Subscriber shall promptly provide Upwork with proof of direct Tax payments made to applicable authorities.
Subscriber shall promptly pay or reimburse Upwork for all costs and fines related to any liability incurred by Upwork as a result of Subscriber’s non-compliance or delay with its responsibilities herein.

</strong>3.6 <strong>Purchase Order</strong>.
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, if Subscriber requires a purchase order to issue payment under this Agreement and Upwork has not received a copy of such purchase order, Upwork reserves the right to suspend Subscriber’s access to the Platform until such purchase order has been received.
If Subscriber requires a valid purchase order number to be attached to or entered in an invoice submission to Subscriber’s portal, but a valid purchase order has not been provided to Upwork in a timely manner, the net payment terms in the Service Order will be based on the date of the invoice generated by Upwork and not the date of invoice submission to Subscriber’s portal.<strong>
</strong>3.7 <strong>Non-Circumvention</strong>.
If Subscriber engages (or directs a third party to engage) the services of a Platform Freelancer that Subscriber found on the Platform through a source other than Upwork within two years after the date that such Platform Freelancer is first engaged by Subscriber or, if never engaged by Subscriber through the Platform, within two years after the Platform Freelancer is first identified by Subscriber on the Platform, then Subscriber agrees to pay Upwork $10,000 for each such Freelancer.
If upon Subscriber’s request, Upwork finds a Freelancer that was not on the Platform and Subscriber engages that Freelancer through a source other than Upwork, Subscriber agrees to pay Upwork $10,000 for each such Freelancer.
This provision does not apply to (i) BYO Freelancers or (ii) Freelancers responding independently and without direct solicitation to Subscriber’s indirect solicitations (such as employment agency referrals and internet job postings).<ol>

</strong>Upwork will determine the appropriate worker classification (e.g., independent contractor or employee) for each Engagement based on the information that Subscriber and Freelancer provide about the applicable Engagement between them.
Determining the proper classification for a Freelancer depends on many factors, including information in Subscriber’s control.
Subscriber will provide Upwork with all information requested that is related to the Engagement and the classification of a Freelancer in a timely, accurate, and complete manner and notify Upwork immediately if any such information changes.2.2.2 <strong>Freelancer Engagement</strong>.<strong>
</strong>Upwork will, based on its worker classification, either: (i) engage the Freelancer as an independent contractor, (ii) hire the Freelancer as an employee through Upwork Payroll Services, or (iii) if the classification is neither employment nor independent contractor, for example the “worker” classification in the United Kingdom, Upwork will engage the worker consistent with applicable law.
Upwork may delegate the Engagement of Freelancers (and other obligations regarding Freelancers under this Agreement) to one or more third parties.
Upwork and Employment Provider reserve the right not to engage or hire a Freelancer in their sole discretion.
Upwork will cause each Freelancer classified and engaged as an independent contractor to execute an Independent Contractor Agreement.
Upwork (through Employment Provider) will cause each Freelancer classified and hired as an employee to execute an employment agreement containing confidentiality and intellectual property assignment provisions consistent with this Agreement.2.2.3 <strong>Custom Requirements</strong>

2.2.5.1 <u>Freelancer Insurance Coverage.</u> Prior to the commencement of any Engagement with a project value of $75,000 or more based on the project value as stated in the project description or for Engagements that exceed $75,000 through the addition of milestones or as a result of the hours approved in a project extension by Subscriber, Upwork will verify that the Freelancer (or the Employment Provider for Engagements using the Upwork Payroll Service) has at least $1,000,000 USD of professional liability or errors and omissions liability insurance coverage in place unless this requirement is waived by Subscriber.
<br>
<br>2.2.5.2 <u>Dispute Process.</u> Before starting the Dispute Process (as described below), Subscriber shall use reasonable efforts to resolve any disputes with the Freelancer.
To start the “Dispute Process” where Upwork will attempt to help Subscriber and the Freelancer resolve the dispute relating to Freelancer Services, Freelancer Work Product, or payment of Freelancer fees, for any Engagement(s), provided that for each such Engagement Subscriber shall (i) for milestone work, provide notice to Upwork by email that reasonably asserts in good faith that the Freelancer Work Product or Freelancer Services do not match the description of work product or services agreed upon, within seven days of acceptance of the milestone provided by Freelancer (or before acceptance of the milestone), or (ii) for hourly work, provide notice to Upwork by email that reasonably disputes in good faith the number of hours billed by the Freelancer within seven days of the earlier of (a) the acceptance by Subscriber of the hours worked by Freelancer, or (b) the end of the Subscriber Review Period (the deadline described in romanettes (i) and (ii), as applicable, are referred to herein as the “Work Protection Dispute Deadline”).
Emails sent by Subscriber to Upwork in connection with the Dispute Process must be sent to work-protection-disputes@upwork.com.<br>
<br>If Subscriber, with Upwork’s assistance, is unable to resolve the dispute to its satisfaction, including specifically to recover amounts from the Freelancer in an amount satisfactory to Subscriber, Upwork will provide Subscriber with a credit to use on Upwork equal to the amount disputed in connection with the disputed Freelancer Services or Freelancer Work Product up to the total amount paid by Subscriber (including applicable Service Fees, but net of any monies returned or to be returned to Subscriber by the Freelancer) in connection with the disputed services or work product (the “Work Protection Credit”).
provided, however that Subscriber assigns in writing the right to Upwork to recover damages from the Freelancer.
By accepting the Work Protection Credit, Subscriber agrees that it thereby automatically assigns to Upwork the right to recover damages from the Freelancer to the extent of the amount of the Work Protection Credit.
To the extent that Subscriber is harmed beyond the amount of the Work Protection Credit, Subscriber retains the right to pursue recovery of any excess damages from the Freelancer.
The Work Protection Credit will be provided at the “Team” level in Subscriber’s account or to Subscriber’s general account if no “Team” exists and will expire upon the earlier of (a) three months after the provision of such credit in Subscriber’s account or (b) termination of the Agreement.<br>
<br>2.2.5.3 <u>Limitations on Work Protection.
</u>The Work Protection Program does not apply to Freelancer Work Product or Freelancer Services provided by BYO Freelancers or in cases where Subscriber has waived the insurance requirement described in Section 2.2.5.1 (Freelancer Insurance Coverage).
For avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that (i) Freelancers are solely responsible for Freelancer Services and Freelancer Work Product.
and (ii) the Work Protection Program is provided to Subscriber as a monetary remedy only and no guarantee is being made by Upwork with respect to Freelancer Work Product or Freelancer Services.
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, Upwork (a) is not obligated to provide the credits described in this Section and may terminate this Agreement with 30 days prior notice to Subscriber if Upwork reasonably determines that allegations made by Subscriber under the Work Protection Program have not been made in good faith, and (b) is not obligated to provide the credits in this Section if Subscriber does not start the Dispute Process by the Work Protection Dispute Deadline.<br>

In any arbitration under the JAMS Employment Arbitration Rules and Procedures, Freelancer will pay JAMS arbitration fees only to the extent those fees are no greater than the filing or initial appearance fees applicable to court actions in the jurisdiction where the arbitration will be conducted, with UTG to make up the difference, if any.
The arbitrator must follow applicable law and may award only those remedies that would have applied had the matter been heard in court.

Class and Collective Action Waiver</strong>
<strong>Private attorney general representative actions under the California Labor Code are not arbitrable, not within the scope of this Arbitration Provision and may be maintained in a court of law.
However, this Arbitration Provision affects the Parties’ ability to participate in class or collective actions.
The Parties agree to bring any dispute in arbitration on an individual basis only, and not on a class or collective basis on behalf of others.
There will be no right or authority for any dispute to be brought, heard or arbitrated as a class or collective action, or as a member in any such class or collective proceeding (“Class Action Waiver”).
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the JAMS Rules, disputes regarding the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity or breach of the Class Action Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.
In any case in which (1) the dispute is filed as a class or collective action and (2) there is a final judicial determination that all or part of the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, the class or collective action to that extent must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the portion of the Class Action Waiver that is enforceable shall be enforced in arbitration.
Freelancer will not be retaliated against, disciplined or threatened with discipline as a result of exercising any rights under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, if applicable, by filing or participating in a class or collective action in any forum.
However, any Party may lawfully seek enforcement of this Arbitration Provision and the Class Action Waiver under the Federal Arbitration Act and seek dismissal of such class or collective actions or claims.

In any arbitration under the JAMS Employment Arbitration Rules and Procedures, Freelancer will pay JAMS arbitration fees only to the extent those fees are no greater than the filing or initial appearance fees applicable to court actions in the jurisdiction where the arbitration will be conducted, with UTG to make up the difference, if any.
The arbitrator must follow applicable law and may award only those remedies that would have applied had the matter been heard in court.

This Arbitration Provision also does not apply to claims for workers compensation, state disability insurance or unemployment insurance benefits.
Either Freelancer or UTG may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for provisional injunctive relief in connection with an arbitrable controversy, but only upon the ground that the award to which that party may be entitled may be rendered ineffectual without such relief.

Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, U.S.
Department of Labor, U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, National Labor Relations Board, or Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs.

Nothing in this Arbitration Provision prevents or excuses a party from satisfying any conditions precedent and/or exhausting administrative remedies under applicable law before bringing a claim in arbitration.
UTG will not retaliate against Freelancer for filing a claim with an administrative agency or for exercising rights (individually or in concert with others) under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act.<strong>b.
Interpretation and Enforcement of this Arbitration Provision</strong>This Arbitration Provision is the full and complete agreement relating to the formal resolution of Claims and replaces all prior agreements between Freelancer and UTG regarding the arbitration of disputes covered by this Arbitration Provision.

All such matters will be decided by an arbitrator and not by a court.
In the event any portion of this Arbitration Provision is deemed unenforceable, the remainder of this Arbitration Provision will be enforceable.
If any portion of the Class Action Waiver in subsection c, below, of this Arbitration Provision is deemed to be unenforceable, the Parties agree that this Arbitration Provision will be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.
<strong>c.
Class and Collective Action Waiver</strong>
<strong>Private attorney general representative actions under the California Labor Code are not arbitrable, not within the scope of this Arbitration Provision and may be maintained in a court of law.
However, this Arbitration Provision affects the Parties’ ability to participate in class or collective actions.
The Parties agree to bring any dispute in arbitration on an individual basis only, and not on a class or collective basis on behalf of others.
There will be no right or authority for any dispute to be brought, heard or arbitrated as a class or collective action, or as a member in any such class or collective proceeding (“Class Action Waiver”).
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the JAMS Rules, disputes regarding the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity or breach of the Class Action Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.
In any case in which (1) the dispute is filed as a class or collective action and (2) there is a final judicial determination that all or part of the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, the class or collective action to that extent must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the portion of the Class Action Waiver that is enforceable shall be enforced in arbitration.
Freelancer will not be retaliated against, disciplined or threatened with discipline as a result of exercising any rights under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, if applicable, by filing or participating in a class or collective action in any forum.
However, any Party may lawfully seek enforcement of this Arbitration Provision and the Class Action Waiver under the Federal Arbitration Act and seek dismissal of such class or collective actions or claims.
