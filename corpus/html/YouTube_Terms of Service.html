<p>If we reasonably believe that any Content is in breach of this Agreement or&nbsp;may cause harm to YouTube, our users, or third parties, we may remove or take down that Content in our discretion.&nbsp;We will notify you with the reason for our action unless we reasonably believe that to do so: (a) would breach the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority or would otherwise risk legal liability for YouTube or our Affiliates.

<b>Terminations by YouTube for Service Changes</b>
</p>
<p>YouTube may terminate your access, or your Google account’s access to all or part of the Service if YouTube believes, in its sole discretion, that provision of the Service to you is no longer commercially viable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>Notice for Termination or Suspension</b>
</p>
<p>We will notify you with the reason for termination or suspension by YouTube unless we reasonably believe that to do so: (a) would violate the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority, or would otherwise risk legal liability for YouTube or our Affiliates.
(b) would compromise an investigation or the integrity or operation of the Service.
or (c) would cause harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates.
Where YouTube is terminating your access for Service changes, where reasonably possible, you will be provided with sufficient time to export your Content from the Service.</p>
<p>
<b>Effect of Account Suspension or Termination</b>
</p>
<p>If your Google account is terminated or your Google account’s access to the Service is restricted, you may continue using certain aspects of the Service (such as viewing only) without an account, and this Agreement will continue to apply to such use.
If you believe your Google account has been terminated in error, you can appeal using this form.</p>
