<p>We also use cookies to collect information about you.
A “cookie” is a small data file stored on your web browser or on your mobile device that allows us to recognize your computer or mobile device when you visit the Sites by associating identification numbers with other user information you have provided us.
Some cookies will remain on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device for the duration of your browser or user session, while others will remain until deleted by you.
You may also be able to configure your computer or mobile device to limit the collection of these “cookies,” but that limitation may also limit our ability to provide all the services or functionality of the Sites.

Information Security<p>We adopt appropriate data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of your Personal Information and data stored on our Sites.
These safeguards vary based on the sensitivity of the information that we collect and store.
For example, we store usernames, passwords, PINs, and other log-in information in encrypted form.
However, we cannot and do not guarantee that these measures will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use, or disclose your information because despite our efforts, no internet and/or other electronic transmissions can be completely secure.</p>

You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account username and password.
If you believe that your account username and/or password have been stolen or been made known to others, it is your responsibility to immediately contact us at Privacy@Newdayusa.com and change your password.
