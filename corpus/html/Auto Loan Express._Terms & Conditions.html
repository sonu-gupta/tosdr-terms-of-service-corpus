<p>Consumer Disclosures</p>
<ol>
<li>The Fair Credit Reporting Act allows you to obtain a disclosure from every credit reporting agency of the nature and substance of all information in your file at the time of the request.
Full disclosure of information in your file at Equifax must be obtained directly from Equifax by logging on to https://help.equifax.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/15.
The credit report you are requesting from us is not intended to constitute the disclosure of Equifax information required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act or similar state laws.</li>
<li>You are entitled to receive a disclosure directly from each of the consumer reporting agencies free of charge under the following circumstances:</li>
<ul>
<li>You have been denied credit, insurance or employment within the past sixty (60) days as a result of your credit report;</li>
<li>You certify in writing that you are unemployed and intend to apply for employment in the 60-day period beginning on the date on which you made the certification;</li>
<li>You are a recipient of public welfare assistance;</li>
<li>You have reason to believe that your file at the agency contains inaccurate information due to fraud;</li>
<li>Annually at www.annualcreditreport.com.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<p>Otherwise, the consumer reporting agency may impose a
reasonable charge for the disclosure.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Fair Credit Reporting Act permits you to dispute inaccurate or incomplete information in your credit file.
You understand that accurate information cannot be changed.</li>
<li>You do not have to purchase your credit report or other information from us to dispute inaccurate or incomplete information in your Equifax file or to receive a copy of your Equifax consumer credit report.</li>
<li>Equifax Information Services, LLC provides a proprietary consumer disclosure that is different from the consumer credit report provided through this site.
The disclosure report must be obtained directly from Equifax.
Consumers residing in the States of Colorado, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, and Vermont may receive a free copy of their consumer credit report once per year and residents of the State of Georgia may receive two copies per year.</li>

<p>Your Rights Under State and Federal Law</p>
<ul>
<li>You have a right to dispute inaccurate information in your credit report by contacting the credit bureau directly.
However, neither you nor any "credit repair" company or credit repair organization has the right to have accurate, current, and verifiable information removed from your credit report.
The credit bureau must remove accurate, negative information from your report only if it is over 7 years old.
Bankruptcy information can be reported for 10 years.</li>
<li>You have a right to obtain a copy of your credit report from a credit bureau.
You may be charged a reasonable fee.
There is no fee, however, if you have been turned down for credit, employment, insurance, or a rental dwelling because of information in your credit report within the preceding 60 days.
The credit bureau must provide someone to help you interpret the information in your credit file.
You are entitled to receive a free copy of your credit report if you are unemployed and intend to apply for employment in the next 60 days, if you are a recipient of public welfare assistance, or if you have reason to believe that there is inaccurate information in your credit report due to fraud.</li>
<li>You have a right to sue a credit repair organization that violates the Credit Repair Organization Act.
This law prohibits deceptive practices by credit repair organizations.</li>
<li>You have the right to cancel your contract with any credit repair organization for any reason within 3 business days from the date you signed it.</li>
<li>Credit bureaus are required to follow reasonable procedures to ensure that the information they report is accurate.
However, mistakes may occur.</li>
<li>You may, on your own, notify a credit bureau in writing that you dispute the accuracy of information in your credit file.
The credit bureau must then reinvestigate and modify or remove inaccurate or incomplete information.
The credit bureau may not charge any fee for this service.
Any pertinent information and copies of all documents you have concerning an error should be given to the credit bureau.</li>
<li>If the credit bureau's reinvestigation does not resolve the dispute to your satisfaction, you may send a brief statement to the credit bureau, to be kept in your file, explaining why you think the record is inaccurate.
The credit bureau must include a summary of your statement about disputed information with any report it issues about you.</li>

<p>Our Remedies.
You acknowledge that we may be irreparably
damaged if this Agreement is not specifically enforced, and damages at law
would be an inadequate remedy.
Therefore, in the event of a breach or
threatened breach of any provision of this Agreement by you, we shall be
entitled, in addition to all rights and remedies, to an injunction restraining
such breach or threatened breach, without being required to show any actual
damage or to post an injunction bond, and/or to a decree for specific performance
of the provisions of this Agreement.
For purposes of this Section, you agree
that any action or proceeding with regard to such injunction restraining such
breach or threatened breach shall be brought in the courts of record of Palm
Beach County, Florida, or the United States District Court, Southern District
of Florida.
You consent to the jurisdiction of such court and waive any
objection to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in such
court.
You agree that service of any court paper may be effected on such party
by mail or in such other manner as may be provided under applicable laws, rules
of procedure or local rules.</p>
<p>Legal Disputes.
You and we agree that any claim or dispute at
law or equity that has arisen or may arise between us relating in any way to or
arising out of this or previous versions of this Agreement, your use of or
access to the Services will be resolved in accordance with the provisions set
forth in this Legal Disputes section.
Please read this section carefully.
It
affects your rights and will have a substantial impact on how claims you and we
have against each other are resolved.</p>
<p>Applicable Law.
You agree that the laws of the State of
Florida, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern this Agreement
and any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and us,
except as otherwise stated in this Agreement.</p>
<p>Agreement to Arbitrate.
You and we each agree that any and
all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and us
relating in any way to or arising out of this or previous versions of this
Agreement, your use of or access to our Services, or any products or services
sold, offered, or purchased through our Services shall be resolved exclusively
through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you
may assert claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify.
The Federal
Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to
Arbitrate section (this "Agreement to Arbitrate").</p>
<p>1.
Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and
Non-Individualized Relief</p>
<p>YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE
OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY
PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.
UNLESS BOTH YOU AND US
AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE
PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A
CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING.
ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY
AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN
FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY
TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).
ANY RELIEF
AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OUR OTHER USERS.</p>
<p>2.
Arbitration Procedures</p>
<p>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.
There
is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is
very limited.
However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on
an individual basis that a court can award to an individual.
An arbitrator
should apply the terms of this Agreement as a court would.</p>
<p>The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or
agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising out of or
relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of
this Agreement to Arbitrate, any part of it, or of this Agreement including,
but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of the Agreement to
Arbitrate or this Agreement is void or voidable.</p>
<p>The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration
Association ("AAA") under its rules and procedures, including the
AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (as applicable),
as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate.
The AAA's rules are available at
www.adr.org.
A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the
AAA's site at http://www.adr.org.</p>
<p>The arbitration shall be held in the county in which you
reside or at another mutually agreed location.
If the value of the relief
sought is $10,000 or less, you or we may elect to have the arbitration
conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election
shall be binding on you and us subject to the arbitrator's discretion to
require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant.
Attendance at an
in-person hearing may be made by telephone by you and/or us, unless the
arbitrator requires otherwise.</p>
<p>The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in
accordance with the laws of the State of Florida, including recognized
principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law.
The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving
our other users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the
same user to the extent required by applicable law.
The arbitrator's award
shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator
may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>
<p>3.
Costs of Arbitration</p>
<p>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees
will be governed by the AAA's rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement
to Arbitrate.
If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your
request, we will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated
with the arbitration.
Any request for payment of fees by us should be submitted
by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and we will make arrangements
to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA.
If the value of the relief
sought is more than $10,000 and you are able to demonstrate that the costs of
arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will
pay as much of the filing, administration, and arbitrator fees as the
arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being
cost-prohibitive.
In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you
assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse us for all
fees associated with the arbitration paid by us on your behalf, which you
otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA's rules.</p>
<p>4.
Severability</p>
<p>With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 1 of
this Agreement to Arbitrate ("Prohibition of Class and Representative
Actions and Non-Individualized Relief"), if an arbitrator or court decides
that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the
other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply.
If an arbitrator
or court decides that any of the provisions in Section 1 of this Agreement to
Arbitrate ("Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and
Non-Individualized Relief") is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety
of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall be null and void.
The remainder of the
Agreement and its Legal Disputes Section will continue to apply.</p>
<p>5.
Future Changes to the Agreement to Arbitrate</p>
<p>Notwithstanding any provision in the Agreement to the
contrary, you and we agree that if we make any change to this Agreement to
Arbitrate (other than a change to any notice address or site link provided
herein) in the future, that change shall not apply to any claim that was filed
in a legal proceeding against us prior to the effective date of the change.
The
change shall apply to all other disputes or claims governed by the Agreement to
Arbitrate that have arisen or may arise between you and us.
We will notify you
of changes to this Agreement to Arbitrate by posting the amended terms on our Services
at least 30 days before the effective date of the changes and/or by email.</p>
<p>Judicial Forum for Legal Disputes</p>
<p>Unless you and we agree otherwise, in the event that the
Agreement to Arbitrate above is found not to apply to you or to a particular
claim or dispute as a result of a decision by the arbitrator or a court order,
you agree that any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you
and us must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in Palm
Beach County, Florida.
You and us agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction
of the courts located within Palm Beach County, Florida for the purpose of
litigating all such claims or disputes.
You also agree that: (i) our Services
shall be deemed solely based in the State of Florida.
and (ii) our Services
shall be deemed passive Services that do not give rise to personal jurisdiction
over us and our assigns, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other
than the State of Florida.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous.
If any portion of this Agreement is deemed
unlawful, void or unenforceable by any arbitrator or court of competent
jurisdiction, this Agreement as a whole shall not be deemed unlawful, void or
unenforceable, but only that portion of this Agreement that is unlawful, void
or unenforceable shall be stricken from this Agreement.</p>
<p>The headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience
of reference only, are not to be considered a part of this Agreement, and shall
not limit or otherwise affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement.</p>
<p>All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties
made in this Agreement, as may be amended by us, from time to time, shall
survive your acceptance of this Agreement and the termination of this
Agreement.</p>
<p>This Agreement and the Privacy Policy represent the entire
understanding and agreement between you and us regarding the subject matter of
the same, and supersede all other previous agreements, understandings and/or
representations regarding the same.</p>
