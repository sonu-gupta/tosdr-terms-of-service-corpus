<p>26.2	<strong>We do not exclude or limit in any way our liability to you where it would be unlawful to do so.
</strong>This includes liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence, or the negligence of our employees, agents or subcontractors, or for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>26.3	<strong>When we are liable for damage to your property.</strong> If defective digital content that we have supplied damages a device or digital content belonging to you, we will either repair the damage or, at our option, pay you compensation.
However, we will not be liable for damage that you could have avoided by following our advice to apply an update offered to you free of charge, or for damage that was caused by you failing to correctly follow installation instructions, or to have in place the minimum system requirements advised by us.</p>
<p>26.4	<strong>We are not liable for business losses.</strong> The App is for domestic, and private use.
If you use the App for any commercial, business, or resale purpose we will have no liability to you for any loss of profit, loss of business, business interruption, or loss of business opportunity.</p>
<p>26.5	<strong>Limitations to the App and the Services.
</strong>The App, and the Services are provided for purposes of automating card selection processes in order to obtain applicable benefits under each of your personal cards, based on which card is deemed by VitraCash, at its discretion, to be the most appropriate with respect to an individual purchase (“<strong>Purpose</strong>”).
Advice on which you should rely is not offered by means of the App or by VitraCash.
You must obtain professional or specialist advice before taking, or refraining from, any action on the basis of information obtained from the App, or the Service.
Although we make reasonable efforts to update the information provided by the App and the Service, we make no representations, warranties or guarantees, whether express or implied, that such information is accurate, complete or up to date.</p>
<p>26.6	<strong>Please back-up content and data used with the App.</strong> We recommend that you back up any content and data used in connection with the App, to protect yourself in case of problems with the App, or the Service.</p>
<p>26.7	<strong>Check that the App and the Services are suitable for you.</strong> The App, and the Services have not been developed to meet your individual requirements.
Please check that the facilities, and functions of the App, and the Services (as described on the App Store) meet your requirements.</p>
<p>26.8	<strong>We are not responsible for events outside our control.</strong> If our provision of the Services, or support for the App, or the Services, is delayed or otherwise impacted by an event outside our control then we will not be liable for any default that arises or may arise directly or indirectly from the same.&nbsp;</p>
<p>26.9	<strong>Use of the App at your own risk.</strong> The App, and the Services are provided for the Purpose.
You acknowledge that each card scheme (i.e.
the relevant scheme under which your personal cards form part) and each provider of such cards (i.e.
your personal bank) may update and/or change certain benefits relating to the card type, from time to time.
Vitracash will use best endeavours to ensure that the appropriate card is used in each transaction.
However, you agree and acknowledge that VitraCash makes such choice at its own discretion and shall not be liable to you for any losses you may suffer as a result of such choice being made by VitraCash (i.e.&nbsp;certain levels of interest being charged under a chosen credit card or failure to obtain a preferred benefit, such as travel insurance).
Accordingly, you give VitraCash full right to make the relevant card choice on your behalf without having to obtain your approval for each transaction undertaken utilising the Services.
Accordingly, you use the App at your own risk.</p>
<p>26.10	<strong>Liability of VitraCash is limited.
</strong>Subject to clause 26.2, the total liability of VitraCash (whether stated in this clause 23 or otherwise determined), whether in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise and whether in connection with this licence, the Service or any collateral contract, shall in no circumstances exceed a sum equal to the Fees paid during the six (6) month period immediately before the date on which the cause of action first arose.</p>
<p>26.11	<strong>Tax.
</strong>It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the payments you make or receive, and it is your responsibility to collect, report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority.
We are not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your Transactions, or for collecting, reporting or remitting any taxes arising from any Transaction.</p>
