access to information, in part or full.
&nbsp;These include, amongst others,
circumstances where:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Racing.com or RVL believe that giving access would pose a serious threat to the life, health or safety of any individual, or to public health or public safety.

</li>
<li> the information relates to existing or anticipated legal proceedings between Racing.com and the individual, and would not be accessible by the process of discovery in those proceedings.
</li>
<li> giving access would reveal evaluative information generated within Racing.com or RVL in connection with a commercially sensitive decision-making process.
</li>
<li> giving access would be likely to prejudice one or more enforcement related activities conducted by, or on behalf of an enforcement body.
</li>
<li> giving access would be unlawful (for example, if providing the information would amount to a breach of legal professional privilege or a breach of confidence).
or </li>
<li> denying access is required or authorised by or under an Australian law or a court/tribunal order.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If any request for access to information is denied in part or full or not

give the individual a written notice, setting out the reasons for the
refusal except to the extent that, having regard to the grounds for the
refusal, it would be unreasonable to do so.
