<p>
<b>Information Automatically Collected</b>
</p>
<p>We also may collect and store information that is generated automatically as you navigate through our Sites or Applications.</p>
<p>To make our Sites and Applications more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third-party service provider) may collect information from your computer or device, including but not limited to:<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>The date and time of your visit and the web pages and content you view and links you click on while navigating within our Sites or Applications;</li>
<li>Information about the type of content accessed via our Sites or Applications;</li>
<li>The site you visited before and after visiting our Sites;</li>
<li>Your Internet Protocol (IP) address (a numerical address assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider so that other computers connected to the Internet can communicate with you online) that can sometimes be used to derive your general geographic area;</li>
<li>Search terms you enter using our Sites or Applications;</li>
<li>Unique identifiers, including non-global mobile device identification numbers;</li>
<li>Information about your computer device such as your device type, screen size, browser type, language and other settings, memory capacity, plug-ins, Internet domain, TCP configuration parameters, operating system, carrier code, time zone and the names, versions and package IDs of software installed on your device.
and</li>
<li>Information collected through cookies, pixel tags and other tracking technologies (see additional descriptions of these terms below).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you allow our Application to have access to your location information and you have enabled location services on your phone, we collect your precise location information.</p>
<p>
<br>
<b>Information Collected from Third Parties</b>
</p>
<p>We may also collect information about you through non-affiliated third parties, such as market research firms and public sources.
Depending on the source, this information collected from third parties could include information such as demographic information and brand and media consumption information.
We may combine information that we collect about you through the Sites and Applications with information that we obtain from such third parties.</p>
<p>
<b>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</b>
</p>
<p>To help make the Sites and Applications more responsive to the needs of users, we employ a standard software feature, called a "cookie," to assign each user a unique, random number that resides on a user's computer or device.
The cookie by itself does not personally identify the user.
it merely identifies the computer or device with which the user accesses a Site or Application.
Cookies help us track user trends and patterns.
They also prevent you from having to re-enter your preferences on certain areas of a Site or Application where you have entered preference information before.</p>
<p>When we post videos, third parties may use local shared objects, known as flash cookies to store your preferences for volume control or to personalize certain video features.
Flash cookies are different from cookies because of the amount and type of data and how the data is stored.</p>
<p>We also may use web beacons (also known as "pixel tags") to access cookies and to count users who visit our Sites, use our Applications, or open our HTML-formatted e-mail messages.
Pixel tags are graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, that are used to track online movements of our users.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, pixel tags are embedded invisibly in web pages and e-mail messages.
We may collect information about your interactions with our e-mail messages, such as the links you click on and whether you open or forward a message, the date and time of these interactions and the device you use to read our e-mails.</p>
<p>Our website may also feature Nielsen proprietary measurement software, which will allow users to contribute to market research.
To learn more about the information that Nielsen software may collect and your choices with regard to it, please see the Nielsen Digital Measurement Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>
<b>Analytics Services</b>
</p>
<p>We use third-party analytics services (“Analytics Services”), to help analyze how users use our Sites and Applications.
The information generated by the cookies or other technologies about your use of our Sites and/or Applications (the “Analytics Information”) is transmitted to the Analytics Services.
The Analytics Services use Analytics Information to compile reports on user activity.
The Analytics Services may also transfer the Analytics Information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process Analytics Information on their behalf.
Each Analytics Service’s ability to use and share Analytics Information is restricted by such Analytics Service’s terms of use and privacy policy.
By using a Site or Application, you consent to the processing of data about you by Analytics Services in the manner and for the purposes set out above.
For a full list of our Analytics Services, please contact us at feedback@politico.com.</p>
<p>We also collect anonymized, cookie-based demographics data from third parties to analyze the composition of our audience.</p>
<p>
<br>
<b>Tailored Advertising</b>
</p>
<p>Our Site also makes use of various third-party cookie data collection and linking services.
POLITICO and third-party vendors, including Google, Teads and others, may use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the Google Ad Manager cookie) together to (i) inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to our website and (ii) report how your ad impressions, uses of ad services, and interactions with the foregoing are related to your visits to the Site.
In addition, we may use Google Analytics data, including but not limited to, geographic, demographics, and interest reporting information to recognize and understand user preferences, make improvements, and for other business purposes.
You can learn more about how Google manages data in its ads products, through which you can learn how to opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, by visiting the Google Ads Settings page.
Learn more about how Teads uses data.</p>
<p>We also may use third-party advertising companies to target and serve some of the advertisements that appear on our Sites and Applications, and these companies likewise may use their own cookies, web beacons and similar technologies to collect information about users of our Sites and Applications.
These companies may use that information, to deliver advertisements on this Site, and possibly on other websites (if the third-party advertising company operates an advertising network), tailored to match the perceived interests of consumers.
The collection and use of information by these companies is governed by the relevant third party's privacy policy and is not covered by our privacy policy.
If you would like more information about this practice, or if you would like information on how to opt out of these information collection practices, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link, the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link or European Digital Advertising Alliance Your Online Choices to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs.</p>
<p>
<br>
<b>Notice Concerning Do Not Track</b>
</p>
<p>Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.
We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third party purposes, and that is why we provide the variety of opt-out mechanisms listed above.
However, we do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals.

<br> Please read the following section carefully.
It requires you to arbitrate disputes with POLITICO LLC and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.
<br> (a) Scope of Arbitration Agreement.
You agree that any dispute or claim against POLITICO LLC, or its affiliates, subsidiaries, owners, officers, directors, employees, agents or representatives relating in any way to your access or use of the Site, to any products or services sold or distributed through the Site, or to any other aspect of your relationship with POLITICO LLC will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify, so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.
and (2) you or the POLITICO LLC may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents).
<br> (b) Initial Dispute Resolution.
Most disputes can be resolved without resort to litigation.
You can reach POLITICO LLC’s support department at legal@politico.com.
Except for intellectual property and small claims court claims, the parties agree to use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation with the POLITICO LLC support department, and good faith negotiations shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.<br> (c) Arbitration Rules and Forum.
You and POLITICO LLC agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce, and this Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act in all respects.
To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent, The Corporation Trust Company, Corporation Trust Center 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, New Castle County, Delaware 19801.
The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS under its rules and pursuant to the terms of these Terms.
Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/.
all other claims shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/.
JAMS’s rules are also available at www.jamsadr.com (under the Rules/Clauses tab) or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267.
Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitration fees will be governed by JAMS’s rules.
Where required by law, POLITICO LLC will pay your JAMS’ filing, administrative, hearing, and/or other fees, subject to reimbursement from you if the arbitrator finds your claims frivolous.
Likewise, POLITICO LLC will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.
You are responsible for your own attorneys’ fees unless applicable law provides otherwise.
If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.
You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone and/or based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location.
If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration may take place in the county where you reside at the time of filing.
For individuals residing outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the Commonwealth of Virginia, United States of America.
You and POLITICO LLC further agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in the Commonwealth of Virginia in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.(d) Arbitrator Powers.
The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement and these Terms including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.
The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and POLITICO LLC.
The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other proceedings or parties.
The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute.
The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and these Terms (including this Arbitration Agreement).
The arbitrator will issue a written statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which any award (or decision not to render an award) is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.
The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.
The arbitrator’s decision is final and binding on you and POLITICO LLC.<br> (e) Waiver of Jury Trial.
YOU AND POLITICO LLC WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND RECEIVE A JUDGE OR JURY TRIAL.
You and the POLITICO LLC are instead electing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration, except as specified in subsection (a) above.
An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow these Terms as a court would.
However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.
<br> (f) Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.
ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS.
CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.
If, however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor POLITICO LLC is entitled to arbitration.
Instead, all claims and disputes will then be resolved in a court as set forth in the section below entitled “Miscellaneous.” <br> (g) Opt Out.
You may opt out of this Arbitration Agreement.
If you do so, neither you nor POLITICO LLC can force the other party to arbitrate.
To opt out, you must notify POLITICO LLC in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement.
Your notice must include your name and address, your username (if any), the email address you used to set up your account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement.
You must send your opt-out notice to: Politico, 1000 Wilson Blvd., 8th Floor, Arlington, VA 22209, Attn Legal or legal@politico.com.
If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of these Terms will continue to apply to you.
Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter into in the future, with us.<br> (g) Survival.
This Arbitration Agreement will survive any termination of your relationship with the POLITICO LLC.<br> (h) Modification.
Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, we agree that if POLITICO LLC makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, it will not apply to any individual claim(s) that you had already provided notice of to us.
POLITICO LLC will provide thirty (30) days' notice of any changes affecting the substance of this Arbitration Agreement by posting on these Terms of Service, sending you a message, or otherwise notifying you when you are logged into your account.
Amendments will become effective thirty (30) days after they are posted on these Terms of Service or sent to you.</p>
<p>Changes to this section will otherwise apply prospectively only to claims arising after the thirtieth (30th) day.
If a court or arbitrator decides that this subsection on "Modification" is not enforceable or valid, then this subsection shall be severed from the section entitled “Arbitration Agreement,” and the court or arbitrator shall apply the first Arbitration Agreement section in existence after you began using the Site.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p> MISCELLANEOUS<p>
<br>Governing Law and Venue.
These Terms have been made in and shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.
To the extent the parties are permitted under these Terms to initiate litigation in a court, both you and POLITICO LLC agree that all claims and disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of the Site will be litigated exclusively in the state or federal courts located within the Commonwealth of Virginia.
</p>
<p>No Waiver.
Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
