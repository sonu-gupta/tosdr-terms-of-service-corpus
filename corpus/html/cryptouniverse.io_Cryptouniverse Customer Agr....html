CRYPTOUNIVERSE SERVICES<p>
<b>4.1.</b>Cryptouniverse provides you with Services via a Dashboard or any other resource, if so specified in the current agreement.</p>
<p>
<b>4.2.</b>The selection and ordering of the Services are carried out by the Customer in the Dashboard.
To order a Service, it is necessary to replenish the Customer’s Personal Account Balance with the minimum amount necessary to provide the Service or pay for the ordered Service using any other available options.</p>
<p>
<b>4.3.</b>The availability of a payment method depends on several factors including, for example, your location, the identification information you have provided to us, and limitations imposed by third party payment processors.</p>
<p>
<b>4.4.</b>The cost of the Services is determined by the tariffs published on the Cryptouniverse website.
The Customer confirms that they are acquainted and agree with the established tariffs.
Prices are listed in US Dollars, unless otherwise clearly indicated on the website.</p>
<p>
<b>4.5.</b>Unless the contrary is provided by the Terms, the Services shall be paid in advance for any number of months of Service use.
Services can be paid for in any manner available for selection in the Dashboard, including via an invoice.
The invoice is to be issued by the Customer in the Dashboard.
Services are only provided if there is a positive balance in the Customer's Personal Account Balance and there are no arrears on payments for the Services.</p>
<p>
<b>4.6.</b>The volume of received Services is determined solely by the Cryptouniverse credentials.
The basis for debiting amounts for the Services from the Customer’s Personal Account Balance is the data obtained using the equipment by the Cryptouniverse to record the volume of the rendered Services, as well as the fact that the Customer ordered the Services.</p>
<p>
<b>4.7.</b>Cryptouniverse has the right to change the tariffs and conditions for the provision of the Services for convenience with the mandatory notification of the Customer at least 15 (fifteen) calendar days before such a change.
In case of disagreement, the Customer undertakes to discontinue to use the Services from the date of the change in the cost of the Services and/or the Terms of the Services.</p>
<p>
<b>4.8.</b>The Customer is solely responsible for payment accuracy.
When the Cryptouniverse bank account details change, from the moment when the new requisites are published on the Cryptouniverse website, the Customer is solely responsible for payments made upon obsolete requisites other than those specified in the newly issued invoice.</p>
<p>
<b>4.9.</b>The fact of payment through the bank (using a bank transfer) is considered confirmed after the receipt of the relevant information from the Cryptouniverse bank and is the basis for replenishing the Customer’s Personal Account Balance</p>
<p>
<b>4.10.</b>The recording of the Services used by the Customer is carried out in accordance with the billing unit accepted by the Cryptouniverse.
The selection and ordering of the Services are carried out solely by the Customer in the Dashboard.
The rendering of the Service by Cryptouniverse begins at the time of its connection if there is a sufficient amount in the Customer's Personal Account Balance.
The exception is the Services, the provision of which requires a confirmation by Cryptouniverse in accordance with the Additional Terms of Use for Service.</p>
<p>
<b>4.11.</b>When a third party (payer) makes the payments instead of the Customer, the following conditions must be met:</p>
<p>
<b>4.11.1.</b>for an individual payer – provision of the power of attorney to represent the interests of the Customer;</p>
<p>
<b>4.11.2.</b>for a legal entity payer – specification in the payment order: "Payment for ...
(Customer's name), personal account number" in the “purpose of payment” field or provision of a written notification by the Payer about the offset payment for the Customer under these Terms.</p>
