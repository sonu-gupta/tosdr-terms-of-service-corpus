By registering domains with NameBright.com, you expressly agree and authorize NameBright.com to act as your Designated Agent as defined by ICANN's transfer policy.
You expressly agree and authorize NameBright.com to approve each change of registrant on your behalf.
When the prior registrant of a domain name requests that (a.) NameBright.com transfer their domain to another customer's NameBright.com account or (b.) to another ICANN accredited registrar, you are giving NameBright.com express permission to act as your Designated Agent and approve the requested transfer.
This includes approving the transfer on behalf of the prior registrant and/or the new registrant, as the transfer relates to the approval requirements of the transfer to or away from NameBright.com and or a NameBright account.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>a."<u>Designated Agent</u>" is defined as an individual or entity that the prior registrant OR the new registrant explicitly authorizes to approve a Change of Registrant on their behalf.</p>

<p>7.<b>Push of Domain Names</b>.
When domain name(s) are pushed between NameBright.com accounts, meaning that a domain is pushed from one NameBright.com account and into another NameBright.com account (not "transferred" between different registrars), the pushed domain name(s) will inherit the category settings of the NameBright.com account and category that is receiving the domain name(s).
If there are no category settings, the domain name(s) will take NameBright.com's default settings of auto-renew being "on".
Specifically, if the domain is being pushed into an account and category that has auto-renew settings set to "off", auto-renew settings for the domain will be turned "off".
Likewise, if the domain is pushed to an account and category with auto-renew settings set to "on", OR if there is no specific setting (and thus NameBright.com default settings apply), the pushed domain name(s) will take on the default auto-renew setting set to "on" for these domain name(s).
Even in a case where the account that initiated the push had an auto-renew setting of "off", auto-renew is treated by default as "on" for maximum user protection.
A NameBright customer will have the sole responsibility for maintaining all settings for all domain names in their account, this includes any renewal and payment settings such as auto-renew of each domain in the user's account.
There will be no refunds for customers who fail to maintain their desired domain renewal settings appropriately.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>11.<b>Provisions Concerning Specific TLD Registrations</b>.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<u>.Com</u>
<u> and .Net Registrations</u>.
You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the .COM and .NET Registry Operator, VeriSign, Inc., and its directors, officers, employees, agents, and affiliates from and against any and all claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses, including reasonable legal fees and expenses arising out of or relating to the Registered Name holder's domain name registration.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>12.<b>Registrar's Deletion and Auto-Renewal Policies</b>.</p>
<p>
<b>
</b>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<u>With auto-renew off</u>: Should you choose to disable the auto-renewal function in your NameBright account for any domain, and you have chosen to manually renew your domain each year, NameBright will make multiple attempts to notify you that the domain name is approaching its expiration date and that you will need to take steps to renew your domain.
NameBright will send you an email approximately one month prior to the domain name's expiration date.
This will be the first warning that your domain name is about to expire.
NameBright will then send another email approximately one week before the domain name's expiration date.
Finally, if the domain name is not renewed by the expiration date of the domain, NameBright will send a final notification about the domain name's expiration.
While not contracted to do so, NameBright may send more notifications in order to help protect its customers and to help prevent domain names from accidental expiration.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<u>With auto-renew on</u>: If you have auto-renew turned on you are asking NameBright to automatically charge the payment method(s) you have on file for the domain's yearly renewal fees.
NameBright will attempt to renew the domain based on the advanced setting "Domain Auto-Renewal" found in My Account &gt.
Settings &gt.
Advanced.
This setting will tell NameBright how many days before the domain name's expiration that the auto-renew should be processed.
The default setting for auto-renewal is 14-days prior to the domain name's expiration date.
When NameBright attempts to renew a domain with auto-renew on, it will first look for an available funded account balance, and then cycle through each of the credit cards on file in attempt to make the auto-renewal payment.
If these auto-renewal attempts fail, NameBright will send you an email notifying you of the auto-renewal failure and try to render payment again the following day.
You may need to take manual steps to remedy the payment method or to make payment for your domain renewal to be successful.
If your domain does not auto-renew within the designated number of days configured, the domain name will be allowed to expire due to non-payment by the auto-renewal.
Presuming you keep this setting at 14-days, this means you will receive 14 auto-renewal failure notices via email before the domain name expires.
While you can set your auto-renew setting to as little as 1-day, NameBright does not recommend this as a billing failure will mean the domain name will expire the following day, will become unusable, email will stop working and the respective website will go offline.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>If your domain expires, NameBright will send an email within 24 hours of the expiration occurring.
NameBright will also send a final email about your domain expiration one week after the domain name has expired, to give you a final notice your domain name is about to become available for someone else to register and use.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>13.<b>Expired Domain Process</b>.
Upon expiration of your domain name, your nameservers will be changed to expired1.namebrightdns.com and expired2.namebrightdns.com as is required by ICANN's ERRP (Expired Registration Recovery Policy).
During this time your domain will have all services interrupted (including but not limited to email, web hosting, ftp servers, etc.) During this expiration process you will be allowed to renew the domain for the standard renewal cost of that domain which is designated by the TLD's current price as reflected on NameBright.com at that time.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The registrant of an expired domain will be given no less than 30 days to pay for the renewal of the domain before the domain enters a Redemption Grace Period ("RGP").
Domain names at NameBright move from "expired" status to RGP status on the 30th day after a domain name's expiration date.
Due to processing constraints, on rare occasions this date might be up to 10 days later.
As a registrant you should expect this will happen on the 30th day after a domain name expires.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>NameBright has absolutely no liability for domains that were allowed to expire due to user error, non-payment, and billing failure.
NameBright will make reasonable attempts to provide ample notification to customers about potential domain name expirations when applicable, but NameBright is not liable in situations where a domain is allowed to expire for any reason.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>14.<b>Domain Deletion / Redemption Grace Period Recovery</b>.
If you fail to renew your domain through the end of the expiration of the domain (30 days from the domain name's expiration date) that domain will enter Redemption Grace Period (aka "RGP").
Once a domain enters RGP status you will have 30 days to "redeem" the domain at the standard redemption period price.
The cost to redeem a .com or .net domain from RGP is currently $85 per domain.
Non .com or .net domains will be charged $85, or the registry's redemption fee.
whichever cost is greater.
Any domain that goes beyond the 30-day Redemption Grace Period (in addition to the previous 30 days of auto-renew grace period) will be ineligible for redemption of any kind.
Meaning 60 days after the domain name's expiration date the registrant can no longer take any steps to recover a non-renewed domain.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>There are two processes in which domains will go through RGP at NameBright.com.
Registry Redemption Grace Period ("Registry RGP") and Registrar Redemption Grace Period ("Registrar RGP").
In the case of Registrar RGP, the domain name may be auctioned off or sold to third parties who have an interest in the domain beginning on the 30th day after the domain name has expired.
Should a third-party purchase rights to the domain, you will have exactly 30 days from the beginning of RGP to pay the redemption fee to have the domain name returned to you.
Should the redemption fee not be paid within 60 days after the domain name's expiration, the ownership of the domain will change hands and be irreversible.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In the case of Registry RGP, the domain name will be deleted and go through the registry's RGP process.
This period is mandated to be the 30 days immediately following the deletion of a registration.
Therefore, presuming the domain name is deleted at the registry on the 30th day after the domain name's expiration, you will have 30 days following that date to redeem the domain name for the standard redemption cost of $85.
Again, if you do not redeem a domain before the end of this redemption grace period, the domain will drop and become available for anyone to use.
In many cases, you can lose permanent rights and access to the domain.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In other words, <u>if the domain name is not renewed or redeemed within 60 days following the expiration, the domain will be irretrievable</u>.
During the first 30 days you can pay the basic renewal fee.
In the second 30 days the Redemption fee, for .com and .net domains this cost is $85.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>15.<b>Privacy Protection</b>.
If you choose to use privacy protection provided by NameBright you agree that you will not abuse the service and should any involvement / interaction be required on NameBright's behalf you will be charged a $150 "Whois privacy protection maintenance fee".

</p>
<p>17.<strong>Abuse and Removal of Privacy Protection</strong>.
NameBright has the right, upon its sole discretion to remove a customer's privacy protection for any of the following reasons:</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>a.<u>Illegal Activity</u>
</p>
<p>NameBright.com has the right to remove a customer's privacy protection without any notice upon notification of a customer's involvement in any (a.) illegal, (b.) malicious or (c.) harmful activity on a domain registered with NameBright.
NameBright.com has a zero-tolerance policy to the abuse of its services to engage in illegal, malicious, or harmful activities.</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>c.<u>ICANN Whois Inaccuracy Complaint</u>
</p>
<p>Should NameBright receive a Whois Inaccuracy Complaint on a domain name, it will email the customer in order to acquire the necessary information and conduct an investigation.
Should the customer fail to respond to this correspondence, their domain will be suspended and privacy protection will be removed from all domains in that customer's account without notice.
It is mandatory the customer respond to these inquiries and failure to do so will result in the loss of the privilege of using privacy protection.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>d.<u>Court Order or Subpoena</u>
</p>
<p>Upon receipt of any legitimate and binding Court Order or Subpoena, NameBright may, upon requirement by law or by its own discretion, remove privacy protection from a customer's domain and/or account in order to obey any relevant laws and to ensure all customers are using their domains in legitimate and legal manners.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>e.<u>Any Reason Deemed Necessary</u>
</p>
<p>In addition to the above reasons, NameBright may remove privacy protection form a customer's domain and/or account for any compelling reason and at NameBright's sole discretion.
NameBright.com is not required to give any notice or provide any reason for removing privacy protection.
Privacy protection is an added and voluntary service that is to be a privilege.
NameBright will not tolerate any abuse of this voluntary service.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>18.<strong>One Year Free Privacy Protection</strong>.
All domain names registered through NameBright (which are eligible for privacy protection) may receive one (1) year of free privacy protection.
This promotion is applicable for new domain registrations, domain name transfers in, and on domain names that have never had privacy turned on before within the system.
After the 1 free year is up you will be charged for the renewal at the current privacy protection price.
In the case your privacy protection does not end on the "anniversary" of your domain name's expiration (this can happen with transfers for example), NameBright will "sync" the privacy protection to the closest anniversary of the expiration date once the free year has ended.
In this case you will see a pro-rated charge where privacy might only renew for a few months (for a fraction of the yearly price with the pro-rated price), and then you will see a second privacy charge for an additional year when the anniversary of your domain's expiration comes up.
This is done to keep all services associated with a domain synced up with its expiration date to make the management of your domain names easier.</p>
<p>
<strong>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>If you do not long into your account and manually cancel your 1-year of free privacy protection before the domain name renews, or before the anniversary of the domain, you will be charged the current rate for privacy protection.
(Currently $2.95 per domain name per year.)</p>

All users of NameBright are required to agree to the same terms and conditions as one another.
By granting another user permission to access/modify/use your account, you are agreeing to the terms and conditions as set forth in this document.
You can and will be responsible for actions taken by other users on your account.
For example, if you have given a user permission to your email accounts, and that user is found to have been sending bulk unsolicited email, not only can NameBright terminate that user's account, but can terminate your email plan, or your account in its entirety.
You also agree to the inherent risks of granting other people access to your account, which means giving those people access to modify your domain registrations, manage your email accounts, managing your domains, etc.
NameBright takes no liability for misuse of linked accounts.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>25.<strong>API Access</strong>.
To get started with API Access (for programmatically connecting to NameBright) you must first apply and provide reasoning and what you are looking to do with the API access.
API access is private and will not be granted to every user.
Secondarily, you will be required to fund your account and have a minimum of $100.00 USD in your account balance before being allowed to use the API.
All charges which are made using the API will come off of your account balance and will not be associated with a credit card in any way.
By using the API you agree that any calls made to the API to charge against your account cannot be refunded.
(Certain exceptions "may" apply for a refund, you will need to contact NameBright directly to discuss.) When using the API you agree that you will not do more than 30 requests against the system in a 30 second timeframe.
If you do so, you will be rate-limited and API access may be revoked if you hit this threshold too often.
As a general rule, NameBright asks you space requests out by 1 second, and NameBright might limit your access even if you are too demanding on the system.
(For example, hitting NameBright 30 times in a 5 millisecond period may be considered too aggressive.) You also agree that the API will not be used to purchase domain names that are expiring / dropping into general availability.
If you attempt to purchase expiring domains, or check their availability during the drop, NameBright will respond with "domain not available" even if the domain might be available at that time.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
