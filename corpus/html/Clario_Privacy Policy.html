In addition, experts will be able to help you fix technical issues and answer system questions related to your device.
To perform a remote connection, experts must receive your prior explicit consent to do so.

<p> Additionally, you can terminate the connection at any time.
Experts will describe to you how to disconnect within the session.

</p>
<p> Also, we may share some of the collected data with third parties only for analysis and statistics to improve our Services.
</p>
<p> For instance, we use a third-party analytical tool provided by AppsFlyer Inc.
(100 1st Street, 25th floor San Francisco, California 94105, USA) for analytical purposes within the Clario mobile application (hereinafter the “App”).
</p>
<p> We may collect and share with AppsFlyer some session and interaction data to research and analyze how you have found our App (for example, which advertiser delivered an ad that led you to our Product in App Store).
Also, based on this data AppsFlyer helps us to understand how you use our app as well as improve user-friendliness of our app and to make it easier for you to use (for instance, by providing statistical patterns of our App use).
The session and interaction data is collected and shared after being rendered anonymously, and is only evaluated in anonymised, summarised form and used for analytical and statistical purposes only.
</p>
<p> In order to receive analytical services from AppsFlyer, we may share such data as: </p>
<ol>
<li>device type and model, CPU, system language, memory, OS version, Wi-Fi status, time stamp and zone, device motion parameters and carrier.
</li>
<li>IDFA (Apple identifier for advertisers), Google Advertiser ID and other similar unique identifiers.
</li>
<li>information relating to your actions in the App (like clicks on the ads, ad impressions viewed, the URL from the referring website, downloads and installations of Applications), and other interactions, events, and actions (like registration, login, start trial, purchases made).

</ol>
<p> Please check the AppsFlyer Privacy Policy to get more information on how AppsFlyer processes your data.
</p>
<p> We use Analytics for Firebase and Crashlytics - service from Google LLC.
(1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA) in order to derive App analytics, see how users interact with our App, as well as track and prevent any bug affecting our iOS and Android App.
</p>
<p> Firebase services process personal data, but, in most cases, it is limited to so-called “instance IDs”, which are provided with a time stamp.
These “Instance IDs” assigned by Firebase are unique and thus allow the linking of different events or processes.
This data does not represent personally identifiable information.
We process these aggregated data to analyze and optimize usage behavior.
</p>
<p> Namely, while you are using our App, certain information may be sent to Google: </p>
<ol>
<li>device information (like name, type, OS version, and certain hardware information about your mobile device, settings, and language of the device).
</li>
<li>unique identifier of App installation;</li>
<li>version and functionality of the App;</li>
<li>time of the crash, the state of the application at the time of the crash, and stack traces.
</li>
</ol>
<p> Data transmitted to Crashlytics neither stored or transferred to other services or resources, nor associated with other data available to Google.
</p>
<p> For Analytics for Firebase, Google uses not only the “Instance ID” described above, but also the advertising ID of the end device.
You can restrict the use of the advertising ID in the device settings of your mobile device: </p>
<ol>
<li>For Android: Settings &gt.
Google &gt.
Ads &gt.
Reset Ad ID</li>
<li>For iOS: Settings &gt.
Privacy &gt.
Advertising &gt.
No ad tracking</li>
</ol>

</ol>
<p> Google privacy policy is available at: </p>
<ol>
<li> https://policies.google.com/privacy.
</li>
</ol>
<p> If you do not wish to be tracked by AppsFlyer or transfer information to the Google in the future, you can opt out at any time via: </p>
<ol>
<li>App settings;</li>
<li> Email to hello@weareclario.com.
</li>
</ol>
<p> Also, you may opt out of future transmission of data from your device to AppsFlyer's servers by using the Opt-Out Button.
</p>
<p> We may anonymize your personal data when you stop using our Services.
Anonymous data does not relate to a particular person, so we are unable to re-identify you.
However, anonymous data does allow us to improve our Services.

<li>“Data”</li>
</ol>
<p> For instance, if you use our App on an Android mobile operating system, we will request access to the details on the connected Wi-Fi spot (device location data).

We only need this data to provide you with the requested functionality of our App.
