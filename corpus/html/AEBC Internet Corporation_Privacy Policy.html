Information Collected via Technology
<p>
<strong>
<u>Information Collected by Our Servers</u>
</strong>.
To make our Services more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, referring/exit pages, clickstream data (including the ads you see and click on), and/or a date/time stamp for your visit.
We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Services, track users’ movements around the Site, gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor our Services to our users’ needs.
For example, some of the information may be collected so that when you visit the Site again, it will recognize you and the information could then be used by us to serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests.
Except as noted in this Privacy Policy, we do not link this automatically-collected data to Personal Data.</p>
<p>
