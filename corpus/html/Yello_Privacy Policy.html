<em>
<em>Effective Date: August 20, 2021</em>
</em>
</p>
<p>RECSOLU, Inc., DBA Yello (“Yello” or “we” or “us” or “our”) is committed to protecting the privacy of visitors and users of the yello.co website (the “Site”) and our mobile and web recruiting applications (the “Apps”).
We want our Customers and their Authorized Users (collectively, our “Customer(s)”) and Candidates (“Candidate(s)”) to have a positive experience while using the Site or Apps.
We respect and protect our Customers’ and Candidates’ rights to privacy as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy applies to both the Site and the Apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To provide some background to our Customers and Candidates, we primarily process personal information on behalf of and in accordance with the instructions of our Customers, who may collect such information from Candidates during the employment recruitment process or otherwise.
In addition, we act as a data controller with respect to some Candidate personal information that we make available to our Customers upon authorization from such Candidates.
We and our Customers collect such information from Candidates using the Site or the Apps.
We also work with partners, who obtain information from Candidates, and offer this information to our Customers.
The personal information from the Candidate(s) is concurrently and automatically stored and backed up from the Site and/or the Apps to servers that are under the control and in the possession of our hosting provider, who acts as our sub-processor.
It is important to note that the provision of personal data by Customers or Candidates is not mandatory, and Customers and Candidates can refrain from such provision at any time and still maintain access to the Site and Apps.</p>

Our sourcing partners may collect and share personal information, including sensitive personal information of Candidates such as ethnic origin, race, religion, and gender.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>Customer Personal Information</strong>
</p>
<p>Through the Site and Apps, we automatically gather certain information about the use of the Site and Apps, such as how frequently certain areas of the Site or Apps are visited or interacted with, and the date and time of Site or Mobile App visits, IP addresses and browser information, including through the use of&nbsp;cookies, web beacons, pixels, and other technologies.

based Customer, consent to us tracking such iPads or tablets using Global Positioning System (GPS) technology that is installed and active on such device(s).
Such tracking will be utilized for the following purposes: (i) locating device(s) in the event that they are lost or stolen.
and/or (ii) locating devices(s) in an anonymized fashion for use on a device heat-map to be used for internal and external marketing purposes and which constitutes a map of broad-scale user activity across the globe.
Such GPS tracking will not involve any access to your personal information nor will it involve the tracking of your activity or behavior on such device(s).
If you object to such tracking, please promptly contact us via email at privacy@yello.co.</p>
<strong>How do we use Customer personal information?</strong>
<p>We use Customer information in order to administer our Customers’ accounts and allow them to use the Site and Apps.

<p>notifying them of new services, offerings, or changes to the Site, Apps, or this Privacy Policy.
Our Customers can opt-out of receiving these emails by contacting us at privacy@yello.co.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may use Customer information to enable us to display advertisements to third parties’ target audiences.
Even though we do not disclose your personal data for these purposes without your consent, if you click on or otherwise interact with an advertisement, the advertiser may assume you meet its target criteria.</p>

<strong>Do we disclose any personal information to outside parties?</strong>
<p>We do not sell, trade, or transfer your personal information to third parties, except in the circumstances described below.&nbsp;</p>
<strong>Our Customers</strong>
<p>As part of our service offerings, we may disclose to our Customers any Candidates’ personal information provided to us, if Candidates consent to such disclosure.
By providing Candidates’ personal information to our Customers, our Customers will be able to contact such Candidates to inquire about potential future hiring or recruitment opportunities.</p>

<p>We may also disclose aggregated, de-identified information, and analyses and reports derived from such information, to service providers, advertisers, merchants, consumer and market research companies and other organizations.
These service providers are responsible for their own compliance with data protection laws.</p>
<strong>Legal Requirements and Business Transfers</strong>
<p>We may disclose personal information (i) if we are required to do so by law, legal process, statute, rule, regulation, or professional standard, or to respond to a subpoena, search warrant, or other government official requests, (ii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss, (iii) in connection with an investigation of a complaint, security threat, or suspected or actual illegal activity.
(iv) in connection with an internal audit.
or (v) in the event that Yello is subject to mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, sales of assets, reorganizations, divestitures, dissolutions, bankruptcies, liquidations, or other types of business transactions.
In these types of transactions, personal information may be shared, sold, or transferred, and it may be used subsequently by a third party.&nbsp;</p>

Please note that by disabling or deleting cookies, you may not be able to access the full&nbsp;</p>
<p>functionality of our Sites.
Disabling or clearing cookies also may affect cookie-based opt-outs by either preventing you from using such cookie-based</p>
<p>opt-outs or clearing opt-outs that you previously set.
For more information about how we use cookies, please see our Cookie Policy.&nbsp;</p>
<strong>Data Subject Access Requests&nbsp;</strong>
<p>To the extent provided for in applicable data protection laws of Candidates’ countries of residence, upon written request from a Candidate, with proper verification of identity at our sole discretion (<em>e.g.
</em>via certification from a notary public), we can promptly destroy, correct, amend and/or return, to such verified Candidate, any and all personal data in our or our sub-processor’s control or possession, subject to both our right to retain such information as deemed necessary to comply with legal obligations and the obligations detailed in our written agreements with Customers.
We will use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to such requests within the prescribed period of time set forth in applicable data protection laws.
All requests in this regard should be submitted via email to privacy@yello.co.&nbsp;</p>
<strong>Contact by our Customers&nbsp;</strong>
<p>As described above, we will disclose to our Customers Candidates’ personal information who provide their consent, which will enable our Customers to contact such Candidates for hiring and recruitment purposes.
If a Candidate does not wish to be contacted by our Customers regarding future hiring and recruitment opportunities, they can choose not to provide their consent when prompted by us or by contacting us at privacy@yello.co.&nbsp;</p>
<strong>Accessing and Updating Personal Information and Preferences&nbsp;</strong>
<p>Authorized users of our Customers may access, update, correct, and/or delete registration and other personal information by logging into the Site or Apps and modifying their user profile, or by sending us an email at privacy@yello.co.
Customers may also close their account at any time by contacting us at privacy@yello.co.
We will take commercially reasonable steps to implement our Customers’ requests promptly, but it may take some time to process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While we make efforts to accommodate requests to restrict our use of personal information, we reserve the right to erase all or any portion of a Customer or Candidate’s information if we are not able to reasonably accommodate a requested restriction.
Please note that in some instances, we may not be able to delete the personal information or our Customers or Candidates except by closing such Customer’s user account.
We will notify our Customers if we are not able to accommodate their requests or if we have elected to close a Customer account as a result of a failure to accommodate such request.&nbsp;</p>
<strong>Do Not Track&nbsp;</strong>
<p>Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals, we do not respond to them at this time.&nbsp;</p>
<strong>Location Data&nbsp;</strong>
<p>You may opt-out of having your location data collected by Yello at any time by editing the appropriate setting on your mobile device (which is usually located in the settings of your device).&nbsp;</p>
<strong>Location of our Site</strong>
<p>Our Site is hosted and operated in the United States.
However, we and our service providers may store information about individuals in the United States, or we may transfer it to, and store it within, other countries.
In very limited circumstances and at our sole discretion, we may provide certain Customers with the option to elect that their data is hosted in Ireland.</p>
<p>Visitors from jurisdictions outside the United States visit us at their own choice and risk.
If you are not a resident of the United States, you acknowledge and agree that we may collect and use your personal information outside your home jurisdiction, and that we may store your personal information in the United States or elsewhere.
Please note that the level of legal protection provided in the United States from which you may access our Sites may not be as stringent as that under privacy standards or the privacy laws of other countries, possibly including your home jurisdiction.</p>
<strong>How long do we retain your personal information?</strong>
<p>We will keep your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is permitted or required by law.&nbsp;</p>
<strong>Third party links</strong>
<p>Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our Site or Apps.&nbsp.
These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies.
We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites.
We urge you to read the privacy policies of other websites before submitting any information to those websites.</p>
<strong>How do we protect your information?</strong>
<p>We are committed to protecting the information we receive from our Customers and Candidates.
We have implemented commercially reasonable, appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of data stored on the Site and on the Apps, including from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, while considering the risks involved.
including, but not limited to, severity of foreseeable harm and likelihood that our processing could threaten the individual rights and freedoms of the Candidates.
While no computer system is completely secure, we believe the measures we have implemented reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, only those employees and third parties who need access to personal information in order to perform their duties are allowed such access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although we do our best to protect the personal information of our Customers and Candidates, we cannot guarantee the security of personal information transmitted to the Site or Apps.
Any transmission of personal data is at the Customer’s or Candidate’s own risk.
We are not responsible for the circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site or Apps.
The safety and security of personal information also depends on the Customers and Candidates.
Customers and Candidates are responsible for keeping their self-created passwords confidential, and Customers and Candidates must not share passwords with anyone.
Customers and Candidates must also take all reasonable steps to ensure the protection of their personal information and must be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Site or Apps or elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>
<strong>Your California privacy rights</strong>
<p>California Civil Code Section §1798.83 permits Customers and Candidates who utilize the Site or Apps and who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
To make such a request, please send an e-mail to privacy@yello.co.</p>

You may also have the right to receive a copy of your personal data in a commonly used and machine-readable format, and to transmit such data to another controller.
You also may object to processing of your personal data, or ask that we restrict the processing of your personal data in certain instances.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon written request from a Candidate or Customer, with proper verification of identity at our sole discretion (e.g.

<strong>Do we collect information from children?</strong>
<p>We do not solicit any personal information from children.
If a Customer or Candidate is not 16 or older, he or she must not use the Site or Apps.
Parents should be aware there are parental control tools available online that can be used to prevent children from submitting information online without parental permission or from accessing material that is harmful to minors.
If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 16 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information.
If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 16, please contact us at privacy@yello.co.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pursuant to CCPA, we will not sell the personal information of any consumer less than 16 years of age, unless the consumer, in the case of consumers between 13 and 16 years of age, or the consumer’s parent or guardian, in the case of consumers who are less than 13 years of age, has affirmatively authorized the sale of the consumer’s personal information.</p>
