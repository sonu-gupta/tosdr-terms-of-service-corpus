</ul>Client Platform Access Agreement
Date of Last Revision: August 12,&nbsp;2020
<p>Notice: this Client Platform Access Agreement is a substantial revision from the prior Toptal on-line agreement entitled ”Client Services Terms of Service“ and replaces such prior agreement in its entirety.
Please read it carefully to acquaint yourself with your rights and obligations for using the Client Platform portions of https://www.toptal.com.</p> 1.
Toptal Properties: Description of Platform and Matching Service.
<p>Toptal, LLC (“Toptal” or “we”) provides a network (“Network”) of independent contractors who provide software engineering or other professional services (each a “Talent” and the services they provide, the “Talent Services”).
The “Platform” includes (a) Toptal’s web site located at https://www.toptal.com (the “Site”), (b) Toptal’s technology platform designed to find and connect Talent to those in need of development, engineering, and other professional services offered by or through Toptal (the “Platform”), and (c) all software, data, reports, text, images, sounds, video, and content made available through any of the foregoing (collectively, the “Content”).
Any new features added to or augmenting the Platform are also subject to this Client Platform Access Agreement (“CPAA”).
The “Matching Services” involve using any and all features, functions, and Content of the Platform that enable clients to identify, review, contact, and otherwise take steps to engage Talent, as well as Toptal’s work in assisting you (“you” or “Client”) in identifying, reviewing, contacting, and taking steps to engage Talent.
The Matching Services do not include any work performed by Talent.
For ease of reference, the Site, Network, Platform, identities or descriptions of Talent and Talent services, the Matching Services, Other Content, Toptal’s Proprietary Information, and any other Toptal products or services are collectively referred to in this CPAA as “Toptal Properties.” “Toptal Properties” include all such elements as a whole, as well as individual elements and portions thereof.
Nothing in this CPAA obligates: (1) you to engage any particular Talent for any work, (2) Toptal to provide you or any Client with Matching Services, or (3) Toptal to identify Talent for your particular needs.</p> 2.
Acceptance of Terms.
<p>2.1.
<strong>Acceptance and Legally Binding Agreement.</strong> Toptal provides the Toptal Properties to you through the Site and the Platform, subject to this CPAA.
By accepting this CPAA or by accessing or using any portion of the Toptal Properties, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this CPAA.
You further acknowledge that this CPAA is a contract between you and Toptal, even though it is electronic and is not physically signed by you and Toptal, and it governs your use of the Toptal Properties.
If you are entering into this CPAA on behalf of a company, business or other legal entity (“Client Entity”), you represent that you have the authority to contractually bind such Client Entity to this CPAA, in which case the terms “you” or “your” or “Client” will refer to such Client Entity.
<strong>IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY TO CONTRACTUALLY BIND SUCH CLIENT ENTITY TO THIS CPAA, OR IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS CPAA, YOU MUST NOT ACCEPT THIS CPAA AND YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE TOPTAL PROPERTIES.</strong>
</p>
<p>2.2.
<strong>CPAA Updates.</strong> Toptal reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to change or modify portions of this CPAA at any time.
Toptal will post the changes to this CPAA on the Site and will indicate at the top of this page the date these terms were last revised.
It is your responsibility to check the CPAA periodically for changes.
Your continued use of any of the Toptal Properties after the date any such changes become effective constitutes your acceptance of the new or revised CPAA.</p>
<p>2.3.
<strong>Registering Your Account.</strong> As part of the registration process, you will identify a user name and password for your Account (“Account”).
You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your user name and password and for any authorized or unauthorized use of the same.
You also agree to provide Toptal truthful, accurate, and complete information in all interactions with Toptal via any of the Toptal Properties.</p> 3.
Restrictions on Your Use of Toptal Proprietary Information.
<p>3.1.
<strong>Confidentiality.</strong> All business, technical or financial information disclosed by Toptal via the Toptal Properties, including without limitation, the Site, Platform, or Matching Service, is the “Proprietary Information” of Toptal.
Proprietary Information also includes, but is not limited to, the rates of each Talent in the Network.
You will hold in confidence and not disclose to others any Proprietary Information.
You will also not use Proprietary Information for any purposes other than evaluation of Toptal, Talent and Talent Services as an existing or prospective client of Toptal.
However, you will not be obligated under this Section 3.1 with respect to information that you can document is or becomes readily publicly available without restriction and through no fault of you (i.e., information that Toptal makes generally available to the public on the Site without requiring acceptance of this CPAA or a similar obligation of confidentiality).
You may make disclosures of Proprietary Information required by law or court order provided that you give Toptal advance written notice.
When you have completed your use of the Platform or Matching Service, or if you have not used the Platform or Matching Service in 12 months, you will destroy all items and copies containing or embodying Proprietary Information.</p>
<p>3.2.
<strong>Non-Solicit.</strong> During all periods of your access to or use of the Platform or Matching Service and for twelve (12) months after each such access or use (collectively, all such periods are referred to as the “Non-Solicit Period”), you will not, directly or indirectly, encourage or solicit to hire, or otherwise hire or engage for performance of services (excluding services performed pursuant to a Sourced Talent Agreement signed by both you and Toptal) any Talent whom you become aware of in connection with your interaction with Toptal.
You also agree that you will not refer such Talent directly to parent, sibling, or other affiliated companies.</p> 4.

NO WARRANTIES AND DISCLAIMER BY TOPTAL.
<p>THE TOPTAL PROPERTIES, AND PARTICULARLY THE SITE, PLATFORM, MATCHING SERVICES, CONTENT, PROPRIETARY INFORMATION AND ALL SERVER AND NETWORK COMPONENTS, ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, AND TOPTAL EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR USAGE OF TRADE.

<p>9.1 <strong>Exclusion of Damages and Limitation of Liability.</strong> Toptal does not charge fees for you to access and use the Toptal Properties pursuant to this CPAA.

Dispute Resolution.
Jury Waiver.
<p>THIS CPAA IS MADE UNDER, AND WILL BE CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF DELAWARE APPLICABLE TO AGREEMENTS MADE AND TO BE PERFORMED SOLELY THEREIN, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW.

Miscellaneous.
<p>This CPAA, together with Toptal’s Privacy Policy constitute the entire agreement between the parties.
In accordance with Section 12, a Sourced Talent Agreement will take precedence over and will govern over any inconsistent or conflicting terms in this CPAA, with respect to the Matching Services and the other subject matter of the Sourced Talent Agreement.
For clarification your access to and use of the Site, Platform, and Content provided through the Site or Platform is not part of the subject matter of the Sourced Talent Agreement and the provisions of this CPAA will apply thereto.
The failure of Toptal to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this CPAA will not be a waiver of that right.
No waiver, change, or modification to this CPAA will be effective unless in writing signed by both parties.
Any notices to Toptal in connection with this agreement will be made by email transmitted to contact@toptal.com provided that you also send a copy of such notice via nationally recognized carrier to Toptal, LLC, 2810 N.
Church St, #36879 Wilmington, Delaware 19802-4447, Attn: Contract Administration.
Notices to you will be made by email or regular mail and will be deemed to have been duly given when sent by Toptal to the email or mailing address associated with your account.
You agree that Toptal is entitled to seek injunctive and other equitable relief to enforce your obligations in Sections 3, 4.1(b) and 4.2.
to avoid harm that cannot adequately be remedied by monetary damages.
The section and subsection headings used in this CPAA are for convenience only and will not be used in interpreting this CPAA.
In the event that any provision of this CPAA will be determined to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be first revised to give the maximum permissible effect to its original intent or, if such revision is not permitted, that specific provision will be eliminated so that this CPAA will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.</p> 12.
Applicable Agreements.
<p>Toptal Talent perform services pursuant to Talent Services agreements that Clients and Toptal enter into separate from this CPAA (“Sourced Talent Agreements”).
Your access or use of the Toptal Properties other than Matching Services always will be governed by the then-current CPAA.
Your access and use of Matching Services also will be governed by the then-current CPAA, <strong>unless</strong> you are accessing and using the Matching Services while you are a party to an active Sourced Talent Agreement, in which case your access and use of the Matching Services will be governed solely by the Sourced Talent Agreement in connection with which you are accessing and using the Matching Services.</p>
