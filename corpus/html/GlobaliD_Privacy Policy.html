Privacy Policy
<p>
<em>Last modified: 27 November 2020</em>
</p>
<p>Welcome to GlobaliD Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) where we describe the types, means and purposes by which GlobaliD processes your Personal Data when you use GlobaliD Services (“Services”), and how you can control your Personal Data and exercise your Privacy Rights.
This Policy also tells you about your rights and choices with respect to your personal information (“Personal Data”), and how you can reach us to get answers to your questions.</p>
<p>Privacy is the foundation upon which we built GlobaliD.
At GlobaliD, we provide a platform where users can establish a unique identity comprised of user-specific Verifications.
We provide our users the ability to store Personal Data securely on their devices or through our platform, and share Personal Data only as needed with GlobaliD or third parties.
Therefore, instead of transferring Personal Data to third parties, users only share access to theirPersonal Data.
This way we eliminate the need to store Personal Data and enable our users to control access to their digital identities.
All capitalized terms used in this Policy are defined in the “Definitions” table below.</p>
<p>The GlobaliD identity system is built on three core pillars: privacy, security, and trust.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
1.
Privacy
<p>We enable privacy through verifications or securely-made claims about the validity of some piece of information about your identity.
Verifications associated with your GlobaliD Name are public and viewable to GlobaliD Name holders and partners, but the underlying Personal Data (e.g.
date of birth, phone number) is private and is only ever seen by the third party providing the verification, or if you chose to grant an entity or person access to your Personal Data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
2.
Security
<p>Our user’s Personal Data is encrypted, anonymized and backed up to the cloud.
The key required to decrypt that data is only held by the owner of the name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
3.
Trust
<p>Permissions are based on trust: before granting permission to a GlobaliD user to perform a given action, an app or website needs to trust that the user is (a) who they claim to be, and (b) authorized to perform that action.
Trust, therefore, has two components: authentication and authorization.
GlobaliD authenticates users with cryptography techniques where the owner of a name has a private key used to prove ownership.
This private key is stored securely on the user’s mobile phone or in encrypted version in the cloud.</p>
<p>Authorization is the process by which an app or website checks that a given user is allowed to perform a given action.
The Verifications acquired by GlobaliD Name holders prove that a given piece of information about a particular GlobaliD Name holder was valid at a particular point in time.
Collectively, the Verifications associated with GlobaliD Name holders allow users to build a reputation.
Using this reputation, an app, website, or merchant can decide whether or not to allow the name’s owner to perform a given action.</p>
