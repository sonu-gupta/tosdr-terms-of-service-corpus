How We Use Cookies and Automatic Data Collection Tools
<p>We also collect information, via cookies, web beacons, pixels, tags or other tracking technologies, such as your Internet Service Provider and IP address, the date and time you access our website or mobile app, the pages you accessed while visiting our
website or mobile app, and the Internet address from which you accessed our website or mobile app.
Some cookies exist only during a single session and some are persistent over multiple sessions over time.
We and our partners use these technologies to
ensure basic functionality of our website and mobile app, to remember user preferences (including regarding your preferences regarding tracking technologies), maximize the performance of our website, mobile app, and services, provide you with offers that
may be of interest to you, measure the effectiveness of our website, mobile app, and email campaigns and to personalize online content.
These cookies and other technologies may be used to track you over time and across devices.
When required by law, we
only use these tracking technologies, when you have given us your consent to do so.</p>
<p>To provide you with a more relevant and interesting experience, we may work with third party companies to display ads or customize the content on our website or mobile app.
These companies may use cookies and similar tracking technologies as described
in this Notice to gather information about your visits to the website or mobile app, as well as your visits elsewhere on the Internet.
These companies also may use this information to provide you with more relevant advertising known as interest-based
advertising.
For more information about third-party advertisers and how to prevent them from using your information, please visit https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/.
This is a site offered
by the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") that includes information on how consumers can opt-out from receiving interest-based advertising from some or all of NAI's members.
The Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) also offers
a choice mechanism with respect to certain types of data collection and use by third parties available at www.aboutads.info.
Opting out of interest-based advertising will not opt you out of all advertising, but
rather only interest-based advertising from us or our agents or representatives.
Similarly, asking our mobile apps not to track you/not agreeing or rejecting tracking technologies in our cookie banner/preference center/mobile app selection screen will
only opt you out of those technologies, but not all advertising.
Some browsers have incorporated Do Not Track (“DNT”) preferences.
Most of these features, when turned on, send signals to the website you are visiting that you do not wish to
have information about your online searching and browsing activities collected and used.
As there is not yet a common agreement about how to interpret DNT signals, we do not honor DNT signals from website browsers at this time.
However, you may not accept
to/refuse or delete cookies.
If you do not accept/refuse or delete cookies, some of our website functionality may be impaired or some of the advertising served to you may not be relevant for you anymore.
If you change computers, devices, or browsers,
or use multiple computers, devices, or browsers, and delete your cookies, you may need to repeat this process for each computer, device, or browser.
Please refer to your browser’s Help instructions to learn more about how to manage cookies and the
use of other tracking technologies.
You can also find more information on managing cookies at All About Cookies - Manage Cookies.</p>
<p>Our websites use Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google Inc.
(“Google”).
Google Analytics cookies collect your IP address.
however, because IP anonymization is used on this website, your IP address will be shortened (and
therefore anonymized) as soon as technically possible and before it is stored or otherwise used in connection with Google Analytics.
The anonymization process takes place within the European Union or the European Economic Area, except in exceptional cases,
where your full IP address may be sent to a Google server in the United States and shortened there.
We use the information collected by Google Analytics cookies to find out about how visitors use our website, to throttle request speed and for advertising
tracking.
Google will not combine the IP address sent by your browser in connection with Google Analytics with other data.
You can prevent Google Analytics cookies from being stored by setting your browser software accordingly or opting-out of Google
Analytics by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available here: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
You can also <strong>change settings</strong> regarding which cookies and tracking
technologies placed on your device you allow us and our partners to read, in our cookie preference center.
Changing these settings will not delete these cookies, but we will no longer be able to utilize them for the purposes you decided to turn off.</p>

If you have any questions about controllership, do not hesitate to contact us (see Section 9 for contact information).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Legal bases for processing</strong>
</p>
<p>We rely on the following legal grounds for the collection, processing, and use of your Personal Data:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>The processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract.</strong> This includes instances when we need to enable interactions between you and us
and to provide our services to you.
as well as when we need to facilitate business relationship with you/companies acting as our investors, suppliers and other business partners.
and in course of our talent recruitment process when we are negotiating
with potential candidates.
and when we conclude and fulfil our part of the contract with our drivers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>The processing is necessary for compliance with a legal or statutory obligation to which we are subject.</strong> This includes instances when we are required by various business laws to carry out various compliance checks (such as anti-money
laundering) related to our customers, investors, suppliers, and other business partners.
It may also include various local compliance obligations and licenses we have to comply with regarding the operation of our service, including engagement of our drivers.
We will also process job applicant data if required by local laws to do so for purposes of fair hiring process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>The processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party.</strong> This includes instances where we process your Personal Data for our own internal business-improvement purposes, certain survey
and questionnaires we may carry out, and our marketing activities (for example by sending you digital direct marketing related to similar products/services we have provided to you), unless consent is required under applicable laws.
We may also provide
some of the auxiliary support to our services based on our legitimate business interest to do so, even though we are not required to do so under our contracts, including through various digital communication and other tools we provide in the course of
our business / service relationship with you.
We rely on our legitimate interest also in the course of our talent recruitment process for our initial interviews with potential candidates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Where you provided us with your consent to the processing of your data for one or more specific purposes.</strong> This includes digital direct marketing communications, were your consent is required by law (for example if we are collecting your
data on behalf of a third party), where you give us consent with keeping your application for other future opportunities, if such consent is necessary (otherwise, we would rely on our legitimate interest to do so), or in other instances where we asked
for your consent in order to collect and process your Personal Data (we will inform you at each such occasion).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>The processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims,</strong> whether in court proceedings or in an administrative or out-of-court procedure;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>The processing is necessary to carry out the obligations and exercising specific rights in the field of employment, social security and social protection law,</strong> where national employment laws regulate certain aspects of hiring procedures
that require processing of sensitive Personal Data.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Your Data Protection Rights</strong>

<p>Under the conditions set by applicable data protection laws, you may exercise the following rights regarding your Personal Data:</p>
<ul>

<p>Access.
You have the right to obtain confirmation from us if Personal Data is being processed, and related information.
and the right to obtain a copy of your Personal Data undergoing the processing.</p>

<p>Rectification.
You have the right to request the rectification of inaccurate Personal Data and to have incomplete data completed.</p>
</li>

<p>Objection.
You have the right to object to the processing of your Personal Data for compelling and legitimate reasons relating to your particular situation, except in cases where legal provisions expressly provide for that processing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Portability.
You may receive your Personal Data that you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit it to other data controllers without hindrance.
This right only exists if the processing
is based on your consent or a contract and the processing is carried out by automated means.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Restriction.
You may request to restrict the processing of your Personal Data in certain cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Erasure.
You may request to erase your Personal Data if (i) it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which we have collected it, (ii) you have withdrawn your consent and no other legal ground for the processing exists, (iii) you objected and no
overriding legitimate grounds for the processing exist, (iv) the processing is unlawful, or erasure is required to comply with a legal obligation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right to lodge a complaint.
You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the country of the EEA, Switzerland or the UK where you reside, or where the issue that is the subject of the complaint occurred.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right to refuse or withdraw consent.
In case we ask for your consent to processing, you are free to refuse to give consent and you can withdraw your consent at any time without any adverse negative consequences.
The lawfulness of any processing of your
Personal Data that occurred prior to the withdrawal of your consent will not be affected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automated decision-making.
You also have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing (you can do so by contacting us at the Contact Info above) and to be given more information about why any such decision was made by

<strong>International Transfers of Personal Data</strong>
</p>
<p>Due to the global nature of our operations, some of the recipients mentioned in Section 5 of the Notice may be located in countries outside the EEA, Switzerland or the UK, which do not provide an adequate level of data protection as defined by data protection
laws in the EEA, Switzerland and the UK.
Certain third countries have been officially recognized by the EEA, Swiss and UK authorities as providing an adequate level of protection and no further safeguards are necessary.
The below outlines how we protect
your Personal Data when transferring it outside those countries.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Intra-Group
<br>Intra-group international transfers will be to countries where GoBrands entities have offices, in particular the United States of America.
The transfer of your Personal Data outside the EEA, Switzerland and the UK takes place on the basis of our intra-group
data transfer agreements, which are based on EU and UK standard contractual clauses, as applicable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Third Parties
<br>Some of the third parties with whom we share Personal Data are also located outside the EEA, Switzerland or the UK in third countries, which do not provide an adequate level of data protection as defined by data protection laws in the EEA, Switzerland
or the UK.
Transfers to third parties located in such third countries take place using an acceptable data transfer mechanism, such as the EU/UK Standard Contractual Clauses, Binding Corporate Rules, approved Codes of Conduct and Certifications, on the
basis of permissible statutory derogations, or any other valid data transfer mechanism issued by the EEA, Swiss or UK authorities.</p>
<p>Please reach out to us using the Contact Info above, if you want to receive further information or, where available, a copy of the relevant data transfer mechanism.</p>
