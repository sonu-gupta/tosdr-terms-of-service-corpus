<strong>mail</strong>pile Privacy and Information Policy
General policy
<p>In the unlikely event that Mailpile ehf or the development team find
themselves in posession of any personal or private information about our
users, our policy is to never disclose it to any third parties unless we
are legally compelled to do so.</p>
<p>Since we would rather not put ourselves in that position, we make every
attempt to not obtain such information in the first place.</p>
The Mailpile e-mail client
<p>
<strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong>: The Mailpile e-mail client is a
standalone free-software application which does not automatically share
any personally identifiable information with the Mailpile development
team or Mailpile ehf.</p>
<p>
<strong>Telemetry</strong>: If enabled by the user, the Mailpile e-mail client will
periodically attempt to download information about available updates
from the www.mailpile.is website, at the same time disclosing the
current version of the software, and which language the user has
selected for the user interface.
No attempt is made to correlate these
details with the identities of individual users and only aggregate
statistics derived from these requests will ever be disclosed to third
parties.
See the section below, "Logs and Tracking", for information
about the format of the raw data and retention policies.</p>
The website: www.mailpile.is

<strong>Thank-you</strong>: Our website discloses names of people who have backed the
project and requested they be given credit and thanked publicly.
People can
request their details be removed from this list at any time, by e-mailing
team@mailpile.is.</p>
<p>
<strong>Voting Access</strong>: Members of the Mailpile community, who have backed the
project by a sufficient amount, are granted access to a members-only voting
area.
This access includes the name they provided when backing the project and
the backer's e-mail address.
This information will never be disclosed to any
third parties.
People can request their details be removed from this list at
any time, by e-mailing team@mailpile.is.</p>
<p>
<strong>Logs and Tracking</strong>: This website does not use any third-party analytics or
tracking tools.
Standard web-server logs (including time-stamps, client IP
addresses and which web pages were downloaded) are generated in order to
facilitate troubleshooting and other routine administrative tasks.
These logs
are kept for up to three months, and then deleted.
We encourage users to make
use of our Tor Onion Service to avoid disclosing their IP addresses to these
logs.</p>
