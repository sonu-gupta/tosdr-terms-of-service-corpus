To help maintain our independence and impartiality, we accept no outside advertising.
However, we may place ads for our own products and services on our own sites and online properties.
You may see ads for Consumer Reports on other websites and online properties you visit.
Ads for CR Products may be customized to your interests and preferences based on information collected as you browse online, a practice that is often referred to as interest-based advertising.
Tracking technologies like cookies and web beacons are used for these purposes.
You can opt out of interest-based advertising, as well as advertising on your mobile device, by visiting TrustARC’s Ad Preference Manager.<br>
<br>
Certain third parties that provide us with analytics services employ their own tracking technologies, such as cookies, when you visit our websites and other digital services.
Those third parties are able to collect information about your online activities across our digital services and other websites and online services.
You can opt out of data collection by some of these data providers by managing your cookies as described in our Cookie Policy and as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some CR Products, including the Consumer Reports website, use Google Analytics Advertising Features and its associated tracking technologies to help display the CR ads you see on other websites, and to help us manage and optimize our online advertising efforts.
To opt out of Google Analytics Advertising Features, visit Google’s Ad Settings page.
Website users can also access the Google Analytics Opt Out Browser Add-on.</li>
<li>Some CR Products, including the Consumer Reports website, use Adobe Analytics and its associated cookies to help us understand how users engage with our CR Products.

<p>
<b>Opting out of Geo-location Sharing</b>&nbsp;<br>
If your computer or device is equipped with GPS, connects with wireless access points or hot spots, or communicates through cell towers or satellites, then your computer or device is able to use these features to determine its precise geographic location.
The geographic location will be transmitted to CR in real time in accordance with the privacy settings you have set on your computer or device, and will continue to transmit the information to us until you have updated your settings to no longer do so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do Not Track <br>
Some Internet browsers include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” signals that give consumers control over the collection and use of web browsing information.
CR does not process or respond to such signals in users’ web browsers at this time.<br>
<br> Cookies <br>
We or our service providers may collect tracking information through cookies.
You can opt out of accepting cookies or disable them from your browser.
The Help function on most browsers contains information on how you can set your browser to notify you before accepting cookies or can disable them entirely.
If you opt out of cookies, you will not be able to take advantage of various features of the Consumer Reports website that are available to other users.

</p> Security / Protection Of Information <p>We are committed to protecting your information.
We have put in place physical, technical and administrative procedures designed to help safeguard and prevent unauthorized access and misuse of your information.&nbsp;When Consumer Reports transmits information over the Internet, we work to protect the information through the use of data encryption methods.</p>
<p>While we endeavor to protect the security and integrity of information we collect via our websites and other online properties, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that any information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers.<br>

If you create an account on a CR website, you are responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of your account password and for any activity that occurs using your account credentials.
Please notify us of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security.</p> Children's Privacy <p>CR Products are intended for general audiences and are not directed to children.
If you are the parent or guardian of a child under age 13 and believe your child has provided us with his or her personal information, please contact us.
You must be 18 or older to participate in certain activities, such as contests and sweepstakes.</p> Third Party Sites and Services <p>CR’s websites and other products contain links to websites, applications and services and incorporate social networking features maintained by third parties that operate under their own privacy policies.
Similarly, if you purchase a CR Product or communicate with us through a third party, then that third party’s privacy policy will control any information you provide to that company.
We encourage you to review the third party’s privacy policy before submitting your personal information.</p>

<br>
For all requests, you must put the statement "Your California Privacy Rights" in the subject line of your request and include your name, street address, city, state, and zip code.</p> Special Terms for Residents of the European Economic Area, Switzerland and the United Kingdom <p>The following section applies to persons in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom and Switzerland (“Data Subjects”):</p>
<p>Lawful Basis for Processing Personal Information <br>
Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), entities like CR that act as data controllers – meaning those entities that determine the purpose and means of processing of personal information -- must have a lawful basis for processing that information.
In order to provide Data Subjects with CR Products and otherwise comply with our legal obligations, CR needs to collect and process certain types of personal information from Data Subjects.
The lawful bases that we rely upon to process the personal information held about Data Subjects are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>To carry out our obligations arising from our agreements with Data Subjects, such as membership, subscriptions and donations, and to take steps at Data Subjects’ request prior to entering into such agreements.</li>
<li>To send communications to Data Subjects about our activities and offerings to the extent we have Data Subject consent or when doing so is in our legitimate interests (and not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of Data Subjects).</li>
<li>To comply with our legal obligations.</li>
<li>For consumer policy and mobilization purposes carried out in CR’s legitimate interests and in compliance with your fundamental rights and freedoms.</li>
<li>For direct marketing purposes carried out in CR’s legitimate interests and in compliance with your fundamental rights and freedoms.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br>
Personal Information Retention <br>
We shall retain your personal information for so long as is required for the purposes of the relevant agreement between you and CR (see our User Agreement) and/or in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements and tax and accounting rules.
We will endeavor not to keep personal information in a form that allows a Data Subject to be identified for any longer than is reasonably necessary for achieving the permitted purposes.
At the end of the applicable retention period, we may destroy, erase from our systems, or anonymize personal information as part of such efforts.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the personal data, the purposes for which we process the personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.<br>
<br> Storage and Transfer of Personal Information <br>
We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect Data Subjects’ personal information, prevent unlawful or unauthorized processing of personal information, and prevent unauthorized disclosure of, or accidental loss of, or damage to, such information.</p>
<p>We may process personal information in, and transfer personal information to, countries that may not guarantee the same level of protection for personal information as the country in which Data Subjects reside, and which may not have received an adequacy decision from the European Commission.</p>
<p>Personal information will also be processed by staff who work for us and operate outside the European Economic Area.
This includes staff engaged in, among other things, the provision of administration and support services.
All such staff are subject to appropriate confidentiality and security obligations.</p>
<p>We restrict access to non-public personal information about Data Subjects to those of our employees and agents who need to know the information to enable us to provide services.</p>
<p>For more information about steps we take to protect your personal data, please click here.<br>
<br> Rights in relation to Personal Information <br>
Data Subjects have certain rights in relation to their personal information, including the right to be informed about the collection and use of their personal information, as outlined in this Privacy Policy.<br>
These include, where certain conditions are met:</p>
<ul>
<li>the right to request access to the personal information we hold about them</li>
<li>the right to have inaccurate information about them amended or updated</li>
<li>the right to object to processing of personal information about them</li>
<li>the right to withdraw consent at any time (where relevant)</li>
<li>the right to have personal information about them erased or to restrict processing in certain limited situations</li>
<li>the right to lodge complaints with applicable data supervisory authorities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Data Subjects should use the contact information below to get more information and/or to make a formal request.</p>
<p>We will endeavor to keep the personal information we store about Data Subjects reasonably accurate and up-to-date by enabling Data Subjects to correct it by request or by logging into My Account and correcting it directly.
Data Subjects should notify us if any of their personal information changes or if they become aware of any inaccuracies in the personal information we hold about them.</p>
