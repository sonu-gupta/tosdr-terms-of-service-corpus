<br>
<br> 5.
Cookies, Web Beacons and Similar Technologies <p>To make our Sites and services work properly, we sometimes place small data files called cookies, or similar technology, on your device.
A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer or mobile device when you visit the site.
Technologies such as local storage allows us to store data locally within the user's browser.
This enables the website or browser to remember your actions and preferences (such as language, search history, or other preferences) over a period of time, so you do not have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another.</p>
<p>If you wish to delete the search history data contained in local storage of your browser, simply click on the “X” next to your “Recent Searches” tab and the local storage data will be deleted.</p>
<p>To learn more, please see our Cookie Policy.</p>
<p>
<strong>Google Analytics.</strong> We use Google Analytics.
We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve the Sites.
We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information.
Please refer to Google’s Privacy Policy for more information.
You may also choose to download the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on.</p>
<p>You may wish to restrict the use of cookies.
Please be aware that some of the features of our website may not function correctly if you disable cookies.</p>
<p>Most modern browsers allow you to change your cookie settings.
You can usually find these settings in the options or preferences menu of your browser.
To understand these settings, the following links for commonly used browsers may be helpful:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cookie settings in Chrome</li>
<li>Cookie settings in Firefox</li>
<li>Cookie settings in Internet Explorer</li>
<li>Cookie settings in Safari web and iOS</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br> 6.
Your Choices <p>You have control over your personal information, cookie settings, and more.</p>
<p>
<strong>Privacy Rights</strong>
<br>PicClick believes in putting you in control of your personal information.
Upon request we will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information and how it is used.
You may access, correct, or remove your personal information by contacting us as described in the “Contact Us” section below.
As required by law for taxes and other record keeping purposes, we may be unable to completely delete an account from our internal records.</p>
<p>
<strong>"Do Not Track" Technology</strong>
<br>Do Not Track ("DNT") is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.
DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services.
We do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.</p>
<br>
<br> 7.
How We Protect Your Information <p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information.
For example, when possible, we use encryption to transfer and store data.
We further limit access to this data using access controls and confidentiality commitments.</p>
<p>However, no website, application, or transmission can guarantee security.
Thus, while we have established and maintain what we believe to be reasonable procedures to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of personal information obtained through the websites, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.
You are responsible for protecting your password(s) and maintaining the security of your devices.</p>
<br>
<br> 8.
Retention and Disposal of Your Information <p>PicClick stores personal information as needed to accomplish the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy and to meet legal requirements, including record retention, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements.
Our retention of your personal information is governed by applicable law.
When the information is no longer necessary for any of these purposes, we delete it or keep it in a form that does not identify you, unless we are required by law to keep this information for a longer period.
This storage period may extend beyond the term of your relationship with PicClick.</p>
<br>
<br> 9.
Children’s Privacy <p>Our websites are not directed at individuals under the age of 16.

Additional Disclosures for Data Subjects in the EEA, the U.K., and Switzerland <p>Residents in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland (together, for purposes of this section of the Privacy Policy, “EEA”), as well as certain other jurisdictions, are entitled to certain rights and disclosures with respect to their personal information.</p>
<p>This section provides general information about how PicClick collects, stores, uses, transfers, and otherwise processes personal data in or from certain countries in the EEA, in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and its local implementations.
This section does not supersede the applicability of any privacy policy found on the website of an EEA-based PicClick affiliate with whom you have engaged, as that entity would be the data controller with respect to your personal data and the entity to which your data subject rights requests should be directed.</p>
<p>
<strong>Lawful Bases of Processing</strong> – Where a PicClick entity is acting as a data controller that determines the purposes and means of processing your personal data, such as when we collect, use, and share personal data as described in the “Information We Collect,” “How We Use Your Information,” and “How We Share Your Information” sections above, we must have a lawful basis for processing or doing so.
Our lawful bases for processing personal data include:</p>
<ul>
<li>for our legitimate business purposes, including to:</li>
<ul>
<li>respond to your customer service inquiries and requests for information;</li>
<li>maintain, improve, and analyze our websites, and the services we offer;</li>
<li>detect, prevent, or investigate security breaches or fraud.
and</li>
<li>facilitate the functionality of our websites;</li>
</ul>
<li>to comply with our legal obligations, for example to maintain appropriate records for internal administrative purposes and as required by applicable law.
and</li>
<li>on the basis of your consent.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us as described in the “Contact Us” section below.</p>
<p>
<strong>Your Data Subject Rights</strong> – In some countries, and in particular if you are located in the EEA, you may have the right to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access your personal information;</li>
<li>Correct inaccurate personal information;</li>
<li>Request erasure of your personal information without undue delay;</li>
<li>Request the restricted processing of your personal information;</li>
<li>Request portability of the personal information that you have given us.
and</li>
<li>To object to the processing of your personal information.</li>
</ul>
<p>To exercise any of these rights, please contact us as set forth in the “Contact Us” section below and specify which privacy right(s) you wish to exercise.
We must verify your identity in order to honor your request, which we will respond to within 30 days of receipt.</p>
<p>
<strong>Retention</strong> – As described in the “Retention and Disposal of Your Information” section above, as a general rule, we retain information from or about you for so long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.
When the information is no longer necessary for these purposes, we delete it or keep it in a form that does not identify you, unless we are required by law to keep this information for a longer period.</p>
<p>
<strong>Transfers Outside the EEA</strong> – Your personal information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in a country other than the one in which it was collected, including the United States.
It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for PicClick or for our third-party service providers.
This may entail a transfer of your personal information across international borders.
The data protections standards may differ and be lower than the standards enforced in your jurisdiction.</p>
<p>
<strong>Complaints</strong> – If you have any issues with our compliance, you have the right to lodge a complaint with an EEA supervisory authority.
We would, however, appreciate the opportunity to first address your concerns and would welcome you directing an inquiry first to us per the “Contact Us” section below.</p>
