</p>
<p> 1.2 <b>Supplementary Services.</b> Smartcat will provide supplementary Services purchased on the Platform selected by Customer.

Acceptance.</b>
<br> (a) Customer accepts and acknowledges that Smartcat relies solely on the use of automation and software quality control tools to perform quality control over translation Services provided to Customer under this Agreement.
Customer takes full and final responsibility for its review of the quality of the completed translation of Customer Materials (“Translated Works”) and for acceptance of such Translated Works by Customer pursuant to subsection (b) below.<br> (b) Smartcat will submit Translated Works to Customer for Customer’s review as to compliance with requirements and specifications identified in the applicable Service Task (“Acceptance Review”).
Customer will complete its Acceptance Review within five (5) business days unless another period is agreed upon by the Parties (“Review Period”).
Prior to the expiration of the Review Period, Customer shall provide Smartcat with notice through Customer’s account dashboard on the Platform of Customer’s Acceptance of the Translated Works (“Acceptance”) or of the Translated Works’ failure to meet Customer’s acceptance criteria (“Rejection”), provided however, that failure by Customer to deliver any notice in accordance with this section during the Review Period, will constitute automatic Acceptance of the subject Translated Works by Customer.
Failure by Smartcat to deliver Translated Works to Customer within the timeframe identified therefore in the applicable Service Task may constitute cause for a Rejection of such Translated Works by Customer.<br> (c) In the event of a justified Rejection by Customer, Smartcat will, at the option of Customer, either: (i) use reasonable commercial efforts to correct and remedy the failure(s) or deficiency(ies) identified by Customer (using the same or another Supplier (as defined in Section 1.4(a)) in Customer’s discretion), or (ii) negotiate with Customer in good faith a discount to the fees for the Services relating to the Translated Works which were the subject of a Rejection.
With respect to a Rejection resulting solely from a delay in delivery, the maximum discount that Smartcat may offer will be capped at 15%.<br> (d) Smartcat’s obligations under subsection (c) comprise Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy and Smartcat’s sole obligation and liability for a Rejection of Translated Works by Customer for any reason.
</p>
<p> 1.4 <b>Suppliers.</b>
<br>
<br> (a) Smartcat in each case will engage the services of such subcontractors as Smartcat deems necessary to perform the Services required by this Agreement (“Suppliers”).<br> (b) Smartcat shall be wholly responsible for payment to the Suppliers of their fees in connection with performing the Services.
In no event shall Suppliers be considered employees of Customer.<br> (c) Customer may request that Smartcat either (i) use, replace or assign additional Suppliers to a Service Task or (ii) not use or remove specific Suppliers from a Service Task, and Smartcat will use reasonable commercial efforts to accommodate Customer requests.<br> (d) Customer may invite Suppliers to register on the Platform via an invitation link.
Smartcat does not provide any additional services to such Suppliers (including, but not limited to, listing Supplier’s profile on the Platform search) except those services that are required to establish and maintain efficient collaboration and delivery of the results of the Service Task.
The Customer may not invite Suppliers who are the Customer’s employees.<br> (e) Customer agrees, during the term of this Agreement and for three (3) years thereafter, not to solicit any Suppliers (except for Suppliers invited by the Customer as per par.1.4(d) above) for employment or consulting, directly or indirectly, for Customer or for any business or organization in which Customer, or any of the beneficial owners of Customer, if Customer is a legal entity, has an ownership interest of any kind.
For the avoidance of doubt, Suppliers are considered to be invited by Customer if: (i) such Supplier’s account was not viewed on the Platform by Customer prior to invitation (ii) the Supplier’s account on the Platform was registered by the invitation link generated from Customer’s account with the Platform.<br>
</p>
<p> 1.5 <b>Delays.</b> In the event of (a) a delay by Customer in delivering Customer Materials or responding to questions relating to Customer Materials, (b) a delay due to Customer’s request for changes to Customer Materials or any other terms of the applicable Service Task, (c) a dispute in good faith between the parties as to whether Translated Works meet the requirements specified in the applicable Service Task, (d) a delay due to any third party’s act, failure to act or delay in performing any obligation whatsoever, other than the act, failure to act or delay by a Supplier, or (e) any other delay incurred as a result of Customer’s actions, the delivery schedule set forth in the Service Task shall be deemed postponed for an equivalent period.
No such delay shall relieve or suspend Customer’s obligation to pay Smartcat under Section 2 hereof and, in addition to such payment obligations, Customer shall pay for all reasonable expenses incurred by Smartcat in connection with any such delay.
In the event of delay due to the act, failure to act or delay in performing obligations by one or more Suppliers, Customer’s sole recourse shall be to request that such Suppliers shall be replaced and Smartcat’s duties shall be considered met upon so replacing the Suppliers, as applicable.
