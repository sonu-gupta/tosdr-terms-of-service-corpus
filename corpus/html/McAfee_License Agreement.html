<p>"License Entitlement" means the number and type of devices and users that are permitted to use the Software, as specified in the documents that accompanied your purchase or download, which (depending upon the channel from which you purchased the license) may include: the checkout payment page, a product description page on our website, the email confirmation that we send for the purchase, the package if purchased at a retail store, or another document made available to you when you purchased the product.
If no licensed device count or user count was specified, the License Entitlement is for a single device and user.</p>
<p>"Service Entitlement" means the scope and duration of the Services you purchased, as specified in documents made available to you when you purchased the product.
If no scope or duration is specified in the documents, the Service Entitlement is for a single device and user for one year.</p>
<p>"System Requirements" means the supported devices and operating systems that the particular McAfee product will function properly with, as listed on our&nbsp;<u>website</u>.
It is your responsibility to meet System Requirements, such as obtaining updates or upgrades in order to continue using the Software.</p>
<p>
<b>License Grant for Small Business Use.</b> This license permits use of the Software only by personnel employed by the licensed small business entity.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and subject to registration of the Software, we hereby grant to you a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the Software on the number of devices for which you have purchased subscription licenses as set forth in the documents that accompanied your purchase, provided that such use is only for the subscription term purchased by you, solely by personnel employed by you, and solely for internal business operations.
(For the purpose of this Agreement, use of the Software means to access, install, download, copy or otherwise benefit from using the Software).
You acknowledge that the Software and all related information are proprietary to us and our suppliers.
You will be entitled to Updates which are made generally available by us for so long as you maintain your subscription.
This license is revocable by us as provided in this Agreement.</p>
<p>Your use of the Software is limited to devices and operating systems we support and may be affected by the performance and compatibility of your hardware, software and Internet access.
Meeting system requirements is your responsibility and you are responsible for the cost of your equipment, which may include obtaining updates or upgrades from time to time in order to continue using the Software.
System requirements are set forth on the product description page.
(For purposes of this Agreement, product description page means either the webpage describing the product and/or the applicable product data sheet).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>You must register each license to the Software that you purchase.
Registration is required in order to obtain technical support, in order to claim any included Virus Removal Service session per year of annual subscription per purchased license, and so that any licenses that you purchase in the future will have the same renewal date as your initially purchased licenses.
Unused sessions do not roll-over to the next subscription year.
It is your obligation to ensure that someone within your organization has access to your registration account and the email address identified in the account profile in order to obtain support from us and to receive the pro-rata rate on additional license purchases described below.</p>
<p>If you purchase additional licenses of the Software which you registered to your account in the future and you use the email address identified in your account profile for the new purchases, the initial term of the additional licenses will be automatically reduced so that the renewal date is the same as the renewal date of the Software licenses you initially purchased.&nbsp.
In that event, you will be charged a prorated subscription price based on a calendar day basis for the reduced initial term.
If you do not register your initial licenses to your account, or you do not use the email associated with the account during checkout, you will receive no pro-rata pricing and the subscription term of such additional licenses will be the term that you purchased.</p>
<p>If the Agreement terminates for any reason or expires, neither you nor any personnel employed by you will be authorized to use or access the Software, including any online storage or backup services, and we may cancel and/or close your account at our sole discretion.

<b>Dark Web Monitoring Services</b>

<p>We also offer dark web monitoring services outside of the McAfee<sup>Â®</sup> Identity Theft Protection offering discussed above.
Our dark web monitoring service searches dark web data available to us and alerts you if the personal data you have chosen to monitor has been found on the dark web.
The dark web is a part of the internet that is hidden from ordinary search engines and can be used by cybercriminals to commit identity theft.
We monitor the personal data you choose to provide us by using certain proprietary sources of information owned by or licensed to us.
If we find that the personal data you have chosen to monitor has been compromised, you will receive an alert.
Alerts may be sent through a variety of means, including in-product notifications, via email to an address that you provide or, if available and if you so choose, via an SMS message to a phone number that you provide.
By using the service, you understand and agree to the following additional terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>We cannot remove your breached information from the dark web.</li>
<li>It is your responsibility to review the alerts and take any recommended actions in order to protect yourself against further misuse of your data.</li>
<li>While our data sources are updated continually, we do not guarantee that it contains all instances in which your personal information has been compromised, nor do we claim that our service can prevent your information from being hacked from a third-party company in the first place.</li>
<li>We provide you alerts based on the dark web data available to us.
We provide you this information as is, and do not guarantee its accuracy.</li>
<li>We can only monitor the information that you have chosen to provide us for monitoring.</li>
<li>You are responsible for providing accurate personal data for monitoring.</li>
<li>You are responsible for keeping your contact information up to date in order to receive alerts.</li>
<li>If you choose to receive alerts via SMS messaging, standard text messaging rates may apply, including, where applicable, roaming charges.

<b>BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>For all non-European Union customers.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes.</b>&nbsp;Subject only to the Small Claims Court Option described below in this section, any claim, dispute or controversy of any kind, regardless of the type of claim or legal theory or remedy ("Claim") by either you or us against the other arising from, relating to or in any way concerning the Agreement, the Software, or Services shall be resolved by confidential binding arbitration.
This agreement to arbitrate includes, but is not limited to: (i) Claims relating to the enforceability or interpretation of this Agreement, including any of these arbitration provisions.
(ii) Claims by you, and also Claims made on your behalf or connected with you, such as an employee, representative, agent, predecessor, successor, heir, assignee, or trustee in bankruptcy.
(iii) Claims that relate directly to us, and/or to our parent, affiliates, subsidiaries, successors, assignees, employees, and agents.
and (iv) Claims that could have been asserted as part of a class action, private attorney general or other collective, consolidated, or representative action, it being expressly understood and agreed to that the arbitration of such claims must proceed solely on an individual (non-class and non-representative) basis and the arbitrator shall have the authority to award relief only on an individual (non-class and non-representative) basis.
YOU AND WE AGREE THAT NO CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, CONSOLIDATED ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMS MAY BE PURSUED IN ARBITRATION, NOR MAY SUCH ACTIONS BE PURSUED IN COURT.
BY ACCEPTING THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, YOU AND WE AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO INITIATE OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR COLLECTIVE OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION OF ANY KIND.</p>
<p>
<b>Notice of Dispute.</b> The party seeking arbitration must first notify the other party of the dispute in writing at least 60 days in advance of initiating arbitration.
When sent to us, notice should be sent to McAfee, 5000 Headquarters Drive, Plano, TX 75024, Attention: Legal Department.
The notice must include your name, address, and contact information, the facts giving rise to the dispute, and the relief requested.
You and we will use reasonable efforts to resolve any dispute through informal negotiation within 60 days from the date the notice of dispute is sent.
After 60 days, you or we may commence arbitration.
Notwithstanding these notice obligations, any demand for arbitration must be made by you or us within the statute of limitations that is applicable to the Claim(s) upon which arbitration is sought or required.&nbsp.
These notice obligations do not modify the statute of limitations that is applicable to any Claim(s).</p>
<p>
<b>Administration of Arbitration.</b> If any dispute is not resolved by informal negotiation, any claim, dispute, or controversy will be, at the demand of either party, conducted exclusively by binding arbitration governed by the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"), and not state law.
Subject only to the Small Claims Court Option for individual consumers described below,&nbsp;<b>YOU AND WE ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE (OR PARTICIPATE IN AS A PARTY OR CLASS MEMBER) ALL DISPUTES IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY.</b>&nbsp;Instead, all disputes will be resolved on an individual basis before a single, neutral arbitrator and the proceeding will be confidential.
The arbitrator will be either a lawyer admitted to practice law in his or her jurisdiction and with at least ten yearsâ€™ experience or a retired or former judge selected in accordance with the rules of the AAA.
The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement, and the arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules or Consumer Arbitration Rules of the AAA, as applicable, as modified by this Agreement (the "Arbitration Rules").
For more information, see adr.org or call 1-800-778-7879.
Except with respect to any claims or counterclaims seeking less than $25,000, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned, written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
All arbitration proceedings will be conducted in English, and the United States FAA will govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings pursuant to the binding arbitration clause in this Agreement.
The award will be confidential and only disclosed as is necessary to obtain judgment or as otherwise required by law.
You and we further agree that a judgment may be entered upon the award by any court having jurisdiction.
The arbitration award will determine the rights and obligations between the named parties only, and only in respect to the claims in arbitration, and will not have any bearing on the rights and obligations of any other dispute.</p>
<p>
<b>Costs.
</b>The party initiating the arbitration will pay the initial filing fee.
If you file the arbitration and an award is rendered in your favor, we will reimburse your filing fee.
We will pay the fees and costs for the first day of any hearing.
All other fees and costs will be allocated in accordance with the arbitration rules.
However, we will advance or reimburse filing and other fees if the arbitrator rules that you cannot afford to pay them or if you ask us and we determine there is a good reason for doing so.
Each party will bear the expense of their respective attorneys, experts, and witnesses and other expenses, regardless of who prevails, but a party may recover any or all expenses from another party if the arbitrator, applying applicable law, so determines.</p>
<p>
<b>Small Claims Court Option.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are an individual consumer, you may choose to sue us in small claims court in your county of residence or in Santa Clara County, California if you meet the courtâ€™s requirements.</p>
<p>
<b>Right to Resort to Provisional Remedies Preserved by McAfee.</b>&nbsp;Nothing herein will be deemed to limit or constrain our right to resort to self-help remedies or to comply with legal process, or to obtain provisional remedies such as injunctive relief, attachment, or garnishment by a court having appropriate jurisdiction.
provided, however, that we may elect to arbitrate any dispute related to such provisional remedies.</p>
<p>
<b>Conflicting Terms.</b> In the event of a conflict between the Arbitration Rules and this arbitration agreement, this arbitration agreement will govern.
If any portion of this arbitration agreement is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it will not invalidate the other provisions of the arbitration agreement.
provided, however, that (a) if the prohibition on class-wide arbitration is deemed invalid, then this entire arbitration agreement will be null and void.
and (b) if the prohibition on arbitration of representative claims brought in a private attorney general capacity is deemed invalid, then the arbitration agreement will be null and void as to such claims only.
This arbitration agreement will survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.
In the event of a conflict between this arbitration agreement and any other applicable arbitration provision, this arbitration agreement will control.</p>
<p>
<b>WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.
IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN THROUGH ARBITRATION, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT THERE WILL NOT BE A JURY TRIAL.
YOU AND WE UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY DISPUTE THAT IN ANY WAY RELATES TO OR ARISES OUT OF THE AGREEMENT OR FROM ANY SOFTWARE OR SERVICES.&nbsp.
&nbsp;IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS PARAGRAPH MAY BE FILED TO SHOW A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A TRIAL BY THE COURT.
This paragraph in no way invalidates the Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes.</b>

<b>GENERAL LEGAL TERMS</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Law Covering This Agreement.</b>&nbsp;Except as provided in the Local Law Section below, this Agreement, the use of the Software and Services, the relationship of the parties, and any disputes arising out of, concerning, or relating to the Agreement, including any disputes between you and us, will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of New York, excluding its conflict of law principles, except that the FAA governs all provisions relating to arbitration.
If for any reason, the laws of the state of New York are found not to apply, then, except as provided in the Local Law Section below, this Agreement, the use of the Software, Services, the relationship of the parties, and any disputes arising out of, concerning, or relating to the Agreement, including any disputes between you and us, will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Delaware, excluding its conflict of law principles, except that the FAA governs all provisions relating to arbitration.
The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act do not apply to the Software or Services.</p>
<p>
<b>Attacks on Data.</b> You acknowledge that some security breaches involve attacks on data.
For example, there are viruses and other malware that: (i) delete or destroy your data (sometimes individual files, but sometimes even an entire disk by corrupting a master boot record or other key element).
(ii) modify your files (such as parasitic malware that attaches itself to a file and modifies the file to enable its own execution and/or propagation).
and (iii) encrypt files on your drive (such as ransomware that uses asymmetric encryption).
The best way for you to protect yourself from these types of attacks is frequent back-ups of your data to another device or location.
That way, you have another copy of the data that the attacking software has deleted, modified, or destroyed.
While we will use commercially reasonable efforts to remove the attacking malware or virus, it is your sole and exclusive responsibility to back-up all data and files on your device so that they can be restored in the event of an attack on your data.
Without such a back-up, it may not be possible to restore the deleted, destroyed, or modified data.
We will have no liability for loss of or recovery of data, or files or loss of use of systems or networks arising from attacks on data.</p>
<p>
<b>Limited Warranty.</b>&nbsp;For 30 days after the purchase date ("Warranty Period"), for paid versions of the Software only, we warrant that the Software licensed under this Agreement (including updates provided during the Warranty Period but not for updates provided outside of the Warranty Period) will perform substantially in accordance with the documentation provided by us in connection with that Software at the time of purchase, and that any tangible medium (such as a CD-ROM, but excluding devices manufactured by other companies) on which the Software is contained and provided to you will be free from defects in materials and workmanship.
We do not warrant or guarantee that any particular mobile device or computer will be compatible with or function with the Software or Service, nor do we warrant or accept any liability for the operation of your personal equipment that is used to access the Software or Service.
Your sole remedy, and our and our suppliersâ€™ entire liability, in case of any breach of this limited warranty is that we will, at our option, refund the price you paid for the license, replace the defective medium that contains the Software, re-perform the Service, or provide an alternative remedy as required by local consumer law in your jurisdiction.
These remedies may not be available in some countries to the extent that we are subject to restrictions under applicable export-control laws and regulations.
If the tangible medium is defective, you must return it at your expense to the place where you bought it and provide a copy of your receipt.
Any replacement medium will be warranted for the remainder of the original Warranty Period.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER.
THE ABOVE WARRANTIES ARE YOUR EXCLUSIVE WARRANTIES.
THEY REPLACE ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS, TERMS OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, PERFORMANCE, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
EXCEPT FOR THE LIMITED WARRANTY IN THIS SECTION, THE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS".
YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR SELECTING THE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES TO ACHIEVE YOUR INTENDED RESULTS, FOR INSTALLING AND USING THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICE, AND FOR THE RESULTS OBTAINED.
WE DO NOT WARRANT OR GUARANTEE THE SOFTWAREâ€™S OR SERVICEâ€™S USE OR PERFORMANCE.
WE DO NOT WARRANT OR GUARANTEE THAT THE SOFTWAREâ€™S OR SERVICEâ€™S OPERATION WILL BE FAILSAFE, UNINTERRUPTED, OR FREE FROM ERRORS OR DEFECTS, OR THAT THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES WILL PROTECT AGAINST ALL POSSIBLE SECURITY THREATS (INCLUDING INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT BY THIRD PARTIES), THAT THERE WILL BE NO MALFUNCTIONS OR OTHER ERRORS IN THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES CAUSED BY VIRUS, INFECTION, WORM OR SIMILAR MALICIOUS CODE NOT INTRODUCED OR DEVELOPED BY US, OR THAT THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS.
WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY DOWNTIME OR SERVICE INTERRUPTION, FOR ANY LOST OR STOLEN DATA OR SYSTEMS, OR FOR ANY OTHER DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY ACTIONS OR INTRUSIONS.</p>
<p>
<b>High Risk Activities.</b>&nbsp;The Software and Services are not fault-tolerant and are not designed or intended for high-risk activities such as use in hazardous environments requiring failsafe performance, including nuclear-facilities operations, air traffic communication systems, weapons systems, direct life-support machines, or any other application in which the failure of the Software or Services could lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe physical or property damage.
We expressly disclaim any express or implied warranty of fitness for high-risk activities.</p>
<p>
<b>Limitation of Liability.
</b>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES ARE WE OR OUR SUPPLIERS, LICENSORS OR OTHER THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY: (I) INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.
(II) THEFT OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION OR COST OF PROCURING SUBSTITUTE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES, AND (III) DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF PERSONNEL SALARIES, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, LOSS OF DATA, OR NEGLIGENCE OF ANY KIND, OR FOR ANY OTHER INDIRECT DAMAGE OR LOSS.
IN NO EVENT WILL OUR, OUR AFFILIATESâ€™ OR OUR SUPPLIERSâ€™, LICENSORSâ€™ OR OTHER THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERSâ€™ AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR DIRECT DAMAGES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE PRICE YOU PAID FOR THE APPLICABLE SOFTWARE, OR USD $100 (OR THE EQUIVALENT AMOUNT IN NATIONAL CURRENCY) IF YOU USED FREE SOFTWARE.
You agree to the limitations of liability in this Section and acknowledge that without your agreement to this term, the fee charged for the Software would be higher.

Export Administration Regulations ("EAR") and implementing regulations.
You agree that you will not directly or indirectly export, transmit, permit access or use the Software or Services and its related documentation, including technical data, in any country to which export, transmission or access is restricted by regulation, statute, or other law, without any required authorization of the Bureau of Industry and Security of the U.S.
Department of Commerce or any other governmental entity that may have jurisdiction over export or transmission.
You will not use, transfer or access any McAfee Products for end use relating to any nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, missile technology, or the military end use or military end user per 15 CFR Part 744.21 unless authorized by the U.S.
Government by regulation or specific license<b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Export to a particular individual, entity, or country may be prohibited by law.
If McAfee receives notice that a user is or becomes identified as a sanctioned or restricted party under applicable law, McAfee will not be obligated to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement if such performance would result in violation of the sanctions or restrictions.

Those third-party materials may include software source code licensed by third parties under one or more open-source or free-software licenses, including the GNU General Public License, which are considered "Open Source Software." The Open Source Software is licensed under terms and conditions different from this Agreement and may, in some cases, conflict with the terms of this Agreement and will apply instead of the terms of this Agreement.

<p>
<b>No Waiver.</b> We do not waive any provision of this Agreement unless we waive it in a signed writing.</p>
