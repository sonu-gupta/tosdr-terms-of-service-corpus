         Copyright Guideline 1.
Copyright <p>Copyright is a legal right given to authors or creators of original works including literature, music, paintings, films and photos in order to control uses of their works.<br>
Authors or copyright holders have certain excusive rights to protect their works.<br>
<br>
"To control uses of work" means that a copyright holder retains the rights to copy, modify or transfer their own works.<br>
For example, if a picture is uploaded and shared on the Internet without the copyright holder's permission, the uploader's act is violating the copyright.<br>
<br>
Copyright is the exclusive right and its holders can specify who, where and how to use their works.<br>
<br>
The following examples show you some copyrightable contents:</p>
<ol>
<li>* TV programs<br> * Films and the trailers<br> * Music and the lyrics<br> * Advertisements<br> * Texts in books and magazines<br> * Photos and images</li>
