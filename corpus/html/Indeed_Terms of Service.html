</p>
<p>Below you will find Indeed’s terms and conditions, including our cookie and privacy policies.
We know we are giving a great deal of information.
Indeed does this for a reason: we want you to have as much knowledge about what we do for you at Indeed as is possible.
We do not want you to wonder about any of our processes or procedures or guess as to what your interaction with Indeed means.
We want you to understand it, which is why we must explain it in detail.
We urge you to read these terms or any section of interest to you.
You are agreeing to proceed under them.</p> &nbsp.

<p>We’ve moved this section to our Privacy Center.
Please visit our Privacy Center to view Indeed’s Privacy Policy.</p> &nbsp.
Your California Privacy Rights &nbsp.
&nbsp.
<p>By availing yourself of the rights afforded in this section of our Privacy Policy, you are declaring that you are a California resident:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other residents: You may make a verified request to Indeed regarding your Personal Data.
While Indeed does not sell your Personal Data, you can nonetheless make a formal request to delete your Personal Data held by Indeed.
This process is detailed in Section 10 of our Privacy Policy, which also describes the designated address information for making requests to Indeed regarding your Personal Data.</p>
<p>
<b>The Right to Know Your Personal Data</b>
</p>
<p>You have the right to request that we disclose the Personal Data we collect, use, disclose and “sell” (<i>we explain this term further in Section 13.2, below</i>) about you.
For more information on how to exercise this right, please see Section 10 of our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>The following sections of our Summary of Indeed’s Privacy Policy explain the categories of Personal Data we collected over the past twelve (12) months (section 3), why we collected this information (section 4), and the third parties with which we shared it (section 5).&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also cover these topics more expansively in our Full Privacy Policy: sections 2.1-2.3 explain the categories of Personal Data we collect.
sections 4, 5, and 9 explain the purposes for which we use your Personal Data.
and sections 4.12 – 4.16, 8, 9 and 11 explain our disclosure of your Personal Data to third parties.</p>
<p>
<b>The Right to Opt-out of the Sale of Your Personal Data</b>
</p>
<p>To learn more about Indeed’s approach to California’s “<i>Do not sell my personal information</i>” requirement, why it applies to your use of our Site, and how you can exercise this right, please go to https://www.indeed.com/legal/ccpa-dns.
There, we explain how California has defined as “sales” under the CCPA certain transfers of Personal Data between Indeed and its affiliates that are integral to the products and services we offer to our users.
We do <b>not</b> “sell” your Personal Data in the traditional sense.
More information on Indeed’s affiliates and our inter-affiliate transfers can be found in our Privacy Center at https://hrtechprivacy.com/.</p>
<p>California’s “<i>Shine the Light</i>” law (Civil Code section 1798.83) also permits California residents once per calendar year to request and receive information about a business’ disclosure of certain categories of Personal Data to other companies for direct marketing purposes.
If you are a California resident and a user of our Site, you can request a copy of this information from Indeed by sending an email to privacy-dept @ indeed.com (remove spaces).
Please include your name and email address with your request.
Indeed reserves the right to request additional Personal Data from you to confirm your identity before responding to this request.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>The Right to Non-Discrimination for Exercising Your Privacy Rights</b>
</p>
<p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your rights under the CCPA.</p> &nbsp.

Indeed General Terms of Service <p>
<b>Last Updated:<b>
</b> December 14, 2020 </b>
</p> &nbsp.
<p>&nbsp;</p> &nbsp.
A.
Terms of Service for Job Seekers &nbsp.
&nbsp.
1.
Job Ads or Job Listings <p>Indeed, which is free to those individuals searching for employment openings (“Job Seekers”), may make available Job Ads advertising employment opportunities and other job-related content, including links to third-party websites (“Job Listings” or “Job Ads”), through Indeed’s search results or otherwise through the Site.
Searching for Job Ads on Indeed is free for Job Seekers.
Job Ads are created and provided by third parties over whom Indeed exercises no control.
you acknowledge and understand that Indeed has no control over the content of Job Ads, links to or from Job Ads, or any conditions third parties might impose once a Job Seeker has submitted an application or left the Site.
For example, some of these third parties may attempt to charge Job Seekers a fee to apply to a particular job, although Indeed endeavors not to make such Job Ads available on the Site.
If you leave the Indeed Site and choose to enter a third-party website, you accept any terms and conditions imposed by that third-party.
Employer websites may have conversion trackers or other functionality provided by Indeed, which informs us that an application has been completed on an Employer site.
An Employer who installs such functionality is required under this Agreement to provide any notice, and obtain any prior consent, that may be required by applicable law.
However, you acknowledge and agree that Indeed has no control over such an Employer or its website.
You agree to Indeed’s use of, and receipt of information from, any such conversion tracker functionality.
Except for sponsored, featured or paid placements, the Job Ads contained on, or linked from, the Site are indexed or posted in an automated manner.
Indeed has no obligation to screen any Job Ads, or to include any Job Ads in its search results or other listings, and may exclude or remove any Job Ads from the Site for any or no reason.
We cannot confirm the accuracy or completeness of any Job Ad or other information submitted by any Employer or other user, including the identity of such Employer or other user.
Indeed assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all liability for the content, accuracy, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of any Job Ads, Company Pages, screener questions and responses, and assessments.
Additionally, Indeed may provide search options to narrow down Job Ads search results by job type categories (i.e.
full-time, part-time, etc.), and such categories are created independently and entirely by Indeed, and may not directly or accurately reflect the content of the Job Ads.
Indeed may reformat Job Listings so that you may read them more clearly on a mobile phone.
While Indeed may in some circumstances be compensated by employers who post Job Ads, helping keep Indeed job search free for Job Seekers, all Job Ads are considered advertising.
Indeed displays Job Ads based on a combination of employer bids and relevance, such as search terms, and other information provided and activities conducted on Indeed.
You are not permitted to use Indeed’s Site or its content other than for non-commercial purposes.
For purposes of this Section A of the Indeed General Terms of Service, all references to “you” or “your” shall mean you, the individual or organization accessing this Site in your capacity as a Job Seeker.
Indeed may provide functionality to call a telephone number contained in a Job Ad using the phone app on a mobile device.
Indeed cannot guarantee that the extracted phone number is the correct phone number for the Employer or for the Job Ad you are viewing.</p> 2.
Resumes and Recommended Jobs <p>By creating a public resume through the Site, you are requesting and authorizing Indeed to make available your resume to third parties, such as Employers, that Indeed believes may have an interest in your resume.
By creating or uploading a resume on Indeed (an “Indeed Resume”), Indeed may share with you Job Listings that match the contents of your Indeed Resume.
Indeed assumes no responsibility and disclaims all liability for the resume or application information you post, send or receive through the Site.
If you see any inaccuracy in any such material, it is your responsibility to correct such information or to contact Indeed to do so.
To protect your privacy, Indeed may mask or hide your contact information, such as your email address, from your resume or application, for example, and may substitute it with an alias.</p>
<p>Indeed may also automatically send you recommended jobs via the email address you use to create an Indeed account or apply to a job.
Indeed may determine what these recommended jobs are on the basis of a variety of factors, including but not limited to, any information you input on the Site about yourself (including in your Indeed Resume), searches you run on the Site, jobs you click on, jobs you apply to, or the materials you provide in a job application to an Employer through Indeed.</p> 3.
Applying to Jobs Through Indeed <p>Any resume or application information that you submit through the Site, including Personal Data included in a resume, application or responses to screener questions and assessments (“Indeed Apply”), is subject to this Agreement (including Section D.3.) and to Indeed’s Privacy Policy.
Once you provide information to an Employer (whether in the form of a job application, resume, email, or otherwise), Indeed does not have control over the Employer’s use or disclosure of that information.
If you want to request the Employer delete, modify, or maintain confidence over any such information, you must make such a request directly to the Employer.
(All references on the Site to “Apply Now”, “Easily Apply”, “Simple Apply”, “Apply from your phone”, “Apply with Indeed”, “RSVP to hiring event” or any similar references mean “Indeed Apply.”) Indeed may use your application materials to determine whether you may be interested in a Job Listing, and Indeed may reach out to you about such Job Listing.
Indeed may store such information regardless of whether a Job Listing has been closed or is no longer available on the Site.
To maintain the quality of the Site and Services, Indeed in its sole discretion may impose limits on your ability to apply to Job Listings or to other Indeed services.
In addition, when you indicate your interest in a Job Listing through Indeed Apply or by RSVPing to a hiring event you are sending your resume and application information to Indeed, and you are requesting and authorizing Indeed to make available such application information to the applicable Employer(s) for such Job Listing(s).
When you ask Indeed to transmit an application or a message, including, but not limited to, a signed offer letter, to an Employer via Indeed Apply or Indeed’s relay system, or store such application, you understand that this is without warranty, and that Indeed reserves the right to reformat such application or message.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that Employers may request that Indeed assemble your application materials, resume, answers to screener questions, assessment responses and other information you provide to Indeed into one document, and you agree that in doing so, Indeed assembles these application materials on your behalf.
When you apply for a job on Indeed you agree to Indeed’s performance of automated processing in relation to your application, as such processing is an essential part of this Agreement.
Additionally, you consent to your application and any responses sent to you by the Employer (including offer letters) through Indeed being processed and analyzed by Indeed according to this Agreement and Indeed’s Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>When you apply to a job using Indeed Apply, Indeed will attempt to send your application to the contact information provided to us by an Employer or their Agent.
We cannot guarantee that such messages and applications will be delivered, received, accessed, read or acted upon.
Indeed also does not guarantee that any Employer will receive, be notified about, access, read or respond to any such resume or other application material, or that there will be no mistakes in the transmission or storage of the data.
However, Indeed may alert you when any of the above events occur.
Please note that Job Ads may expire between the time you submit your application and from the time it is received.
Indeed has no responsibility for expired Job Ads or for delivering applications prior to a Job Ad’s expiration.&nbsp;In addition we cannot vouch for the validity of the contact information provided to us by Employers.
We also cannot vouch for the technical capabilities of any third party sites, including but not limited to Applicant Tracking Systems (ATSs).
If you do not feel comfortable sending an application or messages in this manner, or having your application or messages stored on Indeed, do not use the Indeed Apply or Indeed relay functions and please send your application or messages directly to the Employer by whatever other method you so choose, including the public mail system.
You may contact the Employer directly to find alternative methods of application if you do not wish to apply through Indeed.
By using the Indeed Apply system, you fully consent to the above.</p>
<p>If you require alternative methods of screening or application you must approach the Employer directly to request such as Indeed is not responsible for the Employer application process.</p>
<p>By using Indeed, you agree that Indeed is not responsible for the content of the Employer’s job application, messages, screener questions, skills assessments or their format or method of delivery, and that Indeed does not guarantee receipt of your application by the Employer, or your receipt of messages from the Employer.
Please note that Indeed does not choose the questions asked by Employers or decide the job qualification criteria of Employers.
Some questions may be labeled as Optional, indicating only that the application may be submitted to the Employer without providing an answer.
Indeed cannot guarantee that the Employer will consider such an application or make a particular determination with regard to such an application.
Indeed may inform Job Seekers that an Employer’s requirement from a job description does not appear to be present on a resume or application.
this information is presented without warranty and Indeed does not guarantee that updating a resume or application will result in any job offer.
Indeed does not guarantee the identity of an Employer or any individuals working for any Employers, and cautions Job Seekers when applying to jobs.
Indeed cannot make any guarantee&nbsp;regarding health and safety measures in an Employer’s hiring or interviewing process.
Indeed recommends Job Seekers follow personal health and safety best practices as recommended by the World Health Organization&nbsp;or similar institution.&nbsp;<strong>Indeed does not guarantee the validity of a job offer and cautions Job Seekers to verify the validity of a job offer before taking an adverse action regarding their current employment situations.
Job Seekers are solely responsible for verifying the accuracy of any Employer or job offer.</strong>
</p>
<p>Indeed may use your application materials (including resumes and responses to screener questions) and the recency of your activity on Indeed to determine whether the words of any Job Seeker’s resume and answers to screener questions match the words of a Job Listing or Resume query, and vice-versa.
You agree and consent that Indeed may differentiate those matching resumes and screener questions from those that do not match, and present them to Employers as matches or not matches.
Indeed may also use such information in order to improve the Site or any other Indeed product or service (including by displaying or otherwise making available potentially relevant Job Listings and resumes to Job Seekers and Employers).
By using Indeed Apply and answering screener questions, you acknowledge that Employers may have instructed Indeed to send out rejection notices if your answers do not match the answers sought by the Employer, and you acknowledge that Indeed has no discretion in the transmission of these rejections.
Indeed may offer Employers the ability to activate a feature on their account called Employer Assist.
Activating Employer Assist means the Employer is instructing Indeed to send a message on the Employer’s behalf to the Job Seeker informing them that the Employer has determined not to move forward with their application.
These notices are automatically sent after a period of time selected by the Employer, unless the Employer indicates to Indeed their interest in your application.
You acknowledge and agree that Indeed has no discretion in the sending of these messages, and that any such messages are solely a result of the Employer’s decision to activate Employer Assist and to not take an action on your application on Indeed within the time period selected by the Employer.
Any interactions the Employer has directly with you and not through a tool provided by Indeed (for example, calling or emailing you directly instead of through an Indeed Relay Service) are not visible to Indeed, and would not by themselves prevent an Employer Assist rejection notice from being sent.</p>
<p>When you search for jobs on the Indeed Job Search app and proceed to apply for a job, including jobs on third party sites, Indeed may suggest information from your Indeed profile to include in your application.
It is your responsibility to review suggestions before accepting them and including them on your application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For job seekers located in the UK, you acknowledge that when contacted by Indeed, presented as Indeed Hire (hereinafter referred to as “Indeed Hire”), Indeed is acting as an Employment Agency (as defined under applicable law).
The services Indeed Hire offers are set out in these terms.
Indeed Hire will only send you Job Listings that Indeed Hire determines may be of interest to you.
You further acknowledge that Indeed Hire is not authorised to receive any money on your behalf and/or to enter into any contracts on your behalf.
You may also end your relationship with Indeed Hire at any time.</p> 4.
Communications and Other Actions on the Site <p>When you view, send, store or receive materials (including Job Listings, resumes, messages, applications, questions and responses in applications, and any other information) through or using the Site, Indeed may, for example, use such materials for data analysis, quality control, or to refine the Site or any other Indeed product or service (including to provide better search results and other listings for Job Seekers and Employers), whether via automated means or otherwise.
When an Employer views, sends, stores or receives materials through or using the Site, Indeed may inform you about such actions.
Additionally, we may also inform you that an Employer has taken other actions with regards to a Job Ad, your Resume, or your application, such as pausing or closing a Job Ad, opening your Resume or application, viewing your Resume or application, responding to your Resume or application, and making a decision with regards to your application or Job Ad.
Indeed may inform the Employer about activities you take on the Site or your use of the Site, for example, whether you are online on Indeed, and you hereby consent to Indeed taking such actions.</p>
<p>If you have turned on browser push notification and wish to turn them off, you may do so by visiting the settings on your browser.</p>
<p>Indeed may offer you the opportunity to receive a text message interview reminder from Indeed when an Employer has scheduled interviews with you.
In such an event you will enter your phone number on the Indeed consent form and by entering your phone number you are representing and confirming it is your phone number and that you have the right to accept text messages at the number.
Indeed will only send you a text message reminder for such interview and you agree to accept such text message reminder on your cell phone, including messages sent by automated telephone dialing system.
Please note that since these text message services depend on the functionality of third-party providers, there may be technical delays on the part of those providers.
We also cannot vouch for the technical capabilities of any third parties to receive such text messages.</p>
<p>Indeed may also insert functionality into messages relating to your application allowing you to place calls directly to third parties.
Please note this functionality is provided solely as a courtesy and that such calls are not placed through or tracked by Indeed.
Your standard calling rates with your phone provider will apply.</p>
<p>You may receive messages, including but not limited to text messages, emails or email notifications corresponding with your or an Employer’s (in the event you applied for a job) activity on or use of the Site, Indeed Apply, Indeed Chat, or any other communications service, product, or feature provided on or through the Site.
In all cases, such messages or notifications are provided solely as a courtesy, and you should not rely on them.
For example, if you accept an interview request, it is your responsibility to follow up with the employer separately to ensure they know your response, do not rely on notifications through Indeed.
Indeed may use your email address to create an alias email address for your communication, in lieu of displaying your actual email address to the Employer.
Should you choose to send an email from a third party email client, the person with whom you’re communicating may be able to see your email address, rather than the alias.
Indeed disclaims all warranties with regards to the transmission or storage of such courtesy notices, does not guarantee their delivery or receipt, and does not guarantee the date or time at which they may be sent.
In the event a message being sent is intended for a closed account, these messages will not be deliverable.</p>
<p>Indeed may enable chatbots, which allows you to take certain actions on the Site, such as apply to a job, schedule an interview, or otherwise interact with the Site, Employers, or Job Listings on our Site (“Chatbot”).
You understand that the Chatbot is an automated service that does not involve human interaction.
It is your responsibility to ensure the accuracy and completeness of information submitted through the Chatbot.
Indeed is not responsible for any loss, damage or inconvenience arising as a consequence of the use (or inability to use) the Chatbot or from the information you submit via the Chatbot.</p>
<p>Indeed reserves the right to turn on or enable Indeed Chat or other communication options for select Employers or Job Listings, in its sole discretion, and to notify you that Indeed Chat or other communication options are available for a particular job or Employer.
For Indeed Chat, you may access or view your messages by visiting your Indeed Chat messages dashboard.
Indeed may, in its sole discretion, turn off or disable Indeed Chat for any Employer or Job Seeker at any time without prior notice.
Please note that if you are using Indeed Chat to communicate with an Employer, Indeed will deliver your messages as instructed by the Employer.</p> 5.
Virtual Communications <p>Employers may offer you the opportunity to participate in virtual and remote communications using Indeed products, including but not limited to, phone interviews, virtual meetings, and video interviews (“Virtual Interviews”).
You understand that Indeed is not a telecommunications service provider and that Indeed is only providing the option for you to communicate with Employers via services that may be offered by third-party providers.
Please note that since these telecommunication services may depend on the functionality of third-party providers, there may be technical delays or malfunctions on the part of those providers.
We cannot vouch for the technical capabilities of any third parties to receive, transmit, or support such phone or video communications.
Indeed does not guarantee any aspect of your Virtual Interview experience including transmission of phone or video communications, quality of audio/visual content, data security, or data usage and restrictions.
<strong>Indeed is not liable for any claims arising out of your use of Virtual Interviews and you release Indeed from any such claims.</strong>
<br> You understand that Indeed does not guarantee the Employer’s schedule or availability for conducting Virtual Interviews and cannot vouch for the validity of the contact information provided to us.
You also understand that the Employer is responsible for any and all questions, comments, or hiring decisions made.
Further, Employers are responsible for any accommodations you need during Virtual Interviews.</p>
<p>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THERE IS NO PROTECTION FOR ANY INFORMATION YOU SHARE OR DATA THAT YOU TRANSMIT WHILE PARTICIPATING IN VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, AUDIO/VISUAL CONTENT, INTERVIEW QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS, OR YOUR IMAGE OR LIKENESS.
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT INDEED IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR SECURING OR PROTECTING ANY DATA OR INFORMATION THAT YOU SHARE OR TRANSMIT DURING YOUR USE OF VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS.
INDEED ASSUMES NO LIABILITY FOR THE MISUSE OF ANY DATA YOU SHARE OR TRANSMIT THROUGH USE OF VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS.</p>
<p>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU ACCESS AND USE VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND THAT INDEED DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS.</p> 6.
Indeed Assessments <p>Indeed Assessments is an online tool for the provision and review of skills assessments selected by Employers (“Assessments”) and responses from Job Seekers (“Responses”) through the Site.
Employers may use the Indeed Assessments tool to send you Assessments, to which you may provide Responses.
After you provide a Response, the Employer will be able to use the Indeed Assessments platform to review the Response.
If there are multiple versions of the same Assessment, the Response percentile for any Job Seeker will be determined only in relation to other Responses to the same version of that Assessment.</p>
<p>An Assessment only evaluates a particular skill.
It does not evaluate a Job Seeker’s qualification for any job.
Whether a particular skill is relevant to a job, or whether a Job Seeker is qualified or appropriate for a job, is decided solely by the Employer sending the Assessment and reviewing your Response.
Receiving or responding to an Assessment does not guarantee a job or job offer, or a job offer at any particular salary, or any further communication or action by any Employer.
An Employer is the sole party to determine whether a Response indicates a qualified Job Seeker.
Employers may have instructed Indeed to send out rejection notices if you have not responded to Assessments in a manner acceptable to the Employer, and you acknowledge that Indeed has no discretion in the transmission of these rejections.
The Employer is the sole party to determine whether to consider any retaken Assessments as part of their hiring process.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and understand that Employers select which Assessments to associate with their job openings, and that Indeed does not choose the Assessments sent by Employers and has no control over Employers’ selection or use of Assessments.
You agree that the questions in any Assessment are solely being asked by the Employer sending the Assessment and are not being asked by Indeed.
<b>You further agree that Indeed is not responsible for offering alternative methods of screening, if so required by the Americans with Disabilities Act or any other equivalent or similar law, and that the responsibility for offering any such alternative method lies solely with Employers</b>.
If you require an accommodation, or any alternative method(s) of Assessment, screening or application, you must indicate it to the Employer.
Indeed may provide a means by which you may request such an alternative method or other accommodation from the Employer.
Indeed does not guarantee the Employer’s receipt of, or response to, any such request.
While Indeed is guided by WCAG 2.1, Level AA in our efforts to design and develop accessible offerings, as outlined in the accessibility statement, Indeed does not warrant that the method of delivery of any Assessment question is compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act or any equivalent or similar law.</p>
<p>You agree and acknowledge that the usefulness and value of Assessments and Responses depend on their contents being kept confidential.
You therefore agree to keep the content of Assessments and Responses confidential and to not reproduce or discuss them with anyone, except that you may communicate with an Employer about an Assessment they have sent to you and your Response.</p>
<p>Indeed does not have any obligation to screen any Assessment or Response, or to include any Assessment or Response in the Site, and may exclude or remove any Assessment or Response from the Site for any or no reason without liability or notice.
Assessment links sent to you may continue to be active after an Employer has paused or closed their job campaign on Indeed.
Once an Employer pauses or closes their Job Ad (for example, after the Employer has made a hire), Indeed cannot guarantee that the Employer will view any related notices or updates, including Assessments, Responses, and accommodation requests.
You may still choose to take the Assessment for the purpose of adding its results to your Indeed Profile or for another job application.</p>
<p>Indeed may also offer you the option to select an Assessment to complete independent of a particular job, and your Response will be associated with your Indeed Profile.
You may choose whether the Response is available to Employers viewing your Indeed Profile, though Indeed will count the Response for purposes of generating aggregate Response statistics even if Your Response is hidden.</p>
<p>As a Job Seeker, you consent to your Responses, applications, and any other communications sent through Indeed Assessments being processed and analyzed by Indeed according to this Agreement and Indeed’s Privacy Policy.
You are requesting and authorizing Indeed to make your Response available to the Employer providing the Assessment, or (in the case of Assessments selected by you) to any Employer viewing Your Indeed Profile.
You understand that this is without warranty, and that Indeed reserves the right to display or reformat Responses in a manner to permit Employers to review your Response together with Responses from other Job Seekers.
Indeed may aggregate the results of all Job Seeker-selected Assessments for the purpose of displaying the percentile for Your Response.
You also acknowledge that once you have requested that Indeed transmit your Response to an Employer, that request cannot be canceled.
Indeed does not guarantee that any Employer will receive, access, read or respond to any Response, or that there will be no mistakes in the transmission of the data.
However, Indeed may alert you when any of the above events occur.</p>
<p>As a Job Seeker, you shall not create or send any Response which: (i) contains any highly confidential personal information, such as bank account or credit card information, online account information, social security numbers (or similar counterparts outside the United States of America), health information, or other categories of data subject to special breach notification requirements in any country.
(ii) contains proprietary information, trade secrets, confidential information, advertisements, solicitations, chain letters, pyramid schemes, investment opportunities, or other unsolicited commercial communication (except as otherwise expressly permitted by us in writing).
or (iii) directly or indirectly violates the Site Rules.</p>
<p>Indeed does not act as an employment agency by offering the Indeed Assessments tool.
By using Indeed Assessments, you acknowledge and agree that Indeed is not procuring employees for Employers or procuring opportunities to work for Job Seekers.
Indeed merely provides a tool enabling Employers and Job Seekers to exchange Assessments and Responses as they determine.
The sole responsibility for the content of any Assessment or Response, any requests for interviews or offers made, any issues arising from an acceptance or denial of employment, and any other issues arising from the use of Indeed Assessments, is solely with Employers or Job Seekers as applicable.</p>
<p>As a Job Seeker, you agree that any rights you have under any applicable employment, equality or discrimination laws, the US Fair Credit Reporting Act, any corresponding state laws, or any similar laws regulating consumer or credit reporting agencies in other countries, may only be asserted against the Employer.</p>
<p>Indeed is not a third party beneficiary of or liable for any agreements between an Employer and Job Seeker, regardless of whether or not Indeed receives a fee from the Employer in connection with the transaction.
Indeed will not be liable for any costs or damages arising out of or related to such transaction.</p>
<p>Indeed assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all liability, for the content, accuracy, validity, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of the Site, the Indeed Assessments tool, and any Assessment or Response.</p> 7.
Salary, Career, Hiring and Other Information Provided by Indeed <p>Indeed may provide some information and content to users for informational purposes only.
For example, Indeed may provide you with data regarding estimated salaries for a given Job Listing, or number of applies to a Job Listing,&nbsp;or the likelihood that a particular event will occur such as being selected for an interview.&nbsp;This information&nbsp;provided by Indeed is based on estimates given for informational purposes only and without warranty, and is subject to change or varying levels of accuracy.
Indeed may also include salary estimations on pages other than Job Listings on the Site.
Please note that all salary figures are approximations based upon multiple third party submissions to Indeed, including from Indeed affiliates.
These figures are given to Indeed users for the purpose of generalized comparison only.
Minimum wage may differ by jurisdiction and you should consult the employer for actual salary figures.</p>
<p>Similarly, career-related or hiring-related information provided by Indeed is for informational purposes only, and is in no way to be construed as professional career counseling or staffing services.
You understand that Indeed may give suggestions or information regarding best-practices, however, you understand that it is ultimately your responsibility to determine how to pursue your job search or candidate search.
You further understand that in providing any such career or hiring guides, Indeed is not acting as a job placement agency or staffing firm.
You also understand that by referring to or using such career or hiring guides, you are not guaranteed job interviews, job placement, or assurance of being hired, and you take full responsibility for use of these services or guides.
As a user of the Site, Indeed may, from time to time, send you emails from the career or hiring guides as part of its services to you.
These emails may include but not be limited to, tips on improving your resume or how to use your resume effectively in the job application process, commonly asked interview questions, next steps after you have submitted an application, and how to prepare for a new job after you have been hired.</p>
<p>Indeed may offer, as part of the Services, the opportunity for you to engage with third parties, sometimes referred to as career coaches&nbsp;or professional writers, to discuss job search,&nbsp;resume writing, or&nbsp;career strategies, either through the Site or in person.
Regardless of how you interact with them, you acknowledge that these third parties are not employees of Indeed and that Indeed is not responsible for the content of any such discussion.
Do not share any information you consider confidential or personally sensitive with these third parties.
Indeed does not guarantee the quality or effectiveness of any advice, recommendations, or guidance you may receive from these third parties.
You agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by law, Indeed will have no liability arising from any discussion you have with such a third party.</p> 8.
Your Job Seeker Data <p>As a Job Seeker, you take a variety of actions on our Site.
For example, you search for jobs, and Indeed knows and stores the titles of jobs you search for and click on, where those jobs are located, the general salary range or experience level of the jobs you view (if indicated on the Job Listings), the Job Listings you apply to, your amount of activity or time of most recent activity on Indeed, information you provide directly to Indeed including desired salary or past experience, or any of your other behavior on the Site.
You know exactly what this data is because you are the person who undertook the activity and the data pertains only to your activity.
If you have an Indeed account or an Indeed Resume, you agree that Indeed may associate this data with your Indeed Profile and use this observed factual data to suggest jobs to you and to suggest you or your public resume to Employers that might be interested in a person who matches your behavior on Indeed.
You also agree that Indeed may contact you based on this observed behavior on behalf of Employers or Indeed itself.
Please note, the aforementioned actions do not include information sent to you by a third party, however, Indeed may publicly display the fact that you have recently used the Indeed Site to correspond with a third party.
<strong>In addition, if you set your Resume to public, this means that Indeed may share all of the aforementioned information about yourself with third-party Employers.
If you do not wish to share such information, you may set your Resume to private.</strong>
</p> 9.
Screening Tools <p>Indeed may make screening tools available to Employers for Employer use in the application process, including screener questions, phone screen tools and assessments.
Indeed is licensing these tools for Employers’ use as determined by Employers.
As a Job Seeker you agree that the Employer has made the determination to use these tools as part of its application process, and the questions asked are solely determined by the Employer, and are not being asked by Indeed.
The Employer is the sole party to determine which answers will qualify a candidate and is solely responsible for the use of the screening tool including any results which are considered to have a “disparate impact”.
You further acknowledge that only the Employer is responsible for offering alternative methods of screening, if so required by the Americans with Disabilities Act or any other equivalent or similar law.
While Indeed is guided by WCAG 2.1, Level AA in our efforts to design and develop accessible offerings, as outlined in the accessibility statement, Indeed does not warrant that the method of delivery of these questions is compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act or any equivalent or similar law.</p> 10.
Governing Law and Dispute Resolution <p>This Agreement and any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or related in any way to the Site (“Dispute”) will be governed as to all matters, including, but not limited to the validity, construction and performance of this Agreement, by and under the laws of the State of Texas, United States of America, if you are located in the United States, or the laws of the Republic of Ireland, if you are located elsewhere, without giving effect to conflicts of law principles thereof.
Any and all actions, lawsuits, or other legal proceedings related to such Dispute shall be filed only in courts located in Travis County, Texas, U.S.A., if you are located in the United States, or Dublin, Ireland, if you are located elsewhere.
Each of the Parties hereby consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located in Travis County, Texas, U.S.A, if you are located in the United States of America, or Dublin, Ireland, if you are located elsewhere.</p>
<p>You also hereby waive any right to a jury trial in connection with any action or litigation in any way arising out of or related to your use of the Site or these terms of service, if you are located in the United States.</p> 11.

As partial consideration for your use of the Site and these services, you agree not to sue Indeed as a class plaintiff or class representative, join as a class member, or participate as an adverse party in any way in a class-action lawsuit against Indeed regarding your use of the Site.
Additionally, as a Job Seeker, your use of job search on the Site is at no charge and you acknowledge that part of the price you are paying to use this Site is your acceptance of these terms of service including this Class Action Waiver.

Nothing in this paragraph, however, limits your rights to bring a lawsuit as an individual plaintiff, including in small claims court, subject to Section 10 above.</p> &nbsp.
B.
Terms of Service for Employers &nbsp.
&nbsp.
<p>The following terms and conditions apply to all Employers and other users who access or use the Site as intended for individuals and/or organizations seeking to make available information regarding employment openings, on their behalf or other’s behalf, including but not limited to agencies purchasing for multiple parties, or otherwise indicate their acceptance to this Agreement.
For purposes of this Section B of the Indeed General Terms of Service, all references to “you” or “your” shall mean you, the individual or organization accessing this Site in your capacity as an Employer.</p>
<strong>1.
Employer Accounts</strong>
<p>When you create an Indeed account, a Company Page or post job listings advertising employment opportunities and other job-related contents, including links to third-party websites (“Job Listings” or “Job Ads”) on the Site, whether as part of the Indeed Ads Program or otherwise, you agree that this Agreement, the terms associated with any Indeed service you are using, and all of Indeed’s policies, including the Indeed Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy, apply to you.
When you create an Indeed account, Indeed may require that you verify your identity through a third party service called Mitek.
By using Mitek, you are submitting your identification documents for verification through Indeed to Mitek, you are agreeing to share your identification and identity with Mitek, and you agree that Mitek is solely responsible for any use or loss of data you provide.&nbsp;This process will not involve the capture or storage of any biometric identification or biometric identifiers.</p>

Indeed is not responsible for and disclaims all liability if your email is used improperly or falsely by a third party.
By registering for an Indeed account, you agree to receive mandatory email updates regarding anomalous activity to your Indeed account.
If you attempt to send an email from a name or email address that is not true, accurate, current or complete, we reserve the right to drop such email, and attempting to send such email is a violation of our terms.</p>
<p>In some instances, multiple users may be linked to the same account (“a Linked Account”).
A Linked Account is created when the primary account owner(s) (“Admin(s)”) of an Employer account invites other users to the same account.
Admin(s) can provide these other users varying levels of access and functionality (“Roles”) within the account, as described on the site.
If you are an Admin adding a user to a Role or several Roles, you represent to Indeed that you are an authorized representative of this account and that you have the authority to allow this data and access to be shared.
You further agree to indemnify and hold harmless Indeed from any allegations, claims, actions, suits, demands, damages, liabilities, obligations, losses, settlements, judgments, costs and expenses (including without limitation attorneys’ fees and costs) that result from the sharing of this data and access to your account.
You agree that Indeed assumes no liability in regards to the accuracy of the statements above and that you are fully responsible for said accuracy.
When using a Linked Account, any users with access to certain Roles may have access to any or all account information, including but not limited to: communications and actions of all other users and applicants within the Linked Account, resume contacts, and billing information, and you consent to such access.</p>
<p>Change of Address: If you have provided a billing address to us, and you change such billing address from an address within the United States to an address outside the United States, or from an address outside of the United States to an address inside the United States, you will continue to be bound by this Agreement with the same Indeed party for the remainder of the calendar month in which you made the change.
Beginning on the first day of the next calendar month, you hereby agree that you will be bound by this Agreement with the applicable Indeed party identified in the first paragraph of this Agreement with respect to such new territory.</p>
<p>If your Indeed employer account has a credit card on file to pay for one Indeed product or service, Indeed may charge that card for any additional products or services you order.</p>
<strong>2.
Employer Services Including Indeed Apply and Screener Questions</strong>
<p>You also agree that, as a service to Job Seekers, Indeed may activate its Indeed Apply relay function for use in connection with your Job Listings, and that any Job Seekers who wish to indicate an interest in such Job Listing may only do so through Indeed Apply, and that Indeed will send applications to the email address you provide us with.
You also agree that Indeed may activate a chat bot, which enables Job Seekers to apply to your Job Ad by answering questions.
The answers a Job Seeker submits are presented to you as a job application.
When you use Indeed candidate management tools, including but not limited to your Employer Dashboard, or by activating the Indeed Apply relay function for your Job Listings, you acknowledge and agree that Indeed may make available functions allowing you to take actions regarding the Job Seeker, such as tools for setting up an interview, viewing a resume and rejecting a candidate.
You agree that by using such candidate management tools, you are instructing Indeed to assemble the candidate’s application materials, resume, answers to screener questions, assessment responses and other information you provide to Indeed into one document.
You further agree that Indeed is not responsible for maintaining or storing such application materials, and that you are responsible for your own compliance with any applicable record retention requirements.
By using these tools, you are providing information to Indeed and requesting and authorizing us to make available such information to the applicable Job Seeker.
Additionally, you consent to any information shared through Indeed being processed and analyzed by Indeed according to this Agreement and Indeed’s Privacy Policy.
Indeed may store such information regardless of whether a job vacancy has been filled.</p>
<p>You are responsible for the contents of your emails, application form, screener questions or their format, Company Pages that you create, any Job Listings that you post, and any messages that you send through Indeed Apply or otherwise, and agree that Indeed is not responsible for such content and disclaims all liability for such content, including as to whether such content is legal.
You agree that Indeed may reject or remove any Job Listing, any part of any Company Page, or any questions for Job Seekers for any or no reason.
Indeed further does not guarantee delivery, your receipt of the Job Seeker’s emails or application materials, or that there will be no mistakes in the transmission or storage of the data.
In the event a message being sent is intended for a closed account, these messages will not be deliverable.
If you do not feel comfortable sending a message, including but not limited to an offer letter, to a Job Seeker through Indeed’s relay functions, do not use the Indeed relay functions and please contact the Job Seeker via the personal information provided in such Job Seeker’s resume or application or by whatever method you so choose.
When using the Indeed Apply function, Indeed will attempt to send applications to the contact information provided to Indeed by you, however, Indeed has no ability to verify the contact information provided by you.
In the event you provide incorrect contact information, it shall be your responsibility to correct, appropriately respond, or take any steps necessary to protect the privacy of such Job Seekers, and you indemnify Indeed for any damages resulting therefrom.</p>
<p>When you use the Indeed Apply relay function for your Job Listings, you acknowledge and agree that Indeed may add functions into the corresponding Indeed Apply emails.
In addition, Indeed may, on your behalf, send out reminder emails to Job Seekers you wish to interview.
Indeed may also send emails to Job Seekers on your behalf indicating that your Job Listing is potentially a match for the Job Seeker’s resume.
When you use screener questions, you may be given the option to instruct Indeed to send out rejection notices if the Job Seeker has not answered the questions in the manner set forth in the online instruction.
If you choose such option, you agree you are instructing us to send out rejection notices to such candidates and set them to rejected in your candidate dashboard.
You further acknowledge that Indeed has no discretion in the transmission or storage of these or all other rejection notifications (which is purely mechanical), that transmission or storage is not guaranteed, and that the Job Seeker may not have answered the screener questions accurately.
When you use Indeed’s candidate management tools, you may be given the option to send automatic rejection notices to candidates whose status you set to “rejected”.
If you choose such option, you acknowledge that Indeed has no discretion in the transmission or storage of rejection notices.</p>
<p>You agree that Indeed may take action to try to identify and reduce spam applications, and that one method of doing so may include imposing a cover letter requirement for such applicants.
Indeed does not verify the identity of any Job Seekers who apply to your job listing, nor does Indeed know a Job Seeker’s motivation for applying to your job listing, and thus provides no guarantee as to the Job Seeker’s qualifications or interest in your job listing.
You agree that Indeed Apply and Indeed’s relay functions are presented to you without warranty and Indeed assumes no responsibility for the communications between you and the Job Seeker, which communications are yours’ and the Job Seekers’ sole responsibility.</p>
<p>By using any automated phone screen product, you agree that you are requesting Indeed to send a Job Seeker a telephone number, which the Job Seeker may call with the purpose of answering your telephone screening questions.
You agree these questions are part of your application process, are solely determined by you, and are not being asked by Indeed.
You also agree that you are only asking Indeed to record the Job Seeker’s answers to your screening questions and that Indeed will forward you the recording of the answers to your questions.
You consent to Indeed listening to and analyzing the recording in accordance with Indeed’s Privacy Policy.
Indeed disclaims all warranties with regards to the transmission or storage of such phone screens and responses, does not guarantee their delivery or receipt, and does not guarantee the date or time at which they may be sent.</p>
<p>You shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Indeed, its agents, affiliates, and licensors from any third-party claim or liability (including without limitation reasonable legal fees) arising out of any Company Page created by you, or any Job Listing or screener questions (or answers thereto) posted by you, or any message sent by you (including any questions for Job Seekers contained in any of the foregoing).
Indeed may make Job Ad analytics data available on a Company Page or elsewhere on the Site, and may provide analytics data regarding your Employer account to anyone at your company at Indeed’s discretion.
To the extent permitted by law, if you have an unpaid or outstanding invoice or account balance for any Indeed product, Indeed reserves the right to suspend or terminate your use of that Indeed product as well as any other Indeed product, including but not limited to those Indeed products where you do not have an unpaid invoice or account balance.
Indeed may elect to apply (i) penalties for late payment as per contemporaneous US Federal Reserve interest rates plus 10% or the maximum interest permitted by law, whichever is lower and (ii) a statutory lump-sum indemnity for recovery cost, if provided for under applicable laws, and (iii) any reasonable expenses and attorney fees Indeed incurs collecting such late payments.</p>
<p>When you view, send, store or receive materials (including Job Listings, resumes, and messages) through or using the Site, Indeed may, for example, use such materials for data analysis, quality control, or to refine the Site or any other Indeed product or service (including to provide better search results and other listings for Job Seekers and Employers), whether via automated means or otherwise.
When you view, send, store or receive materials through or using the Site or when you simply use or visit the Site, Indeed may inform a Job Seeker that you have taken an action, for example, with regards to a Job Ad, Job Seeker’s Resume, or application such as pausing or closing a Job Ad, opening the Resume or application, viewing the Resume or application, responding to the Resume or application, and making a decision with regards to the application or Job Ad, and you hereby consent to Indeed taking such actions.</p>
<p>Indeed, in its sole discretion, may add labels or badges to Employer names or Job Ads, such as, “Responsive Employer” or “Active Employer”.
Indeed shall determine the method by which such labels or badges are determined or which Employers qualify.
The lack of a label or badge may indicate that Indeed does not have sufficient data to determine if an Employer qualifies.
</p>
<strong>3.
Job Match</strong>
<p>Indeed may use Job Seekers’ application materials (including resumes and responses to screener questions) and the recency of their activity on Indeed to determine whether the words of their resume and answers to screener questions match the words of your Job Listing or Resume query, and vice-versa.
You further agree and consent that Indeed may differentiate those matching resumes and screener questions from those that do not match, and present them to you as matches or not matches.
Indeed may also use such information in order to improve the Site or any other Indeed product or service (including by displaying or otherwise making available potentially relevant Job Listings and resumes to Job Seekers and Employers).</p>
<strong>4.
Salary, Applies or Other Information Provided by Indeed</strong>
<p>Indeed may provide some information and content to users for informational purposes only.
For example, Indeed may provide Job Seekers with data regarding estimated salaries for a given Job Listing, or provide you with estimated applies to your Job Listing.
All such figures provided by Indeed are estimates given for informational purposes only, and they are subject to change or varying levels of accuracy.
With respect to information regarding estimated applies, if you are participating in the Indeed Ads Program, please note that this is not the information you are purchasing from Indeed and you are not charged per apply.
Indeed may also include salary estimations on pages other than Job Listings on the Site.
Please note that all salary figures are approximations based upon multiple third party submissions to Indeed, including from Indeed affiliates.
These figures are given to Indeed users for the purpose of generalized comparison only.
Minimum wage may differ by jurisdiction and you should consult the employer for actual salary figures.
Indeed may also provide data regarding impressions in relation to your job ad.
Such figures are provided for informational purposes only, are subject to change at any time, and Indeed does not guarantee their accuracy.
Indeed reserves the right to change the method of measuring such figures at any time.</p>
<strong>5.
Screening Tools</strong>
<p>Indeed may make available to you&nbsp.
screening tools for your use during the application process, including screener questions, phone screen tools and assessments.
Indeed is licensing these tools to you for your use as you determine.
By using any screening product, made available to you by Indeed, you agree that you have made the determination to use these tools as part of your application process, and the substantive questions you ask or choose are solely determined by you, and are not being asked by Indeed.
You are the sole party to determine which answers will qualify a candidate.
You are solely responsible for the use of the screening tool including any results which are considered to have a “disparate impact”.
<strong>You further acknowledge that you are responsible for offering alternative methods of screening, if so required by the Americans with Disabilities Act or any other equivalent or similar law.</strong> While Indeed is guided by WCAG 2.1, Level AA in our efforts to design and develop accessible offerings, as outlined in the accessibility statement, Indeed does not warrant that the method of delivery of these questions is compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act or any equivalent or similar law.
You agree to indemnify Indeed for any and all claims arising out of your use of a Screening Tool, including any claims that any screening tool does not comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act or similar or equivalent law, or that such Screening Tool results in a “disparate impact”.</p>
<p>Indeed may offer Employers the ability to activate a feature on their account called Employer Assist.
Activating Employer Assist means the Employer is instructing Indeed to send a message on the Employer’s behalf to the Job Seeker informing them that the Employer has determined not to move forward with their application.
To prevent a rejection notice from being sent, you must indicate your interest in the application on Indeed.&nbsp;Any interactions you have directly with a Job Seeker and not through a tool provided by Indeed (for example, calling or emailing a Job Seeker directly instead of through an Indeed Relay Service) are not visible to Indeed, and will not prevent an Employer Assist rejection notice from being sent.
If you activate Employer Assist then you must interact with a Job Seeker through a tool provided by Indeed to prevent an Employer Assist rejection notice from being sent.
If you activate Employer Assist you agree that you are instructing Indeed to send these messages to candidates with whom you do not interact within your chosen time frame, and you agree to indemnify Indeed from any claims arising therefrom.</p>
<strong>6.
Communication through Indeed</strong>
<p>You may receive messages, emails or email notifications corresponding with your or a Job Seeker’s activity on or use of the Site Indeed Apply, Indeed Chat, or any other communications service, product, or feature provided on or through the Site.
In all cases, such messages or notifications are provided solely as a courtesy, and you should not rely on them.
For example, if you wish to interview a job seeker, it is your responsibility to follow up with the Job Seeker separately to ensure they know about the interview, do not rely on notifications through Indeed.
Indeed may use your email address to create an alias email address for your communication, in lieu of displaying your actual email address to the Job Seeker.
Should you choose to send an email from a third party email client, the person with whom you’re communicating may be able to see your email address, rather than the alias.
Indeed disclaims all warranties with regards to the transmission or storage of such courtesy notices, does not guarantee their delivery or receipt, and does not guarantee the date or time at which they may be sent.
In the event a message being sent is intended for a closed account, these messages will not be deliverable.</p>
<p>Specifically, if you post a Job Listing directly on Indeed, applications are sent only to your Indeed dashboard.
any other notifications you may receive are provided solely as a courtesy to you.
For example, you may not receive application email notifications if a Job Seeker has not answered screener questions correctly, although these applications will be sent to your Indeed dashboard.
Indeed reserves the right to turn on or enable Indeed Chat or other communication options for select Employers or Job Listings, in its sole discretion, and to notify Job Seekers that Indeed Chat or other communication options are available for a particular job or Employer.
For Indeed Chat, you may access or view your messages by visiting your Indeed Chat messages dashboard.
If you do not wish to use Indeed Chat, you may turn it off by visiting your Indeed Chat dashboard.
Indeed may, in its sole discretion, turn off or disable Indeed Chat for any Employer or Job Seeker at any time without prior notice.</p>

<strong>1.
Accessing External Sites</strong>
<p>The Site contains links to other sites on the Internet which are owned and/or operated by third-party vendors and other third parties (the “External Sites”).
You acknowledge that Indeed is not responsible or liable for any such third parties or for the availability of, or the materials located on or through any External Sites.
You should contact the site administrator or webmaster for the applicable External Site if you have any concerns regarding such links or the materials located on an External Site.</p>
<p>In addition, Indeed may provide you with links to third party sites that offer you services for your use or benefit.
We may stop offering any such third party sites or services at any time.
<strong>If you choose to use such third party sites or services, you enter into an agreement with such third party alone at your own risk.</strong> When entering into an agreement with such parties, you are giving them your data directly and your rights and their obligations are determined by their privacy policies and terms of service.
<strong>We are not responsible for any content or services provided by these third parties, and disclaim all liability from anything that may occur when you utilize such third parties.</strong>
<strong>We are additionally not responsible for any payment that may be asked of you by such third party.
You will be notified on the site that these are third party sites and services, and not Indeed.</strong>
</p>
<p>For example, Indeed may provide you with access to a link on Indeed to background check services offered and performed by a third party (each a “Third-Party Background Check Service”).
This service may be offered in the form of permitting a Jobseeker to request their own background check or permitting an Employer to request a background check of a Jobseeker.
If you choose to use this link and these services, you are contracting directly with the Third-Party Background Check Service, and Indeed is not a party to this contract.
Please note (and you acknowledge) that Indeed cannot and does not assemble, access, view, analyze, manipulate, alter, evaluate or store the background check reports provided by any Third-Party Background Check Service to you or to any other Indeed user.
Indeed operates solely as a technical conduit, allowing the transmission of background checks sent by a Third-Party Background Check Service to you.
Further, you agree to fully indemnify and defend Indeed for any claims arising out of your use of a Third-Party Background Check Service’s services or a background check provided to you by a Third-Party Background Check Service.</p>
<p>Pages on the Site may embed content and information provided by third-party APIs, which is subject to additional terms and conditions imposed by those third parties.
For example, the Site may include Google Maps features and content, which is subject to the current versions of: (1) the Google Maps/Google Earth Additional Terms of Service.
and (2) the Google Privacy Policy.
Information on Company Pages includes publicly available information and/or information provided by the respective company and/or may come from third parties.
For example, data about companies located in Japan may come from Toyo Keizai Shinpo Inc.</p>
<p>Please note that while this Agreement describes Indeed’s services generally, services may differ by availability, and you should check the Site in your location to see which services are available to you.
For example, while some parts of this Agreement describe matching services, Indeed does not offer any matching services in Japan.</p>

<p>Although Indeed has no obligation to do so, Indeed may monitor User Content, and reserves the right to delete any User Content or portion thereof that, in Indeed’s sole discretion, violates the above rules, including any User Content that is unrelated to the specific portion of the Site on which it is posted, or that is an advertisement, recruiting or other commercial message (other than Job Advertisements permitted by this Agreement), or that Indeed deems in its sole discretion to be inappropriate.
If you believe that any User Content violates this Agreement or our policies, please contact Indeed immediately so that we may have the opportunity to consider its removal.
You acknowledge and agree that Indeed does not have any obligation to host or remove any User Content, and i) the interpretation of whether any User Content violates any Indeed policy, ii) whether to publish or to withdraw from publication any User Content, and iii) whether to exclude any material that any party seeks to post on Indeed, will always remain within the sole discretion of Indeed.

Indirect discrimination means, for example, that a Job Listing implicitly excludes certain classes of Job Seekers by making it impossible for them to qualify for the job requirements.
You understand and agree that it is your responsibility to refrain from posting any Job Listing that directly or indirectly discriminate against Job Seekers or otherwise violate applicable law.</p>

Claims of Infringement</strong>
<p>U.S.
Copyright Infringement.
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA“) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S.
copyright law.
If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by Indeed infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked.
The notice must include the following information as required by 17 USC.
§ 512(c)(3)(A): (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
(b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works).
(c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Indeed to locate the material on the site.
(d) the name, address, telephone number, and email address (if available) of the complaining party.
(e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send Indeed a counter-notice.
Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA.
see http://www.loc.gov/copyright/ for details.
Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Site should be sent in writing to Indeed Copyright Notice, 6433 Champion Grandview Way, Building 1, Austin, TX, 78750, USA (copyright @ indeed.com) (remove spaces when sending email).
We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice.
Also, be aware that there are penalties for false claims under the DMCA.<br> Other Claims of Infringement.
For claims of infringement that do not involve a U.S.
copyright, please contact us via our Site contact form.</p>

Indeed Products Terms of Service <p>
<b>Last Updated:<b>

&nbsp.
&nbsp.
Indeed Ads Program Terms &nbsp.
&nbsp.
<p>These Indeed Ads Program Terms (“IAP Terms”) form a part of, and are incorporated into, the&nbsp;Indeed Terms of Service&nbsp;(the “Agreement”), and apply to any Employer who accesses or uses the Indeed Ads Program, or who otherwise indicates its acceptance of these Indeed Ads Program Terms.</p>
<p>Any capitalized terms that are used but not defined in these IAP Terms have the meaning set forth in the Agreement.</p>
<strong>1.
The</strong> Program <p>Use of the Indeed Ads Program (“Program”) on or through the Site is subject to all applicable Indeed terms and policies, including without limitation the Indeed Privacy Policy and those instructions provided on the Website, if you are using the Ads Program, through our on-line forms.
Indeed policies may be modified at any time.
With regards to any job advertisements posted on Indeed, either for payment or posted for free and including jobs provided to Indeed via an XML feed (“Job Listings” or “Job Ads”), you agree that you are solely responsible for all: (a) ad or job content (including job descriptions and screener questions) and target URLs (“Creative”), whether generated by or for you, including but not limited to photograph(s) you provide to Indeed.
and (b) websites proximately reachable from Creative URLs and your services and products (collectively “Your Services”).
You shall protect your passwords and take full responsibility for your own and any third party’s use of your accounts.
Job Ads may be placed on (y) any content, service, or property provided by Indeed (“Indeed Property”), and (z) any other content or property provided by a third party (“Publisher”) upon which Indeed places Job Ads or provides search results of Job Listings (“Publisher Property”).
Indeed does not guarantee performance or placement of Job Ads, and distribution on Indeed and Publisher Properties may vary depending on demand, industry, sponsorship, and other considerations.
By sponsoring a Job Ad, you are agreeing to pay a price for each user “click” (a user action that results in a job description being displayed to the user) that such an ad receives.
By sponsoring a Job Ad you are requesting that Indeed manage the visibility of your Job Ads in the Indeed Search Engine Results Page to give your job exposure, in a way designed to make the experience on Indeed better for you and get your jobs better visibility.
“Exposure” does not always mean the Job Ad will get a particular spot on the page, or that it will be called out with special wording, but means that it will be placed by Indeed in accordance with Indeed judgment and discretion in order to achieve what Indeed determines, in its sole discretion, to be the best visibility for such a job, considering the budget.
By sponsoring a job you are requesting Indeed to manage this relative visibility and exposure on its search engine results page.
You acknowledge and agree that such management of sponsored Job Ads is in Indeed’s sole discretion and is provided without warranty as to how and where Indeed shall place such Job Ads.
You shall direct only to Indeed any communications regarding Job Ads on Publisher Properties.
By posting or sponsoring a Job Ad on Indeed, including but not limited to by XML feed: you agree that Indeed may and authorize Indeed to reformat and host (but not change the content of) the Job Ad on an Indeed hosted page or in its publisher network in any way Indeed sees fit.
All dashboards will reflect the total click count, including the clicks that open an Indeed reformatted or hosted page.
In the event you provide Indeed with an indication that you are looking to fill your role in a short time period, as determined by Indeed, Indeed may add a label (such as “Urgent”, “Urgently Hiring” or similar) next to the word “Sponsored” on the search results page where your Job Ad is displayed.
Indeed may use words or phrases interchangeably (for example, “Ad”, “Urgently Hiring”, “Paid”, “Promoted”, “Sponsored”, “Urgent” or similar) in connection with a sponsored advertisement on Indeed.
Job Ads posted directly on Indeed may no longer appear on the Site after a period of time.
in some cases, these Job Ads may need to be sponsored in order to remain visible or become visible again.
However, Job Ads indexed by Indeed will expire after a period of time and Indeed is unable to restore their visibility.
If you sponsor a Job Ad but do not provide a payment method for your campaign, the job campaign will not begin and your Job Ad will not be visible.
Indeed may in its sole discretion remove the budget and post the job with organic visibility.
Indeed may require sponsorship for the display of any Job Ad at any time for any reason.
Indeed may recommend or suggest a budget for any Job Ad to maintain or optimize its visibility.
The suggestion is made without warranty and is not a guarantee regarding placement or visibility of any Job Ad.
If you are located in Japan, you acknowledge that Indeed’s content moderation policies may, in some instances, result in the modification of your Job Ad, and you agree to this activity.
If you are an Indeed agency partner, you may be eligible to participate in an Indeed partnership program.
Agency partners in this program may attain the rank of “Gold”, “Silver”, or “Bronze” based on their Indeed usage and engagement, measured by revenue.
Indeed’s determination of an agency’s rank is made at Indeed’s full discretion and may be revoked at any time.
Indeed may offer some Employers who sponsor Job Ads the opportunity to be displayed more prominently, or in an enhanced way, on the Site (“Featured Employer”).
Featured Employer is awarded at Indeed’s sole discretion.
The ability to receive Featured Employer, generally, is a function of both the number of open jobs at your company and how much you spend.
A Featured Employer may also receive subscriptions to the Indeed Resume Program for a limited time (“Resume Rewards”), which are awarded at Indeed’s sole discretion.
The Featured Employer program and Resume Rewards may be changed or removed by Indeed at any time, at Indeed’s sole discretion.</p>
<p>
<b>Cost per Apply.</b> Indeed may offer a tool permitting an Employer to set a Sponsored Job advertising budget on a per-apply basis, referred to as either “cost-per-apply” or “pay-per-apply.”&nbsp;Employers may be placed into a test group and offered the cost-per-apply product by default.
If you are placed in such a test group and wish to purchase a cost-per-click advertising plan instead of cost-per-apply, contact Client Success at 1-800-475-4361.
Charges are based on applies (“Applies” or “Apply”), defined as an application to one of your Job Ads delivered by Indeed on the Site.
Indeed may offer estimates regarding the number of Applies for a given budget.
this information is based on estimates only and is not a guarantee of future performance or of any particular number of Applies.
By selecting a desired number of Applies on the Site, you are requesting Indeed to display your Job Ad in Indeed’s sole discretion, using the budget you have selected.
You will be charged upon the earlier of a) your ad campaign spending $500.00 or more or b) the beginning of the next calendar month after you sponsor your Job Ad.
If you previously purchased cost-per-click Sponsored Jobs on the same account, you may also be charged once your Job Ad campaign spends $25.00.
The campaign for your Job Ad will automatically pause after the number of Applies you have selected are delivered.
<em>
<b>Charges are solely based on Indeed’s Apply measurements.
Indeed’s determination of Apply count shall be binding.</b>
</em> Indeed and its affiliates, and its and their third-party licensors, disclaim all guarantees regarding positioning, accuracy, or the levels or timing of: (i)&nbsp;costs per Apply, (ii) delivery of any Applies, (iii) the interest level of any users who Apply to or view your job.&nbsp;Indeed further disclaims all guarantees regarding analytics and statistics provided to Employers in the cost-per-apply test group, as such information may be inaccurate or outdated during the test.</p>
<p>Indeed may offer conversion tracking feature that Employers may install on their own websites (“Conversion Tracker”).
The Conversion Tracker will inform Indeed when a Job Seeker completes an application on the Employer website, allowing those applications to appear in the Employer Dashboard.
By installing or using a Conversion Tracker, you represent and warrant that you shall do so in accordance with all applicable laws, including without limitation that you shall provide users of your website with all necessary disclosures, and obtain any necessary consent or agreement from such users, to permit the Conversion Tracker to function in accordance with applicable law, and you agree to defend and indemnify Indeed from any failure to do so.
The Conversion Tracker is provided on an “as-is” and “as-available” basis, and without warranty.
Indeed disclaims all liability for the content, accuracy, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of the Conversion Tracker.</p>
<strong>2.
Cancellation</strong>
<p>Unless otherwise stated in an Insertion Order or other agreement to advertise with Indeed, you may independently cancel online any advertisement at any time (such cancellation is generally effective within 24 hours).
Indeed may immediately cancel the Program or these IAP Terms at any time upon notice.
Indeed may modify the Program or these IAP Terms at any time without liability and your use of the Program after notice that these IAP Terms have changed indicates acceptance of the updated IAP Terms.
Sections 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 will survive any expiration or termination of these IAP Terms.</p>
<strong>3.
Prohibited Uses</strong>
<p>You shall not, and shall not authorize any party to: (a) generate automated, fraudulent or otherwise invalid impressions or clicks.
or (b) advertise anything illegal or engage in any illegal or fraudulent business practice in any state or country where your advertisement is displayed.
You represent and warrant that (x) all your information is correct and current.
(y) you hold and grant Indeed and Publishers all rights to copy, distribute and display Creative (“Use”).
and (z) such Use and websites linked from your Jobs Ads (including Your Services therein) will not violate or encourage violation of any applicable laws.
Violation of these policies may result in immediate termination of these IAP Terms or your account without notice, and may subject you to legal penalties and consequences.&nbsp;Indeed or Publishers may reject or remove any Job Ad, and Indeed may disable any Employer’s account, for any or no reason without notice.&nbsp;Although Indeed may indicate why a job or account has been removed or disabled, we cannot give every reason why a job or a company may be removed, and we always retain the right to remove any job, organic or sponsored, if we feel it is in our interest or our users’ interest.
For examples of why Indeed may reject such Job Ads from Employers, refer to&nbsp;Indeed’s Search Quality Policies, which are provided by way of illustration and are not exhaustive.&nbsp;<b>By submitting your Job Ad to Indeed, you agree that Indeed is under no obligation to accept, host, or publish your Job Ad.</b> That decision is entirely Indeed’s in its sole discretion.&nbsp.
The Indeed team responsible for maintaining the quality of the Site is independent, and its decisions are final and not subject to review.
Indeed may require some Job Ads to be sponsored in order to verify the legitimacy of the Job Ad and/or the Employer, to prevent abuse of the free to post system, to improve our services, or for any other reason in Indeed’s sole discretion.
Indeed may also limit the number of free Job Ads you are allowed to post at a given time in Indeed’s sole discretion.
For example, we may require you to sponsor the following types of Job Ads: identical jobs posted in multiple locations, jobs posted with a confidential or generic company name, jobs that are commission only, hard-to-fill jobs, jobs posted by a staffing agency, recruitment process outsourcer, or other recruitment-based company, and any other jobs as determined by Indeed.
Additionally, Indeed may choose not to accept an employer’s XML feed or any Job Ads in an XML feed for any or no reason.
If you are a job board as determined by Indeed, Indeed reserves the right to include or reject any or all of your Job Ads.
By submitting Job Ads to Indeed, you agree that the determination as to whether you are deemed to be a job board is made by Indeed in its sole discretion, and such decision is binding, and you agree that Indeed is under no obligation to accept, host, or publish your Job Ad.
That decision is entirely Indeed’s in its sole discretion.
The Indeed team responsible for maintaining the quality of the Site is independent, and its decisions are final and not subject to review.
For examples of why Indeed may stop accepting such Job Ads from job boards, refer to the Job Board Inclusion Guidelines.
As a job board, you may only post Job Ads on the Site for your own company.
you may not post Job Ads on the Site for your clients and if you do or attempt to do so, Indeed reserves the right to disable your account.
Indeed further reserves the right to reject any Job Ads which advertise staffing opportunities or platforms rather than actual jobs.
You acknowledge that inclusion of jobs in violation of these guidelines on the Indeed Site may harm Indeed and its users.
When you create an Indeed account, Indeed may require that you verify your identity through a third party service called Mitek.
By using Mitek, you are submitting your identification documents for verification directly to Mitek, you are agreeing to share your identification with Mitek, and you agree that Mitek is solely responsible for any use or loss of data.
Indeed may have access to your identification documents via Mitek.</p>

&nbsp.

<p>Any capitalized terms that are used but not defined in these IRP Terms have the meaning set forth in the Agreement.</p>
<strong>1.
The Program</strong>
<p>Use of the Indeed Resume Program (“Program”) by an individual who posts his or her resume on the Site (hereinafter, “Resume Owner”) or Employer on or through the Site is subject to all applicable Indeed best-practice guidelines, policies and other terms and conditions made available to you, including through the Site, on the subscription purchase page, and on the FAQ and information page(s) for the country you are purchasing a subscription for, any or all of which may be modified at any time.
Purchasing additional subscriptions or modifying subscriptions may reset the monthly billing date for subscriptions associated with your account, resulting in pro rata charges to account for the new date.
You shall not use any information obtained from the Site except for internal use in selecting and contacting Resume Owners, through Indeed, for purposes of filling your Job Listings.
Contact information provided by Indeed, including any Relay Service email address, is for your individual use only and may not be shared with any other person.
You are expressly forbidden from using any product or system intended to extract the information from a Resume, in order to circumvent the Resume contact system.
Use of such system will result in your immediate termination from the Program.
In addition, as a feature of the IRP, Indeed may send emails to Job Seekers on your behalf indicating that your Job Listing is potentially a match for the Job Seeker’s resume.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTICE : YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT: in purchasing or obtaining access to the Program, you are paying Indeed the amount indicated on the Site for the purpose of Indeed facilitating your contact with a Resume Owner by sending a message to the email address that the relevant Resume Owner has provided to Indeed, or by connecting you via phone call to the number provided by the Resume Owner.
Your use of the Program is subject to all Indeed Site Rules and policies, including the Indeed Privacy Policy and any policies pertaining to Relay Services.
Indeed does not guarantee that the email address is still in use, that such message will be received, that such message will be read, that such message will be acted upon by any potential Resume Owner, or that any Resume Owner’s resume is valid, accurate or complete in any respect.
<strong>Indeed may return different results for the same resume search query and has full discretion with respect to the resumes or profiles it presents in response to any particular search.</strong>
<strong>&nbsp;</strong>In addition, in accord with the Agreement, you expressly agree that Indeed does not allow its Resume Contact service to be used in a spam like manner, which Indeed defines as sending requests for job positions to persons who are, as indicated by Indeed experience and Resume Owner behavior and reaction, unsuited for the role.
Indeed reserves the right to disable Indeed Resume contact service for any user who, in Indeed’s sole discretion, violates these IRP Terms, including the foregoing term.
We reserve the right to drop any message, including without limitation dropping any message with an .ade, .adp, .bat, .chm, .cmd, .com, .cpl, .exe, .hta, .ins, .isp, .jar, .jse, .lib,&nbsp;.so, .dll, .lnk, .mde, .msc, .msp, .mst, .pif, .scr, .sct, .shb, .sys, .vb, .vbe, .vbs, .vxd, .wsc, .wsf, .wsh, or .zip attachment or any other attachment containing scripts, macros, or other code, or&nbsp;other messages that Indeed suspects to be malicious or spam, or for any or no reason.

No other uses of the IRP are permitted.&nbsp;</strong>Scraping the Indeed Resume database or using the Indeed Resume database for any other purpose except as allowed will result in legal action being taken against you.
Additionally, if you are a competitor of Indeed (including but not limited to any job aggregation website or any job posting websites) you may not use the Indeed Resume database to contact a Resume Owner for the purpose of sending them a job offer from your clients, and any such competitive use of the Indeed Resume database may result in Indeed blocking you from the Site, blocking you from contacting Indeed Resume Owners, and blocking your contact emails to those resume owners without notice and you consent to the same.
Each Resume subscription is solely for the individual use of the person to whom it is assigned, and may not be shared with other users.</p>

<strong>In the event phone numbers are provided by the Job Seeker in the resume, Indeed does not guarantee their validity and can not confirm whether such numbers are landlines or cell phones.
You agree to call Job Seekers regarding relevant job opportunities only.
It is your sole responsibility to comply with all TCPA guidelines, including laws against automated telephone dialing systems.</strong>

Indemnification</strong>
<p>You shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Indeed, its agents, affiliates, and licensors from any third-party claim or liability (including without limitation reasonable legal fees) arising out of any contact you have with the recipient (or intended recipient), any email you request to be sent pursuant to these IRP Terms, or any phone call or text message you make to a recipient.</p> &nbsp.
Indeed Assessments Terms &nbsp.
&nbsp.
<p>These Indeed Assessments Terms (“IA Terms”) form a part of, and are incorporated into, the Indeed Terms of Service (the “Agreement”).
By using Indeed Assessments as an Employer in any way, or by registering as an Employer on Indeed Assessments, you agree to these Indeed Assessments Terms and the Indeed Terms of Service.
Any capitalized terms that are used but not defined in these IA Terms have the meaning set forth in the Agreement.</p> 1.
Introduction <p>Indeed Assessments is an online tool for the provision and review of skills assessments selected by Employers (“Assessments”) and responses from Job Seekers&nbsp.
(“Responses”) through the Site.</p> 2.
Assessments <p>You agree that any Assessment sent by Indeed to a Job Seeker is done so at your sole request, and you represent and warrant that you have that Job Seeker’s consent for Indeed to contact that Job Seeker for the purpose of transmitting the Assessment(s) you have selected.
You also acknowledge that once you have requested that Indeed transmit your Assessment to a Job Seeker, that request cannot be canceled.
Indeed does not guarantee that any Job Seeker will receive, access, read or respond to any Assessment, or that there will be no mistakes in the transmission of the data.
However, Indeed may alert you when any of the above events occur.</p>
<p>You agree you have made the determination to use Indeed Assessments as part of your application process, and that the types of questions asked in any Assessment or bundle of Assessments you send to a Job Seeker are solely being asked by you and are not being asked by Indeed.
You agree you are solely responsible for the use of Assessments and Responses in compliance with the law, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act and similar state statutes.
You are solely responsible for your use of Indeed Assessments, including without limitation any results which are considered to have a “disparate impact.” You further agree that you are solely responsible for offering alternative methods of screening, if so required by the Americans with Disabilities Act or any other equivalent state act.
You acknowledge that Indeed may, but is not obligated to, provide a means by which Job Seekers may request such an alternative method or other accommodation from you.
While Indeed is guided by WCAG 2.1, Level AA in our efforts to design and develop accessible offerings, as outlined in the accessibility statement, Indeed does not warrant that the method of delivery of any Assessment question is compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act or any equivalent or similar law.</p>
<p>You are the sole party to determine which Assessment to send to any Job Seeker.
You agree that an Assessment is only designed to evaluate a particular skill.
It does not evaluate a Job Seeker’s qualification for any job nor their ability to safely perform a job.
Whether a particular skill is relevant to a job, or whether a Job Seeker is qualified or appropriate for a job, is decided solely by you.
Indeed reserves the right to change any Assessment or the questions asked within an Assessment at any time, for any or no reason, including but not limited to quality control.</p>
<p>Sending an Assessment to a Job Seeker does not guarantee a Response or any further communication or action by any job Seeker.
You consent to your Assessment and any other communications sent through Indeed Assessments being processed and analyzed by Indeed according to this Agreement and Indeed’s Privacy Policy.</p> 3.
Responses&nbsp.
<p>A Job Seeker may, but is not required to, provide a Response to an Assessment sent by an Employer.
After a Job Seeker has provided a Response, the Employer will be able to use the Indeed Assessments platform to review the Response.
A Job Seeker may also have the option to select an Assessment and associate the Response with their Indeed Profile, which will be visible to Employers in accordance with our Terms.
If there are multiple versions of the same Assessment, the Response percentile for any Job Seeker will be determined only in relation to other Responses to the same version of that Assessment.</p>
<p>As an Employer you are the sole party to determine whether a Response indicates a qualified Job Seeker.
You may instruct Indeed to send out rejection notices if the Job Seeker has not responded to Assessments in a manner acceptable to you, and you acknowledge that Indeed has no discretion in the transmission of these rejections.
As the employer, you are the sole party to determine whether to offer a Job Seeker the&nbsp.
opportunity to retake any Assessment that you sent or update or modify their Response.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that Responses are only provided on the condition that you use them responsibly and legally as part of your hiring process, which includes considering any other relevant information about the Job Seeker.
Indeed may display excerpts from or summaries of Responses in other products such as Indeed Resume.
These summaries are for convenience only and are not to be used in lieu of the full Response in context.
You agree not to rely solely on such excerpts or summaries when making a hiring decision regarding any Job Seeker.</p> 4.
Rules For Using Indeed Assessments <p>As an Employer, you represent and warrant that you shall not access or use Indeed Assessments for any directly or indirectly illegal, discriminatory, or fraudulent purpose.
You shall not create or send any Assessment which is directly or indirectly illegal, discriminatory, fraudulent, threatening, abusive, libelous, defamatory, obscene, or otherwise objectionable, or that contains sexual, ethnic, racial or other discriminating slurs, or that contains no relevant or constructive content.
You shall not create or send any Assessment containing proprietary information, trade secrets, confidential information, advertisements, solicitations, chain letters, pyramid schemes, investment opportunities, or other unsolicited commercial communication (except as otherwise expressly permitted by us in writing).</p>
<p>Indeed Assessments is not a tool to ask for sensitive personal data from Job Seekers.
Employers may not create or send any Assessment which seeks highly confidential personal information from Job Seekers, such as bank account or credit card information, online account information, social security numbers (or similar counterparts outside the United States of America), health information, or other categories of personal data subject to data breach notification requirements in any country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An Employer who receives an accommodation request through Indeed Assessments must provide an accommodation to the extent required by applicable law, and further must provide evidence of compliance to Indeed immediately upon request.
Any failure to fulfill these obligations is a material breach of this Agreement and Indeed may immediately terminate your account and your access to Indeed Assessments with no further obligation to you.
You agree to defend and indemnify Indeed from any claims arising from your failure to comply with this section.</p>
<p>
<b>
<i>You understand and agree that Indeed does not have any obligation to screen any Assessment or Response, or to publish any Assessment or Response on the Site, and may exclude or remove any Assessment or Response from the Site for any or no reason without liability or notice.</i>
</b>
</p> 5.
Indeed’s Role <p>Indeed does not act as an employment agency by offering the Indeed Assessments tool.
By using Indeed Assessments, you acknowledge and agree that Indeed is not procuring employees for Employers or procuring opportunities to work for Job Seekers.
Indeed merely provides a tool enabling Employers and Job Seekers to exchange Assessments and Responses as they determine.
The sole responsibility for the content of any Assessment or Response, any requests for interviews or offers made, any issues arising from an acceptance or denial of employment, and any other issues arising from the use of Indeed Assessments, is solely with Employers or Job Seekers as applicable.</p>
<p>Indeed cannot confirm the information submitted by anyJob Seeker, or other user, including the identity of any user.
Indeed does not inquire into the backgrounds of Job Seekers or attempt to verify the statements of Job Seekers.
You are responsible for conducting any background checks, reference checks, or other due diligence that you may require before making an offer of employment to a Job Seeker.
You are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations relating to the intended employment of any Job Seeker.
Further, for any skill area in which formal licenses or certifications may exist, Assessments do not act as a substitute for such license or certification and do not speak to whether a Job Seeker is qualified for or has such a license or certification.
It is the Employer’s sole responsibility to determine what licenses or certifications are required for their job and whether a Job Seeker has such license or certification.
Indeed also makes no statement as to whether a particular skill is necessary for a job and it is an Employer’s sole responsibility to make such a determination (or seek appropriate legal counsel to do so), in accordance with the EEOC regulations or other applicable laws.</p>
<p>Indeed is not a party to, third party beneficiary of, or liable for, any agreements, offers, or promises between an Employer and Job Seeker, regardless of whether Indeed receives a fee from the Employer in connection with the transaction.
Indeed will not be liable for any costs or damages arising out of or related to such transaction.</p>
<p>Indeed assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all liability, for the content, accuracy, validity, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of the Site, the Indeed Assessments tool, and any Assessment or Response.</p> 6.
Fees <p>Indeed Assessments is currently free for Employers.
Indeed may, in its sole discretion and at any time, end Employers’ free use of Indeed Assessments and begin to charge Employers to use Indeed Assessments as a standalone product or in conjunction with an Employer’s use of any other Indeed product.</p> 7.
Confidentiality <p>You agree to keep all information gained from using Indeed Assessments confidential.
You agree that (1) you will use any content submitted by Job Seekers only in accordance with applicable privacy and data protection laws.
(2) you will not disclose the names or identities or share the profile of any Job Seekers outside of your recruiting or hiring department.
and (3) you will take appropriate physical, technical and administrative measures to protect content you obtain through use of Indeed Assessments from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction.</p> 8.

All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.</p> &nbsp.
Indeed Targeted Ads Terms &nbsp.
&nbsp.
<p>These Indeed Targeted Ads Terms (“ITA Terms”) form a part of, and are incorporated into, the&nbsp;Indeed Terms of Service&nbsp;(the “Agreement”), and apply to any Employer who accesses or uses the Indeed Targeted Ads program, or who otherwise indicates its acceptance of these ITA Terms.
&nbsp;These ITA Terms apply to both of Indeed’s Targeted Ads Services: 1) Indeed Targeted Ads: Brand (“ITA Brand”) and 2) Indeed Targeted Ads: Apply (“ITA Apply”).</p>
<p>Any capitalized terms that are used but not defined in these ITA Terms have the meaning set forth in the Agreement.</p> 1.
The Program <p>Use of Indeed Targeted Ads (“ITA”) on or through the Site is subject to all applicable Indeed terms and policies, including without limitation the Indeed Privacy Policy and those instructions provided on the Site, and, if you are using ITA, through our online forms.
Indeed policies may be modified at any time.
With regards to any job or brand advertisements posted on or through Indeed through ITA, (“Targeted Ads”), you agree that you are solely responsible for all: (a) ad or job content and target URLs (“Creative”), whether provided or generated by or for you.
including but not limited to images, photograph(s), marks, or logos you provide to Indeed.
and (b) websites proximately reachable from Creative URLs and your services and products (collectively “Your Services”).
You shall protect your passwords and take full responsibility for your own, and third party, use of your accounts.
You agree that Targeted Ads and Creatives may be placed on any Site, content, or property provided by Indeed (“Indeed Property”) or may be placed on a third party website.
By posting a Targeted Ad on or through Indeed, you authorize Indeed to reformat the Job Ad.
Indeed may reformat the Job Ad, for example, so that the ad can be effectively displayed on a mobile device, a third party website, or certain locations on the Site.
Indeed makes no guarantees and disclaims all liability and warranties as to the content or nature of third party websites on which Targeted Ads may appear.
Target audience membership is based partly on information and criteria provided by the Employer, but the composition of each target audience is determined by Indeed in its sole discretion.</p>
<p>
<strong>ITA Apply:</strong> In order to participate in ITA Apply, you must either use Indeed Apply to receive applications or add Indeed’s conversion tracker snippet to the last page of your job application, also known as the post-apply page (the “Post-Apply Page”).
The Post-Apply Page on which you add Indeed’s conversion tracker snippet shall be determined by mutual agreement between you and Indeed.
However, please note that if you unilaterally place the conversion tracker snippet on a page other than the mutually agreed upon page, in violation of this agreement, Indeed will still count this page as the Post-Apply-Page, charge you for any Applies (as defined below) on this page, and may require you to correct the placement.
Any removal of the tracker snippet, or any provision of a method, for Job Seekers to apply to the Job Ad, bypassing the conversion tracker snippet will disqualify you from the program and will entitle Indeed to any resulting damages.
It shall be your responsibility to inform your job applicants that such tracker snippet is in place.
The conversion tracker will attribute an application to Indeed any time the job seeker started their search on Indeed, despite any intervening activity.
Additionally, if you receive the ITA Apply services, you may be given the option to include application questions for your Job Listing on an ITA ad as part of your application process.
If you request that Indeed include the questions you have chosen as part of your ITA ad, you acknowledge that job seekers who do not answer your questions in the manner set forth in your instructions may not be permitted to proceed with the application process through the ITA ad, and that you are requesting that Indeed perform this action.
You further acknowledge that your use of these questions is provided to you via a license to the application questions tool.
Indeed disclaims all warranties as to the performance of these questions, including but not limited to the accuracy of the job seekers’ answers to your application questions.
&nbsp;</p> 2.&nbsp;Cancellation <p>Unless otherwise stated in an insertion order or other agreement to advertise with Indeed, you may independently cancel online any Targeted Ad at any time (such cancellation is generally effective within 24 hours for any Targeted Ad displayed on Indeed).
Indeed may cancel ITA or these ITA Terms at any time.
Indeed may modify ITA or these ITA Terms at any time without liability, and your use of ITA after notice that these ITA Terms have changed indicates acceptance of the updated ITA Terms.
Sections 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 will survive any expiration or termination of these ITA Terms.</p> 3.&nbsp;Prohibited Uses <p>You shall not, and shall not authorize any party to (a) generate automated, fraudulent or otherwise invalid impressions, applies, or clicks.
(b) cause the under reporting, or circumvent or prevent the reporting of an application by any means, including but not limited to, by providing an alternative method for a Job Seeker to submit an application to your Job Ad and bypassing the Post Apply Page.
or (c) advertise anything illegal or engage in any illegal or fraudulent business practice in any state or country where your advertisement is displayed.
You represent and warrant that (x) all your information is correct and current.
(y) you hold and grant Indeed, Indeed’s vendors, and third party websites on which Targeted Ads may appear all rights to copy, distribute and display Creative (“Use”).
and (z) such Use and websites linked from your Targeted Ads (including Your Services therein) will not violate or encourage violation of any applicable laws.
Violation of these policies may result in immediate termination of these ITA Terms or your account without notice, and may subject you to legal penalties and consequences.
<b>Indeed or Indeed’s vendors may reject or remove any Targeted Ad, and Indeed may disable any Employer’s account, for any or no reason without notice.</b>
</p> 4.&nbsp;DISCLAIMER AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY <p>INDEED’S PROVISION OF THE PROGRAM AND THE SITE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS.

Applies are defined as a user visit to the agreed upon Post-Apply Page.
ITA Brand Impressions are defined as an ad appearing on a page of the Site or a third party site, which page has been presented to a user.
However, an ITA Brand Impression does not guarantee that a Job Seeker has viewed such ad.
If you are an Employer using ITA Brand, your price per ITA Brand Impression found on any ITA Brand Insertion Order is defined as the cost per 1000 impressions.
<b>If your ITA Insertion Order does not contain an end date, you will continue to be billed until you contact Indeed and request to be removed from the ITA Program.</b>&nbsp;If your Indeed employer account has a credit card on file for the Indeed Ads Program, we will charge that same credit card for your Indeed Targeted Ads.&nbsp;If your billing address is in the United States, you shall pay all charges in US Dollars.

</b>
<strong>Indeed’s measurements may include measurements from third-party vendors.
</strong>
<b>Indeed’s determination of number of Applies, clicks or ITA Brand Impressions shall be binding.</b>&nbsp;Refunds (if any) are at the absolute discretion of Indeed and only in the form of advertising credit for Indeed Property.

Indeed API Terms &nbsp.
&nbsp.
<p>These API Terms incorporate the&nbsp;Indeed Terms of Service&nbsp;(the “Agreement”), and apply to anyone who accesses or uses an Application Programming Interface created or maintained by Indeed (“API”) or related documentation (“Documentation”), develops any application that communicates or interoperates with the API, the Site, or any Indeed service (“Application”), or who otherwise indicates acceptance of these API Terms.
By agreeing to the API Terms, you also agree to the Indeed Terms of Service.
Any capitalized terms that are used but not defined in these API Terms have the meaning set forth in the Agreement.</p> 1.&nbsp.

<p>Indeed may update, modify or discontinue the API at any time and in our sole discretion and without liability to you, and may require you to obtain and use the most recent version.
You are required to update your Application accordingly at your sole expense.
You acknowledge that Indeed’s update to an API may adversely affect how your Application communicates with the Site or an Indeed App, and you agree that Indeed will have no liability therefrom.
Your use of an API after an update by Indeed constitutes acceptance of the update.
Indeed reserves the right to develop products or services that are similar to, or may compete with, any Application.&nbsp;</p> 2.
Restrictions <p>Accessing and using the Site or any Indeed App through an API is subject to the Site Rules and any additional rules and policies made available by Indeed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You agree to provide and adhere to a Privacy Policy for your Application that accurately describes to End Users what user information you collect and how you use and share such information with Indeed and other third parties.</p> 3.
Access and API Key <p>You agree to only access an API by the means described in its Documentation.
Indeed may require that you use a password, key or other security device to access an API (“API Key”).
Instructions for obtaining an API Key are included in the applicable Documentation.
You are responsible for all access to and use of the API under your API Key.
You agree to maintain the confidentiality and security of your API Key, to not share it with any third party, and use it only in compliance with these API Terms.
You will not misrepresent or mask either your identity or your Application’s identity.
Your API Key may be revoked at any time by Indeed.&nbsp;</p> 4.&nbsp.
Intellectual Property <p>You understand and acknowledge that Indeed or its affiliates, or its or their licensors, owns all right title and interest to the API, the Site, and Indeed Apps, and all proprietary rights associated therewith.
