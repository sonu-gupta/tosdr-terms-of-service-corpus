<p>
<strong>Purpose</strong>
<br>
</p>
<p>Analytics and Performance Cookies<br>
</p>
<p>These cookies are used to collect information about traffic to our Services and how users use our Services.
The information gathered does not identify any individual visitor.
The information is aggregated and therefore anonymous.
It includes the number of visitors to our Services, the websites that referred them to our Services, the pages that they visited on our Services, what time of day they visited our Services, whether they have visited our Services before, and other similar information.
We use this information to help operate our Services more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information and to monitor the level of activity on our Services.
We use Google Analytics for this purpose.
Google Analytics uses its own cookies.
It is only used to improve how our Services works.

You can find out more about how Google protects your data here.
You can prevent the use of Google Analytics relating to your use of our Services by downloading and installing the browser plugin available via this link.<br>
</p>
<p>Essential Cookies<br>
</p>
<p>These cookies are essential to provide you with services available through our Services and to enable you to use its features.
For example, they allow you to log in to secure areas of our Services and help the content of the pages you request load quickly.
Without these cookies, the services that you have asked for cannot be provided, and we only use these cookies to provide you with those services.<br>
</p>
<p>Functionality Cookies<br>
</p>
<p>These cookies allow our Services to remember choices you make when you use our Services, such as remembering your language preferences, remembering your login details, remembering which polls you have voted in and in some cases, to show you poll results, and remembering the changes you make to other parts of our Services which you can customize.
These cookies also enable us to identify you across various screens and devices as you login and use our Services, as well as enable us to work with partners to resolve your digital identities and personalize your experiences across our Services, our partners and customers, and across channels.
The purpose of these cookies is to provide you with a more personal experience and to avoid you having to re-enter your preferences every time you visit our Services.<br>
</p>

</p>
<p>A Flash cookie is a data file placed on a device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that is built into or downloaded by you onto your device.
Flash cookies are used for various purposes, including, without limitation, enabling a Flash feature and remembering your preferences.

If you choose to adjust your Flash privacy settings on your device some features of the Services may not function properly.<br>
</p>
<p>Pixel Tags<br>
</p>
<p>We also use “pixel tags,” which are small graphic files that allow us and third parties to monitor the use of the Services and collect usage data.
We may also insert pixel tags on third parties’ websites.
A pixel tag can collect information such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the tag appears.
the URL of the page on which the pixel tag appears.
the time (and length of time) the page containing the pixel tag was viewed.
the type of browser that retrieved the pixel tag.
and the identification number of any cookie previously placed by that server on your computer.
We use pixel tags to collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the links you click and other actions taken in connection with our sites and Services and use them in combination with our cookies to provide offers and information of interest to you.
We may also use pixel tags to collect data related to a website visit.
Similar functionality may be enabled in a mobile app through the use of an SDK (Software Development Kit).
Pixel tags also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit the Services or other websites.
In addition, we use a variety of other technologies that collect similar information for security and fraud detection purposes.<br>
</p>
<p>You can also find more information about cookies and how they work, what cookies have been set on your computer or mobile device and how to manage and delete them at http://www.allaboutcookies.org and http://www.youronlinechoices.com.<br>‍<br>To be clear, Ketch does not, and cannot, track your activity when you are not using the Services and does not collect activity about your online activity after you leave the Services.<br>

For users in the European Economic Area (“EEA”): We only send marketing communications to users located in the EEA with your prior consent.

</p>8.
Storage, Security and How to Remove Your Information<p>We use industry standard technical, administrative, and physical controls to protect your data.
While we take reasonable precautions against possible security breaches, no website or internet transmission is completely secure and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breach will never occur.
We will process and store your personal information only for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of the storage, or as permitted by law.
&nbsp;The criteria used to determine the period of storage of information is the respective statutory retention period.
After expiration of that period, the corresponding information is routinely deleted, as long as it is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of a contract or the initiation of a contract.</p>9.
De-Activating Your Account<p>You can choose to deactivate your account so that you are no longer viewable on the Services.
You can request deactivation through the Services or by sending a message to privacy@ketch.com.<br>

Third-Party Links<p>The Services may contain links to and from third-party websites.
If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies, which may differ substantially from ours, and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for their activities or the content of their privacy policies.<br>
</p>11.
California Privacy Rights<p>This section, which supplements the rest of this Privacy Policy, applies to resident of California, containing disclosures required by the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) and applies only to “personal information” that is subject to the CCPA.<br>
<br>If you are a California resident, you have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information.
We do not transfer your personal information to third parties in exchange for money but may share it with certain third parties for activities like targeted advertising, marketing, and analytics, and these may be deemed a "sale" under CCPA.
