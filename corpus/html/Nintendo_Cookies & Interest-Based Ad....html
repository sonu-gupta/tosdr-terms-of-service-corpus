<br> Interest-Based Advertising <p>Interest-based ads, sometimes also referred to as targeted or personalized ads, are advertisements about goods and services, that may be more useful and relevant to you, based on information gathered about your activities across non-affiliated websites.
In providing interest-based ads, we follow the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising developed by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA).
To learn more, please visit https://youradchoices.com/.
Many of our third-party service providers that serve interest-based advertisements to you across our services are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or they follow the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.
You can choose to opt-out directly from these third-parties by visiting the opt-out pages on the NAI website (http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) and DAA website (http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).
However, please note that if you “opt-out” you will still see online ads, but they will not be personalized.</p>
