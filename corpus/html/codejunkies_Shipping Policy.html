</i> Customer Service Shipping Policy UK Shipping with Royal Mail
<p>All products purchased for shipping within the UK are sent via Royal Mail 48h Tracked.</p>
All Other Countries
<p>For all other countries we try to keep delivery costs as reasonable as possible.
Delivery costs are calculated based on shipping zones (Mainland Europe and Rest of World) and the combined weight of your order.
Once you select your delivery country on the checkout screen the actual delivery cost will be displayed.</p>
Delivery Times
<p>Deliveries will be made by Royal Mail.
Royal Mail deliveries <em>may</em> require a signature.
Items that are in stock are dispatched the next working day (an item is in stock unless it clearly states that it is a pre-order or out-of-stock item on the product description page).</p>
<p>
<b>UK</b> - Orders normally arrive within 3-5 working days.<br>
<b>Europe</b> - Orders normally arrive within 5-7 working days<br>
<b>Rest of World</b> - Orders normally arrive within 10-14 working days.<br>Please note that delivery can take up to 25 workings days after dispatch.</p>
