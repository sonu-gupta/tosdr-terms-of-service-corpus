Those circumstances are: you contest the accuracy of the personal data.
processing is unlawful but you oppose erasure.
we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of our processing, but you require personal data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

or for reasons of important public interest.</p>
<p>5.7&nbsp;&nbsp;You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation, but only to the extent that the legal basis for the processing is that the processing is necessary for: the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of any official authority vested in us.
or the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party.
If you make such an objection, we will cease to process the personal information unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</p>

<p>and such processing is carried out by automated means, you have the right to receive your personal data from us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.
However, this right does not apply where it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.</p>

You may do so in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement.</p>
<p>5.12&nbsp;&nbsp;To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time.
Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal.</p>
<p>5.13&nbsp;&nbsp;You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal data by written notice to us.</p>
