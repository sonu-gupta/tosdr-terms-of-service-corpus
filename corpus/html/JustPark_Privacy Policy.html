<li>Personal information collected and use of this information</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Core Account Data - although it is not compulsory to give us this information, if you do not then you cannot register as a member of the Service, or make a booking for a parking space with our parking space operators we will collect the following data.<ol>
<li>Name - we need to store this to identify you in the provision of our service.
It will be shared with parking space operators you make a booking with and users on our platform which you send messages to.</li>
<li>Email - we’ll send emails to you about your bookings and the JustPark service.
We may share your email with third parties (including parking space operators).</li>

<li>Number plate (VRM) - we store this for enforcement purposes and also safety purposes.
We share this with third party enforcement companies and parking space operators along with parking session dates and times, and sometimes your name, subject to terms outlined in separate Data Sharing Agreements held between JustPark and these third party companies outlining each company’s obligations relating to the General Data Protection Regulation 2018.
We also use the VRM to check with the DVSA that a vehicle has a valid MOT certificate at the time of a booking as this is a requirement of some of our space owners to ensure that vehicles parked in their spaces are safe and roadworthy.</li>
<li>IP Address - this is used by us and some of our third-party providers to identify your device in the provision of our service.
It is also used for fraud checks and to ensure a secure product.</li>

They are not stored on JustPark servers and JustPark employees do not have access to these details.</li>
<li>Booking history - we store a history of where and when you’ve booked parking to make repeat use faster and easier for you, and in interest of your and our accounting purposes.</li>
<li>Phone number - we store this so drivers can contact parking space operators and vice versa.
Phone numbers are only shared when you’ve made payment for a booking.
We also use it to make repeat use of our pay by phone service faster.

<li>Reviews - if you choose to leave a review for a parking location, this will be shown to other drivers considering booking the space (only showing your first name and the initial of your last name).</li>
<li>Non-JustPark spaces navigated to - we log which of these you launch navigation to in order to make repeat use faster and easier for you, and to improve our parking availability engine - which helps us show you and other drivers when we think spaces will be available to park in.</li>
<li>Location data - if you choose to enable location services, we will occasionally store your location services data to improve our parking availability engine - which helps us show you and other drivers when we think spaces will be available to park in.

<li>Parking space address - we use this to show drivers where your space is.
We only reveal the full address to them after they've paid to park in it so that they can navigate there.
Before that the driver can only see the street name and a map pin showing the location of your space.</li>
<li>Space description - this is a public-facing description you provide when adding your space which helps drivers decide if a space is suitable.</li>

Once the parking session has finished, they are hidden from the driver.</li>
<li>PIN code for accessing space - if you provide a pin code (e.g.

It is not shown to the driver until they have paid to park in your space.
