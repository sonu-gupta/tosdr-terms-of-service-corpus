<ol>
<li>We employ and our third-party advertising partners (such as Marketo or HubSpot) employ a software technology called “clear gifs” (a.k.a.
Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that helps us better manage content on the Site by informing us what content is effective.

This code is executed on our server or on your device.
A “web beacon” (or a pixel tag) is a small, invisible piece of text or image on a website that is used to monitor traffic on a website.
In order to do this, various data about you is stored using web beacons.<p>In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our website visitors Personal Data.
