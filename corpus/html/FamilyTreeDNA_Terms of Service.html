         Terms of Service <p> Welcome to the FamilyTreeDNA Family! Thank you for choosing us to support you in your journey of discovery.
We encourage you to read the below Terms of Service as well as our Privacy Statement and Law Enforcement Guidelines prior to your purchase.
</p>
<ol>
<li> For Reference <ol>
<li>
<p>
<strong>“FamilyTreeDNA” (“we,” “us,” “our,” “the Company”)</strong> is a d/b/a for Gene by Gene, Ltd., whose principal place of business is at 1445 N Loop W, Houston, TX 77008.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>“DNA sample” or “sample”</strong> refers to the cheek swab or any other sample provided for the purposes of Genomic Sequencing.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li> Acceptance of FamilyTreeDNA Terms <p> This Agreement refers specifically to the acceptable use of the FamilyTreeDNA Services.
</p>
<p> This Terms of Service (TOS) Agreement is an electronic contract that establishes the legally binding terms you must accept to use the Website.
These TOS cover any use of the Services, including but not limited to (a) your submission of a DNA sample for DNA extraction, processing, and storage, (b) uploading a digital version of your Genetic Information with the intent of interacting with it on the FamilyTreeDNA website, and/or (c) creating and using a free FamilyTreeDNA account without providing your Genetic Information or DNA sample.
To use the Services, you must first agree to these TOS.
You may not use the Services if you do not accept these TOS.
You can accept these TOS by (1) clicking to accept or agree to these TOS where this option is made available to you by FamilyTreeDNA for any Service or by (2) actually using the Services.
In this case, you acknowledge and agree that FamilyTreeDNA will treat your use of the Services as acceptance of these TOS from that point onwards.
In addition, when using particular FamilyTreeDNA Services, you shall be subject to any guidelines or rules applicable to such services that may be posted from time to time.
All such guidelines or rules, at this moment, are incorporated by reference into these TOS.
FamilyTreeDNA also may offer other services from time to time that are governed by additional or different terms of service.
</p>
</li>
<li> Description of the Services <p> The Services include access to the FamilyTreeDNA public website and platform as well as our personal genotyping services, including the collection, processing and handling, genetic testing, analysis, and interpretation of your DNA sample or uploaded Genetic Information.
The purpose of the Services is to provide genetic and genealogical results and related reports for research, identification, informational, recreational, and educational use.
</p>
<p> Our Services are very diverse, so sometimes additional or different terms may apply.
Any additional terms will be specified with the relevant Services, and those additional terms become a part of your agreement with us if you use those Services.
Separate terms may also apply to special offers or promotions, and if the rules of a promotion or special offer conflict with these Terms, those special terms will prevail.
We are continuously pushing to advance our Services.
and thus, we may add or remove functionality or features from the Services, and we may suspend or stop a Service altogether.
In order to enhance our Services, we may also use user data to add to our existing user experience or to develop new services or products.
Unless explicitly stated otherwise, each new feature that augments or enhances the current Service shall be subject to these TOS.
</p>
<p> You may stop using the Services at any time.
You do not need to specifically inform FamilyTreeDNA when you stop using the Services unless you are requesting closure of your account.
You may at any time request that we delete your data and account, as described in our Privacy Statement.
</p>
<p> FamilyTreeDNA assumes no responsibility for the use of Services outside the terms of this TOS or other applicable terms.
</p>
<p> To use the Services, you must have Internet access.
In addition, you must provide all equipment necessary to make such an Internet connection.
You are responsible for providing such equipment and are responsible for paying any service fees associated with Internet access.
</p>
</li>
<li> Eligibility to Use the Services <ol>
<li>
<p> Whether you submit your own DNA sample, a DNA sample for anyone for whom you have legal authority to agree, or supply your own Genetic Information, you may neither use the Services or accept these TOS if (i) you are a person prohibited from receiving the Services under the jurisdiction laws in which you are resident or from which you use the Services, (ii) you are not of the legal age to form a binding contract with FamilyTreeDNA.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> In addition to the conditions above, you must be at least 18 years of age to participate or otherwise provide your own Genetic Information and to agree to these TOS on behalf of yourself or those whom you are the parent of or have the legal authority to agree.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> You may use the Services with your parent's or guardian's permission if you are between the ages of 13 and 18.
You must be 13 years of age or older to use the Services and accept the TOS.
Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to use any Services.
If FamilyTreeDNA becomes aware that we have unknowingly collected any personal data directly from a child under the age of 13, we will take commercially reasonable efforts to delete such data from our system.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li> Considerations Regarding FamilyTreeDNA Services <ol>
<li>
<p>
<strong>You may discover information about yourself that you, as well as your family, did not anticipate:</strong> You should be aware that some of the information you receive may be unexpected.
In most cases, this information may be interesting.
In other cases, it may lead to distress.
Examples may involve: (i) information about your origins that contradicts prior assumptions.
(ii) the discovery of an unknown relative.
or (iii) discovering unexpected genetic information about a potential health condition.
As a user, you take responsibility for all possible consequences that could result from the use of these Services.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>The laboratory may not be able to process your sample, and the laboratory process may result in errors:</strong> We run and operate our own CLIA certified lab at our headquarters in Houston, TX where we place great attention on quality.
Regardless of our attention to quality, from time to time and although rare, there are cases where issues may occur in our lab processing.
These issues may be a result of a contaminated sample, insufficient DNA due to a tester not following swab instructions, or most rarely, misidentification.
If you believe your sample was misidentified, please contact Customer Service for help as this can affect your privacy.
Please see our Retesting and Return Policies as well as our Privacy Statement for further information about how we handle your Genetic Information.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Genetics is an evolving field of research:</strong> Currently, only a small percentage of the hundreds of thousands of data points we measure from your DNA are known to be associated with human traits or health conditions, and we may not know or comprehend all of the genetic contributions for a trait.
The research community is quickly learning more about genetics as we discover new links between genes and traits.
At times, research is also showing that some previously identified links may not be valid.
In addition, many ethnic groups are not included in genetic studies.
Because interpretations provided in our service depend on scientific studies, you may receive interpretations that are based on populations that might not apply to you.
In the future, scientific research may change the interpretation of your DNA and the scientific community may show past research to be incomplete or inaccurate.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li> Your Use of the Services <p> The Services includes tools that provide you with ethnicity and other genetically related results as well as accompanying services that help you explore your ethnic and family origins, offer you the ability to view genetic matches that can identify potential relatives, and allow you to learn more about your DNA.
</p>

If a dispute arises between you and FamilyTreeDNA, our objective is to provide a speedy and cost-effective means of resolving the dispute.
If you have any concern or dispute about the Services, you agree to first try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting us.
</p>
<p> In the unlikely event that FamilyTreeDNA has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any FamilyTreeDNA claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to this Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in the city of Houston, TX under the commercial rules then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein.
The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing FamilyTreeDNA from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to protect any of FamilyTreeDNA’s proprietary interests.
</p>
<p> All claims must be brought in the parties’ individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.
You agree that, by entering into this agreement, you and FamilyTreeDNA are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.
</p>
<p>
<strong>For E.U.
Customers.</strong> Nothing in this Agreement, including the paragraph above, affects your rights as a consumer to rely on such mandatory provisions of local law.
Nothing contained in this clause shall limit FamilyTreeDNA's rights to bring enforcement proceedings in another jurisdiction or to seek interim, protective or provisional relief in the courts of another jurisdiction.
