Please know that this in no way affects reviews, benchmarks, content, or this site's opinions of products, services, manufacturers, partners, or merchants.
The mission of PCPartPicker is to provide the best functionality for this site's users, regardless of any potential affiliate commissions.</p>
<p>While many people have generously offered donations to support this site, PCPartPicker does not accept donations.
Instead, income received from affiliate relationships funds site maintenance and feature development.
If you desire to donate to PCPartPicker, I kindly ask that you consider donating to a charitable organization instead.
I am particularly fond of Charity:Water, a non-profit organization that provides safe, clean drinking water to people in developing countries.</p>
