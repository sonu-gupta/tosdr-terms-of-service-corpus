What are Cookies?
<p>Cookies are small text files that are downloaded to your computer or mobile device by a website via your web browser or mobile app when you visit a website or other online service.
Cookies store information about how you use an online service so that the website can recognize your device, provide functionality, enhance your experience (like remembering your preferred language), analyze usage patterns, and personalize content and advertising.
</p>
<p>When we say “cookie,” we don’t mean the delicious ones with chocolate chips.
We are, however, talking about similar online tracking tools and technologies, such as web beacons (also called tracking pixels).
Like cookies, web beacons allow us to analyze how visitors to our websites use Asana and deliver personalized content.
Web beacons can also be included in emails we send to determine whether they have been read or acted on.
