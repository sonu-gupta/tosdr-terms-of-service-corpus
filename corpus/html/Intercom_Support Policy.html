<p>This Agreement permits Customer to purchase subscriptions to online software-as-a-service products and other services from Intercom pursuant to any Intercom ordering documents, online registration, order descriptions or order confirmations referencing this Agreement ("<strong>Order Form(s)</strong>") and sets forth the basic terms and conditions under which those products and services will be delivered.
This Agreement will govern Customer's initial purchase on the Effective Date as well as any future purchases made by Customer that reference this Agreement.</p>
<p>The "<strong>Effective Date</strong>" of this Agreement is the date which is the earlier of (a) Customer's initial access to any Service (as defined below) through any online provisioning, registration or order process or (b) the effective date of the first Order Form referencing this Agreement.</p>
<p>As used in this Agreement, "Intercom" means (a) Intercom, Inc., a Delaware corporation with offices at 55 2nd&nbsp;Street, 4th&nbsp;Fl., San Francisco, CA 94105, USA, if Customer's billing address on the applicable Order Form is located in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, or Pennsylvania.

<strong>Modifications to this Agreement</strong>: From time to time, Intercom may modify this Agreement.
Unless otherwise specified by Intercom, changes become effective for Customer upon renewal of Customer's current Subscription Term (as defined below) or entry into a new Order Form.
Intercom will use reasonable efforts to notify Customer of the changes through communications via Customer's account, email or other means.
Customer may be required to click to accept or otherwise agree to the modified Agreement before renewing a Subscription Term or entering into a new Order Form, and in any event continued use of the Services after the updated version of this Agreement goes into effect will constitute Customer's acceptance of such updated version.
If Intercom specifies that changes to the Agreement will take effect prior to Customer's next renewal or order (such as for legal compliance or product change reasons) and Customer objects to such changes, Customer may terminate the applicable Subscription Term and receive as its sole remedy a refund of any fees Customer has pre-paid for use of the applicable Services for the terminated portion of the Subscription Term.</p>

Intercom's sole liability (and Customer's sole and exclusive remedy) for any breach of this warranty will be, at no charge to Customer, for Intercom to use commercially reasonable efforts to correct the reported non-conformity, or if Intercom determines such remedy to be impracticable, either party may terminate the applicable Subscription Term and Customer will receive as its sole remedy a refund of any fees Customer has pre-paid for use of such Service for the terminated portion of the applicable Subscription Term.
The limited warranty set forth in this Section 9.1 will not apply: (i) unless Customer makes a claim within thirty (30) days of the date on which Customer first noticed the non-conformity, (ii) if the error was caused by misuse, unauthorized modifications or third-party hardware, software or services, or (iii) to use provided on a no-charge, trial or evaluation basis.</p>
<p>9.2.&nbsp;<strong>Warranty Disclaimer</strong>&nbsp;.
EXCEPT FOR THE LIMITED WARRANTY IN SECTION 9.1, ALL Services and PROFESSIONAL SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS".
NEITHER INTERCOM NOR ITS SUPPLIERS MAKES ANY OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NONINFRINGEMENT.
Intercom does not warrant that Customer's use of THE ServiceS will be uninterrupted or error-free, nor does Intercom warrant that it will review the Customer Data for accuracy or that it will preserve or maintain the Customer Data without loss OR CORRUPTION.
INTERCOM SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR THE RESULTS OF ANY COMMUNICATIONS SENT OR ANY COMMUNICATIONS THAT WERE FAILED TO BE SENT USING THE SERVICES.
Intercom SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR DELAYS, INTERRUPTIONS, SERVICE FAILURES OR OTHER PROBLEMS INHERENT IN USE OF THE INTERNET AND ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS, THIRD-PARTY PLATFORMS OR OTHER SYSTEMS OUTSIDE THE REASONABLE CONTROL OF Intercom.
CUSTOMER MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS, BUT THE DURATION OF STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES, IF ANY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE SHORTEST PERIOD PERMITTED BY LAW.</p>10.
Availability and Service Credits<p>The Services are available subject to&nbsp;Intercom's Service Level Agreement.&nbsp;("<strong>SLA</strong>").</p>11.
Support<p>During the Subscription Term of each Service, Intercom will provide end user support in accordance with Intercom's&nbsp;Support Policy&nbsp;("<strong>Support Policy</strong>").</p>12.
Professional Services<p>Intercom will provide the professional consulting services ("<strong>Professional Services</strong>") purchased in the applicable Order Form.
The scope of Professional Services will be as set forth in a Statement of Work referencing this Agreement and executed by both parties describing the work to be performed, fees and any applicable milestones, dependencies and other technical specifications or related information ("<strong>SOW</strong>").
Unless Professional Services are provided on a fixed-fee basis, Customer will pay Intercom at the per-hour rates set forth in the Order Form (or, if not specified, at Intercom's then-standard rates) for any excess services.
Customer will reimburse Intercom for reasonable travel and lodging expenses as incurred.
Customer may use anything delivered as part of the Professional Services in support of authorized use of the Services and subject to the terms regarding Customer's rights to use the Service set forth in Section 2 (Intercom Services) and the applicable SOW, but Intercom will retain all right, title and interest in and to any such work product, code or deliverables and any derivative, enhancement or modification thereof created by Intercom (or its agents).</p>13.
Limitation of Remedies and Damages<p>13.1.&nbsp;<strong>Consequential Damages Waiver.&nbsp;</strong>EXCEPT FOR EXCLUDED CLAIMS (DEFINED BELOW), NEITHER PARTY (NOR ITS SUPPLIERS) SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST DATA, LOST PROFITS, FAILURE OF SECURITY MECHANISMS, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, RELIANCE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE.</p>
<p>13.2.&nbsp;<strong>Liability Cap.&nbsp;</strong>INTERCOM'S AND ITS SUPPLIERS' ENTIRE LIABILITY TO CUSTOMER ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY CUSTOMER TO INTERCOM DURING THE PRIOR TWELVE (12) MONTHS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.</p>
<p>13.3.&nbsp;<strong>Excluded Claims.&nbsp;</strong>"<strong>Excluded Claims</strong>" means any claim arising (a) from Customer's breach of Section 2.7 (General Restrictions).
(b) under Section 3.3 (Customer Obligations) or 3.4 (Indemnification by Customer).
or (c) from a party's breach of its obligations in Section 15 (Confidential Information) (but excluding claims arising from operation or non-operation of any Service).</p>
<p>13.4.&nbsp;<strong>Nature of Claims and Failure of Essential Purpose</strong>.
The parties agree that the waivers and limitations specified in this Section 13 apply regardless of the form of action, whether in contact, tort (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise and will survive and apply even if any limited remedy specified in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</p>14.
Indemnification<p>Intercom will defend Customer from and against any claim by a third party alleging that a Service when used as authorized under this Agreement infringes a U.S.
patent, U.S.
copyright, or U.S.
trademark and will indemnify and hold harmless Customer from and against any damages and costs finally awarded against Customer or agreed in settlement by Intercom (including reasonable attorneys' fees) resulting from such claim, provided that Intercom will have received from Customer: (i) prompt written notice of such claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for Intercom to respond without prejudice).
(ii) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense and settlement (if applicable) of such claim.
and (iii) all reasonable necessary cooperation of Customer.
If Customer's use of a Service is (or in Intercom's opinion is likely to be) enjoined, if required by settlement or if Intercom determines such actions are reasonably necessary to avoid material liability, Intercom may, in its sole discretion: (a) substitute substantially functionally similar products or services.
(b) procure for Customer the right to continue using such Service.
or if (a) and (b) are not commercially reasonable, (c) terminate this Agreement and refund to Customer the fees paid by Customer for the portion of the Subscription Term that was paid by Customer but not rendered by Intercom.
The foregoing indemnification obligation of Intercom will not apply: (1) if such Service is modified by any party other than Intercom, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such modification.
(2) if such Service is combined with products or processes not provided by Intercom, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such combination.
(3) to any unauthorized use of such Service.
(4) to any action arising as a result of Customer Data or any third-party deliverables or components contained within such Service.
(5) to the extent the alleged infringement is not caused by the particular technology or implementation of the Service but instead by features common to any similar product or service.
or (6) if Customer settles or makes any admissions with respect to a claim without Intercom's prior written consent.
THIS SECTION 14 SETS FORTH Intercom's AND ITS SUPPLIERS' SOLE LIABILITY AND CUSTOMER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT.</p>15.
Confidential Information<p>Each party (as "<strong>Receiving Party</strong>") agrees that all code, inventions, know-how, business, technical and financial information it obtains from the disclosing party ("<strong>Disclosing Party</strong>") constitute the confidential property of the Disclosing Party ("<strong>Confidential Information</strong>"), provided that it is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or should be reasonably known by the Receiving Party to be confidential or proprietary due to the nature of the information disclosed and the circumstances surrounding the disclosure.
Any Intercom Technology, performance information relating to any Service, and the terms and conditions of this Agreement will be deemed Confidential Information of Intercom without any marking or further designation.
Except as expressly authorized herein, the Receiving Party will (1) hold in confidence and not disclose any Confidential Information to third parties and (2) not use Confidential Information for any purpose other than fulfilling its obligations and exercising its rights under this Agreement.
The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, agents, contractors and other representatives having a legitimate need to know (including, for Intercom, the subcontractors referenced in Section 17.8 (Subcontractors)), provided that such representatives are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective of the Disclosing Party than this Section 15 and that the Receiving Party remains responsible for compliance by any such representative with the terms of this Section 15.
The Receiving Party's confidentiality obligations will not apply to information that the Receiving Party can document: (i) was rightfully in its possession or known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential Information.
(ii) is or has become public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party.
(iii) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation.
or (iv) is independently developed by employees of the Receiving Party who had no access to such information.
The Receiving Party may make disclosures to the extent required by law or court order, provided the Receiving Party notifies the Disclosing Party in advance and cooperates in any effort to obtain confidential treatment.
The Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party will be entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.</p>16.
Co-Marketing<p>At the request of Intercom, Customer agrees to the issuance of a joint press release ("<strong>Press Release</strong>") on a mutually agreed upon date or the 90th day from the Effective Date, whichever is earlier.
Each party will have the right to approve the Press Release in advance, but such approval will not be unreasonably delayed or withheld.
Customer also agrees to participate in other reasonable marketing activities that promote the benefits of the Services to other potential customers and to use of Customer's name and logo on Intercom's web site and in Intercom promotional materials.
Customer agrees that Intercom may disclose Customer as a customer of Intercom.</p>17.
General Terms<p>17.1.&nbsp;<strong>Assignment</strong>&nbsp;.
This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each party's permitted successors and assigns.
Neither party may assign this Agreement without the advance written consent of the other party, except that either party may assign this Agreement in connection with a merger, reorganization, acquisition or other transfer of all or substantially all of such party's assets or voting securities.
Any attempt to transfer or assign this Agreement except as expressly authorized under this Section 17.1 will be null and void.</p>
<p>17.2.&nbsp;<strong>Severability</strong>.
If any provision of this Agreement will be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in effect.</p>
<p>17.3.&nbsp;<strong>Governing Law.
Dispute Resolution</strong>.</p>
<p>a)&nbsp;Direct Dispute Resolution.
In the event of any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement arising from or relating to this Agreement, whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise, ("<strong>Dispute</strong>"), the parties shall first use their best efforts to resolve the Dispute.
If a Dispute arises, the complaining party shall provide written notice to the other party in a document specifically entitled "Initial Notice of Dispute," specifically setting forth the precise nature of the dispute ("<strong>Initial Notice of Dispute</strong>").
If an Initial Notice of Dispute is being sent to Intercom it must be emailed to legal@intercom.io and sent via mail to:</p>
<p>Attn: Legal Department Intercom 55 Second Street, Suite 400 San Francisco, CA 94105</p>
<p>Following receipt of the Initial Notice of Dispute, the parties shall consult and negotiate with each other in good faith and, recognizing their mutual interest, attempt to reach a just and equitable solution of the Dispute that is satisfactory to both parties ("<strong>Direct Dispute Resolution</strong>").
If the parties are unable to reach a resolution of the Dispute through Direct Dispute Resolution within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the Initial Notice of Dispute, then the Dispute shall subsequently be resolved by arbitration as set forth below.</p>
<p>b)&nbsp;Arbitration.
IN THE EVENT THAT A DISPUTE BETWEEN THE PARTIES CANNOT BE SETTLED THROUGH DIRECT DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE PARTIES AGREE TO SUBMIT THE DISPUTE TO BINDING ARBITRATION.
BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATE, THE PARTIES AGREE TO WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.
The arbitration shall be conducted before a single neutral arbitrator, before JAMS in San Francisco, California.
The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS in accordance with this document and the JAMS Streamlined Rules and Procedures for the Arbitration, with one addition: The limitation of one discovery deposition per side shall be applied by the arbitrator, unless it is determined, based on all relevant circumstances, that more depositions are warranted.
The arbitrator shall consider the amount in controversy, the complexity of the factual issues, the number of parties and the diversity of their interests and whether any or all of the claims appear, on the basis of the pleadings, to have sufficient merit to justify the time and expense associated with the requested discovery.</p>
<p>The arbitration will occur in San Francisco, California, but the parties may choose to appear by person, by phone, by another virtual means, or through the submission of documents.</p>
<p>The arbitrator will issue a ruling in writing.
Any issue concerning the extent to which any dispute is subject to arbitration, the applicability, interpretation, or enforceability of this agreement shall be resolved by the arbitrator.
To the extent state law is applicable, the arbitrator shall apply the substantive law of California.</p>
<p>All aspects of the arbitration shall be treated as confidential and neither the parties nor the arbitrators may disclose the content or results of the arbitration, except as necessary to comply with legal or regulatory requirements.
The result of the arbitration shall be binding on the parties and judgment on the arbitrator's award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
The arbitrator shall award to the prevailing party, if any, the costs and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred by the prevailing party in connection with the arbitration.</p>
<p>c)&nbsp;Choice of Law and Jurisdiction.
FOR ANY CLAIM WHICH IS NOT SUBJECT TO THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISION, CUSTOMER AGREES TO SUBMIT AND CONSENT TO THE PERSONAL AND EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION IN, AND THE EXCLUSIVE VENUE OF, THE STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED WITHIN SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA.
IN ANY DISPUTE, CALIFORNIA LAW SHALL APPLY.</p>
<p>d)&nbsp;Construction and Joinder.
THIS AGREEMENT MUST BE CONSTRUED AS IF IT WAS JOINTLY WRITTEN BY BOTH PARTIES.
BOTH CUSTOMER AND INTERCOM AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN THEIR RESPECTIVE INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS.
NO ARBITRATION OR CLAIM UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE JOINED TO ANY OTHER ARBITRATION OR CLAIM, INCLUDING ANY ARBITRATION OR CLAIM INVOLVING ANY OTHER CURRENT OR FORMER USER OF THE SERVICES, AND NO CLASS ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS SHALL BE PERMITTED.
IN THE EVENT OF ANY DISPUTE CONCERNING THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION, SUCH CLAIM MUST BE ADJUDICATED BY A COURT AND NOT BY AN ARBITRATOR.</p>
<p>e)&nbsp;Injunctive Relief.
Notwithstanding the above provisions, Intercom may apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.</p>
<p>17.4.&nbsp;<strong>Notice</strong>.
Any notice or communication required or permitted under this Agreement will be in writing to the parties at the addresses set forth on the Order Form or at such other address as may be given in writing by either party to the other in accordance with this Section and will be deemed to have been received by the addressee (i) if given by hand, immediately upon receipt.
(ii) if given by overnight courier service, the first business day following dispatch or (iii) if given by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested, the second business day after such notice is deposited in the mail.</p>
<p>17.5.&nbsp;<strong>Amendments.
Waivers</strong>.
Except as otherwise provided herein, no supplement, modification, or amendment of this Agreement will be binding, unless executed in writing by a duly authorized representative of each party to this Agreement.
No waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights under this Agreement, nor will any waiver be effective unless in a writing signed by a duly authorized representative on behalf of the party claimed to have waived.
No provision of any purchase order or other business form employed by Customer will supersede the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and any such document relating to this Agreement will be for administrative purposes only and will have no legal effect.</p>
<p>17.6.&nbsp;<strong>Entire Agreement</strong>.
This Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements and communications relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.
Customer acknowledges that the Services are on-line, subscription-based products, and that in order to provide improved customer experience Intercom may make changes to the Services, and Intercom will update the applicable Documentation accordingly.
The support and service level availability terms described in the Support Policy and the SLA may be updated from time to time upon reasonable notice to Customer to reflect process improvements or changing practices (but the modifications will not materially decrease Intercom's obligations as compared to those reflected in such terms as of the Effective Date).</p>
<p>17.7.&nbsp;<strong>Force Majeure</strong>.
Neither party will be liable to the other for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under this Agreement (except for a failure to pay fees) if the delay or failure is due to unforeseen events that occur after the signing of this Agreement and that are beyond the reasonable control of such party, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, failure or diminishment of power or telecommunications or data networks or services, or refusal of a license by a government agency.</p>
<p>17.8.&nbsp;<strong>Subcontractors</strong>&nbsp;.
Intercom may use the services of subcontractors and permit them to exercise the rights granted to Intercom in order to provide the Services under this Agreement, provided that Intercom remains responsible for (i) compliance of any such subcontractor with the terms of this Agreement and (ii) for the overall performance of the Services as required under this Agreement.</p>
<p>17.9.&nbsp;<strong>Subpoenas</strong>.
Nothing in this Agreement prevents Intercom from disclosing Customer Data to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court orders, but Intercom will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Customer where permitted to do so.</p>
<p>17.10.&nbsp;<strong>Independent Contractors</strong>.
The parties to this Agreement are independent contractors.
There is no relationship of partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise or agency created hereby between the parties.
Neither party will have the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other party's behalf without the other party's prior written consent</p>
<p>17.11.&nbsp;<strong>Export Control</strong>.
In its use of the Services, Customer agrees to comply with all export and import laws and regulations of the United States and other applicable jurisdictions.
Without limiting the foregoing, (i) Customer represents and warrants that it is not listed on any U.S.
