<p>If you deposit funds to the wrong address, FTX is not responsible for any losses.&nbsp.
If the funds are recoverable--e.g.
sending an ERC20 token to your ETH address or OMNI USDT to your BTC address--we can try to recover the funds.&nbsp.
Doing so is not guaranteed and might take up to a week.&nbsp.
We also charge a $500 fee for recovery.&nbsp.
Similarly, sending ETH via a smart contract to FTX may not be automatically credited, and may take time to recover.</p>
<p>FTT is the exchange token of the FTX ecosystem.&nbsp;&nbsp;FTT is not being offered in the United States or to U.S.
persons.</p>
<p>FTX does not permit self trades executed in order to manipulate markets, reported statistics, or cause liquidations.&nbsp.
Doing so is a violation of the FTX terms of service and may result in account closure.</p>
<p>To ensure account security, please set up Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for your FTX account immediately.
Our platform will not be responsible for any losses for accounts whose credentials are breached.</p>
<p>If a user has a Line of Credit from FTX, their own funds will always be considered to have been spent first from an ownership perspective.
if you are below your line of credit you cannot withdraw.<br>

<p>If FTX has evidence that an account is violating the terms of service, FTX reserves the right to shut down the account and, except in cases of suspected violations of our anti money laundering (AML) policy or other similar concerns about the source of wealth or malicious market manipulation, return funds to the user.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that, among other things, FTX does not guarantee the right to trade.&nbsp.
While FTX will take all reasonable methods to ensure that accounts do not receive any unwanted fills outside of our standard liquidation procedures, risk engine, and the terms of service, FTX does not as a matter of principle have any obligation to honor people's desires for trades to have occurred that didn't.</p>
