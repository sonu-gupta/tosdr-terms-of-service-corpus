</ul> Cookie Policy Cookies <p>Our Privacy Policy explains our principles when it comes to the collection, processing, and storage of your information.
The Cookie Policy specifically explains how we, our partners, and users of our services deploy cookies, as well as the options you have to control them.</p> What are cookies? <p>Cookies are small pieces of data, stored in text files, that are stored on your computer or other device when websites are loaded in a browser.
They are widely used to ‘remember’ you and your preferences, either for a single visit (through a ‘session cookie’) or for multiple repeat visits (using a ‘persistent cookie’).
They ensure a consistent and efficient experience for visitors, and perform essential functions such as allowing users to register and remain logged in.
Cookies may be set by the site that you are visiting (known as ‘first party cookies’), or by third parties, such as those who serve content or provide advertising or analytics services on the website (‘third party cookies’).</p> Cookies set by WordPress.org <p>We use cookies for a number of different purposes.
Some cookies are necessary for technical reasons.
some enable a personalized experience for both visitors and registered users.
and some allow the display of advertising from selected third party networks.
Some of these cookies may be set when a page is loaded, or when a visitor takes a particular action (clicking the ‘like’ or ‘follow’ button on a post, for example).</p>
<p>Below the different categories of cookies set by WordPress.org are outlined, with specific examples detailed in the tables that follow.
This includes their name and purpose.
Certain cookies are only set for logged-in visitors, whereas others are set for any visitors, and these are marked below accordingly.
Where a cookie only applies to specific subdomains, they are included under the relevant header.</p>
<p>
<strong>Strictly Necessary</strong>: These are the cookies that are essential for WordPress.org to perform basic functions.
These include those required to allow registered users to authenticate and perform account related functions.</p>
<p>
<strong>Functionality</strong>: These cookies are used to store preferences set by users such as account name, language, and location.</p>
<p>
<strong>Performance</strong>: Performance cookies collect information on how users interact with websites hosted on WordPress.org, including what pages are visited most, as well as other analytical data.
These details are only used to improve how the website functions.</p>
<p>
<strong>Tracking</strong>: These are set by trusted third party networks (e.g.
Google Analytics) to track details such as the number of unique visitors, and pageviews to help improve the user experience.</p>
<p>
<strong>Third Party/Embedded Content</strong>: WordPress.org makes use of different third party applications and services to enhance the experience of website visitors.
These include social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter (through the use of sharing buttons), or embedded content from YouTube and Vimeo.
As a result, cookies may be set by these third parties, and used by them to track your online activity.
We have no direct control over the information that is collected by these cookies.</p> wordpress.org Cookie Duration Purpose Logged-in Users Only? devicePixelRatio Browser default (1 year) Used to make the site responsive to the visitor’s screen size.
