<li>Sometimes when you use the Services, you may (as a result of, or through your use of the Services) use a service or download a piece of software, or purchase goods, which are provided by another person or company.
Your use of these other services, software or goods may be subject to separate terms between you and the company or person concerned.
If so, the Terms do not affect your legal relationship with these other companies or individuals.</li>
<li>The Terms constitute the whole legal agreement between you and Penrose Hill and govern your use of the Services (but excluding any services which Penrose Hill may provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replace any prior agreements between you and Penrose Hill in relation to the Services.</li>
<li>You agree that Penrose Hill may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms, by email, regular mail, or postings on the Services.</li>
<li>You agree that if Penrose Hill does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the Terms (or which Penrose Hill has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Penrose Hill’s rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Penrose Hill.</li>
<li>If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of these Terms is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the Terms without affecting the rest of the Terms.
The remaining provisions of the Terms will continue to be valid and enforceable.</li>
<li>You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Penrose Hill is the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the Terms and that such other companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the Terms which confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them.

<li>The Terms, and your relationship with Penrose Hill under the Terms, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.
Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms, the Services or the relationship between you and us shall be settled by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association using the AAA's Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
Such arbitration shall be specific to you, and as such, you agree that you shall not bring or participate in any action against Penrose Hill as part of a class action either in arbitration or in any court.
In the event the foregoing is held to be unenforceable by any court, You and Penrose Hill agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the State of Delaware to resolve any legal matter arising from the Terms.
Notwithstanding this, you agree that Penrose Hill shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.</li>
