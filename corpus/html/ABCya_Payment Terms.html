App Subscribers <p>We may offer different tiers or types of Subscription Account.
The types of available Subscription Account and the fees for and benefits of each type will be as described on the Platform.

<strong>Enrollment &amp.
Account Type</strong>
<br> We may offer different tiers or types of Subscription Account.
The types of available Subscription Account and the fees for and benefits of each type will be as described on the Platform.
Unless otherwise expressly stated on the Platform, all fees are listed in, and will be charged in, United States Dollars.</p>
<p>Some of types of Subscription Accounts that we offer will expire at the conclusion of the original subscription period, unless affirmatively renewed by the subscriber.
Other types of Subscription Account, like our monthly subscription, will renew automatically at the conclusion of each subscription period.
If you elect such a plan, then, once you subscribe, your Subscription Account will renew automatically on a periodic basis (e.g., month-to-month for our monthly plan) and you will be billed each subscription period unless and until you cancel your Subscription Account or we terminate your use of the Platform pursuant to our Terms of Use.
You may cancel your subscription at any time by navigating to the "Manage Your Account" page on the Platform and following the on-screen links and instructions to cancel, as described below.</p>
<p>You will not be able to change the type/tier of your Subscription Account once subscribed.
If you later wish to subscribe to a Subscription Account of a different type or tier, you will need to cancel your current Subscription Account and begin a new one.</p>
<p>Billing for Accounts Created Directly with ABCya</p>
<p>You will be required to provide valid payment card information as part of your creation of a Subscription Account.
(ABCya may limit the type of payment cards accepted as described during the checkout process or otherwise on the Platform.) The fees for your Subscription Account (plus any applicable taxes) will be billed to the payment card you provide when you initially subscribe or shortly thereafter.
If you have selected an auto-renewing plan, then your Subscription Account will automatically renew each subscription period and ABCya will bill the payment card then associated with your Subscription Account on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your Subscription Account, unless and until you cancel.
For example, if you sign up for a monthly Subscription Account on January 1, your date of first renewal would be February 1.
In the event you sign up for a monthly Subscription Account on a calendar day not contained in any subsequent month, your account will renew (and your payment card will be billed) on the last day of such month.
For example, if you were to create a monthly Subscription Account on March 31, your account would next be billed on April 30.</p>
<p>It is your responsibility to keep your billing and contact information up-to-date.
You may change the payment card associated with your account at any time by visiting the Manage Your Account page on the Platform.
If your payment card is declined during the renewal process or we are otherwise unable to process a transaction using your payment card, we will terminate your Subscription Account following the conclusion of the last period for which you completed payment.
If you want to resume use of the subscriber features of the Platform, you will need to enroll in a new Subscription Account.</p>
<p>You shall be solely responsible for all internet connection and other costs that you incur accessing and using the Platform.</p>
