</ul> Bandwidth and Disk Quotas CES Updated December 10, 2020 20:59 Follow 1.
Hosted website and media bandwidth usage at Sonic.net
<p>Each Sonic.net service type has an associated hosted website and media bandwidth quota.
Accounts with multiple services will gain the benefit of each service's quota combined (they are cumulative).
Usage during the month that is trending above the total quota (i.e.
is projected to exceed the quota by the end of the month based upon the current portion of the month already passed) will generate a warning email.</p>
<p>
<strong>Additional bandwidth transfer usage beyond the quota will be billed at $4.95 per gigabyte in 1GB increments.</strong> The bandwidth quota includes bandwidth used for content you host here at Sonic.net, including web, FTP and multimedia.
It does not apply to content you download to your PC via your dialup, DSL, or other Sonic.net connection.</p>
<p>This hosted website and media bandwidth quota is applied across all of your sites as a group, so you receive significant benefit if you have multiple sites hosted on your Sonic.net account.
It is not required that bandwidth be used equally by your sites.
this means that if you have one site that's more popular or larger, it receives the benefit of the leftover quota for the smaller or less popular sites.</p>
<p>To view your current bandwidth and disk quota usage please see Disk Usage Monitoring in the Member Tools.
We also support some forms of bandwidth quota protection for hosting usage.</p>

Disk usage at Sonic.net
<p>Each Sonic.net service on an account which comes with a disk quota will increase the amount of disk storage available on our servers by a set amount.
Usage during the month that is trending above the quota (that is, is projected to exceed the quota by the end of the month based upon the current portion of the month which has passed) will generate a warning email.</p>
<p>
<strong>Additional disk usage beyond the quota will be billed at $10 per 250 megabytes.</strong> The disk quota includes disk space used for content you host here at Sonic.net, including web, FTP, unix home directory, streaming multimedia servers, MySQL and SSL.</p>
<p>Disk quotas are cumulative and applied across all of your services as a group, so you receive significant benefit if you have multiple sites or services hosted on your Sonic.net account.
It is not required that disk space be used equally by your sites.
this means that if you have one site that's more popular or larger, it receives the benefit of the leftover quota for the smaller or less popular sites.</p>
