<u>AAA</u>
</i>”) in accordance with the AAA’s “Consumer Arbitration Rules” effective September 1, 2014, including the “Costs of Arbitration (Including AAA Administrative Fees)” effective September 1, 2014 (collectively, the “<i>
<u>Consumer Procedures</u>
</i>”) and will be subject to the following: </p>
<p> 11.6.1.
The Consumer Procedures provide for certain fees, specifically allocating some to the consumer (you) and others to the business (Vendor).
If your claim is US$75,000 or less, Vendor will pay all of those specified fees and costs, including those allocated to the consumer.
Vendor does not agree to bear any other costs.
If your claim is more than US$75,000, the Consumer Procedures will govern payment.
</p>
<p> 11.6.2.
Except as provided in below, the AAA’s Consumer Procedures will be applied to any Dispute between the parties.
However, pursuant to Consumer Arbitration Rule R-1(e), a party may raise the proper application of the Consumer Arbitration Rules to an arbitrator for a final decision.
This Agreement governs to the extent it conflicts with the Consumer Procedures.
You will commence arbitration only in the county or other similar political subdivision in which you reside.
The arbitration proceedings will be conducted by conference call.

</p>
<p> 11.6.3.
You and the Vendor agree that the use of the AAA to administer arbitration is not integral to the parties’ agreement to arbitrate Disputes.
If the AAA will not or cannot conduct an arbitration, you and Vendor will negotiate in good faith to agree on a sole arbitrator who will resolve the Dispute as provided in the Consumer Procedures.
If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, a court of competent jurisdiction may appoint an arbitrator, who will follow the AAA’s Consumer Procedures .
</p>
<p> 11.6.4.
If one or more parts of this Section <u>11</u> are found to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a Dispute, then, and only in that circumstance, those parts will be severed and the Dispute will be resolved subject to all remaining parts of this Section <u>11</u> and all other provisions of this Agreement.
If such severance results in all or some parts of a Dispute proceeding in a court of law, exclusive jurisdiction for any such court proceeding will be the courts sitting in the county of New York, New York, U.S.
For purposes of any such court proceeding, you consent to, and will not challenge, the New York, New York courts’ personal jurisdiction over you, and you further waive objection based upon improper venue or forum non conveniens and will not seek transfer to another district or jurisdiction.
</p>
<p> 11.7.
Notwithstanding the preceding paragraphs of this Section <u>11</u>, if you acquired a Solution for other than personal or household use, the arbitration proceedings, including the payment of costs, will be administered in accordance with the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules (the “<i>
<u>Commercial Procedures</u>
</i>”).
The Commercial Procedures are appropriately applied to any Dispute between the parties, and you will not advocate otherwise in any proceeding.
However, this Agreement governs to the extent it conflicts with the Commercial Procedures.
