Content Rating Levels You must ensure that your posts are tagged properly.<br>
Similar Worlds is a very diverse social network, of varying opinions, ideologies and standards.<br>
In order to help protect users and provide the most relevant and appropriate content per each user's preferences, it is important that all users act responsibly, correctly labeling/categorizing their own content, especially when it falls into more adult themed categories.<br>
Users can select through their account settings, various "Content Rating Levels", which algorithmically determines what content may be most suitable and interesting for that user.<br>
Below is a description of each rating level: <ul>
