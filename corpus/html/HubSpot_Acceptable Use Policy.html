</ul> HubSpot Acceptable Use Policy <p>Last Modified: February 3, 2021</p>
<p>This HubSpot Acceptable Use Policy ("AUP") applies to the use of any product, service or website provided by us (HubSpot), whether we provide it directly or use another party to provide it to you (each, a "HubSpot Service").
This AUP is designed to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations that apply to the HubSpot Service.
This AUP also protects the interests of all of our clients and their customers, as well as our goodwill and reputation.
These terms are so important that we cannot provide the HubSpot Service unless you agree to them.
By using the HubSpot Service, you are agreeing to these terms.&nbsp;</p>

General Terms</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are using any HubSpot Service, this AUP applies to you.
Every client of ours agrees to abide by this AUP and is responsible for any violations.
You are not allowed to assist or engage others in a way that would violate this AUP.
We will enforce and ensure compliance with this AUP by using methods we consider to be appropriate, such as complaint and email failure monitoring.&nbsp.
We may also suspend or terminate your use of HubSpot Services pursuant to our Customer Terms of Service for violations of this AUP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We periodically update these terms and we will let you know when we do through the Notification app in the HubSpot portal used to access your HubSpot subscription (if you have one), or by posting a revised copy on our website.
You agree to review the AUP on a regular basis and always remain in compliance.</p> 1.<strong>&nbsp;Reporting Suspected Violations</strong>
<p>We encourage recipients of email messages sent using the HubSpot Service to report suspected&nbsp;violations&nbsp;of this AUP to us by forwarding a copy of the received email with FULL headers to&nbsp;abuse@hubspot.com.
We have a policy to&nbsp;investigate all of these reports and to respond in the way we consider appropriate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you know of or suspect a violation of this AUP, you will promptly notify&nbsp;us&nbsp;in writing of the known or suspected violation of this AUP.</p> 2.<strong>&nbsp;Prohibited Email Actions&nbsp;</strong>
<p>a.&nbsp;You may not use HubSpot to send spam.
Spam can be in the form of bulk email or one to one commercial emails.</p>
<p>Bulk email is spam when it is unsolicited.
Unsolicited means the recipient has not granted verifiable permission for the message to be sent.
Bulk means that the message is sent as part of a larger collection of messages that have substantively similar content.
<br>One-to-one commercial emails are spam when they violate CAN-SPAM.
One-to-one commercial emails are also considered Spam if the data processed for purposes of sending that email is in scope of the General Data Protection Regulation (‘GDPR’) and you fail to provide notice to individuals and establish a lawful basis of processing.</p>
<p>You may not use the HubSpot Service in any way (directly or indirectly) to send, transmit, handle, distribute or deliver: (a)&nbsp;spam in violation of the CAN-SPAM Act (referenced below) or any other law.
(b) email to an address obtained via Internet harvesting methods or any surreptitious methods (e.g., scraping or harvesting).
(c) email to an address that is incomplete, inaccurate and/or not updated for all applicable opt-out notifications, using best efforts and best practices in the industry, (d) commercial electronic messages in violation of Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (referenced below), or&nbsp;(e) in violation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>b.
You may not use any misleading or false names, addresses, email address, or subject line.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Email sent, or caused to be sent to or through the HubSpot Service may not: (a) use or contain invalid or forged headers.
(b) use or contain invalid or non-existent domain names.
(c) employ any technique to otherwise misrepresent, hide or obscure any information in identifying the point of origin or the transmission path.
(d) use other means of deceptive addressing.
(e) use a third party's internet domain name&nbsp;without their consent, or be relayed from or through a third party's equipment without the third party’s permission.
(f) contain false or misleading information in the subject line or otherwise contain false or misleading content.
or (g) use&nbsp;our&nbsp;trademark(s), tagline(s), or logo(s) without our prior written consent and only then pursuant to&nbsp;our&nbsp;trademark usage guidelines.</p>
<p>If you use email, we recommend&nbsp;that you adopt the Messaging, Malware and Mobile Anti-Abuse Working Group (M<sup>3</sup>AAWG) Sender Best Communications Practices (BCP), which were created and agreed upon with collaborative input from both volume email senders and Internet Service Providers.
The Sender Best Communications Practices document is available here.
You will use commercially reasonable efforts to follow these practices.</p>
<p>c.
You may not email purchased lists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are prohibited from using the HubSpot Service to email: (a) purchased, rented, or borrowed lists, and&nbsp;(b) lists that are likely to result in an excessive number of unsubscribe requests or Spam complaints or notices, as determined by acceptable industry practices.</p> 3.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;Email Opt-out Requirements</strong>&nbsp.
<p>You warrant that each email you send or is sent for you using the HubSpot Service will contain: (a) header information that is not false or misleading.
and (b) an advisement that the recipient may unsubscribe, opt-out or otherwise demand that use of its information for unsolicited, impermissible and/or inappropriate communication(s) as described in this AUP be stopped (and how the recipient can notify you that it wants to unsubscribe, opt-out, or stop this use of its information).&nbsp;These requirements may not apply if the email sent is a transactional email and these requirements are not otherwise required by law.&nbsp;You warrant that you will promptly comply with all opt-out, unsubscribe, "do not call" and "do not send" requests.</p> 4.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;Telephone Marketing</strong>
<p>You must comply with all laws relating to telephone marketing, including without limitation those specifically referenced in the ‘Proper Usage of HubSpot Service’ section below.
You must comply with all laws related to the recording of phone calls and ensure all proper consent to record is obtained prior to making any such recording.
If you use the HubSpot Service to place telephone calls, you must also comply with all applicable industry standards, including those applicable guidelines published by the CTIA and the Mobile Marketing Association.
