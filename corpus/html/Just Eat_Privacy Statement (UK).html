We will only share your information with these third parties where you have given your consent.
If you don’t want us to use your personal information in this way or generally change your mind about receiving any form of marketing communications, you can unsubscribe at any time using the unsubscribe functionality in the communication you receive or by amending your profile accordingly.

If any part of our business enters into a joint venture, purchases another business or is sold to or merged with another business entity, your information may be disclosed or transferred to the target company, or new business partners or owners or their agents and advisors.
In these circumstances we will always inform the relevant entities that they must only use your personal information for the purposes disclosed in this Privacy Notice.</p>
<p>Any law enforcement or regulatory body, government agency, court or other third party where we believe disclosure is necessary (i) as a matter of applicable law or regulation, (ii) to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights, or (iii) to protect your vital interests or those of any other person.</p>
<p>Any other person provided that you have given your consent to the disclosure.
We will not sell, distribute or lease your personal information unless we have your permission or are required by law to do so.</p> 3.
Legal basis for processing personal information <p>Our legal basis for collecting and using your personal information as described above will depend on the specific context in which we collect it.<br>
Our main reason for collecting and using your personal information is to perform our contract with you (i.e.
to make sure you get your Order when you want it).
However we will also use your personal information where it is in our legitimate business interests to do so (but only if our interests are not overridden by your data protection interests or your fundamental legal rights and freedoms).
In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you (e.g.
in the event of legal proceedings) or we might need to process it or share it with others to “protect your vital interests” (this is legal speak for saving your life) or those of another person (e.g.
in a case where another person’s life is in danger).<br>
If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (and we’ll also explain the possible consequences of you not providing it).<br>
Similarly, we may collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party).
Relevant legitimate interests include a) to market to you or make you offers that we believe will interest you.
b) to analyse and understand how our services are used and so to improve them.
c) for fraud prevention or prevention of other criminal acts.
or d) to keep our systems secure.<br>
If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us” below.</p> 4.
International data transfers <p>We may transfer your personal information to countries other than the country in which you are resident.
Just Eat’s website servers are mainly located in the Republic of Ireland and Germany, however our group companies and third party service providers and partners operate in a number of countries, including Australia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, France, Ireland, Italy, Mauritius, Mexico, Norway, New Zealand, the Philippines, Spain, Switzerland, Ukraine and United Kingdom.
This means that when we collect your personal information we may process it in any of these countries.<br>
Whilst these countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country, you can rest assured that Just Eat takes care to implement appropriate safeguards to protect your personal information in those countries in accordance with this Privacy Notice.
Some of the safeguards we rely on include, where appropriate, using the European Commission’s approved standard contractual clauses with our suppliers, intra-group transfer agreements (so that we can safely transfer your data between the Just Eat group of companies all over the world).</p> 5.
Security <p>We place great importance on keeping your personal information safe and secure.
As such, we put in place appropriate technical and organisational measures / industry standard technology to protect it from unauthorised access and unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage.<br>
The security measures we use are designed to provide a level of protection security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information.
Where you have chosen a password which allows you to access certain parts of the Services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.
We advise you not to share your password with anyone and to use a unique password for our Services.
We will not be liable for any unauthorised transactions entered into using your name and password.</p> 6.
Data retention <p>Just Eat will retain your personal information where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, while you hold an account with us or to enable us to meet our legal, tax or accounting obligations).<br>
If you object to us processing certain categories of your personal information (including in relation to receiving marketing communications from us), we will retain a record of your objection to the processing of your information so that we can continue to respect your wishes.<br>
We will destroy or permanently anonymise your personal information at the point that we no longer need to process it for our ongoing legitimate business needs or for any legal reason.
If this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store it and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p> 7.
Your data protection rights <p>Just Eat respects your privacy and data protection rights.
Below is a summary of your rights in respect of the personal information of yours which Just Eat handles:<br>
Just Eat provides you with the tools to access, review or update your personal information at any time through your account.
If you wish to request deletion of your personal information, you can do so by contacting us using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us” heading below.<br>

Again, you can exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us” heading below.<br>
You have the right to opt-out of receiving marketing communications we send you at any time.
You can exercise this right by using the unsubscribe functionality in the communication you receive or by amending your profile accordingly.<br>
