Forward-Looking Statements
<p>Suncor’s websites contain certain forward-looking information and forward-looking statements (collectively referred to herein as “forward-looking statements”) within the meaning of applicable Canadian and U.S.
securities laws.
Forward-looking statements and other information are based on Suncor’s current expectations, estimates, projections and assumptions that were made by Suncor in light of information available at the time the statement was made and consider Suncor’s experience and its perception of historical trends, including expectations and assumptions concerning: the accuracy of reserves and resources estimates.
commodity prices and interest and foreign exchange rates.
the performance of assets and equipment.
capital efficiencies and cost-savings.
applicable laws and government policies.
future production rates.
the sufficiency of budgeted capital expenditures in carrying out planned activities.
the availability and cost of labour, services and infrastructure.
the satisfaction by third parties of their obligations to Suncor.
the execution of projects.
and the receipt, in a timely manner, of regulatory and third-party approvals.
In addition, all other statements and other information that address expectations or projections about the future, and other statements and information about Suncor’s strategy for growth, expected and future expenditures or investment decisions, commodity prices, costs, schedules, production volumes, operating and financial results, future financing and capital activities, and the expected impact of future commitments are forward-looking statements.
Some of the forward-looking statements may be identified by words such as “objective”, “targets”, “estimates”, “anticipated”, “plans”, “goal”, “vision”, “strategy”, “expects”, “proposed”, “intention”, “continue”, “may”, “will”, “outlook”, “opportunity”, “pursuing”, “illustrative”, “projected”, “scheduled”, “believes”, “indicates”, “could”, “focus”, “should”, “would” and variations of such words and similar expressions.</p>
<p>Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve a number of risks and uncertainties, some that are similar to other oil and gas companies and some that are unique to Suncor.
Suncor’s actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by its forward-looking statements, so readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on them.
Risks, uncertainties and other factors that could influence the financial and operating performance of Suncor include, but are not limited to, changes in general economic, market and business conditions, such as commodity prices, interest rates and currency exchange rates.
fluctuations in supply and demand for Suncor’s products.
the successful and timely implementation of capital projects, including growth projects and regulatory projects.
competitive actions of other companies, including increased competition from other oil and gas companies or from companies that provide alternative sources of energy.
labour and material shortages.
actions by government authorities, including the imposition or reassessment of taxes or changes to fees and royalties, and changes in environmental and other regulations.
the ability and willingness of parties with whom we have material relationships to perform their obligations to us.
outages to third-party infrastructure that could cause disruptions to production.
the occurrence of unexpected events such as fires, equipment failures and other similar events affecting Suncor or other parties whose operations or assets directly or indirectly affect Suncor.
the potential for security breaches of Suncor’s information systems by computer hackers or cyberterrorists, and the unavailability or failure of such systems to perform as anticipated as a result of such breaches.
our ability to find new oil and gas reserves that can be developed economically.
the accuracy of Suncor’s reserves, resources and future production estimates.
market instability affecting Suncor’s ability to borrow in the capital debt markets at acceptable rates.
maintaining an optimal debt to cash flow ratio.
the success of Suncor’s risk management activities using derivatives and other financial instruments.
the cost of compliance with current and future environmental laws.
risks and uncertainties associated with closing a transaction for the purchase or sale of an oil and gas property, including estimates of the final consideration to be paid or received, the ability of counterparties to comply with their obligations in a timely manner and the receipt of any required regulatory or other third-party approvals outside of Suncor’s control that are customary to transactions of this nature.
the accuracy of cost estimates, some of which are provided at the conceptual or other preliminary stage of projects and prior to commencement or conception of the detailed engineering that is needed to reduce the margin of error and increase the level of accuracy.
the ability to secure adequate product transportation.
the risk of war, hostilities, civil insurrection, political instability and terrorist threats.
and risks associated with existing and potential future lawsuits and regulatory actions.
The foregoing important factors are not exhaustive.</p>
<p>Although Suncor believes that the expectations represented by such forward-looking statements are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct.
Suncor’s most recently filed Annual Report, Quarterly Report, Annual Information Form/Form 40-F, and other documents it files from time to time with securities regulatory authorities describe the risks, uncertainties, material assumptions and other factors that could influence actual results and such factors are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p>Copies of these documents are available without charge from Suncor through the following means:</p>
<ul>
<li>via mail request: 150 6th Avenue S.W., Calgary, Alberta T2P 3Y7,</li>
<li>by telephone 1 (800) 558-9071,</li>
<li>via email request to info@suncor.com</li>
<li>by referring to Suncor’s profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com/ or EDGAR at www.sec.gov/.</li>
</ul>
<p>Except as required by applicable securities laws, Suncor disclaims any intention or obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.</p>
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
<p>Certain financial measures on Suncor’s websites are not prescribed by Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).
Non-GAAP measures presented do not have any standardized meaning and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.
Therefore, these non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP measures are included because management uses the information to analyze business performance, leverage and liquidity and therefore may be considered useful information by investors.
Non-GAAP measures are defined and reconciled in Suncor’s most recent Management’s Discussion and Analysis filed with securities regulatory authorities available at www.sedar.com/.</p>
Reserves
<p>Unless otherwise stated, reserves information presented on Suncor’s websites is presented as Suncor’s working interest (operating and non-operating) before deduction of royalties, and without including any royalty interests of Suncor.
For more information on Suncor’s reserves, please see Suncor’s most recent Annual Information Form/Form 40-F filed with securities regulatory authorities available at www.sedar.com/ and www.sec.gov/.</p>
<p>Certain crude oil and natural gas liquids volumes have been converted to mcfe on the basis of one bbl to six mcf.
Also, certain natural gas volumes have been converted to boe or mboe on the same basis.
Any figure presented in mcfe, boe or mboe may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation.
A conversion ratio of one barrel of crude oil or natural gas liquids to six thousand cubic feet of natural gas is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not necessarily represent value equivalency at the wellhead.
Given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value.</p>
