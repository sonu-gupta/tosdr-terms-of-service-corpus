         <p>VPN Privacy Policy | Extensions Privacy Policy | Common Information | Cookies Policy</p>
<p>This policy applies solely to our VPN Services and must be read together with the general data processing information.
Please read Common Information for overall information about who we are.
For other products and services please visit Extensions Privacy Policy, and for the information how we handle website cookies, please visit our Cookies Policy.</p>
<p>This policy applies to client versions: </p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 5.1</li>
<li>MacOS 5.2</li>
<li>Android 5.8</li>
<li>iOS 5.2</li>
<li>HMA VPN Proxy Unblocker 1.1</li>
</ul>
<p>For older versions of this document, please visit the legal archive.</p>
<p>This policy does not apply to service data which may be collected by different products, such as an antivirus app, or to the operation of cookies on our website.</p> What data our VPN processes? <p>Generally speaking, we need some personal data particularly to provide you our products and services, optimize and improve our products and services, to send you direct marketing, or to comply with our legal obligations.
We try to minimize the collection of any data, we aggregate or delete it as soon as possible, and if it is not necessary we don’t collect it at all.
We will describe how we process the data in the following sections.
But let’s start with what we don’t collect.</p> Our No Logging Policy - data we don’t send to our servers.
Period.
<ul>
<li>Originating IP address.</li>
<li>Any DNS queries while connected.
We rely on our own secure DNS servers, so your queries are also protected from exposure to 3rd parties.</li>
<li>Browsing history.</li>
<li>Transferred data.</li>
</ul> Personal Data Use <p>Personal data is understood as any information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person and includes the information you provide to us while using our VPN services.</p>
<p>More specifically, we may collect and process personal data about you in the following situations:</p> Product functionality Service Data from our VPN servers <p>If you use our VPN service, we collect the minimum amount of information needed to provide and operate it, as well as keep it running safely and efficiently.
This is the data we collect to make sure our VPN infrastructure works (“Service Data”):</p> Service Data What we use it for Day of connection<br>E.g.
We store the date you were connected together with an internal identifier, but not the exact time: timestamps are floored to either 12 am or 12 pm.
To troubleshoot for support and abuse handling.<br>
<br>Example: To know the amount of daily active users.
Rounded amount of data transmitted<br>E.g.
If a user transferred within the session 364MB, we floor it to 300MB.
1843MB of transferred data is floored to 1000MB.
We keep just the first digit of the value together with an internal identifier.
To plan for new network capacity and server improvements.<br>
<br>Example: We may deploy more capacity to meet demand and make sure speeds stay up for all users.
<p>
<b>We store server’s service data for 35 days</b>, after which time it is deleted on a rolling basis — data created on Jan 3rd, 2020 gets deleted on Feb 7rd 2020, for example.</p> Service Data from our VPN clients <p>In order to make sure our VPN clients do their job properly and without errors we have to know how many specific errors we have.
This data pertains to interactions taken in the app, and cannot be used to uncover what you’re using the VPN service for.</p> Client Data What we use it for Connection events<br>
<br>Events such as the attempt to connect, disconnection, connection error, etc.
together with an internal identifier exclusively used for this (“connection event identifier”) To operate and provide VPN service with high quality.
We do not pair any individual user with this data.<br>
<br>Example: How many unknown users get the same error? Application Events<br>
<br>Events such as auto-connection, uninstall event, etc.
together with an internal identifier (“application event identifier”) To plan product development and analytics<br>
<br>Example: How many users do we have? Is a new client-side feature we introduced popular? Are people uninstalling after our latest release? Crash reports generated and sent by the user<br>
<br>We might collect data like your e-mail, app version or internal identifiers described above.
To help troubleshoot the issue.
We don’t send any privacy-sensitive data automatically - you need to explicitly allow sending this back to us and check prior to what data is being sent before you share it with us.<br>
<br>Please note that if you provide us together with information above also your personal data, e.g.
within an ad hoc crash report that you decide to send to us, we could add this information to the service data and might be able to connect it with you.<br>
<br>Example: App is crashing on some specific device.
This is how customer care support can help with device-specific issues.
<p>
<b>We store client’s service data for 2 years</b>, after which time it is deleted on a rolling basis — data created on Jan 3rd, 2019 gets deleted on Jan 3rd, 2021, for example.</p>
<p>Note: if you are using an older version of HMA, our apps may be configured to collect your username.
While we have set our servers to immediately dump this information for all versions of clients, this is still a potential risk to your privacy.
The only way to resolve this is to upgrade your VPN app/service to the latest versions.</p> Account creation and management <p>When you create an account with us (note: this is necessary in order for you to use the VPN service), we will need some information about you.
This is the personal data that is created and stored for the management of your account:</p> Account data What we use it for Email address To send you purchase receipts, communications, and occasional product news Username (only for legacy versions) To manage your account and facilitate your login into the service.
We do not collect this information anymore.
Usernames are used only with older versions of our VPN clients.
Activation code To activate your subscription Subscription renewal date To tell us until when the account is valid <p>All of the above data is stored for as long as you use our service, as it is necessary for us to provide it.
However, your Account Data is not paired with your activity usage.
You can see all of this data by logging into our Privacy Preference portal.</p> Billing and Payment <p>We rely on third-party payment processors to handle your product purchases.
You can find out which provider we are working with for the point of purchase you chose (for example our website, an app store, etc) by looking at your transactional email or receipt.</p>
<p>This is the list of payment processors we cooperate with and their privacy policies:</p>
<ul>
<li>2Checkout - https://www.2checkout.com/legal/privacy/</li>
<li>Google Play - https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US</li>
<li>Apple iTunes - https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/</li>
</ul>
<p>These providers are in the position of independent controllers and may collect a variety of information about you to complete the purchase.
All of them are PCI-compliant or the equivalent and are prohibited from using your personal data for anything but facilitating your payment and subscription management or as otherwise described in their applicable terms of service and privacy policy.</p>
<p>Some of that billing data may be shared with us in order to detect and prevent fraud, help with customer support, or used as a record of your payment for accounting, taxation, and invoicing purposes.
This data is what we call “billing data” and it includes your name, address, email address, the product (subscription you purchased) and for how long, and payment information.</p>
<p>Your payment provider will process your credit card number, but it is not shared with us.</p>
<p>On our side, billing data is stored for as long as you continue to use our service, and for up to 10 years after that.
If legal obligations change, or we need to resolve disputes and enforce our agreements, we may be obliged to keep this data longer than that.</p> Communication The Email <p>If you contact us by email, it will be stored for 6 months, unless required by law or other exceptional circumstances.
We do this to speed up our turn around on support and to follow up.
</p>
<p>If you are a user of our service or you have subscribed on our website, we will send you such commercial communications through this channel in the form of newsletters, or blog notifications.
Please note, if you don’t want to be on our mailing list, you may use the “Unsubscribe” link available in every communication we send you.</p> Livechat <p>When you use our Livechat functionality, we also store the message for 6 months.
Our Livechat functionality is provided by Zopim (a ZenDesk subsidiary), which may also collect some data subject to their security policy and privacy policy.</p>
<p>Please note that if you provide us with your personal data we might be able to connect the collected service data with you.</p> Third-party tools used for analytics <p>To analyze application events from our VPN clients in order to understand how our services function, or how stable or successful they are, we rely on our own analytics tools as much as possible.
Here are the third-party tools we use, how we use them, and their privacy policies:</p> Microsoft App Center on macOS.
<p>Microsoft App Center (former HockeyApp) on older versions of our macOS and iOS apps: This was used to do beta distribution, crash reporting, user metrics, feedback, and more.
This tool belongs to Microsoft and you can find their privacy policy here.</p> Google Firebase Analytics on iOS and Android <p>Firebase helps us to understand how people interact with certain aspects of our service.
While Firebase normally relies on Android Advertising ID or iOS Identifier for Advertisers, this is not the case of our service because we’ve opted to use our own anonymizing identifiers instead.</p>
<p>As this tool is not necessary for service functioning, you can opt-out of providing us with this anonymized application performance data in our application settings.</p> Google Fabric Crashlytics on iOS and Android <p>This Google tool helps us to improve application stability, pinpoint things that don’t work, and improve your experience.
Its implementation doesn’t contain any information that can personally identify you.</p>
<p>Both Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics are subject to Google’s privacy policies</p> Deprecated Analytics <p>If you’re still on older versions of our service, the following analytics are embedded in them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook Analytics on older versions of our Android apps: we used to use this to know how many people opened an app, how much time they spent in it, and other information about how they interacted with them.
You can find Facebook’s privacy policy here.</li>
</ul>
<p>We highly recommend that you upgrade to later versions.</p> Extensions Privacy Policy <p>As an optional part of the VPN service, we offer the following free extensions.</p>
<p>Please read Common Information for overall information about who are we.
For other products and services please visit Extensions Privacy Policy, and for information on how we handle website cookies, please visit our Cookies Policy.</p>
<p>This policy applies to version 1.1.
For older versions of this document, please visit the legal archive.</p> Free HMA VPN Proxy Unblocker <p>The proxy extension is provided as a free tool for online privacy protection.
Because of that, we need to gather different data to protect our product from abuse.</p> What personal data Free HMA VPN Proxy Unblocker processes? <p>If you use the free HMA VPN Proxy Unblocker for Chrome and Firefox browsers, this is the personal data that gets collected:</p> Service data What we use it for Your originating IP address To prevent attacks on our network.<br>
<br>Example: If someone attempts to attack our servers, we will cut off the connection.
Domain names To prevent attacks on our network.<br>
<br>Example: If someone attempts to use our servers to attack our own infrastructure, we will cut off the connection.
Timestamp of requests To prevent attacks on our network.<br>
<br>Example: If someone attempts to attack our servers, we may report the attacker to their ISP or law enforcement.
<p>We delete all of this data <b>every 30 days</b> on a rolling basis so data created on January 3rd gets deleted on February 2nd, for example.</p>
<p>On the client extension side, we collect data to understand how people are using the extension, troubleshoot it, and plan development.
None of this can be used to specifically identify you.</p> Client data What we use it for User Agent<br>E.g.Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh.
Intel Mac OS X 10_14) For user support, troubleshooting, and product development planning<br>
<br>Example: Help us troubleshoot issues with specific configurations.
Application Events<br>
<br>E.g.
User has used Panic Mode feature, etc.
Product planning.<br>
<br>Example: Let us know what features are popular.

or (b) refuse to act on the request.</p>

These third parties are contractually bound by confidentiality clauses, even when they leave.
Where an individual employee no longer requires access, that individual's credentials are revoked.</p> Technical safeguards <p>We store your personal data in our database using the protections described above.
In addition, we utilize up-to-date firewall protection for an additional layer of security.
We use high-quality antivirus and anti-malware software, and regularly update our virus definitions.
Third parties who we hire to provide services and who have access to our users' data are required to implement privacy and security practices that we deem adequate.</p> Physical safeguards <p>Access to user information in our database by Internet requires using an encrypted VPN, except for email which requires user authentication.
Otherwise, access is limited to our physical premises.
Physical removal of personal data from our location is forbidden.
Third-party contractors who process personal data on our behalf agree to provide reasonable physical safeguards.</p> Changes to this policy <p>We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time, but we will inform you when we are doing so, and highlight the changes we are making.
We also keep an archive of previous versions of this policy available for review.</p> Contact Us <p>If you have any questions or feedback regarding these terms, you can contact us by email: info@hidemyass.com.
