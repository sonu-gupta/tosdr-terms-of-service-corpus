</p>Live Speaking Practice<p>When you take a Live Speaking Lesson, we will use your computer's microphone throughout the lesson to speak to your tutor.
You also have the option of using your camera to share your video with your tutor.
Duolingo records these audio and video lessons and retains them until you close your Duolingo account.
Duolingo uses this data to help improve the quality of the lessons and for internal research purposes.</p>
<p>Duolingo does not share any of your personal data with your tutor.
You are completely anonymous to them by default, and you can freely choose whether you show them your video or tell them any personal details such as your name during the conversation.
Duolingo only shares some basic skill level information with the tutor, prior to your lesson, so they understand how best to speak to you.</p>Speaking Challenges<p>Some lessons involve you speaking into the app.
To recognize speech your audio may be sent to a third party provider such as Google, Apple, or Amazon Web Services.
We may ask you to allow Duolingo to collect and analyze your speech data to help us understand the effectiveness of our lessons, and to improve the product.
If you choose not to share your audio with us, or if we haven’t asked you yet, then your audio will not be used in this way.
Any audio you agree to send to Duolingo is anonymized when it reaches our servers to ensure that no trace of your personal data remains attached to the audio.</p>Test Data<p>If you register for the Duolingo English Test, you will also provide us with your gender, native language, secondary school, and self-reported test scores for other exams.
Each time you take a test you must also provide a photo of a current, valid driver’s license, passport, or other government issued ID and take a photo of your face to verify your identity (“<strong>Testing ID</strong>”).</p>
<p>When you use the Service to take an examination in the Duolingo English Test you must provide access to your computer’s webcam and microphone.
We will use them to record you and your screen during the entire examination period (“<strong>Testing Video</strong>”).
While using the Duolingo English Test, you will submit answers to questions and other information as part of the testing and evaluation process.</p>
<p>The testing software will be installed onto your computer.
During the test, the testing software will monitor if additional applications are running on your computer, but will not open any applications or individual files.
Please close any other applications by exiting from them completely prior to starting the test.</p>
<p>Additionally, Duolingo will be able to note if any peripherals are used during the test (i.e.
external devices attached to your computer), but will not have any control or access to these peripherals.
Please remove these before testing if you do not wish to have their presence known.</p>
<p>Duolingo will not open network packets, but will have access to network usage statistics and the volume of network traffic.</p>Third Party Data<p>We also collect information about you from third parties.
For more information, see Information obtained by Third Parties.</p>Product Research and Development<p>We may contact you to participate in product research activities.
These may include surveys, interviews, and other types of feedback sessions.
When you participate in these research activities, the information you provide will be used to test, improve, and develop our products.
We will record the video, audio and text transcriptions of this feedback together with any additional contact information you provide and will retain this data for two years.</p>

These Third Party Advertising Service Providers collect and use personal data about your visits to and use of the Website and mobile Application, as well as other websites in order to serve you with advertisements and content tailored to meet your preferences and likely interests or better understand ad effectiveness.
Aggregate demographic and interest data will also be used for market research purposes.</p>

Like many services, Google Analytics uses first-party cookies to track user interactions as in our case, where they are used to collect information about how users use our site.
This information is used to compile reports and to help us improve our Website.
The reports disclose website trends without identifying individual visitors.

<p>We will provide personal data to hosting providers such as Amazon Web Services, search engine providers such as Google, analytics providers such as Crashlytics, and support providers such as ZenDesk.</p>
<p>These data processors help us bring you the Service.
For example, we may share your information in order to detect where or how you encountered a bug when using our mobile application.
In connection with these operations, our service providers will have access to personal data for a limited time.
When we utilize service providers for processing any personal data, we implement contractual protections limiting the use of that personal data to the provision of services to Duolingo.</p>
<p>We will be required to access and disclose personal data in response to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws.
Additionally, we will access and share account or other personal data when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the Service or using the Duolingo name, or to prevent imminent harm.
This will include accessing and sharing personal data with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies.</p>
<p>Duolingo will share the complete and accurate results of Duolingo English Tests with such institutions, including universities, potential employers, or other third parties, (collectively, “<strong>Score Recipients</strong>”) as specified when you send your results after finishing a test or when you apply a coupon sponsored by the Score Recipient before starting a test.

Where this is the case, we will inform you of specific details in response to your request.</p>
</li>
<li>Third party websites and links<p>Please note that you may have cookies placed on your computer by third party websites that refer you to our Service.

</li>
<li>Children under age of digital consent<p>We know that children deserve extra privacy protection.
That’s why we treat child users differently to ensure their parents are in control and we only collect the bare minimum information we need to make Duolingo work.</p>
<p>When a user creates a Duolingo account we collect their age and compare it to the local standard of child online consent depending on the country they registered in.
We refer to users under this age as “child users”.
Child users are permitted to create a user account but we ask them to provide their parent’s email address instead of their own.
We also prevent child users from supplying their own name because we don’t need that information.</p>
<p>After registration we will send an email notifying the parent about Duolingo’s privacy and information practices regarding child users, including what personal data we collect and how we use, share, and protect that personal data.
The email also explains how parents can request that Duolingo access, change or delete the personal data about their child.</p>
<p>Child users receive the following special treatment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lessons are made age appropriate by removing mature words like “beer” or “wine”.</li>
<li>Advertisements are set to family safe content.</li>
<li>The Profile page is hidden, preventing the child from stating their name, location or bio.</li>
<li>Uploading an avatar photo is disabled.</li>
<li>Promotional emails are disabled.</li>
<li>Leaderboards are disabled.</li>
<li>Discussion forums are disabled.</li>
<li>The child’s profile is made private and hidden from other users’ searches.</li>
<li>Other users are unable to follow the child.</li>
<li>The ability to follow other users or search for other users is disabled.</li>
<li>The ability to send an invitation email is disabled.</li>
<li>Finding friends on Facebook is disabled.</li>
<li>Social logins with Facebook, Google or Apple are disabled.</li>
<li>Social follow buttons for Twitter, Facebook and Instagram are disabled.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, all users under the age of 16 receive the following special treatment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advertisements are set to non-personalised.</li>
<li>Third party behavioral tracking is disabled.</li>
<li>Third party analytics is disabled.</li>
</ul>
<p>To prevent restricted users from amending these features, the settings will be hidden or grayed out.
In the future, once we’re sure the user is old enough we will automatically remove the restrictions, reset the settings to their defaults and make the settings visible for them to configure how they choose.</p>
<p>With regards to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule ("COPPA"), Duolingo only collects personal information from children under the age of 13 for the sole purpose of performing internal operations of the Service.
If we discover that we have unknowingly collected additional personal information from these children we will delete it.
If you believe this to be the case, please contact us at privacy@duolingo.com.</p>
</li>
<li>Links<p>The Service may contain links to other websites.
We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites.
We encourage users to be aware when they leave the Service to read the privacy statements of other websites that collect personally identifiable information.
This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by Duolingo via the Service.</p>
</li>
<li>Information security<p>Duolingo has implemented administrative and technical safeguards it believes are appropriate to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of your personal data, Testing ID, User Photo, access credentials, and Duolingo English Test results.
However, given sufficient resources, a determined attacker could defeat those safeguards and may, as a result, gain access to the data we seek to protect.</p>
</li>
<li>Do Not Track<p>The Service is not designed to respond to “do not track” signals sent by some browsers.</p>
