Last updated: February 12, 2020
<br>
<br>
We value your business and we know privacy is important to you.
It’s important to us, too.
<br>
<br>
This Privacy Notice which describes how we collect and use your personal information, what we do with
the information collected, and how you can exercise your privacy rights.
<br>
<br>
Certain countries and states, such as the European Union and the state of California, have enacted
specific data protection and privacy rules for their residents.
Some of these rules overlap, but some
don’t.
In order to make this privacy notice as understandable as possible, we have split our information
into a common notice (where we provide you with information which is generally required), and separate
notices specific to certain jurisdictions.
<br>
<br>
Please also review our Terms of Service and Data Processing Addendum which describe what we can expect from each
other when you use our products and services.
<br>
<br>
<br> Who we are and what we do Backblaze, Inc.
(“Backblaze”) is a US-headquartered data storage provider that offers two
different services:
<ul>
<li>
Computer Backup, which provides unlimited cloud
backup for individuals and organizations using Macs or PCs (laptops and desktops).
and
</li>
<li>
B2 Cloud Storage, which provides low-cost cloud
storage for individuals and organizations.
</li>
</ul>
<br>

Under EU data protection legislation, commonly known as the GDPR, Backblaze is the
controller of processing of personal information described below.
With regard to the
processing of files uploaded to our platform by our users when using our Computer Backup and
B2 Cloud Storage services, however, Backblaze is the processor and the person or
organization owning the Backblaze account is the controller.
We explain more about the
distinction between a controller and a processor under EU data protection legislation here.
<br>
<br>
<br> The personal information we collect When you use our services, you upload your files to store with us.
