The Cutting Room Floor has no formal privacy policy, because those are a lot of legalese and we don't really have money for that.
Instead, have some basics:
</p>
<ul>
<li>We don't sell any of your information.</li>
<li>The only information we collect when you visit here is your IP address (kind of required for the internet to work).</li>
<li>If you register, we collect some further (optional) information:
<ul>
<li>Your email address.
This is only used to send you opted-in system emails (e.g.
watch lists, change notices) or for password resets, and is never given out or sold.</li>
<li>Your "real name".
MediaWiki probably displays this information somewhere.
Nothing stops you from entering a fake one, and we don't sell it or give it out.</li>
<li>Your username.
You can enter anything for this as well, used for logging in and probably crediting people.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We use (non-Google) analytics software to track access.
That software collects different things, which are not cross-referenced with the above.
Aggregated versions of these statistics may be released, but never sold:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Your IP address.</li>
<li>Various browser details, such as user agent, resolution, etc.</li>
<li>The page that referred you, if any.</li>
<li>Your visits to this site and pages accessed.</li>
</ul>
<p>We use an advertising service.
They are not based on "relevance".
You can read more in the Project Wonderful privacy policy, which is fancy and official and not ours.
