<br>
I will not give, sell or pass on your details&nbsp;to anyone unless you expressly consent that I can do so (except in the very&nbsp;limited&nbsp;circumstances as set out in this Privacy Policy).
Easy :)<br>
<br>
Joining&nbsp;my mailing list will mean that I send you emails from time to time (at the&nbsp;moment it is monthly) and I may include sponsored ads or links,&nbsp;but those&nbsp;companies will not get your email address.<br>
<br>
Of&nbsp;course, if you give me your mailing address when ordering a product it is just&nbsp;as private.<br>
<br>
There&nbsp;is an unsubscribe link at the bottom of every newsletter too, so you can&nbsp;unsubscribe anytime.</p>
<p>Oh, and some of my links to Amazon are "affiliate links" and so I might get a (very) small commission if you buy something through one of those links!<br>
<br>
Hope&nbsp;that is cool with you.
:)<br>

A cookie is a small&nbsp;file which asks permission to be placed on your computer's hard drive.
Once you&nbsp;agree, the file is added and the cookie&nbsp;helps analyse web traffic or lets you&nbsp;know when you visit a particular site.
Cookies allow web applications to&nbsp;respond to you as an individual.
The&nbsp;web application can tailor its operations&nbsp;to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information&nbsp;about your preferences.<br>
<br>
We&nbsp;use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used.
This helps us&nbsp;analyse data about webpage traffic and improve our website in&nbsp;order to tailor&nbsp;it to customer needs.
We only use this information for statistical analysis&nbsp;purposes and then the data is removed from the system.<br>
<br>
Overall,&nbsp;cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us to monitor&nbsp;which pages you find useful and which you do not.

<br>
You&nbsp;can choose to accept or decline cookies.

<br>
<strong>Marketing/&nbsp;Promotional offers from us</strong>
<br>
We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal&nbsp;data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising.<br>
<br>
We may use your Identity, Contact, and Usage Data to form a view&nbsp;on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you.&nbsp;This&nbsp;is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you&nbsp;(we call this marketing).<br>
<br>
We&nbsp;if you&nbsp;have requested information from us or purchased goods or services from us,&nbsp;joined our mailing&nbsp;list or if you provided us with your details when you&nbsp;entered a competition or registered for a promotion and, in each case, you have&nbsp;not opted out of&nbsp;receiving that marketing.<br>
<br>
Controlling your personal information/Opting-out<br>
<br>
You can ask us or third parties to&nbsp;stop sending you marketing messages at any time by logging into the website and&nbsp;checking or unchecking&nbsp;relevant boxes to adjust your marketing preferences or&nbsp;by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you or by&nbsp;contacting us&nbsp;at any time.<br>
<br>
Where you opt out of receiving these&nbsp;marketing messages, this will not apply to personal data provided to us as a&nbsp;result of a product/service&nbsp;purchase, product/service experience or other&nbsp;transactions.<br>
<br>
We will not sell,&nbsp;distribute or lease your personal information to third parties unless we have&nbsp;your express permission (i.e.
by way of opt-in) or are&nbsp;required by law to do&nbsp;so.
We may use your personal information to send you promotional information&nbsp;about third parties which we think you may&nbsp;find interesting if you tell us that&nbsp;you wish this to happen.<br>
<br>
If you believe that any&nbsp;information we are holding on you is incorrect or incomplete, please email us&nbsp;as soon as possible, at the above address.&nbsp;We will promptly correct any&nbsp;information found to be incorrect.<br>
<br>
We do not transfer&nbsp;personal data outside of the European Economic Area.<br>
<br>
We will only retain&nbsp;your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected&nbsp;it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any&nbsp;legal, accounting, or&nbsp;reporting requirements<br>
<br>
<strong>YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</strong>
<br>
<br>
You have the right to:<br>
<br>
Request access&nbsp;to your&nbsp;personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request").&nbsp;This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we&nbsp;hold about you and&nbsp;to check that we are lawfully processing it.<br>
<br>
Request correction&nbsp;of&nbsp;the personal data that we hold about you.
This enables you to have any&nbsp;incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you&nbsp;corrected, though we may need&nbsp;to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.<br>
<br>
Request erasure&nbsp;of your&nbsp;personal data.
This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data&nbsp;where there is no good reason for us continuing to&nbsp;process it.
You also have&nbsp;the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have&nbsp;successfully exercised your right to object to&nbsp;processing (see below), where we&nbsp;may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to&nbsp;erase your personal data to comply&nbsp;with local law.
Note, however, that we may&nbsp;not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal&nbsp;reasons which will be notified&nbsp;to you, if applicable, at the time of your&nbsp;request.<br>
<br>
Object to the processing&nbsp;of&nbsp;your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a&nbsp;third party) and there is something about your&nbsp;particular situation which makes&nbsp;you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your&nbsp;fundamental rights and freedoms.
You&nbsp;also have the right to object where we are&nbsp;processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.<br>
<br>
Request restriction of&nbsp;processing&nbsp;of your personal data.
This enables you to ask us to suspend the&nbsp;processing of your personal data in the following&nbsp;scenarios: (a) if you want us&nbsp;to establish the data's accuracy.
(b) where our use of the data is unlawful but&nbsp;you do not want us to erase it.
(c) where you&nbsp;need us to hold the data even if&nbsp;we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal&nbsp;claims.
or (d) you have objected to our use&nbsp;of your data but we need to verify&nbsp;whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.<br>
<br>
Request the transfer&nbsp;of&nbsp;your personal data to you or to a third party.<br>
<br>
Withdraw consent at any time&nbsp;where&nbsp;we are relying on consent to process your personal data.
However, this will not&nbsp;affect the lawfulness of any&nbsp;processing carried out before you withdraw your&nbsp;consent.
If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain&nbsp;products or services to&nbsp;you.
We will advise you if this is the case at the time&nbsp;you withdraw your consent.<br>
<br>
If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please&nbsp;contact us.
You will not have to pay&nbsp;a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any&nbsp;of the other rights).&nbsp;However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded,&nbsp;repetitive or excessive.
Alternatively, we may&nbsp;refuse to comply with your request&nbsp;in these circumstances.&nbsp;We may need to request specific&nbsp;information from you to help us confirm your identity and&nbsp;ensure your right to&nbsp;access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights).
This is a security&nbsp;measure to ensure that personal data is not&nbsp;disclosed to any person who has no&nbsp;right to receive it.
We may also contact you to ask you for further information&nbsp;in relation to your request to speed&nbsp;up our response.<br>
<br>
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.&nbsp;Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly&nbsp;complex or you have made a number of requests.
In this case, we will notify you&nbsp;and keep you updated.<br>
