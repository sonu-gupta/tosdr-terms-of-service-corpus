√ <p>For your protection, we may only implement requests with respect to the Personal Data or Other Information associated with the particular email(s) you provide in your Privacy Request, and we will take steps to verify your identity before granting access to your Personal Data or Other Information or complying with your Privacy Request.
For example, we may verify your Privacy Request by matching information you provide with our records, or you may be asked to log in to your online account (if applicable).
We may request additional information to verify your identity depending on the nature of the Privacy Request and the sensitivity of the information sought, if you do not have an account with us, or if we have reason to suspect the security of your account is compromised.</p>
<p>You can use an authorized agent to submit your Privacy Request.
If you use an authorized agent, in addition to verifying the Privacy Request itself (see above), we will also verify the authorized agent’s ability to act on your behalf (they should submit written permission to act on your behalf or a power of attorney).</p>
<p>Once we have verified your identity (and your authorized agent, as applicable), we will respond to your Privacy Request as appropriate.
To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may charge a reasonable fee to comply with your Privacy Request.
If we are unable to complete your Privacy Request in whole or in part, we will let you know why.</p>
