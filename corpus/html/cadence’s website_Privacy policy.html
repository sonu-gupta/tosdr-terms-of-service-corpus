<p>The first time a user personally provides data to the site, such as changing settings or subscribing to a channel, an ephemeral session is created and linked to a cookie.</p>
<p>On future visits, this cookie will be used to look up the session, and provide a response based on that stored information.</p>

</ul>How the data is sharedWith YouTube<p>YouTube is a company owned by Google, Inc.
CloudTube displays information from YouTube.</p>
<p>When you perform a query on CloudTube that requires data from YouTube, such as making a search or loading a video, your query is forwarded to YouTube.</p>
<p>For example, when searching, YouTube receives a query for those search terms, and when watching a video, YouTube receives a page load for that video.</p>
<p>When watching a video, your browser connects to googlevideo.com directly to request the video stream.
This connection, and any data stored by YouTube as a result, is subject to Google's privacy policy.</p>
<p>All other queries are forwarded to your selected Invidious instance, which forwards them to YouTube.
YouTube does not receive any metadata about you for these queries, only the query itself.</p>With other organisations<p>CloudTube does not share any data with other people or organisations.</p>How to delete your data<p>Visit the settings page and find the "delete data" section.
Read the text.</p>
<p>To delete your data, check "I understand the consequences", then click "permanently erase my data".</p>
<p>This will erase all of your data from the server, and delete the unique cookie from your web browser.</p>
