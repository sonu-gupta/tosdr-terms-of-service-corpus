         <strong>Privacy</strong>
<p>Snoozz does not collect or analyse any personal data.
Your tabs, windows, IPs, and geolocations are completely secure and never leave your device.</p>
<p>As of v2.4.3, Snoozz collects a minimal amount of anonymous click data to help improve Snoozz in the future.
Only your selected choice (Tomorrow Morning, Next Week etc...) and the time selected (3:45pm -&gt.
1545) in the popup is transmitted.</p>
<p>For complete transparency, all collected data is available on the Snoozz Stats page.
The data passes through my own server (also open source) and there are no 3rd party tools involved in any way.</p>
<p>An explanation of what data is being collected is described in great detail in this post on Github.
If you hate progress and technological advancement, you can opt out on the Settings page of the extension.</p>
<p>Snoozz is still completely open source and you can browse the code yourself to make sure there is no funny business.</p>
<strong>Permissions</strong>
