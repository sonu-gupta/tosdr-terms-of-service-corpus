<p>Each time Google Maps is accessed, Google sets a cookie to process user settings and data when viewing the page that has the Google Maps component integrated.
This cookie is usually not deleted by closing the browser, but it will expire after a certain amount of time unless it is manually deleted by you.</p>
<p>If you disagree with the processing of your data, you may disable the "Google Maps" service and prevent the transmission of data to Google in this way.
To do this, you must disable the JavaScript feature in your browser.

<p>The IP address submitted as part of "reCAPTCHA" will not be merged with any other data provided by Google, unless you are logged in to your Google Account at the time you use the "reCAPTCHA" plug-in.
If you want to prevent this transmission and storage of data about you and your behaviour on our website by "Google", you must log out of "Google" before you visit our site or use the reCAPTCHA plug-in.</p>

Twitter is a service of Twitter Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, United States.</p>
<p>Each time you visit our websites which contain such a component, this component causes the browser you are using to download a corresponding representation of the component of Twitter.
Through this process, Twitter is informed about which specific page of our website is currently being visited.</p>
<p>We have no control over the information that Twitter collects here, nor about the amount of data collected by Twitter.
To the best of our knowledge, Twitter collects the URL of the respective website and the user's IP address, but it is not used for purposes other than the presentation of the Twitter component.

<p>Here we use the option provided by YouTube "- extended privacy mode -".</p>
<p>When you visit a page that has an embedded video, it will connect to the YouTube servers and display the content by notifying your browser on the website.</p>
<p>According to information provided by YouTube, in "- enhanced privacy mode -" data is only transmitted to the YouTube server when watching the video, in particular which of our web pages you have visited.
If you are logged in to YouTube at the same time, this information will be associated with your membership account on YouTube.

Vimeo is a service of Vimeo LCC, 555 West 18th Street, NY, New York 10011, USA.
Each time you visit a web page which has such a component, this component causes the browser you are using to download a corresponding representation of the component from Vimeo.
When you visit our site and you are logged in to Vimeo, Vimeo recognises, through the information gathered by the component, which specific site you are visiting and assigns this information to your personal Vimeo account.
If, for instance, you click the "Play" button or leave a comment, this information will be transmitted to your personal Vimeo account and stored there.
In addition, the fact that you have visited our site is passed on to Vimeo.
This happens regardless of whether you, for instance, click on the component, or leave comments, or not.</p>
