<strong>Termination</strong>
</p>
<p>You are free to stop using the Services at any time.
You understand and agree that we may or may not delete your User Content in the event that you stop using the Services.

In the event that we elect to terminate your account, we will try to provide advance notice to you prior to termination so that you are able to retrieve any important User Content stored in your account.
