<strong>Retargeting of Advertisements and Opting Out.</strong> We try to deliver relevant advertisements by using a common form of online advertising known as “retargeting”.
Retargeting provides advertisements on a website based on a user’s activities on a different, unrelated site.
To enable this, LifeScan or its advertising service providers may use a device ID, cookie, pixel, web beacon or similar technology placed by LifeScan or its third-party service provider when you visit our Services.
The placing of these cookies or other technologies on your device may enable you to be identified across multiple websites.</p>
<p>You can opt-out of having your online activity collected for advertising purposes and receiving behaviorally targeted advertisements by using the links below depending on your region:</p>
<ul>
<li>USA: http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.aspx(link is external);</li>
<li>Canada: https://youradchoices.ca(link is external);</li>
<li>Europe: www.youronlinechoices.eu(link is external).</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that the choices you make are specific to the browser and device on which you implement such controls.</p>
<p>We may use Facebook’s custom audience tools which allows us to provide you with advertising to you when you use Facebook’s platforms which you may find to be more relevant to you.
You can learn more about Facebook’s privacy policy here(link is external).
This is done by converting your email address into a unique number that Facebook uses to match to a unique number that Facebook generates based on the email address that you have provided to Facebook.
You can change your advertising preferences within the “Ad Settings” and “Ad Preferences” sections of your Facebook account.</p>
<p>On some pages of our websites, we allow third-party advertising partners to use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to collect or receive information regarding your activities on those web pages (e.g., your IP address, page(s) visited, time of day, and cookie identifiers).
We may also share such information we have collected with advertising and analytics companies, they may use this information (and combine it with information collected over time and across other websites, apps, or other digital services) to deliver targeted advertisements.</p>
<p>
<u>Mobile advertising identifier controls</u>.
Apple and Android mobile devices generate an advertising identifier that can be accessed by apps and used by advertisers in a way similar to how cookies are used on websites.
Apple and Android operating systems provide options to limit tracking.</p>
<p>
<strong>Do Not Track</strong>.
Some browsers have a Do Not Track (“DNT”) feature that allow a user to indicate a preference not to have their online activities tracked.
If you limit a website’s ability to set cookies, your user experience may be affected.
The DNT function is not available when you are accessing the Services through a mobile application rather than through the relevant website.</p> YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS AND CHOICES<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We may de-identify data that we collect about you.
We may use or share this data with third parties to perform analytics and research, for product development or improvement, and for other compatible purposes or as otherwise permitted by law.
We may also permanently anonymize your Personal Data so that it is no longer personal data under relevant laws.
After permanent anonymization, you can never be identified and the data is not traceable to you.
We may use or share such anonymized data for statistical analysis, clinical research, demographic analysis or other similar activities.

<p>LifeScan uses various technical, organizational and administrative measures to protect your Personal Data against loss, unauthorized use or access.
For example, when we transmit your health-related Personal Data, through our Services we use encryption technology.
When our Services communicate with our analytics providers, encryption is also used.
However, you should be aware that no data storage or method of transmission can be guaranteed to be 100% secure or error-free.</p> SAFETY AND OTHER REGULATORY REPORTING<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to ensure the safety of medical devices, regulators place a legal obligation on manufacturers to report certain complaints and potential adverse events to them.
LifeScan may share this information with other LifeScan companies in other countries, its service providers or business partners who assist in the maintenance and operation of LifeScan’s complaints database.</p>
<p>In some cases, LifeScan may not be the legal manufacturer of devices that we promote or make available, in those circumstances, we are obliged to pass on details of complaints and potential adverse events to the device’s legal manufacturer so that they may report the matter to applicable regional or national regulatory bodies, including those that may have different data protection laws than the laws that apply in your country.</p>
<p>Where relevant, LifeScan enters into European Union standard contractual clauses (or equivalent measures) with the party outside the European Economic Area receiving the personal data.
A copy of the relevant standard contractual clauses is available upon request.</p>
<p>LifeScan processes complaint and adverse event data in order to comply with legal requirements to which it or its business partners are subject.
Where LifeScan processes health data (which is a special category of data) for these purposes, LifeScan does so for reasons of public interest in ensuring high standards of quality and safety of medical devices.
Any data provided for complaint and/or adverse event reporting purposes will not be used for direct marketing.</p>
<p>If you are a healthcare professional, LifeScan may be required, by law or industry codes of practice, to report on or to make public disclosures of certain payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals (such as consulting fees, travel and other permitted expenses).
Where required by local law, we will disclose your identity, your location and the nature and amount of the transfer of value or payment.</p> LINKS TO OTHER SITES<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we provide a link to another website or application that is not owned or controlled by LifeScan, we are not responsible for how such websites or applications handle your Personal Data.
We urge you to read the linked website’s privacy policy.
The inclusion of a link to a third-party website or application does not mean that LifeScan endorses that website or application.</p> TRANSFERS TO OTHER COUNTRIES<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a global company, we have operations and service providers that may not be located in your country.
By using any of our Services or, where required by law, by providing us with your consent, your information may be processed and / or stored outside of your country of residence.
Data protection laws in those countries may differ from the laws in your country.
Appropriate contractual and other measures are in place to protect Personal Data when it is transferred to LifeScan company or third parties in other countries.</p>
<p>For residents of the European Economic Area (“EEA”): Some countries outside the EEA are recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of data protection (the full list of these countries is available here(link is external)).
For transfers from the EEA to countries not considered adequate by the European Commission, we shall ensure that adequate measures are in place, including by ensuring that the recipient is bound by the European Union’s Standard Contractual Clauses or by another method which has been approved by the European Commission.</p>
<p>If you are using the Services in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, you specifically acknowledge and agree that none of the data within the Services constitutes medical records under the laws of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.</p> CHILDREN’S PRIVACY

Some of the Services allow the creation of a parent or guardian account which allows for the submission of a child’s Personal Data by a parent or guardian.

<p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.
The verifiable consumer request must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Data or an authorized representative.</li>
<li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>

For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your Personal Data that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>
<p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.
