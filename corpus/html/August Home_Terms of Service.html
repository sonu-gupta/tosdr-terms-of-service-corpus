<b>Arbitration</b>
<p>If you are a resident of the United States, then this Arbitration section applies to you.
This section includes a mandatory arbitration provision for certain claims.
The claims to which this section applies are described below.
This section limits your and our rights.
Specifically, you understand that you and August are waiving the right to sue in court and have a jury trial for certain claims.</p>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree that all disputes and claims arising out of, or relating to, these Terms, or your use of the Services, Licensed Software and Device (including the arbitrability of any claim or dispute and the enforceability of this section), shall be determined exclusively by final and binding arbitration.
Provided however, that you agree that the terms of this arbitration section do not apply to determinations as to the ownership of any intellectual property rights in the Services, Licensed Software or Device.
The arbitration shall be conducted before a single arbitration under the American Arbitration Association’s (AAA’s) Commercial Arbitration Rules and conducted in San Francisco, CA, USA (or in the federal court district in which you reside at the time of making a claim, if mutually agreed by you and August in writing in the interest of fairness).
You and August also agree that the AAA Optional Rules for Emergency Measures of Protection shall apply to the proceedings.
The AAA rules are available at http://www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
You and August are each responsible for their respective costs relating to counsel, experts, and witnesses, and any other costs relating to the arbitration.
In the event that you file for arbitration, August will pay for the arbitration administrative or filing fees in excess of $250 U.S.
dollars, including the arbitrator and/or other AAA case management fees, for any dispute of $75,000 U.S.
Dollars or less, unless the claim is determined by the arbitrator to be frivolous.
The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party.</p>
<p>CLASS ACTION WAIVER: Except as otherwise provided in this section, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, consolidated action or private attorney general action) unless both you and August specifically agree to do so following initiation of the arbitration.
If you choose to pursue your dispute in court by opting out of this section, as specified below, this class action waiver will not apply to you.
Neither you, nor any other user of the Services, Device or Licensed Software can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding arising out of or relating to these Terms, the Services, Device or the Licensed Software without having complied with the opt-out requirements below.</p>
<p>Except as expressly set forth in this section, you and August may litigate in court only to compel arbitration under these Terms or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrators.
To the extent that you have breached or have indicated your intention to breach these Terms in any manner which violates or may violate August ‘s or any of its licensor’s intellectual property rights, or may cause continuing or irreparable harm to August (including, but not limited to, any breach that may impact August ‘s or it’s licensor’s intellectual property rights, or a breach by reverse engineering), August may seek injunctive relief, or any other appropriate relief, in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the above, you or August may choose to pursue a dispute in court and not by arbitration if (a) the dispute qualifies, it may be initiated in small claims court.
or (b) YOU OPT OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THESE TERMS (the “Opt-Out Deadline”).
You may opt out of this Section by mailing written notification to August at support@august.com.
Your written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, and (3) a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with August through arbitration.
Your decision to opt-out of this Section will have no adverse effect on your relationship with August.
Any opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and you must pursue your dispute in arbitration or in small claims court.
In addition, this arbitration provision does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.
Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf.
The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.
1, et seq.
(the “FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this agreement to arbitrate.
The FAA’s provisions, not state law, govern all questions of whether a dispute is subject to arbitration.</p>
