         <p>Cisco has simplified our licensing documents.
We no longer require an End User License Agreement (EULA) for on-premise software and a Universal Cloud Agreement (UCA) for cloud-hosted software.
Our EULA now contains the terms of use applicable to&nbsp;<i>all</i>&nbsp;Cisco software (on-premise and cloud-hosted).
Cisco’s updated End User License Agreement reduces duplication for our customers and simplifies selling for our channel.&nbsp;</p>
