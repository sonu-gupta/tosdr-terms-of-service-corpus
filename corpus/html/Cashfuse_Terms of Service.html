         Cashfuse Terms of Service <p>Thank you for using Cashfuse!</p>
<p> When we say ”company”, “we”, “our”, “us”, ”service” or ”services” in this document, we are referring to Cashfuse.
</p>
<p> We may update these Terms of Service in the future.
Whenever we make a significant change to our policies, we will also announce them&nbsp;by email.
</p>
<p> When you use our service, now or in the future, you are agreeing to the latest Terms of Service.
That’s true for any of our existing and future products and all features that we add to our service over time.
There may be times where we do not exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service.
in doing so, we are not waiving that right or provision.
These terms do contain a limitation of our liability.
</p>
<p> If you do not agree to these Terms of Service, do not use this service.
Violation of any of the terms below may result in the termination of your account.
</p> Account terms <p> You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password.
Cashfuse cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
</p>
<p>You are responsible for any activity that occurs under your account.</p>
<p> You may not use our service for any illegal purpose or to violate any laws in your jurisdiction.
</p>
<p> You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process.
</p> Payment, refunds terms <p> For our free trial, we explain the length of trial when you sign up.
We do not ask you for your credit card and — just like for customers who pay for our services — we do not store, sell or distribute your data.
After the trial period, you need to pay in advance to keep using the service.
If you do not pay, we will freeze your account and it will be inaccessible until you make payment.
If your account has been frozen for 60 days, we will queue it up for auto-cancellation.
</p>
<p> If you are upgrading from a free trial to a paid plan, we will charge you immediately and your billing cycle starts on the day of upgrade.
</p>
<p>Paying customers are billed automatically via credit card.</p>
<p> There are no surprise fees and your card will never be charged unexpectedly.
</p>
<p> Our payment process is conducted by our payment processor Stripe.
Stripe provides customer service inquiries and handles returns.
All fees are inclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities.
Stripe will collect those taxes on behalf of taxing authority and remit those taxes to taxing authorities.
See Stripe’s Terms of Use&nbsp;for details.
</p>
<p>Fees paid hereunder are non-refundable.</p> Cancellation and termination <p> You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account.
An email to cancel your account is not considered cancellation.
You can cancel your account by login into your account at https://cashfuse.ca/account, clicking on “Manage my subscription”.
You will be redirected to your Stripe Customer Portal where you can click “Cancel plan” to cancel your account.
</p>
<p> If you cancel the service before the end of your current paid up period, your cancellation will take effect at the end of the current billing cycle, and you will not be charged again.
All future transactions will not be accessible after the time you paid for expires.
</p>
<p> We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the service for any reason at any time.
Such termination of the service will result in the deactivation or deletion of your account or your access to your account.
Cashfuse reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.
We have this clause because there may be individuals doing something nefarious.
</p>
<p> Verbal, physical, written or other abuse (including threats of abuse or retribution) of any service customer, company employee or officer may result in immediate account termination.
</p> Modifications to the service and prices <p> We reserve the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any part of the service with or without notice.
</p>
<p> Sometimes we change the pricing structure for our products.
When we do that, we tend to exempt existing customers from those changes.
However, we may choose to change the prices for existing customers.
If we do so, we will give at least 30 days notice and will notify you via the email address on record.
</p>
<p> Cashfuse shall not be liable to you or to any third-party for any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the service.

If the bet does not work out, that’s on you, not us.
We do our best to be as safe a bet as possible.
If you choose to use our services, thank you for betting on us.
