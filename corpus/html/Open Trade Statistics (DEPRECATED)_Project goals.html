<p>Open Trade Statistics is an independent project that values reproducible research and provides tidy trade data.
We are heavily inspired by R community values and Open Licenses views on freedom.</p>
<p>We focus on commodities data and our added value, unlike many other good trade data projects, is that we focus on data processing and reproducibility instead of data visualization.</p>
<p>We advocate for openness and collaboration, so our contribution is focused on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Releasing all of our source code on GitHub</li>
<li>Releasing snapshots of the software we use</li>
<li>Sharing curated data (direct download and API)</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides open data we don’t track users, we don’t want your personal information and we use https to protect your navigation and our service.</p>
<p>Our goal is to ease data analysis, promote a reproducibility culture, and do something towards a better internet.</p>
