         Firefox Privacy Notice Effective May 28, 2021 At Mozilla, we believe that privacy is fundamental to a healthy internet.
<p>That’s why we build Firefox, and all our products, to give you greater control over the information you share online and the information you share with us.
We strive to collect only what we need to improve Firefox for everyone.</p>
<p>In this Privacy Notice, we explain what data Firefox shares and point you to settings to share even less.
We also adhere to the practices outlined in the Mozilla privacy policy for how we receive, handle and share information we collect from Firefox.</p> Firefox by default shares data to:
Improve performance and stability for users everywhere<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Interaction data</strong>: Firefox sends data about your interactions with Firefox to us (such as number of open tabs and windows.
number of webpages visited.
number and type of installed Firefox Add-ons.
and session length) and Firefox features offered by Mozilla or our partners (such as interaction with Firefox search features and search partner referrals).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Technical data</strong>: Firefox sends data about your Firefox version and language.
device operating system and hardware configuration.
memory, basic information about crashes and errors.

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Location data</strong>: When you first use Firefox, it uses your IP address to set your default search provider based on your country.

</ul>
Suggest relevant content<p>Firefox displays content, such as “Snippets” (messages from Mozilla), Add-on Recommendations, Top Sites (websites suggested by Mozilla for first-time Firefox users), and Pocket Recommendations (which is part of the Mozilla family).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Location data</strong>: Firefox uses your IP address to suggest relevant content based on your country and state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Technical &amp.
Interaction data</strong>: Firefox sends us data such as the position, size and placement of content we suggest, as well as basic data about your interactions with Firefox’s suggested content.
This includes the number of times suggested content is displayed or clicked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Webpage data for Snippets</strong>: When you choose to click on a Snippet link, we may receive data about the link you followed.
This information is not associated with any other information about you.
Learn more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Webpage, Language, and Location data for Pocket Recommendations</strong>: We recommend content to you based on your browsing history, language, and country location.
The process of deciding which stories you should see based on your browsing history happens locally in your copy of Firefox, and neither Mozilla nor Pocket receives a copy of your browsing history.
To help you see relevant Pocket Recommendations based on your location, Firefox shares your language and country location with Pocket.</p>
<p>Mozilla and Pocket receive aggregated data about the recommendations you see and click.
We also share aggregated data about the sponsored content you see and click with our third-party ad platform Adzerk so advertisers can see how many people click on their articles.
This aggregated data does not identify you personally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Location data and Interaction data for Top Sites</strong>: When you click the Amazon.com Top Site tile on New Tab, we share your country and the time you clicked with Amazon and AdMarketplace (a third-party referral platform) to verify you navigated to Amazon.
Firefox does not share your IP address or any other information that could be used to identify you with either Amazon or AdMarketplace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Add-on and Feature Recommendations</strong>: We recommend Add-ons in two places: the Manage Your Extensions Page (about:addons) and the Awesome Bar, where you search or type in URLs.
We may also recommend Firefox Features in the Awesome Bar.
We base the recommendations in about:addons on a cookie.
We base the recommendations in the Awesome Bar on your interaction with Firefox.
Mozilla does not receive your browser history.
The process happens locally in your own computer’s copy of Firefox.
Learn More about Awesome Bar recommendations or Extensions Page recommendations.</p>
</li>
</ul> Improve security for users everywhere<p>
<strong>Webpage data to DNS Resolver service</strong>: For some Firefox users in the United States, Firefox routes DNS requests to a resolver service that has agreed to Mozilla’s strict privacy standards for resolvers.
This provides added protection from privacy leaks to local networks and also from certain DNS security attacks.
System logs of your DNS requests are deleted from the service within 24 hours and are only used for the purpose of DNS resolution.

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Cloudflare</strong>

<p>
<strong>Technical data for add-ons blocklist</strong>: Firefox for Desktop and Android periodically connect to Mozilla to protect you and others from malicious add-ons.
Your Firefox version and language, device operating system, and list of installed add-ons are needed to apply and update the add-ons blocklist.

<strong>Webpage and technical data to Google’s SafeBrowsing service</strong>: To help protect you from malicious downloads, Firefox sends basic information about unrecognized downloads to Google's SafeBrowsing Service, including the filename and the URL it was downloaded from.Learn more or read Google’s Privacy Policy.
Opting out prevents Firefox from warning you of potentially illegitimate or malicious websites or downloaded files.</p>

<strong>Webpage and technical data to Certificate Authorities</strong>: When you visit a secure website (usually identified with a URL starting with "HTTPS"), Firefox validates the website's certificate.
This may involve Firefox sending certain information about the website to the Certificate Authority identified by that website.
Opting out increases the risk of your private information being intercepted.
