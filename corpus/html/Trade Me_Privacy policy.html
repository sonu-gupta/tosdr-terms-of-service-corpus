What information do we collect? <p> We collect information so that we can provide you with our Services, and so that we can build new Services that make life better for Kiwis through online experiences they love.

For other Services we may also collect photos connected to your profile if you upload or publish these.</li>
<li>
<strong>Application forms</strong>.
We collect information when you complete an application for any of our Services or for services that we connect to.

<li>
<strong>Listing content</strong>.
We collect the listing content when you create a listing, which may include your description of the listing, photos, your user name and in certain cases your contact details.

You will be told at the time of collection when this applies.</li>

Most mobile devices allow you to control or disable the use of location services for applications in the device’s settings menu.</li>

Cookies may be “session” cookies (which temporarily store information and expire when you close your browser) or “persistent” cookies (e.g.
when you select “remember me” when logging in).
We may also allow our business partners to use these technologies on our Services (e.g.
for advertising and remarketing), or engage others to track your behaviour on our behalf.
You may disable the usage of cookies through your browser settings.
Some Services also use social media features (e.g.
the Facebook Like button or widgets, such as a share button or mini programmes running onsite) which may collect your IP address and the pages you visit, and which are generally governed by the terms of the social media business providing the features.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> 2.3 Information from third parties or external sources, such as: <ul>
<li>
<strong>Information from third party services you use</strong>.

<li>
<strong>Background Information about you</strong>.
For some Services, to the extent permitted by applicable laws, we may request that you provide or are subject to background or credit checks, and we may obtain reports from public records (e.g.

If we collect the information described in this paragraph, you will be notified before we do so.

<li>
<strong>Analytics information</strong>.
We may collect analytics information from third parties (e.g.

<li> 3.4 For advertising and marketing, for example to: <ul>
<li>
<strong>Send you promotional messages, marketing or advertising about our Services, including customised promotions, marketing or advertising.</strong> We may send or show you promotional messages, marketing, advertising, and other information about our Services including information that we think may be of interest to you, for example through recommendations and suggestions on our websites or through email.

<li>
<strong>Send you customised third-party advertising (unless you opt out)</strong>.
We may send or show you third-party promotional messages, marketing, advertising (including on-site display advertising), and other information that may be of interest to you (including information about our business partners).
For clarity, products and services advertised on our websites (e.g.
on-site display ads showing messages from third parties) are not endorsed by Trade Me.
We may make advertising space available on our websites through certain advertising platforms or exchanges, such as DoubleClick Ad Exchange, and you can manage what you see on our sites due to DoubleClick cookies through Google’s Ad Settings.
If you opt out of customised third-party advertising, the advertising you see on our websites may be less relevant to you.</li>
<li>
<strong>Tailor our advertising and marketing to you once you’ve left our websites.</strong> We may send or show you promotional messages, marketing, advertising, and other information that may be of interest to you once you’ve left our websites.
We may advertise to you in this way through certain advertising platforms such as Google Marketing Platform or Facebook.
If you opt out of tailored remarketing, we won’t use your personal information for remarketing, but you may still see similar ads based on your browsing history, non-personal cookie data or other anonymous information.
You can further control what ads of ours you see off-site in various ways, for example through Google’s Ad Settings, through your Facebook Adverts settings, by visiting the websites of the Network Advertising Initiative or Digital Advertising Alliance or through your browser settings.
Visit our Remarketing help page to learn more.</li>
<li>
<strong>Run promotions</strong>.
We may use your information to administer referral programmes, rewards, surveys, sweepstakes, contests, or other promotional activities or events sponsored or managed by us or our business partners.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Measure and improve our advertising</strong>.
We may use your information to measure the effectiveness of our advertising and make improvements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> 3.5 To help you publish things on our website, such as: <ul>
<li>
<strong>Your public profile</strong>.
Parts of your public profile page, such as your user name and your region may be publicly visible to others.</li>
<li>
<strong>Your listing content</strong>.
We may make listing content publicly available on the applicable Service when you publish it (and in such cases, you are solely responsible for such publication).
Listing content will also be available to people who use our API (e.g.
developers) and may appear on other websites or applications (see clause 4 below).
</li>
<li>
<strong>Your feedback</strong>.
A number of our Services allow Users to provide feedback and rate each other.
These may be publicly available on our Services.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Comments on message boards</strong>.
If you submit content on a message board, social media post or other similar feature on our Services, that content will be publicly visible.</li>
<li>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> 3.6 For other things, with your express consent.
<ul>
<li>We may disclose your information at your direction, or otherwise as you agree with us.
Please note that we:</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Do not have access to your passwords.</li>
<li>Only use your credit card details for purposes related to your transactions and for fraud prevention or law enforcement purposes.</li>
<li>Have included some Service-specific terms below, which cover how we use your information for particular Services.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> 3.7 To measure traffic on our sites and Services.
<ul>
<li>We may use your information to measure traffic across our sites, apps and Services, to analyse trends and to help us understand how our Services are performing and whether they are meeting the needs of our customers.
We use Nielsen digital measurement software to measure this for us.
Nielsen collects anonymous information, like the number of people who visit our sites &amp.
apps, how many pages are viewed, and how long people stay on our site.
Nielsen may also randomly ask you to complete anonymous short site surveys - these are totally optional.
Nielsen then aggregates this information and combines it with other information from third parties to provide measurement of user engagement across our sites and apps.</li>
<li>You can opt-out of some Nielsen measurement.
Because the Nielsen measurement is anonymous, if you use both our site and our apps, or if you use our site across multiple browsers, you’ll need to opt-out for each device and browser.
That’s because Nielsen doesn’t know who you are and therefore can’t opt you out across the board (sorry!).
To learn more about Nielsen and how to opt-out, go here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> 4.
Who do we disclose your information to? <p>We may need to disclose your personal information to others to provide you with our Services, to improve our Services or uphold the law or our terms.
To help build your trust, we produce an Annual Transparency Report which details disclosures we have made for law enforcement purposes.
As described above, we may disclose your information to our Trade Me Affiliated Services (unless you have opted out of these disclosures).
We may also disclose your personal information in the following ways:</p>
</li>
<li> 4.1 To others with your consent, for example when you: <ul>
<li>
<strong>Ask us or authorise us</strong>.
We’ll share your information when you authorise us to send this to a third party (e.g.
Afterpay or a job advertiser).
For example, if you use Trade Me and are a buyer or seller in respect of a listing, you authorise us to release your name, email address and other contact details to the other party to facilitate the trade after the listing closes.
Likewise, if you use Holiday Houses, Viewing Tracker or Tenancy Tracker, we may disclose your personal information between Users to facilitate the Service.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Authorise third party access</strong>.
We may share your information when you authorise a third party application to access your information.
This is most common for Top Sellers (e.g.
who use Tradevine), and other professional listers (e.g.
motor vehicle dealers, property agents and recruiters).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> 4.2 To other users in certain cases, for example: <ul>
<li>
<strong>Your trading history</strong>.
Your membership trading history is published in your feedback if someone places feedback about you.
Although we allow this functionality, the person posting feedback is solely responsible for the content of their feedback.</li>
<li>
<strong>Dispute information (subject to a statutory declaration)</strong>.
In rare circumstances we may disclose contact details of one User to another User (e.g.
see cause 4.5 below).
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> 4.3 To our service providers, to provide and manage our Services.
<ul>
<li>In order to provide and manage our Services, we may need to disclose some of your personal information to our third party service providers.
These providers have limited access to your personal information to perform tasks on our behalf, (such as cloud-storage providers.
marketing partners.
data analytics or research partners.
third parties that help us to enhance the safety and security of the Service.
where required, to international regulators (for example, for tax purposes).
and our consultants, lawyers, accountants, insurers, and professional advisors) and are contractually obliged to use your personal information consistently with this Privacy Policy.
These disclosures will be consistent with the Service-specific terms and the rest of this privacy policy.</li>
<li>Some of these service providers are located outside of New Zealand and may not be subject to New Zealand privacy laws.
However, we will take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to confirm that those organisations are required to protect the information in a way that, overall, provides comparable safeguards to those under the Privacy Act 2020.
By using the Service and otherwise providing us with your information, you authorise such disclosure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> 4.4 To other third parties, such as: <ul>
<li>
<strong>Developers who use our API to build applications</strong>.
If you use Trade Me, we provide application programming interfaces (APIs) that allow developers to build new applications that include our data.
Users of our API must agree to our API terms and conditions.
Some applications may deliver services to you that ask you to log in to connect to Trade Me (via the application).
These applications will not be able to retrieve your Trade Me password, but will be able to access your current listing content and other personal information to the extent you have authorised access.
For example, some applications, with your authorisation, may be able to access information within your My Trade Me such as your watchlist, sold items or personal contact details.
You should only allow applications to access your information if you trust them.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Afterpay, if you buy or sell with them</strong>.
If you use the “Afterpay Service” to conduct a transaction (either as a buyer or a seller), we may disclose your personal information to Afterpay NZ Limited (“Afterpay”) or a related company of Afterpay where necessary to: (i) facilitate payments under the Afterpay Service.
(ii) help with resolution of a dispute (including where our Buyer Protection Policy applies).
(iii) help process a refund, chargeback and/or reversal.
(iv) report suspicious or potentially fraudulent activity on the website in connection with the Afterpay Service.
(v) allow suspension of the Afterpay Service where a seller’s sales through the Afterpay Service disproportionately lead to a buyer’s default on payment obligations to Afterpay.
or (vi) ensure Afterpay can enforce any contractual rights given for Afterpay’s benefit under our Afterpay terms for Trade Me sellers.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Job advertisers and recruiters, via Trade Me Jobs.</strong> If you apply for a job on Trade Me Jobs, we may send the advertiser your job application (including CV and other documents such as cover letters) and other personal information.
The advertiser may also be able to access your job application, and other personal information submitted for the job, via our applicant tracking system.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Advertisers providing customised ads, unless you opt out</strong>.
We may give advertisers your personal information to facilitate them sending you promotional messages, marketing, advertising, and other information that may be of interest to you (unless you opt out or unsubscribe).
This may be provided on our Services or on services provided by those advertisers.
The advertiser’s own privacy policy will apply to the personal information we send them.
Depending on the privacy policy of the advertiser, the advertiser may combine the personal information we give them with personal information they hold about you, to assist with their advertising to you.
This is particularly relevant for Google’s Customer Match and Facebook Custom Audience.
Visit our Remarketing help page to learn more.
If any personal information is shared, we require that it is done so securely.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Insurers and advisers (with your permission) if you use Trade Me Insurance</strong>.
If you use Trade Me Insurance, we may give your insurance application form and other personal information to our underwriter (Tower) so that they can facilitate your insurance.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Users of Tailored Products</strong>.
Some of our Services provide tailored personal information to the users of those Services.
Those Services will have their own customisable settings, so you can choose whether you want to share your information.
For example, if you have an active Trade Me Job Profile, subject to your profile settings (e.g., whether you make your information public or not), we may share your Trade Me Job Profile with recruiters and job advertisers that use our Trade Me Jobs candidate database .
We call our products that provide tailored personal information “Tailored Products”.
When we are developing any Tailored Products, Trade Me will ensure that your personal information is processed fairly and that the recipients of the personal information are contractually restricted in respect of their use of your personal information (e.g.
for users of our Trade Me Jobs candidate database, to contacting you about a particular role).
If we develop a Tailored Product that doesn’t have its own customisable settings, then if you’re opted out we will not disclose your information to users of the Tailored Product.
You can find out information about each Trade Me Service which provides tailored personal information.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> 4.5 To authorities or other entities to uphold the law or our terms, for example: <ul>
<li>
<strong>For legal compliance or law enforcement purposes</strong>.
We may disclose your personal information to courts, law enforcement or government agencies, or third parties, to the extent we believe that disclosure is appropriate or permitted by the Privacy Act.
</li>
<li>
<strong>To facilitate legal processes</strong>.
If you wish to take Disputes Tribunal (or other) proceedings against another User, you can contact us for a statutory declaration form which must be completed before we will consider releasing anyone else's information to you.
You may only request contact details for the sole purpose of making a claim.</li>
<li>
<strong>To enforce or apply our terms and conditions or policies</strong>.
Despite anything else in this clause 4.5, if you are involved in a dispute to which our Buyer Protection Policy applies, you authorise us to (at our discretion) provide the other party with any correspondence or evidence relevant to the dispute which you’ve provided to us.
In limited circumstances, we may also provide your contact details to the other party to help resolve the dispute (but will always seek your permission first).
</li>
<li>
<strong>To protect the rights, property or safety of us, our Users or others</strong>.
This includes collecting money you owe us and making such disclosures as are necessary for the purpose of trust, safety and assurance in accordance with clause 3.3 above (e.g.
we have authorisation to access name and address details registered in respect of a vehicle on the motor vehicle register for fraud prevention purposes).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> 4.6 To our other Services.
<ul>
<li>We may disclose your personal information to entities partly or fully owned by Trade Me Group Limited which are governed by this privacy policy, subject to your privacy options and the service-specific terms in clause 8.
In relation to Trade Me Affiliated Services, unless you opt out, we may disclose your personal information to businesses that provide a Trade Me Affiliated Service.
We won’t allow your information to be disclosed for a Trade Me Affiliated Service unless we trust the business providing it and we’ll ensure that all Trade Me Affiliated Services have robust privacy arrangements in place.
You can find out information about each Trade Me Affiliated Service and opt out of disclosures to Trade Me Affiliated Services.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> 4.7 To others where necessary to reorganise or sell our business.
<ul>
<li>If we undertake or are involved in any merger, acquisition, reorganisation, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or insolvency event, then we may sell, transfer or share some or all of our assets.

</ul>
</li>
<li> 4.8 To other third parties, where your identity is anonymised.
<ul>
<li>We may share non-personally identifiable information (e.g., aggregated information about our Users that we combine together so that it no longer identifies or references an individual User), for industry and market analysis, demographic profiling, marketing and advertising, and other business purposes.
For example, we may disclose aggregated anonymised information to Users of DealerBase for the purpose of understanding trends in the motor industry.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> 4.9 Also, some interactions with our sites and Services may be subject to additional third party terms.
For example <ul>
<li>

Our Services may contain links to third party websites or services.
We don’t own or control those websites or services or endorse them in any way and, if you interact with them, you may be providing information directly to the third party concerned.
The third parties will have their own rules about the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information.
We encourage you to review their privacy policies accordingly.</li>
<li>
<strong>Certain embedded third party services</strong>.
Some of our Services use embedded third party services, e.g.

Information you share publicly on our Services may be indexed through third party search engines.
We do not control the practices of third party search engines, and they may use caches containing your outdated information.</li>

<li> 5.
How do we hold and protect your information? <p>We’re big on security.
We publish lots of tips on how to keep your personal information secure.
We also work hard to ensure we keep your personal information safe and to avoid any harm to you or your personal information.
We would notify you and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner if a potentially harmful data breach of your personal information did occur.
We delete personal information after it is no longer reasonably necessary for us to use it.
In particular:</p>
</li>
<li> 5.1 We use industry recognised security practices and measures.
<ul>
<li>We are committed to keeping your personal information as safe and secure as possible and follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
</li>
<li>We continuously implement and update our administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information against unauthorised access, loss, destruction, or alteration.
However, despite all of our measures we can’t 100% guarantee the security of the transmission or storage of your personal information.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> 5.2 We store your information in New Zealand or overseas subject to standards that will comply with our privacy obligations <ul>
<li>You authorise us to transfer, store, and process your personal information in New Zealand and possibly other countries.
Where we store information overseas, or a third party we use to provide our Services stores information overseas (e.g.
Amazon Web Services), we will ensure that the storage complies with New Zealand privacy obligations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> 5.3 We retain your information as long as reasonably required, unless we are legally required to hold it longer.
<ul>
<li>We will keep your personal information for as long as is reasonably required for us to use it in accordance with this policy, unless we are required by law to hold it longer.
In particular, we may retain:</li>
<ul>
<li>Recordings of your phone calls for a period of up to two years (and sometimes longer, where necessary for business purposes, to help prevent fraud or facilitate legal processes).</li>
<li>All listing content after listings have expired.
We do this for various reasons, including in case of disputes, to help prevent fraud and facilitate legal processes, to comply with financial record-keeping and to help personalise or recommend products in future.
Listing content may also persist elsewhere when third parties access and cache listings while they are live.
For example, Google do this when they index the web for searching and so old listings may show in Google searches for a period of time.</li>
<li>Trade Me Jobs information.
However, if you delete a CV or other document from Trade Me Jobs, the item will be immediately removed from your list of stored documents and deleted from our systems within seven days.
Otherwise, documents you upload will expire and be deleted after five years.</li>
<li>Motorweb (New Zealand) vehicle information reports (VIRs), including for audit purposes.</li>
</ul>
<li>Other personal information that is deleted by you may persist for a limited time in our backup systems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> 5.4 Credit card Information is held subject to stringent payments industry standards.
<ul>
<li>Credit and debit card information is sensitive and we protect it to stringent security standards, which at a minimum comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (“PCI standards”).
We use a number of procedures and different technologies to help protect your credit and debit card information from unauthorised access, use and disclosure.
Our compliance with PCI is audited every year.
</li>
<li>For some Services we may allow you to save your card information for subsequent use (and, to make life easier for you, we may use your saved card information for other Services we offer where you’re able to make card payments).
For example, if you use a credit or debit card for our Ping or Pay Now Services, you may have the option to “save this card for next time” (or an option to similar effect) and if you choose this option, your credit or debit card details will be encrypted and securely stored.</li>
</ul>

Or, a vehicle you own (or owned in the past) is for sale, a prospective buyer may purchase a Vehicle Information Report from us which may contain your name and address as the registered owner or a previous owner.
