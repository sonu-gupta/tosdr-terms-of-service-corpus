Collection and processing in our products

<p>When you use the Adblock Plus browser extension, we collect and process the following data:</p>
Extension update checks
<p>Your browser periodically checks for updates of all your extensions, including Adblock Plus.
Some general information - browser version, extension version, operating system, date of last update and your IP address - are transmitted during an update check.
After a successful update, a website may be automatically opened.
Data stored on this website includes your IP address (solely for the purpose of IT security and only accessible by eyeo's IT Security team), the time at which the request was made, the web address accessed, the browser identifier and the referring page.
This data (IP address only aggregated via hashing with a daily changing salt) is used to generate usage statistics as well as to investigate potential security issues and forum or blog spam.
Detailed logs are retained for a period of 30 days, after which only the aggregated usage statistics that cannot be connected to a single user remain.
Everything else is deleted.</p>
<p>Updates for Adblock Plus for Android and Internet Explorer are handled by the Adblock Plus website and the data transmitted is subject to the Adblock Plus Privacy Policy.
Updates to Adblock Plus for Firefox are handled by the Mozilla website and are subject to the Mozilla's Privacy Policy.
Updates to Adblock Plus for Chrome are handled by the Google Web Store website and are subject to the Google Privacy Policy.
Updates to Adblock Plus for Opera are handled by the Opera Add-ons website and are subject to the Opera Privacy Policy.
Updates to Adblock Plus for Safari are handled by the Safari Extensions website and are subject to the Apple Privacy Policy.</p>
Subscription downloads
<p>If you add filter subscriptions to your Adblock Plus installation, the subscription will be requested to regularly retrieve updates.
Every update results in the hosting website receiving your IP address as well as some general information like your Adblock Plus version, browser and browser version.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if a subscription download fails on several consecutive occasions, the updated address of the filter list is requested from the AdblockPlus.org domain.
The data transmitted includes the Adblock Plus version, subscription address and any information about the error encountered.
This data is used to identify issues that have not been reported by subscription maintainers and is subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>
Issue Reporter
<p>Adblock Plus allows you to send issue reports that will be temporarily stored on the AdblockPlus.org website.
These reports contain information required to investigate the issue including the Adblock Plus version, browser version, browser build number, if any, URL of referred page, if any, URL of page that opened the given webpage, address of the webpage where the problem is visible, blockable items on the webpage, matching filters, active subscriptions, type of issue report (i.e.
false positive or false negative), and a screenshot of the issue (it is possible to remove particularly sensitive sections of the page before the report is sent).
Parameter values are removed from all transmitted addresses to avoid unintentionally leaking private information.</p>
<p>You can voluntarily:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide your email address in order for us to request more information from you or to update you on the issue.</li>
<li>Include an optional comment about the issue.</li>

eyeo will use the reports for troubleshooting and support monitoring purposes only.</li>

Emergency notification
<p>Adblock Plus contains an emergency notification mechanism that allows it to notify users about important issues affecting their Adblock Plus installation.
This feature requires all Adblock Plus installations to query an address in the AdblockPlus.org domain regularly to retrieve the list of active notifications.
This request makes your IP address visible to the website and also sends some general information like your Adblock Plus version, browser, browser version and the number of previous Adblock Plus downloads (the download number is limited to four, and will be displayed as 4+ after reaching this number).
This data allows serving different notifications to different clients and is subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>

For example, a documentation link is clicked or the full list of filter subscriptions needs to be downloaded.
These requests are subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>

On a voluntary basis, you can provide us with your reason why you have uninstalled Adblock Plus.
We need this information to improve our products.</p>
<p>For donations, we work with payment providers (Stripe, Inc.
