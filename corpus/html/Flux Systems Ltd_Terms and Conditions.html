<li>5.
Loyalty Schemes And Cashback<ol>
<li>
<p>If you have consented, Retailers may use your Flux Service to send you offers, including inviting you to participate in loyalty schemes with one or more Retailers (each a ‚Äú<strong>Loyalty Scheme</strong>‚Äù).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where available, your participation in Loyalty Schemes across the Banking App and other Flux enabled applications will be aggregated.
This will allow you to participate in a Loyalty Scheme using multiple payment methods and may mean that your entitlement to Cashback (as set out below) arises sooner.
We will inform you in writing when and where this aggregated participation method is available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Retailer is solely responsible for any retargeting (such as direct advertising or offers to you) which it carries out through the Flux Service and for the content of any messages.
You will only receive these if you have explicitly consented either at sign-up or as an option in your Banking App‚Äôs marketplace for example.
These retargeting messages may include discounted offers on items which may be of interest.
Flux commits to ensure that you are always able to easily opt out by emailing help@tryflux.com and any available channels in the Banking App.
Flux is committed to build transparency into how your data is used.
Your may receive retargeting messages and access to Loyalty Schemes through the Flux Service but the Retailer remains responsible for ensuring that the retargeting and Loyalty Schemes are compliant with applicable laws.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you decide to participate in a Loyalty Scheme offered by a Retailer, you may be eligible to receive a payment from Us (‚Äú<strong>Cashback</strong>‚Äù) as follows.
The Retailer may provide Flux with a commission in exchange for anonymised information about transactions you make with the Retailer and for promoting the Retailer‚Äôs Loyalty Scheme to you.
Flux in turn makes Cashback available to you in exchange for your participation in the Loyalty Scheme and for providing access to the anonymised information about your transactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Flux receives commission from the Retailer, Flux will hold the commission as its own funds.
Our obligation to pay Cashback to you arises under these Terms and not under any agreement you or We may have with the Retailer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once We have verified information that your transactions with a Retailer have met the requirements of that Retailer‚Äôs Loyalty Scheme, We will notify you that there is Cashback due to you.
We will then make a Cashback payment to you by paying the value of the Cashback straight into the bank account from which you paid for the transaction within 1 working day that triggered the entitlement to Cashback, subject to the following limitations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right not to make a payment of Cashback if these Terms are terminated by you or Us before a Cashback payment becomes due.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The exact amount of Cashback you will receive is set by the terms of each Loyalty Scheme as provided to Us by the Retailer, and Our ability to operate the Loyalty Scheme is dependent on the information We receive from Retailers and the Retailers‚Äô Data Providers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flux shall be entitled to stop providing any Loyalty Scheme:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>for legal or regulatory reasons;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if a Retailer has failed to pay Flux‚Äôs fees for providing the Loyalty Scheme to you.
or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if a Retailer has decided to stop providing a Loyalty Scheme.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>However in the event that We stop providing any Loyalty Scheme, we will still provide Cashback in relation to any redemption event that you may have earned prior to the end of the Loyalty Scheme, but do not redeem until after the Loyalty Scheme is no longer provided.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
