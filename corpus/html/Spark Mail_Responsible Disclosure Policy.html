</ul> Spark Responsible Disclosure Policy <p>If you believe you have discovered a security or privacy vulnerability that affects Spark software, services, or web servers, please report it to us.</p>
<p>Before reporting, please review our responsible disclosure policy below.</p> Expectations <p>Security is core to our values, and we value the input of security professionals acting in good faith to help us maintain a high standard for the security and privacy of our users.
This includes encouraging responsible vulnerability research and disclosure.
This policy sets out our definition of good-faith in the context of finding and reporting vulnerabilities, as well as what you can expect from us in return.
When working with us according to this policy, you can expect us to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extend Safe Harbor for your vulnerability research that is related to this policy;</li>
<li>Work with you to understand and validate your report, including a timely initial response to the submission;</li>
<li>Work to remediate discovered vulnerabilities in a timely manner.
and</li>
<li>Recognize your contribution to improving our security if you are the first to report a unique vulnerability, and your report triggers a code or configuration change.</li>
</ul> Ground Rules <p>To encourage vulnerability research and to avoid any confusion between legitimate research and malicious attack, we ask that you attempt, in good faith, to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Play by the rules.
This includes following this policy any other relevant agreements;</li>
<li>Report any vulnerability you’ve discovered promptly;</li>
<li>Avoid violating the privacy of others, disrupting our systems, destroying data, and/or harming user experience;</li>
<li>Use only the Official Channels to discuss vulnerability information with us;</li>
<li>Handle the confidentiality of details of any discovered vulnerabilities according to our Disclosure Policy;</li>
<li>Perform testing only on in-scope systems, and respect systems and activities which are out-of-scope;</li>
<li>If a vulnerability provides unintended access to data: Limit the amount of data you access to the minimum required for effectively demonstrating a Proof of Concept.
and cease testing and submit a report immediately if you encounter any user data during testing, such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Personal Healthcare Information (PHI), credit card data, or proprietary information;</li>
<li>You should only interact with test accounts you own or with explicit permission from the account holder.
and</li>
<li>Do not engage in extortion;</li>
<li>Do not perform any ‘denial of service’ types of attacks.</li>
</ul> Safe Harbor <p>When conducting vulnerability research according to this policy, we consider this research conducted under this policy to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Authorized in view of any applicable anti-hacking laws, and we will not initiate or support legal action against you for accidental, good faith violations of this policy;</li>
<li>Authorized in view of relevant anti-circumvention laws, and we will not bring a claim against you for circumvention of technology controls;</li>
<li>Exempt from restrictions in our Acceptable Usage Policy that would interfere with conducting security research, and we waive those restrictions on a limited basis.
and</li>
<li>Lawful, helpful to the overall security of the Internet, and conducted in good faith.</li>
</ul>
<p>You are expected, as always, to comply with all applicable laws.
If legal action is initiated by a third party against you and you have complied with this policy, we will take steps to make it known that your actions were conducted in compliance with this policy.</p>
<p>If at any time you have concerns or are uncertain whether your security research is consistent with this policy, please submit a report through one of our Official Channels before going any further.</p> Scope <ul>

<li>Attacks designed or likely to degrade, deny, or adversely impact services or user experience (e.g., Denial of Service, Distributed Denial of Service, Brute Force, Password Spraying, Spam…).</li>
<li>Attacks designed or likely to destroy, corrupt, make unreadable (or attempts therein) data or information that does not belong to you.</li>
<li>Attacks designed or likely to validate stolen credentials, credential reuse, account takeover (ATO), hijacking, or other credential-based techniques.</li>
<li>Intentionally accessing data or information that does not belong to you beyond the minimum viable access necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability.</li>
<li>Performing physical, social engineering, or electronic attacks against Spark/Readdle personnel, offices, wireless networks, or property.</li>

<li>Security issues or vulnerabilities created or introduced by the reporter (e.g., modifying a library we rely on to include a vulnerability for the sole purpose of receiving a reward).</li>
<li>Attacks performed on any systems not explicitly mentioned as authorized and in-scope.</li>

</ul> Rewards <p>We believe in recognizing the work of others.</p>
<p>Spark provides rewards to vulnerability reporters at its discretion.
You can use the following indicative values for general guidance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Critical (9.0-10.0) — $3000+</li>
<li>High (7.0-8.9) — $1000</li>
<li>Medium (4.0-6.9)— $500</li>
<li>Low (0.1-3.9) — up to $100</li>
</ul>
<p>The reward amount depends on severity as determined by CVSS v3.0.</p>
<p>When duplicates occur, we award the first report that we can completely reproduce.
Multiple vulnerabilities caused by one underlying issue will be awarded one bounty.</p>
<p>Currently, we do not offer rewards for software issues that do not have a security impact.</p> Reporting <p>To report a security or privacy vulnerability, send an email to security@sparkmailapp.com and include appropriate steps to reproduce, logs, and optionally videos in your message.</p>
<p>Please report different findings by sending separate emails with a relevant subject each.</p>
<p>You may use our PGP key to encrypt sensitive information that you send by email.</p> Policy Text <p>Our responsible disclosure policy is based on the https://disclose.io/ vulnerability disclosure framework.</p>
