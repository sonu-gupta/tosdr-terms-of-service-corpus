It also applies to information collected by or through our Services, which may include by phone, text message, email, the Site or other communication mechanisms.</p>
<p>To the extent you are a parent, guardian, caretaker or other authorized representative of another individual (such as a minor) and register for the Services on that person's behalf, you represent that you are legally authorized to take such actions and to disclose the individual's Personal Information.
In such case, statements in this Privacy Policy directed to registered users of the Services apply to the person whose Personal Information you provided.</p>
<p>By visiting the Site or using the Services, you accept and consent to the terms of our Privacy Policy in effect at the time of your visit or use.</p> II.
WHAT WE MEAN BY "PERSONAL INFORMATION" <p>For purposes of this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" means information that directly or indirectly identifies you or can be used to identify you as an individual.</p> III.
WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT? (1) Information You Provide to Us <p>When you use the Site or otherwise communicate or interact with us through the Services, we collect information that you provide to us directly.
For example, we collect information in the following circumstances: when you contact us.
when you register for and engage with our Services.

Occasionally, you may choose whether or not to provide or disclose Personal Information in connection with your use of the Services.
If you choose not to provide the Personal Information we request, you may still visit and use parts of the Site, but may be unable to access or use certain features, options, programs, and services of the Site.
In addition, as we need certain Personal Information for the performance of the Services, the consequence of not providing such information might be that the Services cannot be provided as requested.</p>
<p>The Personal Information you provide to us may include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li> Information you provide via email, through our 'Contact' section, or using contact details listed on various parts of the Site, including your name, e-mail, phone number, and any other information you decide to provide.

<li> In connection with the Services, information you provide in order to sign up for clinical trial matching, including your name, age, e-mail address, health conditions relevant to the clinical trial opportunities, or any other information you decide to provide to us in connection with the Services.
</li>
<li> If you are one of our customers, suppliers, or prospects, or interested in serving as an investigator of a clinical trial, we may collect or process limited Personal Information in the course of our business relations with you.
For example, when you engage us for our Services, sign up for a webcast, request a demo, or the like.
Such Personal Information may include your name, company, title, order details, and business contact details (e-mail address, telephone number, address).
and </li>
<li> We may also collect any other information you may want to share with us.
Moreover, if you contact us, a record of such correspondence may be kept.

We have a legitimate interest in using such information to assist in log-in, systems administration purposes, information security and abuse prevention, to track user trends, and to analyze the effectiveness of the Site.
Alone or in combination with other information, such automatically collected information may constitute Personal Information.
Some of our service providers (described in Section V., below) may use cookies or other methods to gather information regarding your use of the Site and to track your activities over time and across sites to provide advertising services to us.</p>

When you visit the Site, our servers may send a cookie to your computer.
We may use cookies that are session-based and persistent.
Session cookies exist only during one session.
They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer.
Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your browser or turn off your computer.
Please note that if you disable your web browser's ability to accept cookies, you will be able to navigate the Site, but you may not be able to use all of the features of the Site.

</ul> Type of Cookies Description Managing Settings Required cookies Required cookies enable you to navigate the Site and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the Site and using our services.
If you have chosen to identify yourself to us, we use cookies containing encrypted information to allow us to uniquely identify you.
Each time you log into our Site, a cookie containing an encrypted, unique identifier that is tied to your account is placed on your browser.

Performance cookies These cookies collect information about how you use our Site, including which pages you go to most often and if they receive error messages from certain pages.
These cookies do not collect information that individually identifies you.
Information is only used to improve how the Site functions and performs.
From time-to-time, we may engage service providers to track and analyze usage and volume statistical information relating to individuals who visit the Site.

</li> (3) Do-Not-Track Signals <p>Some browsers have a "Do-Not-Track" feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked.
When you choose to turn on the Do-Not-Track setting in your browser, your browser sends a signal to websites, analytics companies, ad networks, plug-in providers, and other web services that you may encounter while browsing the Internet, instructing them to stop tracking your activity via cookies or other online tracking technologies.
The Site does not currently respond to browser based Do-Not-Track signals.

Our data providers include Human API and iPatient Axis, the entities that we partner with to provide free patient medical record retrieval for clinical trial recruitment.

PURPOSES FOR OUR COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION (1) General Uses <p>We may use Personal Information obtained through the Services in the following ways: </p>
<ul>
<li>To provide the Services;</li>
<li>To provide, analyze, administer, develop, and improve the Site or our Services;</li>
<li> To contact you in connection with the Site, our Services, and notifications, services, programs or offerings for which you may have registered.
</li>
<li>To send you updates and promotional materials for which you have registered;</li>
<li> To assess whether a clinical trial is suited for you, to contact you when a potential clinical trial is identified, and to bring you in contact with principal investigators, clinical research sites or clinical trial service providers, using solely for these purposes the health information that is provided to us based on your consent.
</li>
<li> To identify and authenticate your access to the parts of the Site and Services that you are authorized to access.
</li>
<li>For our legitimate interests of documenting and managing our internal administration;</li>
<li> To protect the rights and/or our property and to ensure the technical functionality and security of the Site or Services.
and </li>
<li> To comply with applicable laws and for our legitimate purposes of protecting our legal rights, in connection with legal claims or enforcement of contracts, and for compliance, regulatory, and investigative purposes.
This may include sharing the Personal Information with third parties, such as governmental authorities or law enforcement officials, subject to applicable law.
</li>
</ul> (2) Registered Users <p>If you register for our Services, SubjectWell uses algorithms that enforce criteria to select the clinical trial most suitable to you, which is the service that you (as the data subject) request from SubjectWell.
The decision on the clinical trial matching is therefore necessary for the performance of the contract between you and SubjectWell.
Furthermore, our patient recruitment marketplace is voluntary and when you choose to participate and disclose your information to us, you also provide your explicit consent, which is freely given and can be withdrawn at any time by contacting us through the contact details further below.</p>
<p>The logic that is used for the decision-making is created by SubjectWell employees reviewing study protocols that define inclusion/exclusion criteria for study eligibility.
The SubjectWell systems then enforce these criteria based on the responses collected during the phone screening process.
The most important consequences of the automated decisions in question is that you will or will not have the opportunity to participate in a clinical trial.</p>
<p>In order to safeguard your rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, you have the right to obtain human intervention on the part of SubjectWell, to express your point of view and to contest the decision.</p>
<p>Also note that we only provide clinical trial participant recruitment services and are not involved in clinical trials or informed about the results.
Therefore, SubjectWell does not determine the purposes or means of the further processing of your Personal Information, including your health information, by principal investigators, clinical research sites or clinical trial service providers once you are brought in contact with them.</p> V.
WHO DO WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH? <p>We may disclose Personal Information you provide to us or that we collect automatically on the Site or in and through the Services with the following categories of third parties: </p>
<ul>
<li> Service providers, such as data storage service providers, marketing service providers, and communications service providers that help us operate our business or provide services on our behalf.
</li>
<li> If you would like to participate in a clinical trial and there are matching clinical trials, we may share Personal Information about you with principal investigators, clinical research sites, and clinical trial service providers that are relevant to you.
</li>
<li> Public authorities, such as law enforcement, if we are legally required to do so or if we need to for national security or to protect our rights or the rights of third parties.
</li>
<li>Our subsidiaries and affiliates for our business operations.
and</li>
<li> A subsequent owner, co-owner or operator of the Site and their advisors in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of substantially all of our stock and/or assets, or in connection with bankruptcy proceedings, or other corporate reorganization, in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
