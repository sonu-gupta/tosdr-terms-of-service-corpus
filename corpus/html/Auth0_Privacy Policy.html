These typically involve pieces of information or code that a website transfers to or accesses from your computer hard drive or mobile device to store and sometimes track information about you.
Cookies and similar technologies enable you to be remembered when using that computer or device to interact with websites and online services and can be used to manage a range of features and content as well as storing searches and presenting personalised content.
Our site uses cookies and similar technologies to distinguish you from other users of our site.
This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our site and use our service and also allows us to improve our site.
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies and similar technologies, but if you prefer, you can change your browser to prevent that and your help screen or manual will tell you how to do this.
However, you may not be able to take full advantage of our website if you do so.
A number of cookies and similar technologies we use last only for the duration of your web or app session and expire when you close your browser.
Others are used to remember you when you return to the site and will last for longer.
We use these cookies and other technologies on the basis that they are necessary for the performance of a contract with you, or because using them is in our legitimate interests (where we have considered that these are not overridden by your rights), and, in some cases, where required by law, where you have consented to their use.

</ul>Transfers of EU &amp.
Swiss Data into the US<p>Auth0 (“we,” “us”) has committed to comply with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield.&nbsp;We have certified that we adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such data.
If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and data subject rights under the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.
To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit&nbsp;https://www.privacyshield.gov/</p>
<p>We are aware that, on July 16, 2020, in the Schrems II case, the European Court of Justice invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield as a means of ensuring adequate protection for personal data transferred to the US.
We are also aware that the Swiss Data Protection Authority and Information Commissioner invalidated the Swiss-US Privacy Shield in September 2020.
In reflection of these rulings, where we transfer personal data originating in the EEA or in Switzerland to the US, those transfers are made under the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission for the transfer of personal data to processors established in third countries which do not ensure an adequate level of data protection.</p>
<p>Auth0 is subject to the investigatory and enforcement authority of the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC).</p>
<p>Pursuant to the Privacy Shield principles we still acknowledge the right of EU and Swiss individuals to access their personal data to inspect, update, or correct it.
EU and Swiss individuals wishing to exercise this right may do so by emailing Auth0 at compliance@auth0.com.</p>
