        Honey Privacy and Security PolicyLast updated June 25, 2020A letter from our founders As users of the internet, we care about privacy just like you do.
And as fellow human beings, we think you deserve to know exactly what you can expect from your Honey experience.
Before you read our privacy policy, we’d first like to tell you how we think about privacy in simple terms.<br>
<br> We do not sell your personal information.
Ever.<br>
<br> Honey works by finding you the best deals.
When you buy something with a Honey coupon, promo code, or offer, the store sometimes pays us a fee.
That’s how we make money.
We do not need to (or want to) sell your information.<br>
<br> So how do we use your data?<br>
<br> First and foremost, we analyze some information on the retail website you’re on so that we can find the best coupons for that site or product.
Also, we collect limited shopping data to support the Honey community.
That means Honey members share real-time information about deals, prices, and products with the rest of the community to help everyone save time and money.<br>
<br> Want to know which promo code works? Sure, another member just tested all of the codes with Honey five minutes ago.
Want to see when a product you’re interested in goes on sale? Another Honey member is helping us update the price right now.
When shoppers hunt for deals together, rather than on their own, everyone saves time and money.<br>
<br> Our stance on privacy is simple: We will be transparent with what data we collect and how we use it to save you time and money, and you can decide if you’re good with that.<br>
<br> If this sounds fair, then let’s start shopping smarter, together.<br>
<br> P.S.
If you have any questions or comments, just email us at privacy@joinhoney.com.
George RuanCo-FounderRyan HudsonCo-FounderIntroducing the Privacy Policy This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains how Honey Science LLC (“Honey” or “we”) collects and processes information from members and users of the website, software applications, and other online services we provide (collectively “Honey’s products”).
Honey’s products include, but are not limited to, the Honey extension for web browsers (the “Extension”), the Honey mobile application (the “Mobile App”), and the website located at www.joinhoney.com (the “Website”).<br>
<br> If we ever need additional personal information for a specific reason, we will tell you and ask for your permission.
Also, to the extent that Honey has links to other websites (like retailers), please note that we do not own, operate, or control them, and they have their own controlling privacy policies that you should review.
What data we collect and why In order to provide our products, Honey collects information that you share directly with us when you use our website, extension, or Mobile App.
Though you don’t have to, you can choose to provide your email to set up an account with us, which lets you add items to your Droplist, earn Honey Gold, see a personalized recommendation feed, and more.
You can also set up your profile with your name and other info for a more personalized experience.<br>
<br> Honey also collects technical information about your device and use of Honey to make sure that our products are working correctly.
The information we collect is geared to providing Honey members with a better way to shop online and to help us develop, improve, and market our services.

When you are on a pre-approved retail site, to help you save money, Honey will collect information about that site that lets us know which coupons and promos to find for you.
We may also collect information about pricing and availability of items, which we can share with the rest of the Honey community.Learn More&nbsp;How we share your dataWe know how important your personal data is to you, so we will never sell it.
