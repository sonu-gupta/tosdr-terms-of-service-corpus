</p> Modifying &amp.
Moving Tests <p> Once a sample has begun processing in our lab, the new or existing kit order is no longer eligible for modifications or any type of refund.
Modifications are changes to the type(s) of test(s) you have ordered.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Modifying the type of test ordered on kits.</strong> You may modify the type of test ordered on a new kit before it starts processing in the lab.
The funds for the original test will be credited towards the new test.
</p>
<p> You may modify the type of test ordered on an existing kit prior to any lab processing.
Any remaining balance may be applied to additional testing.
You will be responsible for any additional costs associated with the change.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Moving tests between kits.</strong> If a test is moved to a different kit, you may be subject to shipping costs and any additional costs depending on the circumstance.
</p>
<p> Any test ordered for a new kit that you wish to move to an existing kit will be refunded the shipping cost as long as the kit has not been shipped.
If process is complete, the new kit may be merged with the original kit provided that the tester is the same person and the request meets our merge requirements.
If it does not meet our merge requirements, no refund will be granted.
Please note that you may be subject to additional costs associated with the change.
</p> Sample Failures <p> In the rare circumstance that a sample fails initial testing, we will begin a second run if there is a sample in storage.
If we do not have an additional sample in storage, we will mail out a second collection kit, free of shipping charges, to the address on file.
Adjustments to the shipping address can be made on the Contact Information section of the Account Information page.
