<strong>Third-Party Data Collection</strong>
</p>
<p>Cookies may also be placed on our websites by third parties to deliver tailored information and content that may be of interest to you, such as promotions or offerings, when you visit third-party websites after you have left ours.
We do not permit these third parties to collect personal data about you on our sites beyond such cookies (e.g., email address) unless such data is provided to the third party in their role as a service provider acting solely on our behalf.<strong>

<p>
<strong>Social Media Features and Widgets</strong>
</p>
<p>Our websites include social media features, such as Facebook’s “Like” button, and widgets, such as the “Share This” button, or interactive mini-programs that run on our sites.
These features are usually recognizable by their third-party brand or logo and may collect your IP address or other personal data, including which page you are visiting on our websites, and set a cookie to enable the feature to work properly.

<strong>Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms.</strong>
</p>
<p>Some mobile and web browsers transmit “do-not-track” signals.
Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they are even aware of them.
We currently do not respond to these signals.<strong>

<strong>Automated Individual Decision-Making and Profiling</strong>
<p>Where NortonLifeLock processes network traffic data for the purpose of network and information security based on our or our customers’ legitimate interest as outlined in the corresponding section of this Statement, automated decisions concerning data elements may occasionally be made.
This could involve assigning relative cybersecurity reputation scores to IP addresses and URLs based on objective cyber-threat indicators measured by our and our partners’ cyber-threat detection engines.
Such indicators may be, for instance, the determination that malicious or otherwise harmful contents are hosted at a given URL or are coming from a given IP address.
Such automatically assigned reputation scores may be leveraged by you, by NortonLifeLock, by our partners, and by other customers to detect, block, and mitigate the identified cyber threats.
They could therefore result in our Services blocking network traffic coming from or going to such URLs and IP addresses.
This processing is intended only to protect you, NortonLifeLock, our partners, and our other customers from cyber threats.
If you consider that such automated processing is unduly affecting you in a significant way, please contact us as explained above (“Contact Us”) to raise your concerns and to seek our help in finding a satisfactory solution.<strong>
