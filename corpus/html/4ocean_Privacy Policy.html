Cookies </p>
<p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user.
Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site.
Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates.
For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site.
If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our</p>
<p>site.
The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site.
Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.
Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers).
However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.</p>

When the user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>M.
Security</p>
<p>This website takes every precaution to protect our users’ information.
When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.
When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is</p>
<p>encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL.
While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Google Chrome and Microsoft Internet</p>
<p>Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just ‘surfing’.
To learn more about SSL, follow this link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line.
All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.
Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.
Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk.
When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information.
Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.
Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers’ information is protected.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage.
If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an</p>
<p>email to info@4Ocean.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>N.
Special Offers</p>
<p>New and established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and our newsletter.
Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications.
Please see our choice and opt-out in letter Q below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>O.
Site and Service Updates</p>
<p>We also send the user site and service announcement updates.
Users are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service.
We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regard to issues relating to their account via email or phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.
Your Rights to Access and Control Your Personal Data.</p>
<p>We give you access and control of your personal data as described in this Privacy Policy.
If you live</p>
<p>in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, and Switzerland (the “Designated Countries”), you</p>
<p>have a number of legal rights with respect to your information,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q.
Data Retention</p>
<p>We will retain your data for a period of 6 months from the time we first collect your data if you have no additional activity or until you opt out, whichever comes first.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>R.
Policies for Children</p>
<p>In order to respect the privacy of minors, 4ocean does not knowingly collect, maintain or process Personal Information submitted online via our Internet Services by anyone under the age of 18.
To the extent 4ocean collects Personal Information on minors in the context of one of the purposes mentioned in the Statement, 4ocean will only do so with the appropriate consent or as otherwise permitted under applicable laws.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>S.
Your California Privacy Rights</p>
<p>Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83, California customers are entitled to request information relating to whether a business has disclosed Personal Information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.
4ocean does not sell or share your Personal Information with third-party companies for their direct marketing purposes without your consent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>T.
International Data Transfers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will rely on multiple legal bases to lawfully transfer personal data around the world.
These include</p>
<p>your consent, the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield, and EU Commission approved model contractual clauses, which require certain privacy and security protections.
You may obtain copies of the model contractual clauses by contacting us.
4ocean complies with the Privacy Shield principles regarding the collection, use, sharing, and retention of personal information as described in our Privacy Shield certifications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4ocean is subject to the oversight of the US Federal Trade Commission and remains responsible for</p>
<p>personal information that we transfer to others who process it on our behalf as described in the How</p>
<p>Information Is Shared section.
If you have a complaint about our Privacy Shield compliance,</p>
<p>please contact us.
You can also refer a complaint to our chosen independent dispute resolution</p>
<p>body, the International Centre for Dispute Resolution® at http://go.adr.org/privacyshield.html.
&nbsp.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that the countries where we operate may have privacy and data protection laws that</p>
<p>differ from, and are potentially less protective than, the laws of your country.
You agree to this risk</p>
<p>when you create a 4ocean's account and click “I agree” to data transfers, irrespective of which</p>
<p>country you live in.
If you later wish to withdraw your consent, you can delete your information as</p>
<p>described in the Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have the right to lodge a complaint regarding your information with the proper supervising authority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>U.
Correction/Updating Personal Information:</p>
<p>If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user’s personal data provided to us.
This can usually be done at the user account page or by emailing our Customer Support at info@4Ocean.com or by sending a written request to: </p>

<p>P.
Choice/Opt-out</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our users are given the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information.
For example, our order form has an ‘opt-out’ mechanism so users who buy a product from us, but don’t want any marketing material, can keep their email address off of our lists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials from our partners may opt-out of receiving these communications by clicking the opt-out, unsubscribe button, or email us at info@4Ocean.com or by sending a written request to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4ocean Public Benefit Corporation, </p>

<p>P.
Choice/Opt-out</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties.
We do this, so our users can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>V.
Notification of Changes</p>
<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Website, so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email.
Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner.
We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under</p>
<p>which the information was collected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
