DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE.
NO WEB ACCESS
<p>
OSDN is a website owned and operated by Appirits Inc.
, for the purpose of fostering software development and content creation under Open-Source Initiative ("OSI")-approved licenses or other arrangements relating to software and/or content development that may be approved by OSDN (the "Purpose").
OSDN currently offers users access to a rich collection of on-line resources for Open Source software development and content creation, including various communications tools, source code control and project management tools, online forums, personalized content and branded programming through its network of properties (collectively, the "Services").
To use the Services, each user must independently obtain access to the World Wide Web, either directly or through devices that access Web-based content, and pay any and all service fees or equipment costs associated with such access.
</p> 4.
REGISTRATION OBLIGATIONS
<p>
If required by OSDN, each user must: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information on the Service's registration form (collectively, the "Registration Data") and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data as necessary.
If, after investigation, we have reasonable grounds to suspect that any user's information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, we may suspend or terminate that user's account and prohibit any and all current or future use of the Services (or any portion thereof) by that user other than as expressly provided herein.
</p>
<p>
Each user will receive a password and account designation upon completing the Service's registration process and is wholly responsible for maintaining the confidentiality thereof and wholly liable for all activities occurring thereunder.
OSDN cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from a user's failure to comply with this Section, including any loss or damage arising from any user's failure to (a) immediately notify OSDN of any unauthorized use of his or her password or account or any other breach of security and (b) ensure that he or she exits from his or her account at the end of each session.
</p>
<p>
OSDN handles user Registration Data in accordance with the OSDN Privacy Statement.
</p> 5.
CONTENT
<p>
All information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, video, messages or any other materials whatsoever (collectively, "Content"), whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, are the sole responsibility of the person from which such Content originated.
This means that the user, and not OSDN, is entirely responsible for all Content that he or she uploads, posts, emails or otherwise transmits via OSDN or any Service.
No user shall transmit Content or otherwise conduct or participate in any activities on OSDN and/or any Service which, in the judgment of OSDN, is likely to be prohibited by law in any applicable jurisdiction, including laws governing the encryption of software, the export of technology, the transmission of obscenity or the permissible uses of intellectual property.
</p>
<p>
OSDN will not pre-screen or review Content, but OSDN reserves the right to refuse or delete any Content of which it becomes aware that it reasonably deems not to fulfill the Purpose.
In addition, OSDN shall have the right (but not the obligation) in its sole discretion to refuse or delete any content that it reasonably considers to violate the Terms or be otherwise illegal.
OSDN, in its sole and absolute discretion, may preserve Content and may also disclose Content if required to do so by law or judicial or governmental mandate or as reasonably determined useful by us to protect the rights, property or personal safety of OSDN, its users and the public.
OSDN does not control the Content posted via the Service and, as such, does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of such Content.
Under no circumstances will OSDN be liable in any way for any Content, including, but not limited to, liability for any errors or omissions in any Content or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content posted, emailed or otherwise transmitted via OSDN or any Service thereon.
</p>
<p>
Each user, by using OSDN or any Service, may be exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent or objectionable.
Each user must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the use of any Content, including any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such Content.
</p> 6.
LICENSING AND OTHER TERMS APPLYING TO CODE AND OTHER CONTENT POSTED ON OSDN:
<p>
Use, reproduction, modification, and ownership of intellectual property rights to data stored in CVS, SVN or as a file release and posted by any user on OSDN ("Source Code") shall be subject to the OSI-approved license applicable to such Source Code, or to such other licensing arrangements that may be approved by OSDN as applicable to such Source Code.
</p>
<p>
With respect to text or data entered into and stored by publicly-accessible site features such as message boards and bug trackers, the submitting user retains ownership of such OSDN Public Content.
with respect to publicly-available statistical content which is generated by the site to monitor and display project activity, such content is owned by OSDN.
In each such case, the submitting user grants OSDN the royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive and fully sublicensable right and license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform and display such Content (in whole or part) worldwide and/or to incorporate it in other works in any form, media, or technology now known or later developed, all subject to the terms of any applicable approved license.
</p>
<p>
With respect to Content posted to private areas of OSDN, i.e., private OSDN development tools or OSDN Mail, the submitting user may grant to OSDN or other users such rights and licenses as the submitting user deems appropriate.
</p>

Content located on any OSDN-hosted subdomain which is subject to the sole editorial control of the owner or licensee of such subdomain, shall be subject to the OSI-approved license applicable to such Source Code, or to such other licensing arrangements that may be approved by OSDN as applicable to such Content.

GENERAL PRACTICES REGARDING USE AND STORAGE <p>
OSDN may establish general practices and limits concerning use of the Services, as defined by posted Service-specific Rules.
While OSDN will use reasonable efforts to back up site data and make such data available in the event of loss or deletion, OSDN has no responsibility or liability for the deletion or failure to store any messages and other communications or other Content maintained or transmitted by any Service.
OSDN reserves the right to mark as "inactive" and archive accounts and/or projects that are inactive for an extended period of time.
OSDN reserves the right to change these general practices and Service-specific Rules at any time, in its sole discretion, with notice to users and the public as described in Section 1 above.
