<b>Dispute Resolution and Waiver of Class Action and Jury Rights </b>
</p>
<p>The following applies only to those users that reside in the
United States of America or Canada:</p>
<p>You understand and agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy
arising under or in connection with this Agreement, including your use and
access to the Services or any other content, including, but not limited to,
claims as to whether any services rendered by Tomofun or persons employed or
engaged by Tomofun were unnecessary or unauthorized or were improperly,
negligently, or incompetently rendered, shall be finally and exclusively
resolved by binding arbitration under the American Arbitration Association’s
("AAA") Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures and
Consumer-Related Disputes Supplementary Procedures, and not by a lawsuit or
resort to court process, except as California law provides for judicial review
of arbitration proceedings.
Each party retains the right to seek injunctive or
other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the
actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s
copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property
rights.
It is your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and
arbitrator fees as set forth in the AAA Rules.
</p>
<p>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT BOTH PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
ARE GIVING UP THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO HAVE SUCH DISPUTE DECIDED IN A
COURT OF LAW BEFORE A JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN
ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT, CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION, PRIVATE
ATTORNEY-GENERAL ACTION, OR ANY OTHER PRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
</p>
<p>The parties further agree that the arbitrator, and not any
federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to
resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability,
enforceability or formation of this agreement to arbitrate.
Any such
controversy or claim shall be arbitrated on an individual basis, unless both
parties otherwise agree in writing.
The arbitration shall be held in San
Francisco County, California, U.S.A.
</p>
<p>You may cancel this agreement to arbitrate by giving written
notice to Tomofun within 30 days of the date of your acceptance of this
Agreement, or 30 days after Tomofun makes material changes to this section of
this Agreement.
You should send your cancellation notice to support@furbo.com with the
following information: (i) your name, (ii) your Tomofun account email address.
(iii) your mailing address.
(iv) a statement of your wish not to resolve
disputes with Tomofun through arbitration.
Your notice to opt-out of
arbitration only applies to this Agreement.
if you previously entered into other
arbitration agreements with Tomofun or enter into other such agreements in the
future, your notification that you are opting out of the arbitration terms of
this Agreement shall not affect the other arbitration agreements between you
and Tomofun.
Should you choose to withdraw from the arbitration provision, all
other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p>If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than
arbitration, each party waives any right to a jury trial.
You agree to the
personal jurisdiction by and venue in the state and federal courts of San
Francisco County in the State of California or a United States District Court
for the Northern District of California located in San Francisco, California,
and waive any objection to such jurisdiction or venue.
