Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of warranties or limitation of liability in certain circumstances.
Accordingly, some of the above limitations may not apply to you.</p>
<p>11.<strong> Governing.</strong> These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to conflict of law principles.
Subject to Section 12, which provides that disputes are to be resolved through binding arbitration or small claims court, to the extent that any lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted hereunder, you and NerdWallet agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within San Francisco County, California, for the purpose of litigating all such disputes.
We operate the Services from our offices in California, and we make no representation that information and materials included in the Services are appropriate or available for use in other locations.</p>
<p>12.<strong> Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration.
Class Action Waiver.</strong> In the interest of resolving disputes between you and NerdWallet in the most expedient and cost-effective manner, you and NerdWallet agree to resolve disputes through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction (“Agreement to Arbitrate”).
Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.
Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts.
Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.
Any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual basis.
class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.
You acknowledge and agree that the arbitrator may award relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that individual party’s claim(s).
Any relief awarded cannot affect other users.</p>
<p>
<strong>YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND NERDWALLET ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<u>a) Claims To Be Resolved By Binding Arbitration</u>.
You and NerdWallet agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us.
This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted.
It includes, but is not limited to: claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory.
claims that arose before this or any prior Terms.
claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class.
and claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms.</p>
<p>
<u>b) Exceptions</u>.
Notwithstanding Section 12(A), you and NerdWallet agree that no statement herein shall be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either party’s right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court.
(ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available.
(iii) seek injunctive relief in any competent court of law.
or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.</p>
<p>
<u>c) Arbitrator</u>.
Any arbitration between you and NerdWallet will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA.
The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting NerdWallet.</p>
<p>
<u>d) Notice and Process</u>.
A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”).
The Notice to NerdWallet should be addressed to: NerdWallet, Inc., 55 Hawthorne St, 11th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94105 (“Notice Address”).
The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.
and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”).
If you and NerdWallet do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or NerdWallet may commence an arbitration proceeding.</p>
<p>
<u>e) Fees</u>.
In the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, NerdWallet will, at your request, reimburse you for your payment of the arbitration filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by the AAA Rules.
Any request for payment of fees by NerdWallet should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and NerdWallet will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA.
In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), you agree to reimburse NerdWallet for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by NerdWallet on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA’s rules.</p>
<p>If your claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.
Any in-person arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in San Francisco County, California.
Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.
The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.</p>
<p>
<u>f) No Class Actions.</u> Unless both you and NerdWallet agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<u>YOU AND NERDWALLET AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</u>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<u>g) Opt-Out.</u> If you are a new NerdWallet user, you can choose to reject the arbitration agreement contained in this Section 12 (“opt-out”) by mailing us a written opt-out notice (“Opt-Out Notice”).
The Opt-Out Notice must be postmarked no later than thirty (30) days after the date you accept these Terms for the first time.
You must mail the Opt-Out Notice to the Notice Address listed in Section 12(D), above.</p>
<p>The Opt-Out Notice must contain your name, address (including street address, city, state and zip code), and the user name(s) and email address(es) associated with the NerdWallet account(s) to which the opt-out applies.
You must sign the Opt-Out Notice for it to be effective.
This procedure is the only way you can opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate.
If you opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate, all other parts of the Terms will continue to apply to you.
Opting out of this Agreement to Arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with NerdWallet.</p>
<p>
<u>h) Modifications.</u> If NerdWallet makes any future change to this Agreement to Arbitrate (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the Notice Address provided above.
You acknowledge and agree that, in the event you reject any future change, your account with NerdWallet shall be immediately terminated and you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision.</p>
<p>
<u>i) Severability and Enforceability</u>.
If an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this Section 12 is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Section 12 shall still apply.
If the entirety of this Section 12 is found to be unenforceable, then the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 11 shall govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms, and that the remainder of the Terms will continue to apply.</p>
<p>13.
<strong> Modification of the Services.</strong> NerdWallet reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, some or all of the Services at any time without any notice or further obligation to you.
You agree that NerdWallet will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of any of the Services.</p>
<p>14.
<strong>General.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<u>a) Entire Agreement</u>.
These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and NerdWallet regarding your use of and access to the Services, and except as expressly permitted above may only be amended by a written agreement signed by authorized representatives of the parties.</p>
<p>
<u>b) No Waiver</u>.
The failure to require performance of any provision shall not affect our right to require performance at any time thereafter, nor shall a waiver of any breach or default of the Terms constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself.</p>
<p>
<u>c) Paragraph Headers</u>.
Use of paragraph headers in the Terms is for convenience only and shall not have any impact on the interpretation of particular provisions.</p>
<p>
<u>d) Severability</u>.
In the event that any part of the Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part shall be given effect to the greatest extent possible and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p>
<u>e) Partner Terms</u>.
In some instances, NerdWallet’s third party partners require that NerdWallet users agree to be bound by some additional terms of use that are specific to particular products or services (“Partner Terms”).
