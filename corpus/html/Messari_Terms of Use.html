<b>CLASS ACTION AND ARBITRATION</b>
</p>
<p>16.1.&nbsp;&nbsp.
<u>Notice</u>.
THIS SECTION CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND
CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS ABOUT HOW TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE
WITH US.
Except if you opt-out as expressly permitted below, or except to the
extent contrary to applicable law ("Excluded Disputes"), you hereby
agree that all disputes between you and us (whether or not such dispute
involves a third party) with regard to your relationship with us, including,
without limitation, disputes related to these Terms of Use, your use of the Service,
and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, may, in our discretion, be resolved
by binding, individual arbitration under the American Arbitration Association's
rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes, and you hereby expressly
waive trial by jury.
As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local
"small claims" court, if permitted by that small claims court's
rules.
You may bring claims only on your own behalf.
You agree that you will
not participate in any class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims
covered by this Agreement.
You also agree not to participate in claims brought
in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated
claims involving another person's account, if we are a party to the proceeding.
This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the U.S.
Federal
Arbitration Act, to the extent permissible.
In the event the American
Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within 160
days of filing the case, then either we or you can elect to have the
arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation
Services (JAMS).
Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be
entered in any court having competent jurisdiction.
Any provision of applicable
law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages,
remedies, or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use.<b>
</b>
</p>
<p>16.2.&nbsp;&nbsp.
<u>Opt Out</u>.&nbsp.
You may opt out of
this agreement to arbitrate.
If you do so, neither you nor we can require the
other to participate in an arbitration proceeding.
To opt out, you must notify
us in writing within 30 days of the date that you first became subject to this
arbitration provision.
You must use this address to opt out: admin@messari.io.
You must include your name and residence address, the
email address you use for your account with us, and a clear statement that you
want to opt out of this arbitration agreement.
If and to the extent the
prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third
parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then such preceding
language in this Arbitration section will be null and void.
This arbitration
agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with us.<b>
