</ul> Introduction&nbsp.
<p>Guilded was founded with one humble goal&nbsp;<em>—</em> to connect gaming communities.
In pursuit of this goal, we've developed a host of features for your community to chat, organize, share content, recruit, and compete with one another.</p>
<p>We recognize that for communities to flourish, players need to be both empowered to express themselves while also feeling safe and free from abuse.
To that end, we've drafted a series of Community Guidelines to help communicate how the policies established in our<strong> Terms of Use</strong> affect our users and servers, and how we can promote diverse conversations across our communities.&nbsp.
&nbsp;</p>
&nbsp.
Guidelines
<p>In order to provide a safe and fair environment for our users, some content and activity is not permitted on our services.
Content and activity that is not tolerated broadly fall into four categories: 1.
Violence and harassment, 2.
Objectionable content, 3.
Criminal behavior, and 4.
Hacking and cheating.
In addition, all publicly visible content, including but not limited to profile pictures, banners, team logos, profile posts, and public channel content, must be suitable for ages 13 and up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
