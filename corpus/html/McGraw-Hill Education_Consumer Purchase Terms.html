<strong>PRODUCT SUBSCRIPTIONS AND AUTO-RENEWALS.</strong>
<p>McGraw Hill offers a variety of Products, including software and services such as ALEKS Independent Use, on a subscription basis subject to auto-renewal.
This means that your subscription will automatically renew for a given term as communicated to you in the manner described below without any further action taken by you.
Auto-renewal ensures continued access to your Product until you cancel your subscription, with no need to keep track of renewal dates.
Subscription periods shall commence upon the date of your order of the applicable Product.
We will automatically renew your subscription on the applicable renewal dates presented to you on the Product checkout page and set forth in your Order Confirmation, using the payment method you used to pay for the initial subscription, until you cancel your subscription.
You must cancel your subscription before it automatically renews at the end of the then-current subscription period (or free trial if applicable) in order to avoid renewal charges.
Subscription fees are subject to change, and you will be charged at the then-current published subscription fee for your term.
You will be notified in advance of any changed subscription fees and will be provided the opportunity to cancel prior to your subscription automatically renewing at the new price.
Your access is conditioned upon timely payment of the applicable subscription fee.
You will not have access to the relevant subscription Product beyond your then-current paid period if your subscription is cancelled, allowed to lapse, or terminated for non-payment.
YOU MAY BE SUBJECT TO TERMINATION FEES FOR CANCELLATION OF SUBSCRIPTIONS DURING THE TERM.</p>
<p>You may cancel your subscription for a Product by following the directions for cancellation in your Order Confirmation or by signing into your account for that Product, visiting your account information page, and following the instructions for cancellation or opt out for auto-renewal, or by contacting Customer Service.
You may cancel a subscription at any time, but the cancellation will only become effective at the end of your current billing period (or free trial if applicable).
<strong>We do not offer refunds or credits if you cancel your subscription after your new billing cycle began.</strong> If you cancel your subscription in the middle of a billing cycle, you will not receive a refund of any prepaid subscription fees.
Cancellation will only take effect at the end of your current billing period (or free trial if applicable) and we will allow you to access the relevant subscription Product until your most recently paid-up subscription period ends, unless a specific subscription Product offers a different policy.</p>
<p>Please review your Order Confirmation for additional auto-renewal terms for your specific Product subscription, including renewal dates, cancellation methods, and any fees, such as early termination fees, that may apply in some circumstances for some subscriptions.</p>

By using Third-Party Services, you release and hold us harmless from any and all liability arising from your use of any such Third-Party Service.
If there is a dispute between users, or between users and any third party in relation to a Third-Party Service, we are under no obligation to become involved.</p>

<strong>DISPUTE RESOLUTION, BINDING ARBITRATION, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</strong>
<p>
<em>GOVERNING LAW</em>.
These Consumer Purchase Terms and the relationship between you and McGraw Hill will be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
<p>
<em>ARBITRATION</em>.
You and McGraw Hill agree to submit to the personal and exclusive arbitration of any disputes relating to your use of the Products under the rules of the American Arbitration Association Rules for Arbitration of Consumer-Related Disputes, except with respect to disputes arising out of (i) violations of our intellectual property rights or (ii) individual claims made in small claims court.
Any such arbitration will be conducted in New York County in the State of New York.
You covenant not to sue McGraw Hill in any other forum.
Discovery and rights to appeal in arbitration are generally more limited than in a lawsuit, and other rights that you and we would have in court may not be available in arbitration.</p>
<p>
<em>CLASS ACTION WAIVER</em>.
You agree that (i) no arbitration proceeding hereunder shall be certified as a class action or proceed as a class action, or on a basis involving claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, other customers or potential customers.
and (ii) no arbitration proceeding hereunder shall be consolidated with, or joined in any way with, any other arbitration proceeding.</p>
<p>You also acknowledge and understand that, with respect to any dispute arising out of or relating to your use and purchase of Products, or these Consumer Purchase Terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO PURSUE YOUR RIGHTS IN COURT;</li>
<li>YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO SERVE AS A REPRESENTATIVE, AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR IN ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS OF CLAIMANTS, IN ANY LAWSUIT OR ARBITRATION INVOLVING ANY SUCH DISPUTE.
AND</li>
<li>YOU MUST FILE ANY CLAIM WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER SUCH CLAIM AROSE OR IT IS FOREVER BARRED.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights, we may seek injunctive or other appropriate relief in any state or federal court in the State of New York.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and not by any state law concerning arbitration.
Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies, or awards that conflict with these Consumer Purchase Terms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>FORCE MAJEURE.</strong>
<p>We will not be liable or responsible to you, nor be deemed to have defaulted or breached these Consumer Purchase Terms, for any failure or delay in our performance (including a delay in shipment or delivery of Products to you) under these Consumer Purchase Terms when and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by or results from acts or circumstances beyond our reasonable control, including, without limitation, acts of God, flood, fire, earthquake, explosion, governmental actions, war, invasion or hostilities (whether war is declared or not), terrorist threats or acts, riot or other civil unrest, national emergency, revolution, insurrection, epidemic, pandemic, quarantines, lockdowns, lockouts, strikes or other labor disputes (whether or not relating to our workforce), restraints or delays affecting carriers, inability or delay in obtaining supplies of adequate or suitable materials, or telecommunication breakdown or power outage.</p>
