<p>Do Not Track</p>
<p>Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and
Chrome) incorporate a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) or similar feature that
signals to websites that a user does not want to have his or her online
activity and behavior tracked.
If a website that responds to a
particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the browser can block
that website from collecting certain information about the browser’s
user.
Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet
uniform.
For this reason, many website operators, including this picoCTF
website, do not respond to DNT signals.</p> CHILDREN’S PRIVACY <p>IF YOU ARE UNDER THE AGE OF 13, DO NOT USE THE SERVICES.</p>

years old.
Consistent with the requirements of the U.S.
Children’s
Online Privacy Protection Act, if we learn that we received any

parent’s verified consent, we will use that information only to inform
the child (or his or her parent or legal guardian) that he or she cannot
use the Services.</p>

<p>If you reside within the EU, you have the right to lodge a complaint
with a Data Protection Authority about how we process your personal data
at the following website:
https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en.</p>
<p>
<em>Processing EU Personal Data</em>
</p>
<p>In the event that your personal data is subject to the GDPR, we will
only use your personal data for the original purpose for which we
collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for
another purpose and that purpose is compatible with the original
purpose.
If we need to use your EU personal data for an unrelated
purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which
allows us to do so.
We require third parties to only use your EU
personal data for the specific purpose for which it was given to us and
to protect the privacy of your personal data.
If your personal data is
no longer necessary for the legal or business purposes for which it is
processed, we will generally destroy or anonymize that data.</p>
<p>
<em>International Transfers of Personal Data</em>
</p>
<p>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EU, we ensure a
similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one
of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>European Commission Standard Contractual Clauses: We may use
specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give
personal data the same protection it has in the EU.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Privacy Shield.
Where we use providers based in the US, we may
transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which
requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared
between the Europe and the US.</p>
</li>
</ul>

personal data, please contact our Data Protection Officer at
