and how you can manage the way information about you is handled.</p>

Where does ZoomInfo get the Business Information for its Public Profiles?
<p>ZoomInfo creates profiles of business people and companies, which we call “Public Profiles,” from different sources.
Once we have collected Business Information about a person or company, we combine multiple mentions of the same person or company into a Public Profile.
The resulting directory of Public Profiles (the “Directory”) is then made available to the users of the Site and our customers and strategic partners.</p>
<p>ZoomInfo obtains the data for its Public Profiles in several ways including:</p>
<ol>
<li>Our search technology scans the web and gathers publicly-available Information.</li>
<li>We license Information from other companies.</li>
<li>Users contribute Business Information about themselves or other people and companies.
(See “ZoomInfo Contact Contributor,” below)</li>
<li>Through market research surveys and phone interviews conducted by our in-house research team.</li>
</ol>
<strong>How does the ZoomInfo Community and the ZoomInfo Contact Contributor Work?</strong>
<p>ZoomInfo offers a service called ZoomInfo Community.
To subscribe to ZoomInfo Community, you are required to install software offered on the Site, known as the ZoomInfo Contact Contributor (the “Software”) or otherwise provide ZoomInfo with access to your email account.
When you subscribe to ZoomInfo Community, you allow ZoomInfo to access certain Business Information stored by the application that your computer uses to manage your email and contacts, known as an “email client” (e.g., Microsoft Outlook) or stored by a provider of cloud services for email (e.g.
Google Apps).
If required to access this Business Information stored on your computer’s email and contact application(s), you may need to provide ZoomInfo with the necessary username and password information.
We use this Business Information to improve the size and quality of our Directory.
In exchange for allowing this access, you receive a subscription to ZoomInfo Community at no charge under specified terms and conditions (available at&nbsp;/about-zoominfo/ce-terms-conditions).</p>
<p>From the contacts within your email client and “signatures” within email messages, we collect the following Business Information, if available, for each person:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name</li>

<ul>
<li>The date the email message was sent or received</li>
<li>Email addresses, names and job titles of recipients and senders</li>
</ul>
<p>To ensure the integrity of the Directory, we take the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business Information Only – ZoomInfo only wants business-related information.
Therefore, any contacts that have an address from a consumer-oriented service such as Gmail, Hotmail or Yahoo are disregarded.</li>
<li>Unattributed – We do not disclose who contributed particular Information using the ZoomInfo Contact Contributor software or other contribution methods.
(The only exceptions: See “Disclosures to Service Providers,” “Disclosures for Legal Reasons,” and “Disclosures to a Buyer of the Company,” below.)</li>
<li>Opt Out – Anyone added to the Directory may request to be removed at any time, via email, web or a toll-free number.
We promptly honor such requests.</li>
</ul>

our technology automatically extracts from the messages only the data we describe in this Policy.
We do not collect data from custom fields or notes in your email client.</p>
<p>Information from your email client will continue to be shared as described above as long as the Software remains installed.
