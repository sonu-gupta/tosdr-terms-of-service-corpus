<p> Presearch.org Global Limited ("Presearch") offers a search tool that enables you to easily search other existing search engines and be rewarded.
</p>
<p> By using Presearch, you agree to the terms and conditions (the "Terms") outlined below, as well as any future revisions to the Terms, which will be posted in the changelog at the bottom of this document, and which we will notify registered Members of via email or site notification.
</p> Use of Services <p> Presearch, its subsidiaries, and affiliated organizations offer services to you provided that you are of legal age to form a binding contract and are not a person barred from receiving services under the laws of Canada or other applicable jurisdiction.
In order to access certain services, you may be required to provide current, accurate contact, and other information as part of the registration process and/or continued use of Presearch services.
You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account password, and are responsible for all activities that occur under your account.
You agree to immediately notify Presearch of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security.
Presearch cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to provide us with accurate information or to keep your password secure.
</p> Conduct <p> You understand that all information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, video, messages or other materials ("Content") are the sole responsibility of the person from which such Content originated.
Presearch reserves the right, but shall have no obligation, to pre-screen, flag, filter, refuse, modify or move any Content available via Presearch services.
You understand that by using Presearch services you may be exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent, or objectionable, and that you use Presearch services at your own risk.
</p>
<p> You agree that you are responsible for your own conduct and any Content that you create, transmit, or display while using Presearch services and for any consequences thereof.
You agree to use Presearch services only for purposes that are legal, proper, and in accordance with the Terms and any applicable policies or guidelines.
You agree that you will not engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts Presearch services or servers or networks connected to Presearch services.
</p> Fraud and Abuse <p> Presearch offers Members rewards for using the service, namely, Presearch Tokens ("PRE") in exchange for searching, engaging with sponsored content, and choosing specific paid search resources.
As such, these incentive mechanisms are potentially subject to attempted fraud and abuse, and therefore, to protect the project and its Members, fraud, and abuse of any sort will absolutely not be tolerated.
In the event that Presearch detects fraud or abuse on your part, we reserve the right to terminate your account and cancel any rewards provided.
Additionally, we may take steps to further prevent you from using the service, and we also reserve the right to prosecute you for fraudulent activity.
Abuse is defined as intentionally attempting to earn additional rewards that you would not earn under regular use.
For example, running automated programs or bots designed to earn rewards, doing searches more frequently than you would under normal circumstances in an attempt to earn rewards beyond those which would typically be provided, or creating multiple accounts to bypass account limits and restrictions.
There is an automated anti-abuse system in place that analyzes your search behaviour on an ongoing basis to determine whether you are abusing the reward system.
You will be assigned a PRE Level between 0 and 10, which will affect the rewards that you are able to withdraw from the system.
</p> Rewards and Withdrawals <p> Before a Presearch Member can use their Presearch Reward Tokens or withdraw them to the Presearch blockchain, Tokens must be verified and marked as Eligible for withdrawal.
</p>
<p> The percentage of your Reward Tokens that are eligible for withdrawal will correspond to your PRE Level and are called 'Eligible Tokens': </p> PRE Level Eligible Tokens Level 8-10: 100% of Reward Tokens Level 7: 70% Level 6: 60% Level 5: 50% Level 4: 40% Level 3: 30% Level 2: 20% Level 1: 10% Level 0: None - account suspended <p> In order to initiate a withdrawal of PRE Tokens to a blockchain address, all Members must first have more than 1,000 Eligible Tokens and supply an ERC20-compatible wallet address.
</p>
<p> Withdrawals can currently only be done in batches of 1,000 tokens.
This means that you will only be able to withdraw 1,000 tokens to start.
This is done to protect the project from significant Ethereum Gas costs generated by processing many smaller transactions.
You will be able to withdraw up to 1,000 tokens every 90 days, unless otherwise approved.
</p>
<p> Once a withdrawal request is initiated, it will need to be approved by a Presearch administrator.
If a request has been issued or otherwise allowed due to a system error or malicious activity, Presearch reserves the right to block a request at the approval stage.
Presearch endeavours to approve all legitimate requests within 3 business days.
If your request is initially denied for any reason, you will be notified by a message on the site and will be directed to contact support@presearch.io.
</p>
<p> You may be limited to a certain number of withdrawals in a certain period of time, or a certain number of tokens at a single time or in a period of time.
This number may change based on your PRE Level or on the needs of the project.
</p>
<p> If your account is left dormant for more than one year, meaning that you do not login or record a search for 365 days, Presearch reserves the right to rescind any reward tokens in your account.
That does not necessarily mean it will be done, but that the right is there.
This does not apply to tokens that have been purchased.
</p> Privacy Policy <p> Presearch takes your privacy very seriously.
