<br>
</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;<u>Changes.</u>&nbsp;Changes in the industry, carrier and other partner requirements, applicable law and regulations may require Vonage to make changes to the Services from time to time.
It is Customer’s responsibility to ensure that its usage is compatible with the then-current Services.
Vonage endeavors to maintain backward compatibility, but where it cannot, it will make commercially reasonable efforts to provide at least 60 days’ notice prior to implementing changes that do not maintain backward compatibility.

<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;<u>Telephone Numbers.</u>&nbsp;Customer acknowledges and agrees that its use of the Services or any of the telephone numbers that Vonage may provide in connection with use of the Services do not grant Customer any ownership or other rights in the telephone number other than the limited, revocable use rights expressly set forth in this Agreement.
Customer does not have the right to use those telephone numbers indefinitely.
Customer acknowledges and agrees that telephone numbers which Vonage provisions may be reclaimed by Vonage or the applicable supplier from time to time during the Term, and may be re-assigned to other customers after the Term.
Vonage reserves the right to reclaim any phone number from Customer’s Account if Customer does not send sufficient traffic over that phone number such that the phone number is unutilized or underutilized, as defined by any local, federal, and/or national regulatory agency and/or governmental organization with oversight over the relevant phone number and numbering plan.

</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;<u>Paid Services.</u>&nbsp;Customer agrees to pay for its use of the Services as set forth on the pricing page on the Site, as may be updated from time to time, except and only to the extent Customer has entered a separate written agreement or addendum with Vonage for special pricing on certain Services and/or country-specific pricing, or Vonage has otherwise conveyed special pricing in writing to Customer.
Vonage reserves the right to change pricing from time to time.
Customer’s continued use of the Services after a price change becomes effective constitutes Customer’s agreement to pay the changed amount.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;<u>Prepayment.</u>&nbsp;Except as set forth in the next sub-section, Customer shall pay in advance for the Services in the currency specified by Vonage, without the right of set-off, deductions, or counterclaim.
Some of the Services may accept recurring period charges as agreed to by Customer on the Site.
By choosing such auto-reload payment plan, Customer acknowledges that such Services have a recurring payment feature and Customer accepts responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation.
VONAGE MAY SUBMIT PERIODIC CHARGES (E.G., MONTHLY) WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM CUSTOMER, UNTIL CUSTOMER PROVIDES PRIOR NOTICE (RECEIPT OF WHICH IS CONFIRMED BY VONAGE) THAT CUSTOMER HAS TERMINATED THIS AUTHORIZATION OR WISHES TO CHANGE ITS PAYMENT METHOD.
SUCH NOTICE WILL NOT AFFECT CHARGES SUBMITTED BEFORE VONAGE REASONABLY COULD ACT.&nbsp;CUSTOMER MUST PROVIDE CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE INFORMATION FOR ITS BILLING ACCOUNT.
IF CUSTOMER HAS REQUESTED AUTO-RELOAD PAYMENTS, CUSTOMER MUST PROMPTLY UPDATE ALL INFORMATION TO KEEP ITS BILLING ACCOUNT CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE (SUCH AS A CHANGE IN BILLING ADDRESS, CREDIT CARD NUMBER, OR CREDIT CARD EXPIRATION DATE), AND CUSTOMER MUST PROMPTLY NOTIFY VONAGE OR ITS PAYMENT PROCESSOR IF CUSTOMER’S PAYMENT METHOD IS CANCELED (E.G., FOR LOSS OR THEFT) OR IF CUSTOMER BECOMES AWARE OF A POTENTIAL BREACH OF SECURITY, SUCH AS THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR USE OF CUSTOMER’S USER NAME OR PASSWORD.
CHANGES TO SUCH INFORMATION CAN BE MADE IN&nbsp;THE ACCOUNT DASHBOARD.
IF CUSTOMER FAILS TO PROVIDE ANY OF THE FOREGOING INFORMATION, CUSTOMER AGREES THAT VONAGE MAY CONTINUE CHARGING CUSTOMER FOR ANY USE OF PAID SERVICES UNDER THE BILLING ACCOUNT UNLESS CUSTOMER HAS CANCELLED AUTO-RELOAD OR TERMINATED ITS PAID SERVICES AS SET FORTH ABOVE.
Customer may change its payment method or terminate any auto-reload authorization via the Account dashboard.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;<u>Post-payment.</u>&nbsp;Where authorized by Vonage in writing, Vonage will invoice Customer for the Services monthly in arrears, and payment shall be due 30 days following the date of invoice, without deduction.
Invoices may be sent to the e-mail address specified in Customer’s Account, and shall be deemed received on the date sent.
Customer shall pay interest on past due amounts at a rate of 1.5% per month or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is less, and shall be responsible for all costs of collection.
If Customer disputes any invoiced charges exceeding EUR 1,000 in a detailed writing provided to Vonage, and such disputes are reasonable and made in good faith (as reasonably determined by Vonage), then (i) the Parties shall discuss and attempt to resolve the dispute in good faith in a timely manner, and (ii) Customer may withhold the disputed portion of the invoice exceeding EUR 1,000 if Customer has paid the undisputed portion of the invoice in accordance with the Agreement, until the dispute is resolved.
Customer’s credit shall be limited to the amount indicated by Vonage from time-to-time in connection with Customer’s Account.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;<u>Taxes.</u>&nbsp;Unless otherwise provided on the pricing page on the Site, all charges and fees for the Services are exclusive of any country, province, federal, state or local taxes, including without limitation, use, sales, value-added, privilege, or other taxes, levies, imports, duties, fees, surcharges, governmental assessments and withholdings (“Taxes”).
Customer will be solely liable for and will pay upon demand all Taxes associated with Customer’s access to and use of the Services and shall not deduct any such amounts, or any other withholdings, set-offs or deductions, from amounts Customer owes Vonage, but will not be responsible for taxes based on Vonage’s net income.
Customer may present Vonage with an exemption certificate eliminating Customer’s and Vonage’s liability to pay certain Taxes.
Once Vonage has received and approved the exemption certificate, Customer shall be exempt from those Taxes on a going-forward basis.
If, a taxing jurisdiction determines that Customer is not exempt from Taxes and assesses those taxes, Customer shall pay those Taxes to Vonage, plus any applicable interest or penalties.
SUCH NOTICE WILL NOT AFFECT CHARGES SUBMITTED BEFORE VONAGE REASONABLY COULD ACT.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>e.&nbsp;<u>Billing Disputes.</u>
</p>
<p>Billing disputes must be initiated within 30 days of the date the Service was provided, by contacting Vonage at&nbsp;billing@nexmo.com.
Upon expiration of such 30-day period, Customer will not be entitled to dispute any fees paid or payable to Vonage.
The Parties will work together in good faith to resolve billing disputes.
A pending billing dispute shall not exempt Customer from timely paying any undisputed amounts owed.
Any disputes that cannot be resolved in accordance with the foregoing shall be handled in accordance with Section 13 below.
Other than in accordance with the foregoing, fees paid are non-refundable.</p>

</p>
<p>
<strong>13.&nbsp;Arbitration and Dispute Resolution.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;<u>Management Resolution.</u>&nbsp;In the event either Party has a dispute or claim against the other Party (except with respect to billing disputes), the disputing Party shall provide written notice to the other Party.
The Parties agree to escalate disputes to their respective management, who will use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve the dispute by consulting with each other in good faith to reach an equitable resolution satisfactory to both Parties within 30 calendar days of the receipt of notice.
Neither Party shall pursue or commence proceedings regarding the dispute in any court, administrative arbitral or other adjudicative body prior to engaging in such consultations and negotiations.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;<u>Binding Arbitration.</u>&nbsp;If negotiations fail to resolve the dispute within 30 calendar days, and/or small claims court is not a valid option due to the size or nature of the claim, all disputed claims (except for claims relating to intellectual property rights, indemnity, or confidentiality obligations, fraudulent or unauthorized use, theft, or piracy of service, or matters relating to injunctions or other equitable relief) must be resolved by binding arbitration before a single arbitrator, in the English language.
This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be given the broadest possible meaning under applicable law.
The initiation of an arbitration dispute shall not otherwise prevent Vonage or Customer from terminating Services in accordance with the Agreement.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;<u>Location and Procedure.</u>&nbsp;A Party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other Party a written notice of dispute, which must describe the nature and basis of the dispute and set forth the specific relief sought.
The location of arbitration will be in New York, New York, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, and this dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and not by any state or national law concerning arbitration.
The amount of any settlement offer made by Customer or Vonage shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which Customer or Vonage is entitled.
Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction.
Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with this Agreement.
The prevailing Party in any action or proceeding to enforce this Agreement shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;<u>Jury Trial and Class Action Waiver.</u>&nbsp;Each Party waives its right to a trial by jury for claims subject to arbitration hereunder.
The arbitrator may award relief only in favor of the individual Party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that Party's individual claim.
The arbitrator may not award special, indirect, punitive, incidental or consequential damages.
CUSTOMER MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST VONAGE ONLY IN CUSTOMER’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING AND CUSTOMER EXPRESSLY WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO BRING A CLASS ACTION SUIT.
The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's or entity's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>e.&nbsp;<u>Equitable Relief.</u>&nbsp;Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party shall be entitled to enforce its intellectual property rights and seek equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction at any time.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>14.&nbsp;Miscellaneous.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;<u>Entire Agreement.
Headings.</u>&nbsp;This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Customer and Vonage with respect to the Site and Services, and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between Customer and Vonage with respect thereto.
The section and paragraph headings in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect their interpretation.
No oral or written information or advice given by Vonage or its employees and other representatives will create any obligations or warranty on behalf of Vonage unless otherwise agreed in a writing signed by an authorized Vonage representative.
Any purchase orders, confirmations, payment documentation, or other terms provided by Customer, even if signed by the Parties after the date hereof, shall have no force or effect.
In the event that the Parties have executed versions of this Agreement drafted in more than one language, the English language version shall govern and prevail.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;<u>Modifications/Waivers.</u>&nbsp;Except as expressly provided elsewhere in this Agreement, this Agreement may not be changed or modified, nor may any provisions hereof be waived, nor may any consent or confirmation be considered to have been given, except by an agreement in writing signed by the Party against whom enforcement of the change or modification is asserted, and any such modification, change, waiver, consent or confirmation on Vonage’s behalf may only be given by an authorized signatory of Vonage.
The failure of either Party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;<u>Severability.</u>&nbsp;If any provision of this Agreement, or any part of such provision, is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be (to the minimum extent necessary) replaced by a valid and enforceable provision the effect of which comes as close as possible to the intended economic effect of the unenforceable or invalid provision, so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;<u>Force Majeure.</u>&nbsp;Neither Party is liable for any failure of performance (other than for delay or performance in the payment of money due and payable hereunder) to the extent such failure is due to any cause or causes beyond such Party’s reasonable control, including acts of God, fire, explosion, vandalism, cable cut, adverse weather conditions, governmental action, acts of terrorism, strikes and similar labor difficulties, war, sabotage, outages of third party connections, utilities, or telecommunications networks, including, without limitation, carrier-related problems or issues, internet-access issues, denial of service attacks, shortage or unavailability of supplies, and other mechanical, electronic or communications failures or degradation.
Either Party’s invocation of this clause will not relieve Customer of its obligation to pay for any Services actually provided or permit Customer to terminate any Services except as expressly provided herein.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>e.&nbsp;<u>Notices.</u>&nbsp;Customer hereby authorizes Vonage to send notices to Customer relating to this Agreement (e.g., Service updates, notices of breach and/or suspension) via email to the email address Customer provides to Vonage in Customer’s Account, in addition to the other means and methods set forth in this Agreement.
It is Customer’s responsibility to keep Customer’s email address current, and Customer will be deemed to have received any email sent to the last known email address Vonage has on record for Customer.
Notices that Vonage sends to Customer via email will be deemed effective upon Vonage’s sending of the email.
Notices provided to Vonage under this Agreement shall be sent to the attention of Customer’s account manager, with a copy sent to the following address with respect to any legal matters, at:</p>
<p>

<p>legaldept@vonage.com</p>
<p>

<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>f.&nbsp;<u>Relationship of the Parties.</u>&nbsp;The relationship of the Parties shall not be that of partners, agents or joint venturers for one another, and nothing contained in the Agreement shall be deemed to constitute a partnership or agency agreement between the Parties for any purpose.
Vonage and Customer shall be independent Parties and shall discharge their contractual obligations at their own risk subject to the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>g.&nbsp;<u>Assignment.</u>&nbsp;This Agreement inures to and is binding upon the Parties’ successors and permitted assignees.
Customer shall not assign this Agreement without Vonage’s prior written consent.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>h.&nbsp;<u>Export Controls.</u>&nbsp;By using the Services, Customer represents and warrants that (i) its use of the Services will not violate any embargoes, sanctions, trade restrictions or similar restrictions issued by any applicable governmental entity, and (ii) Customer, its Affiliates, and its End Users have not been designated by any applicable government or any government agency as a prohibited or restricted party under any trade restrictions, export laws or the like.
Customer also will not use the Site or Services for any purpose prohibited by applicable law, including the development, design, manufacture or production of missiles, or nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.
Customer may not use, export, re-export, import, or transfer any technology or data related to the Services except as authorized by both this Agreement and all applicable laws, rules and regulations.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>i.&nbsp;<u>Government Terms.</u>&nbsp;If Customer (or its End Users) is an agency, department or other entity of any government, then any use, modification, duplication, reproduction, release, performance, display, transfer or disclosure of the Services and accompanying documentation shall be governed solely by this Agreement.
Any other use shall be prohibited and no other rights are granted.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>15.&nbsp;Terms Applicable to EU Residents.</strong>
</p>
<p>The terms and conditions in this Section shall apply only to Customers who reside in the European Union, and notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;Customer shall ensure that Vonage is enabled to use all Customer data (including Application Content) necessary to provide the Services.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;The primary characteristics of the Services will remain available to Customer during the term of this Agreement.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;For Customers who reside in Germany, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in general, warranty rights with regards to the Services are ruled by statutory law.
However, liability without fault for initial defects is excluded.
The liability with fault remains unchanged.
In assessing whether or not Vonage is in fault Customer acknowledges that software cannot actually be without defect.
Deficiencies can be cured at Vonage’s discretion either by rectification or replacement delivery.
Customer is only entitled to a termination according to statutory law due to the failure to grant use in accordance with the Agreement if Vonage has been given sufficient opportunity to rectify the deficiency and such attempt has failed.
Vonage does not warrant internet access for Customer, especially the availability or volume of internet access.
Customer is solely responsible for its access to the internet until the point where Services are handed over by Vonage.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;Notwithstanding Section 3(d), Customer will have a reasonable period from the date of any charge to dispute such charge.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>e.&nbsp;As to non-German Customers who reside in the EU, notwithstanding Section 11, the following shall apply in relation to the limitation of liability:</p>
<p>i.&nbsp;The Parties shall only be fully liable for intent and gross negligence as well as damages caused by injury to life, body or health;</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>ii.&nbsp;In an event of slight negligence, the Parties shall be liable only for breaches of a material contractual obligation (cardinal duty).
A “cardinal duty” in the sense of this provision is an obligation whose fulfillment makes the processing of this Agreement possible in the first place and on the fulfillment of which the other Party may therefore generally rely;</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>iii.&nbsp;In any of the above mentioned cases, the Parties shall not be liable for any lack of commercial success, lost profits and indirect damages;</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>iv.&nbsp;Liability in accordance with the above clauses shall be limited to the typical, foreseeable damages: and</p>
<p>v.&nbsp;Except where otherwise stated in this Agreement, the Parties shall not be liable for any loss or damage or any costs, expenses or other claims including without limitation loss of profit, business, revenue, goodwill or anticipated savings, loss of any data or information and/or special or indirect loss or consequential loss or otherwise which arise out of or in connection with this Agreement.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>f.&nbsp;As to German Customers, notwithstanding Section 11, the following shall apply in relation to the limitation of liability:</p>
<p>i.&nbsp;The liability of Vonage is unlimited for damages arising out of death, injury to body or health based on a breach conducted by a legal representative or designated agent of Vonage, as well as for damages that arise from the lack of a guaranteed characteristic or in case of fraudulent intent;</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>ii.&nbsp;The liability of Vonage is unlimited for damages caused by Vonage, a legal representative, or designated agent by intent or gross negligence;</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>iii.&nbsp;In case of a slight negligent breach of a contractual core duty Vonage shall, except in the cases pursuant to (i) and (iv), only be liable to the amount of the typically foreseeable damage.
Contractual core duties abstractly are such duties whose accomplishment enables proper fulfilment of the contract in the first place and whose accomplishment a contractual party regularly may rely on;</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>iv.&nbsp;Liability pursuant to the German Product Liability Act remains unaffected;</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>v.&nbsp;The limitation period for claims for damages shall be one (1) year, except in the case of (i), (ii) and (iv) above, where the statutory statute of limitations shall apply.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>vi.&nbsp;Insofar as telecommunication services are affected, Vonage shall, except in cases pursuant (i) and (iv) above, in cases of slight negligent breach of a contract only be liable for an amount that does not exceed EUR 12,500 vis-à-vis Customer and vis-à-vis all damaged parties an amount that does not exceed EUR 10,000,000 per damaging event.
If, in the latter case, the compensation exceeds the said maximum amount payable to several parties due to the same event, the compensation shall be reduced in proportion to the ratio between the total claims for damages and the upper limit.</p>
