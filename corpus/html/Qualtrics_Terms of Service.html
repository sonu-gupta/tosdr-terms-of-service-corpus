<strong>Appropriate Technical and Organizational Measures.</strong> Qualtrics has implemented and will apply the technical and organizational measures set forth in Appendix 2.
Customer has reviewed such measures and agrees that as to the Cloud Service selected by Customer in the Order Form the measures are appropriate taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing of Personal Data.</li>
<li>
<strong>Changes.</strong> Qualtrics applies the technical and organizational measures set forth in Appendix 2 to Qualtrics’ entire customer base hosted out of the same Data Center and receiving the same Cloud Service.
Qualtrics may change the measures set out in Appendix 2 at any time without notice so long as it maintains a comparable or better level of security.
Individual measures may be replaced by new measures that serve the same purpose without diminishing the security level protecting Personal Data.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<strong>QUALTRICS OBLIGATIONS</strong>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Instructions from Customer.</strong> Qualtrics will process Personal Data only in accordance with documented instructions from Customer.
The Agreement (including this DPA) constitutes such documented initial instructions and each use of the Cloud Service then constitutes further instructions.
Qualtrics will use reasonable efforts to follow any other Customer instructions, as long as they are required by Data Protection Law, technically feasible and do not require changes to the Cloud Service.
If any of the before-mentioned exceptions apply, or Qualtrics otherwise cannot comply with an instruction or is of the opinion that an instruction infringes Data Protection Law, Qualtrics will immediately notify Customer (email permitted).</li>
<li>
<strong>Processing on Legal Requirement.</strong> Qualtrics may also process Personal Data where required to do so by applicable law.
In such a case, Qualtrics shall inform Customer of that legal requirement before processing unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest.</li>
<li>
<strong>Personnel.</strong> To process Personal Data, Qualtrics and its Subprocessors shall only grant access to authorized personnel who have committed themselves to confidentiality.
Qualtrics and its Subprocessors will regularly train personnel having access to Personal Data in applicable data security and data privacy measures.</li>
<li>
<strong>Cooperation.</strong> At Customer’s request, Qualtrics will reasonably cooperate with Customer and Controllers in dealing with requests from Data Subjects or regulatory authorities regarding Qualtrics’ processing of Personal Data or any Personal Data Breach.
Qualtrics shall notify the Customer as soon as reasonably practical about any request it has received from a Data Subject in relation to the Personal Data processing, without itself responding to such request without Customer’s further instructions, if applicable.
Qualtrics shall provide functionality that supports Customer’s ability to correct or remove Personal Data from the Cloud Service, or restrict its processing in line with Data Protection Law.
Where such functionality is not provided, Qualtrics will correct or remove any Personal Data, or restrict its processing, in accordance with the Customer’s instruction and Data Protection Law.</li>
<li>
<strong>Personal Data Breach Notification.</strong> Qualtrics will notify Customer without undue delay after becoming aware of any Personal Data Breach and provide reasonable information in its possession to assist Customer to meet Customer’s obligations to report a Personal Data Breach as required under Data Protection Law.
Qualtrics may provide such information in phases as it becomes available.
Such notification shall not be interpreted or construed as an admission of fault or liability by Qualtrics.</li>
<li>
<strong>Data Protection Impact Assessment.</strong> If, pursuant to Data Protection Law, Customer (or its Controllers) are required to perform a data protection impact assessment or prior consultation with a regulator, at Customer’s request, Qualtrics will provide such documents as are generally available for the Cloud Service (for example, this DPA, the Agreement, audit reports or certifications).
Any additional assistance shall be mutually agreed between the Parties.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<strong>DATA EXPORT AND DELETION</strong>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Export and Retrieval by Customer.</strong> During the Subscription Term and subject to the Agreement, Customer can access its Personal Data at any time.
Customer may export and retrieve its Personal Data in a standard format.
Export and retrieval may be subject to technical limitations, in which case Qualtrics and Customer will find a reasonable method to allow Customer access to Personal Data.</li>
<li>
<strong>Deletion.</strong> Before the Subscription Term expires, Customer may use Qualtrics’ self-service export tools (as available) to perform a final export of Personal Data from the Cloud Service (which shall constitute a “return” of Personal Data).
At the end of the Subscription Term, Customer hereby instructs Qualtrics to delete the Personal Data remaining on servers hosting the Cloud Service within a reasonable time period in line with Data Protection Law (not to exceed six months) unless applicable law requires retention.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<strong>CERTIFICATIONS AND AUDITS</strong>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Customer Audit.</strong> Customer or its independent third party auditor reasonably acceptable to Qualtrics (which shall not include any third party auditors who are either a competitor of Qualtrics or not suitably qualified or independent) may audit Qualtrics’ control environment and security practices relevant to Personal Data processed by Qualtrics only if:
<ol>
<li>Qualtrics has not provided sufficient evidence of its compliance with the technical and organizational measures that protect the production systems of the Cloud Service through providing either: (i) a certification as to compliance with ISO 27001 or other standards (scope as defined in the certificate).
or (ii) a valid ISAE3402 and/or ISAE3000 or other SOC1-3 attestation report.
Upon Customer’s request audit reports or ISO certifications are available through the third party auditor or Qualtrics;</li>
<li>A Personal Data Breach has occurred;</li>
<li>An audit is formally requested by Customer’s data protection authority.
or</li>
<li>Mandatory Data Protection Law provides Customer with a direct audit right and provided that Customer shall only audit once in any twelve month period unless mandatory Data Protection Law requires more frequent audits.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Other Controller Audit.</strong> Any other Controller may audit Qualtrics’ control environment and security practices relevant to Personal Data processed by Qualtrics in line with Section 5.1 only if any of the cases set out in Section 5.1 applies to such other Controller.
Such audit must be undertaken through and by Customer as set out in Section 5.1 unless the audit must be undertaken by the other Controller itself under Data Protection Law.
If several Controllers whose Personal Data is processed by Qualtrics on the basis of the Agreement require an audit, Customer shall use all reasonable means to combine the audits and to avoid multiple audits.</li>
<li>
<strong>Scope of Audit.</strong> Customer shall provide at least sixty days advance notice of any audit unless mandatory Data Protection Law or a competent data protection authority requires shorter notice.
The frequency and scope of any audits shall be mutually agreed between the parties acting reasonably and in good faith.
Customer audits shall be limited in time to a maximum of three business days.
Beyond such restrictions, the parties will use current certifications or other audit reports to avoid or minimize repetitive audits.
Customer shall provide the results of any audit to Qualtrics.</li>
<li>
<strong>Cost of Audits.</strong> Customer shall bear the costs of any audit unless such audit reveals a material breach by Qualtrics of this DPA, then Qualtrics shall bear its own expenses of an audit.
If an audit determines that Qualtrics has breached its obligations under the DPA, Qualtrics will promptly remedy the breach at its own cost.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>

</ol>
</li>
<li>
<strong>New Subprocessors.</strong> Qualtrics’ use of Subprocessors is at its discretion, provided that:
<ol>
<li>Qualtrics will inform Customer in advance (by email or by posting within the Cloud Service) of any intended additions or replacements to the list of Subprocessors including name, address and role of the new Subprocessor.
and</li>
<li>Customer may object to such changes as set out in Section 6.3</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Objections to New Subprocessors.</strong>
<ol>
<li>If Customer has a legitimate reason under Data Protection Law to object to the new Subprocessors’ processing of Personal Data, Customer may terminate the Agreement (limited to the Cloud Service for which the new Subprocessor is intended to be used) on written notice to Qualtrics.
Such termination shall take effect at the time determined by the Customer which shall be no later than thirty days from the date of Qualtrics’ notice to Customer informing Customer of the new Subprocessor.
If Customer does not terminate within this thirty day period, Customer is deemed to have accepted the new Subprocessor.</li>
<li>Within the thirty day period from the date of Qualtrics’ notice to Customer informing Customer of the new Subprocessor, Customer may request that the parties come together in good faith to discuss a resolution to the objection.
Such discussions shall not extend the period for termination and do not affect Qualtrics’ right to use the new Subprocessor(s) after the thirty day period.</li>
<li>Any termination under this Section 6.3 shall be deemed to be without fault by either party and shall be subject to the terms of the Agreement.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Emergency Replacement.</strong> Qualtrics may replace a Subprocessor without advance notice where the reason for the change is outside of Qualtrics’ reasonable control and prompt replacement is required for security or other urgent reasons.
In this case, Qualtrics will inform Customer of the replacement Subprocessor as soon as possible following its appointment.
Section 6.3 applies accordingly.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
