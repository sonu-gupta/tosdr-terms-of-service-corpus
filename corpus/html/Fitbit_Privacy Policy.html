<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may share non-personal information that is aggregated or</p>
<p>de-identified so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify an individual.
We may disclose such information publicly and to third parties, for example, in public reports about exercise and activity, to partners under agreement with us, or as part of the community benchmarking information we provide to users of our subscription services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we will continue to take measures to protect the confidentiality of personal information and give affected users notice before transferring any personal information to a new entity.</p>
