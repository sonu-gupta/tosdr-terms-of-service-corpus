<p>KINDS OF INFORMATION</p>
<p>There are two kinds of information websites can obtain about you:</p>
<p>· &nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
Aggregate Information: Aggregate Information is anonymous data that websites use to diagnose problems on the sites' servers, administer the sites, and to help improve the quality of the Web pages.
It may be your domain name (i.e.
"XYZ.com") or your IP address.</p>
<p>· &nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
Personally Identifiable Information: Personally Identifiable Information is any information that personally identifies you.
It can be your first and last name, your email address, your home address, or your telephone number.
Sometimes this personal information is needed when you order products online or subscribe to an email newsletter.
Other times, websites collect this information to help personalize advertising and marketing.</p>
<p>We collect Aggregate Information - such as your IP address (a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Internet), browser type (e.g., Netscape or Internet Explorer), and domain (e.g., "XYZ.com").
We do this in the background so it does not interrupt your cruising speed.
We use this information to help diagnose problems with our servers, to administer our site, and to gather broad demographic information.
We share Aggregate Information with third parties for advertising and promotional purposes.
None of this information is connected with Personally Identifiable Information.
So, when you enter our site, you are anonymous and will remain that way unless you choose otherwise.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>SURVEYS AND REGISTRATION FORMS</p>
<p>Sometimes MoviesTVNetwork.com posts surveys and registration forms in which we ask for Personally Identifiable Information.
Here are some ways we might use that information:</p>
<p>· &nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
To send you information about Movies! Network and this website.</p>
<p>· &nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
To better serve viewers on the Movies! Network.</p>
<p>· &nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
To customize which articles and information appears on this website for visitors.</p>
<p>The choice is yours - you do not have to answer surveys or register for newsletters or service.
If you choose to answer the survey or complete the registration, we will tell you on the survey or registration form how we will use the Personally Identifiable Information.
If we are asking for optional information, we will mark it with an asterisk (*) so you know you can skip it if you want.
And on that same page we will give you a way to "opt out" of being contacted by MoviesTVNetwork.com and any third parties.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>CONTESTS AND SWEEPSTAKES</p>
<p>From time to time we run contests and sweepstakes in which we ask for Personally Identifiable Information such as your name, email address or telephone number.
That's so we can let you know if you win.
Sometimes we request additional Personally Identifiable Information such as your age, gender, and income level.
And once in a while - though not often - we require this additional information in exchange for allowing you to enter the contest.
Here are some of the ways we might use the information that we collect:</p>
<p>· &nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
To notify you if you are a winner</p>
<p>· &nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
To send you information about Movies TV Network and our site</p>
<p>· &nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
To give to content partners, who may send you promotional email</p>
<p>· &nbsp.
&nbsp.
&nbsp.
To give to advertisers, who may send you emails about their products and services</p>
<p>We may share Aggregate Information with our partners and advertisers.
We will not share your Personally Identifiable Information with third parties unless we tell you otherwise when asking for it.
We will give you a way to "opt out" of being contacted by MoviesTVNetwork.com and any third parties.</p>
<p>If you win one of our contests or sweepstakes, we will not publish your name, hometown, or other Personally Identifiable Information on the Site unless you give us your permission.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>OPT OUT</p>
<p>If we ask you for Personally Identifiable Information, we will tell you if we intend to share it with others.
We will provide you with a way to tell us that you don't want us to share the information or if you don't want to receive promotional and/or marketing information about products, services, and offerings from MoviesTVNetwork.com and/or any third parties.
Let us know and we will use your name and address only to tell you if you win a contest.</p>
<p>
