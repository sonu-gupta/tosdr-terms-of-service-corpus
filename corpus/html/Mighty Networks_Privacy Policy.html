By directly integrating these services, we make your use of Mighty Networks richer and more personalized.
To enable Integrated Services, we will ask you to authorize Mighty Networks to access the Integrated Services (or vice versa).

Transferring your Personal Data to Other Countries<p>
<b>
<i>This Section Includes Important</i>
</b>
<b>
<i>Updates as of December 11, 2020</i>
</b>
</p>
<p>Our website and mobile applications are provided from within the United States and are subject to state and federal laws of the United States.
If you are located outside the United States, your Personal Information is being transferred to, stored, used, and shared in the United States.</p>
<p>Following the invalidation of the EU-US Privacy Shield by the Court of Justice of the European Union on July 16, 2020 (known as the “Schrems II” decision) and of the Swiss-US Privacy Shield on September 8, 2020, Personal Data subject to the GDPR are no longer transferred by or to Mighty Software on the basis of the Privacy Shield but are instead subject to the EU Standard Contractual Clauses.&nbsp.
The Schrems II decision also placed additional compliance requirements on the use of EU Standard Contract Clauses (SCC) for transfer of EU/EEA Personal Data to the U.S.
by companies subject to Section 702 of the U.S.
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) and/or Executive Order 12333 (E.O.
12333).&nbsp.
It is our good faith belief that the types of EU/EEA Personal Data we receive, collect, process, use and/or share in the U.S.
are not of the types of data that would generally be subject to requests from U.S.
government authorities pursuant to FISA Section 702 and/or E.O.
12333.</p>
<p>As explained above in this Privacy Policy in Section 2(b), we sometimes share your Personal Information with Third Party service providers so they can perform services for us.
If we share Personal Information we have received from EU/EEA/Swiss data subjects, with a Third Party, that Third Party’s access, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information will be subject to the Standard Contractual Clauses.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Standard Contractual Clauses, like the Privacy Shield Principles, we may be liable to you for the failure of our service providers to comply with the Standard Contractual Clauses.</p>
<p>While EU and U.S officials are working to resolve the issues which were the basis for the Schrems II decision invalidating the EU-U.S Privacy Shield framework, we continue to adhere to the EU Privacy Shield Principles required by our Privacy Shield Certification(s).
We remain subject to the regulatory and enforcement authority of the U.S.
Federal Trade Commission.
If you are located in the UK, European Union (EU), Switzerland or European Economic Area (EEA), and have a question or complaint regarding data collected in the UK, EU, EEA or Switzerland that was transferred to the U.S.
under the Privacy Shield Frameworks, you should first direct your question or complaint to dpo@mightnetworks.com.
You can also write or call us at the following address: Mighty Software, Inc., 127 Lytton Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94301, Phone: 415-935-4253.</p>
<p>Mighty Software Inc.
continues to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Privacy Shield Principles to BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, a non-profit alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States and operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus.</p>
<p>If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not resolved your complaint, please visit&nbsp;https://www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers for more information or to file a complaint.
The services of the BBB EU Privacy Shield are provided free of charge to you.
Finally, as a last resort and in limited circumstances, UK, EU &amp.
Swiss individuals with residual complaints may be eligible to request binding arbitration before a Privacy Shield Panel described on the Privacy Shield Annex I website found at https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction.</p>14.
