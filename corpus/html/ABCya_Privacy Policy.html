<p>ABCya.com is a teacher-created website brought to you by ABCya.com LLC ("ABCya") that provides fun and educational games for kids to use under the guidance of their parents and teachers.
In this policy, we refer to our visitors younger than age 13 as "Children." We provide this privacy policy to inform parents and other users about our privacy practices for ABCya.com, our ABCya Games mobile app, and any other ABCya online service that links to this Privacy Policy (the "Platform"), as required by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").

<p>Please review our full privacy policy below - but here are some key points to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Platform does not require Children to provide their name, address, or other contact information in order to play games.
We, and third-party service providers, may automatically collect IP address and similar device identifiers from Platform visitors - but only for analytical and other internal-operations purposes.</li>
<li>The Platform does collect personal information from parents, teachers, and other adults (for example, if you subscribe to a paid account).</li>
<li>Unless you purchase an ad-free subscription, we have advertisements on the Platform, which are served by third-party companies.
However, these ads are not targeted to a specific user.
(We use only contextual advertising methods and not interest-based advertising methods).</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to this privacy policy, please review our Terms of Use, which govern your use of the Platform, and our Payment Terms, which contain additional terms applicable to paid subscriptions.</p>
