<p>We may disclose the below-specified categories of information for our business or commercial purposes, including the following:</p>
<p>
<strong>Disclosure to Our Service Providers</strong>
</p>
<p>We may share all categories of your collected personal information as necessary with our third-party service providers (which may include Company affiliates) who perform various business operations, solely for our benefit or on our behalf, under our instructions and in compliance with appropriate contractual, technical and organizational security measures to protect your data from unauthorized use, retention, or disclosure.

<p>We work with various types of third-party business partners to offer you our Cash Back shopping Services.
We may share the following types of information with the following types of Business Partners.</p>
<p>
<strong>Affiliate Partners</strong>
</p>
<p>When you click on a link to a merchant site presented on our Services to start your Cash Back shopping, you evidence your intent to interact with that business through our Services, and thereby are directing us to disclose certain information about you (including the link you clicked in our Services and a unique ID assigned to track that your shopping originated from our Services) to an affiliate network to properly account for your purchases.
For a small number of merchants that do not utilize an affiliate network, this information is provided directly to the merchant.
The Affiliate Partner will collect Internet and Network Activity information (excluding any Inbox Data) about your use of our Services in relation to the merchant site, products, or offers.
Our Affiliate Partners collect this information to track the shopping trip, but certain of them may also use this information to contribute it to their own user profiles and/or combine it with information they collect elsewhere, which they may make available for use by their other clients business clients.
In such case, our sharing with certain of these Affiliate Partners could be considered a “sale” of your personal information as that term is defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), and the opt-out we offer for California consumers in Section 5, below, would signal these Affiliate Partners to not collect or use your information from our Services except as necessary to validate and provide your Cash Back.</p>
<p>In addition, to the limited extent that you are a California resident and we target direct marketing to you or personalize the offers you see in our Services based on the profile data we compile from your behavior tracked via our Services, for the direct benefit of a particular merchant, this marketing or personalization may be considered a “sale” of your personal information under CCPA.
In this circumstance, the opt-out we provide for California residents in Section 5, below, would cover this type of targeted marketing and personalization.</p>
<p>
<strong>Referral Marketing Partners</strong>
</p>
<p>In order to expand your options to sign up for our Services and start your Cash Back shopping from third-party sites where you learn about our Services, we contract with certain referral marketing business partners to enable that functionality, which may require that we share certain data about you with them.
For example, if you are referred to our Services from a business partner’s websites, we may provide that partner with information about your sign up to validate the referral and activate your Services account access from the partner’s site.</p>
<p>In addition, we may share information about whether you have made a purchase with us recently and whether you have installed our mobile app or browser extension so that the partner can personalize their email and site content to you.
For California residents, this information sharing about your behavior in our Services may be deemed a sale, so we provide an opt-out opportunity in Section 5, below.</p>

(“ShopStyle”), we may share certain transaction information with ShopStyle so that you can view your rewards summary on www.shopstyle.com.
