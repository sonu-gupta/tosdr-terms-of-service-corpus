</ul> Cookies and other tracking mechanisms
<p>We may automatically collect information about you through the use of common information-gathering tools, as well as new tracking technologies that develop as technology evolves.
The tools that we or our service providers may use to track you include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Cookies.</strong> A cookie is a small string of text that a website can send to your browser to help the website remember and customize your visit.
For example, we use cookies to help us to tailor our Site to you, remember your orders, keep you logged into your account, and compile statistics about Site usage.
With most Internet browsers or other software, you can erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block or disable cookies or receive a warning before a cookie is stored.
Please refer to your browser instructions to learn more about these functions.
If you reject cookies, functionality of the Site may be limited, and you may not be able to take advantage of many of the Site's features (e.g., you may not be able to stay logged into your account).</li>
<li>
<strong>Web beacons/clear GIFs.</strong> Clear graphics interchange format images (“GIFs”) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, that are embedded invisibly on web pages or in emails.
We or our service providers may use clear GIFs (also known as web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags) in connection with our Site to track the activities of visitors to our Site, help us manage content and compile statistics about usage of our Site.
We or our service providers may also use clear GIFs in emails to our users, to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed and track whether our emails are forwarded.</li>
<li>
<strong>LSOs.</strong> We may also use local storage objects (“LSOs”) to store your Site preferences and to personalize your visit.
LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored.
Typically, you cannot control, delete or disable the acceptance of LSOs through your web browser.
For more information on Flash LSOs, or to learn how to manage your settings for Flash LSOs, please click here.
We may use applications, servers and other technology provided by third-party companies, such as Google Analytics, to help us improve our Site, performance and user experiences.
These entities may use cookies and information-gathering tools, such as web beacons or LSOs, to perform their services.</li>
</ul> California do not track disclosure
<p>Our Site does not respond to do not track signals (e.g., the Mozilla Firefox Do Not Track feature), though you may be able to disable certain tracking as discussed above (e.g., by disabling cookies).
There is still no universally accepted standard regarding tracking, but for more information about do not track signals, please click here.</p> Online advertising
<p>We use third-party marketing or advertising companies (e.g., Google Customer Match) to serve advertisements on our Site and on third-party websites or other media (e.g., social networking platforms).
This enables these third parties to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested.
These advertisements may be targeted based on the pages you view on our Site or on third-party websites, as well as other information that they may have about you.
These third parties may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), LSOs and other tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you.
We may provide these third-party advertisers with information, including Personal Information, about you, as permitted under our agreements with such third parties.</p>
<p>Users in the United States may opt out of many third-party ad networks.
For example, you may go to the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Consumer Choice Page for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and your choices regarding having information used by DAA companies.
You may also go to the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) Consumer Opt-Out Page for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and your choices regarding having information used by NAI members.</p>
<p>Opting out from one or more companies listed on the DAA Consumer Choice Page or the NAI Consumer Opt-Out Page will opt you out from those companies’ delivery of interest-based content or advertisements to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising through our Site or on other websites.
Please note that even if you opt out, you may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads).
Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you opt out on the DAA or NAI websites, your opt out may not be effective.
Additional information is available on the DAA’s website at www.aboutads.info or the NAI’s website at
www.networkadvertising.org.</p>

However, for your convenience, here are the opt outs for some of the advertising service providers we use as of the “Last Modified” date of this Policy:</p>

<p>Our Site is not targeted to children under thirteen (13) years of age and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 13.
If we discover that we have inadvertently collected Personal Information from a child under 13, we will promptly take measures to delete that Personal Information from our systems.

Custom Ink is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites.
We encourage our users to read the privacy statements of each and every website they visit.</p> Security
<p>We have implemented technical and organizational measures, appropriate to the risk, to protect your information against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration and unauthorized disclosure or access.
For example, we limit internal access to our servers and have physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards in place that are designed to protect your information.
However, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure, and we cannot guarantee the security of information transmitted through our Site.
We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any such information, and you provide such information at your own risk.</p>
<p>You can also take steps to help protect your information.
For example, if you have an account with us, you should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your account by, among other things, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess and keeping your log-in and password private.</p> Data Retention
<p>We retain your Personal Information, if provided by you through our Site, for as long as your inquiry is active (as determined by us) and for a reasonable time thereafter, or if applicable, for as long as you remain on our marketing list.
We also may retain your Personal Information for a longer period of time on the basis of our legitimate interests in providing our Services to you or as necessary to comply with our tax and legal obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce our agreements.
Even if we delete some or all of your Personal Information, we may continue to retain and use aggregated or anonymous data previously collected so that it can no longer be used for personal identification and/or anonymize or aggregate your Personal Information.
