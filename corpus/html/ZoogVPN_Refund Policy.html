<p>For recurring subscriptions it is your responsibility to ensure that upon claiming refund you have cancelled recurring payments from the source (e.g.
bank or Paypal), simply deleting your ZoogVPN account does not automatically cancel recurring payments.</p>
<p>We endeavour to process refunds within 3 business days of an approved valid refund request, but payments may take up to 30 days to appear on your account depending on your bank, card or payment provider.
All refunds are subject to 5% admin fee.</p>
<p>Only Credit/Debit card and Paypal payments can be refunded.</p>
<p>This refund policy is subject to our full Terms of Service.</p> Questions? <p>If you wish to cancel your account with recurring billing or if you have questions about your account, pelase email billing at billing(at)zoogvpn(dot)com or by visiting Support Center.</p>
