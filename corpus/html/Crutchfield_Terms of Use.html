Other Terms of Sale <p>The risk of loss and title for items purchased by you pass to you upon our delivery of the items to the carrier pursuant to our standard terms of sale.
We do not take title to returned items until the item arrives at our fulfillment center.
At our discretion, a refund may be issued without requiring a return.
In this situation, we do not take title to the refunded item.</p> Disputes <p>Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of the Site, or to any products or services sold or distributed by us or Crutchfield.com will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify.
The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.</p>
<p>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.
However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Terms of Use as a court would.</p>
<p>To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to us at Crutchfield, Attention Legal Depart, 1 Crutchfield Park, Charlottesville, VA 22911.
The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes.
The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules.
You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.</p>
<p>We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.
If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial.
We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.</p> Reviews and Comments <p>Except as otherwise provided elsewhere in this Agreement or on the Site, anything that you submit or post to the Site and/or provide us, including without limitation, ideas, know-how, techniques, questions, reviews, comments, and suggestions (collectively, "Submissions") is and will be treated as nonconfidential and nonproprietary, and we shall have the royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable and transferable right to use, copy, distribute, display, publish, perform, sell, lease, transmit, adapt, create derivative works from such Submissions by any means and in any form, and to translate, modify, reverse-engineer, disassemble, or decompile such Submissions.
All Submissions shall automatically become our sole and exclusive property and shall not be returned to you.</p>

We may, but shall not be obligated to, remove or edit any Submissions (including comments or reviews) for any reason.</p> Sales Taxes <p>Some states require us to provide them with lists of residents of the state along with other personally identifiable information such as email addresses, mailing addresses and the items purchased which we are required to submit under the laws of these states.</p> Transmissions <p>Any material, information or idea you transmit to or post on this site by any means will be treated as non-confidential and non-proprietary, and may be disseminated or used by Crutchfield or its affiliates for any purpose whatsoever.
