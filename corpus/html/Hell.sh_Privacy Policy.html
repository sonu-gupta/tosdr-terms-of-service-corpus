So, in the following sub-sections we will go over each bit of personal data that we may store.</p> Unique Identifiers <p>When connecting with a third-party services for login, we store your unique identifier on that service in association with your account to facilitate subsequent logins until you unlink that service.</p> Display Name <p>Your accounts may be associated with a display name, which might be your given name or full name.
When you create an account by connecting with a third-party service, we copy your display name on that service to our service.</p> Profile Picture <p>When connecting to a third-party service we store a URL to your profile picture on that service, if applicable, until you unlink that service, so your profile picture with the third-party service can be your profile picture on our service as well without you needing to upload it again.</p> Email Address <p>When connecting to a third-party service, we will copy the email address that you have provided to them, if applicable, until you unlink that service.</p> Email Forwarding <p>If you enable email forwarding on netdex.co, we store</p>
<ul>
<li>your username and</li>
<li>your real email address</li>
</ul>
<p>in correlation on our email servers to provide the forwarding service.</p>
<p>Additionally, for all incoming emails, we store:</p>
<ul>
<li>the sending email server's IP address,</li>
<li>the sender's email address,</li>
<li>your real email address,</li>
<li>the IP address of the receiving email server and</li>
<li>any transfer metadata and errors (e.g.
reason for declining to receive email)</li>
</ul>
<p>which we use to improve our spam filters and compliance.</p>
<p>Currently, we don't enforce encryption for receiving and sending but try to enable it whenever possible, because too many providers don't support it yet.</p> Screenshots <p>When you upload a screenshot using the LavaShot App, it's uploaded to our server, where it's publically available at its unique link forever unless we receive a correct abuse notice.</p>
