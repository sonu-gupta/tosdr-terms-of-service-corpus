ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL.
You and Utreon agree that you will notify each other in writing of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises.
Notice to Utreon shall be sent to Utreon Inc., Attn: Legal, 477 Madison Avenue, 6th floor, PMB# 4859, New York, NY, 10022.

and that the state or federal courts in New York County, New York have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals of an arbitration award and over any suit between the parties not subject to arbitration.
Other than class procedures and remedies discussed below, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court.
Any dispute between the parties will be governed by this Agreement and the laws of the State of New York and applicable United States law, without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that may provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction.
Whether the dispute is heard in arbitration or in court, you and Utreon will not commence against the other a class action, class arbitration or other representative action or proceeding.</p>
<p>(ii) If you are a resident in any jurisdiction in which the provision in the section above is found to be unenforceable, then the following shall apply:</p>
<p>Any disputes, claims or causes of action arising out of or in connection with these Terms of Service will be governed by and construed under the laws of the jurisdiction of your residence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any disputes, claims or causes of action arising out of or in connection with these Terms of Service shall be resolved by competent civil courts within your jurisdiction of residence.</p>
<p>e.&nbsp.
Claims</p>
<p>YOU AND UTREON AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE UTREON SERVICES MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES.
OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.</p> 16.
Miscellaneous <p>a.
Waiver</p>
<p>If we fail to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service, it will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

<p>b.
Severability</p>
<p>If any provision of these Terms of Service or any Guidelines is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated from these Terms of Service to the minimum extent necessary and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>
<p>c.
