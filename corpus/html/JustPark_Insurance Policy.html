You must be sure that the information you have given to us to pass onto the insurers is a “fair presentation” of the risk.
You must disclose to insurers via us, before the terms of the insurance contract are finalised with insurers, all information which is known to you (or which ought to be known to you based on reasonable enquiries) in the ordinary course of your business and which is material to the risk.
Such disclosure must also be reasonable clear and accessible and you must respond fully to any requests for information made by insurers.</p>
<p>Information is material if it would influence the judgment of a prudent insurer (not necessarily the insurer in question) in establishing the premium or determining whether to underwrite the risk.
If there is any doubt as to whether the information is material, it must be disclosed to insurers.</p>Policy Documentation<p>We will endeavour ensure your policy documents are issued promptly.
You should read all insurance policy documents sent to you.
You are responsible for reviewing the documentation we send to you and confirming the coverage is in accordance with your instructions.
Please ensure you understand the policy terms, conditions and warranties and are able to follow their requirements exactly.
If there is anything you do not understand, please advise us immediately so that we can explain it to you, as a breach of any terms, conditions or warranties may enable your insurer to terminate your policy from the date of that breach or from inception of the policy, and/or repudiate a claim under your policy.</p>Notification of Incidents and Claims<p>Claims should be advised to in accordance with the Policy Wording.</p>Cancellation of insurances<p>Your policy documents will detail your rights to cancel any insurance you have purchased.
The insurance contract may include provisions permitting you or the insurer to cancel the policy.
If you wish to give notice of cancellation under the terms of the policy, please contact us in writing.
A condition of cancellation may require the return of any relevant certificate of insurance or other document issued to you.
If insurers wish to cancel this insurance contract, we/they shall contact you at the last known address we/they have for you on our/their records.</p>Return Premiums<p>Return premiums may arise if an insurance risk is reduced or a policy cancelled.
A return premium may be allowed by insurers depending on the precise policy terms and conditions.
Insurers may not allow a return premium if any claims have been made under the current insurance contract.</p>Security (Solvency of Insurers)<p>We may use UK or Non-UK rated or unrated insurers for a particular client or risk.
You should be aware that a different legal and regulatory regime may apply for Non-UK insurers so your ability to enforce your legal rights or to seek compensation may vary.
If you do not wish to use a Non-UK or unrated insurer, please advise us immediately.</p>
<p>We do not guarantee the solvency of any insurer we place business with.
We do not monitor insurer solvency on an ongoing basis, and shall not be liable for losses suffered by you in the event of the insolvency of an insurer.
If an insurer with which you have a policy becomes insolvent, you may still be liable for any unpaid premiums you owe it and we may be unable to collect any return premiums that might be due to you.</p>Client Money<p>We hold money received from you, or to pay to you, as ‘client money’, either:</p>
<p>As your agent in a statutory trust bank account, which, in the unlikely event of our failure, is available to clients ahead of insurers and other creditors.
or</p>
<p>As agent of your insurers under agreements with some insurers specifying that premiums and claims monies received by us are held as agent for those insurers.
This is termed ‘risk transfer’.</p>
<p>Statutory trust accounts are subject to strict controls set out in the FCA CASS Handbook including rules in relation to segregation, establishing the trust, and the detailed operation of the trust.
These controls provide robust protection in relation to funds held on behalf of policyholders and insurers.</p>Confidentiality of Personal Information <p>If you are an individual, we will process your personal information responsibly, fairly and in accordance with the WeCovr Privacy Notice available at https://wecovr.com/privacy.</p>
