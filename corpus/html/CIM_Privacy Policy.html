If you are interested in learning more about and/or opting out of online behavioral advertising, sometimes called interest-based advertising, we encourage you to visit one of the advertising industry-developed opt-out pages, such as www.youradchoices.com or aboutads.info.

<b>Protecting Your Personal Information</b>
<br>
<br>We implement and maintain reasonable security appropriate to the nature of the personal information that we collect, use, retain, transfer or otherwise process.&nbsp;Our policy is to restrict access to your personal information to only those employees, service providers and other third parties who need to know that information to provide products or services to you.
We maintain commercially reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards consistent with industry standards and other applicable standards as required by law and we require service providers and third parties to do the same.<br>
<br>While we are committed to developing, implementing, maintaining, monitoring and updating a reasonable information security program, unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.&nbsp.
Data security incidents and breaches can occur due to vulnerabilities, criminal exploits or other factors that cannot reasonably be prevented.&nbsp.
Accordingly, while our reasonable security program is designed to manage data security risks and thus help prevent data security incidents and breaches, it cannot be assumed that the occurrence of any given incident or breach results from our failure to implement and maintain reasonable security.
As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control.
(b) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through the website cannot be guaranteed.
and (c) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party.<br> &nbsp;</li>
<li>
<b>Retention </b>
<br>
<br>We keep your personal information for as long as it is required by us for our legitimate business purposes, to perform our contractual obligations, or where longer, such longer period as is required by law or regulatory obligations which apply to us.
While we generally retain information about you throughout the life cycle of any investment you are involved in and for no longer than we need it, some personal information may be retained after your relationship with us ends.<br> &nbsp;</li>
<li>
<b>Links to Third-Party Websites</b>
<br>
<br>Our websites may contain links to websites operated and maintained by third parties, over which we have no control.
Privacy policies on such linked websites may be different from our Privacy Policy.
You access such linked websites at your own risk.

Please be sure to check this page before proceeding to use our websites.

In the event of any conflict between the Additional Privacy Terms and this Privacy Policy, the Additional Privacy Terms shall prevail but we will treat personal information that you provide to us before we adopt such Additional Privacy Terms in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy, unless and until you agree with the application of the Additional Privacy Terms to your personal information collected by us prior to the updates or amendments.<br> &nbsp;</li>
