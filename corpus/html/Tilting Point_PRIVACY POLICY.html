<p>In addition, we may process your data for additional purposes which are compatible with any of the purposes listed above.</p>
<p>
<b>3.2.
ADVERTISING</b>
</p>
<p>Advertising is one of the tools that helps fund our Services and enables us to make our Games available free of charge.
In some of our Games, we may show our own ads and also ads from third parties.
We also advertise our Games outside of our Services on third-party properties such as websites or applications.
This section provides more information on how we may use your data for advertising purposes, and how you can control the use of your data for these purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mobile advertising relies on the use of certain online identifiers, in particular Advertising IDs but also IP addresses or other identifiers.
An “<b>Advertising ID</b>” is an alphanumeric string of digits provided by the operating system of your mobile device (e.g.
your phone or tablet).
It is consistent across applications from different publishers.
The Advertising ID is known as the Identifier for Advertisers (“<b>IDFA</b>”) on iOS devices and Google Advertising Identifier (“<b>GAID</b>”) on Android devices.
Advertising IDs are used for interest-based advertising and other advertising related purposes.
You can control the extent to which your Advertising ID is used for these purposes.
Using the privacy settings on your device, you can typically reset and/or limit the use of your Advertising ID.
For example, you can “limit ad tracking” on iOS devices or “opt out of interest-based ads” on Android devices.
These settings are specific to each device, which means that you should set them as you prefer on each of your devices individually.
It may take some time for your updated settings to take effect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please consider that resetting or limiting the use of your Advertising ID will not stop you from seeing ads or necessarily reduce the number of ads you see, but the ads you see may be less relevant to you and will not be served based on your personal data.<br>
<br>
<b>When you see ads in our Games</b>, we may share your Advertising ID and IP address with our advertising partners if you have given your consent to the use of your data for personalized ads.
Our advertising partners may also collect non-personal information directly from our Games through technologies such as software development kits (SDKs).
In each case, they may use such data for a number of purposes, including to limit the number of times you see an ad or to personalize the ads you see to make them more relevant to you (for example, based on the past activity they have associated with your Advertising ID).
For more information, please refer to the privacy policies of our advertising partners listed&nbsp;here.<br>
<br>
<b>When you see our ads outside of our Services</b>&nbsp;(for example, on third-party properties such as websites or applications), the ad network involved in delivering that ad to you may, based on information such as the past activity they have associated with your Advertising ID, have determined that you may be interested in our Services.
When ad-networks use your Advertising ID in these ways, they do so based on their respective privacy policies or notices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ad networks may also use your data to:</p>
<ul>
<li>limit the number of times you see our ads,</li>
<li>inform users who have previously played our Games about new content, updates, or other news related to those Games, or</li>
<li>refrain from showing our ads to users who already play the Game being advertised.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>For both ads in our Games and our ads outside of our Services</b>, Advertising IDs or other identifiers are also used for ad measurement, which involves the collection of metrics such as total views, clicks, or installs generated by an ad.
Measurement data may be directly or indirectly collected or received by multiple parties involved in ad delivery (including us and our advertising partners), for example through technologies such as web beacons inserted into ads.
This data is used for purposes such as to provide measurement services, to detect, investigate and prevent fraud or fraudulent behavior, or to settle payments between the parties involved in ad delivery.</p>
<p>
<b>3.3.
COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES ON OUR WEBSITE</b>
</p>
<p>Like most websites today, our Websites may use cookies or similar technologies (for example, local shared objects or web beacons).
A “<b>cookie</b>” is a small file your browser stores when told to do so by a website.
Cookies can be set by either the website you visit (“<b>first-party cookies</b>”) or a third party involved in providing content, functionality, or services such as analytics or advertising for the website you visit (“<b>third-party cookies</b>”).
Cookies are typically used to identify or “remember” your device, for example to enable functionality, facilitate audience measurement, improve performance, or store your preferences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As explained in the cookie banner seen when you first visit the Websites, we may only collect essential (necessary to enable functionality of the Website) and analytical (useful to improve our Websites by using information on its usage) cookies.</p>
<p>Using your browser or device settings or making a choice through our cookie banner, you can control the use of cookies, for example by disabling some or all cookies or configuring your browser or device to notify you when cookies are being set.
However, please consider that disabling essential cookies may affect your ability to use the Services.</p>
<p>
<b>4.

<p>
<b>7.
HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR DATA?</b>
</p>
<p>We will keep your data for as long as necessary to achieve the purpose(s) for which it was collected, including to provide you with the Services or to comply with any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
We may periodically delete or de-identify inactive accounts or other data in our Games or other Services.
After the applicable retention period necessary for safe performance of Services, we will either delete or de-identify your data or, if neither deletion or de-identification is possible (for example, due to data being stored on a backup server), isolate your data from further processing until deletion or de-identification is possible.
We may continue to use data that is not identifiable to you (for example, aggregate data).</p>
<p>
<b>8.
HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR DATA SECURE?</b>
</p>
<p>We have adopted measures to provide your data a level of security appropriate for the degree of risk involved with the data processing activities described in this Policy.
These measures are designed to protect your data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, or alteration as well as unauthorized disclosure or access.
The specific measures we employ vary depending on the sensitivity of the data, but typically include, for example, encryption, pseudonymization of identifying data where feasible, physical and technological controls to limit access to services or systems that contain personal data, and maintaining procedures to handle any suspected security incidents.</p>
<p>

<b>10.
INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER</b>
</p>
<p>Tilting Point is a company based in the United States and, in order to provide you the Services, your data will be transferred to the US for processing and will be stored on Amazon Web Services.
By using Tilting Point’s Services you acknowledge and consent to the processing of your data in the United States.
<br>
<br>Since the United States is considered a country that does not ensure “an adequate level of protection,” according to the art.

46 and 49 of the GDPR.
Namely, Tilting Point collects and transfers your data to the United States only due to the following circumstances: 1) because we entered into a contract with the Amazon Web Services or another service provider incorporating standard data protection clauses.
2) to perform a contract (providing you with the Services under our Terms of Service).
3) your consent.</p>
<p>
<b>11.

<p>
<b>– The right to opt out of the sale of your personal information.
</b>We do not sell your personal information in exchange for money.

and</li>
<li>internet or other electronic network activity information (including technical information required to select and deliver the appropriate ad type and format).</li>
</ul>
<p>Because this disclosure of information could be deemed a “sale” in the meaning of the CCPA, we ask for your explicit consent to disclose your personal information to our advertising or marketing partners for the above purposes.
You have several options to exercise your right to opt-out:</p>
<ul>
<li>contact us at privacy@tiltingpoint.com;</li>
<li>decline to give consent to such sharing within a Game or a cookie banner on the Websites when you see a message asking for consent.
