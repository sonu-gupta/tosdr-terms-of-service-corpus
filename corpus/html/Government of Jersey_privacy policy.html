We work hard to make sure that we have the right policies, training and processes in place to protect our manual and electronic information systems from loss, corruption or misuse.
Where necessary we use encryption, particularly if we are transferring information out of the department.

<p>We may not be able to provide you with a service unless we have enough information or your permission to use that information.</p>
<p>We will endeavour to keep your information accurate and up to date and not keep it for longer than is necessary.
In some instances the law sets the length of time information has to be kept.
Please ask to see our retention schedules for more detail about how long we retain your information.</p>
