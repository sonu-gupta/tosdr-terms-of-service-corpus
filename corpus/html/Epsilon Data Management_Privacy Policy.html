<li>helping our Clients identify and understand their customers better, by providing insights about them and managing loyalty programs.</li>

<strong>Online targeting, for example:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>creating defined audience segments based on common demographics and/or shared (actual or inferred) interests or preferences (e.g., households with prospective students).

<strong>Additional marketing and database services, for example:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>assisting in targeting and optimizing of direct mail and email campaigns, display, mobile and social media marketing.</li>
<li>measuring the effectiveness of online or offline ad campaigns by determining which messages are most likely to be seen or opened by which types of consumers, or which types of ads are most likely to lead to purchases.</li>
<li>analyzing and optimizing our Clients’ (or their service providers’) proprietary databases or helping Clients to identify and mitigate potential fraud.</li>
<li>providing “verification” or data “hygiene” services, which is how companies update and/or “clean” their databases by either verifying or removing or correcting old, incorrect or outdated information.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Operate our Services, for example: </strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>improving, testing, updating and verifying our own database.</li>

Cookies and Similar Technologies</strong>
<br>
<br>
<em>
<strong>a.
Cookies and How We Use Them</strong>
</em>
<br>
<br>Epsilon and its business partners use certain industry-standard technologies, including cookies and similarly functional technologies, which we describe below.
(We use these technologies on our Website, for instance, and our partners may use these technologies in their own marketing services.)<br>
<br>We may work with third parties to provide or enhance our Services (e.g.
for purposes of tailoring ads, or placing browser cookies), or to offer marketers ways to access or use our Information, often in de-identified form.
These partners may set and access their own cookies, pixel tags and similar technologies on your device, which may have cookies with varying expiration periods.
Those partners may, likewise, collect various types of information about your browser, device, or browsing activities through use of these cookies.<br>
<br>Cookies, in turn, are small data files that contain a string of characters, such as a unique browser identifier.
Cookies are stored on your computer or other device and act as tags that identify your device.
Our (or other companies’) servers send your device a cookie when you visit a website.
A pixel tag (also commonly known as a web beacon or clear GIF) is an invisible 1 x 1 pixel that is placed on certain web pages.
When you access web pages (such as the website of a marketer), pixel tags may permit our partners (or sometimes, us) to read the cookies that a respective company or server has deployed.
Pixel tags are used in combination with cookies to track the activity on a site by a particular device.<br>
<br>We or our service providers, and other online marketing platforms that we or they work with, may use cookies to, among other things, “remember” you, determine visitor patterns and trends, collect information about your activities on our clients’ sites, or interact with the advertising you see.
Cookies are used in this way to provide relevant content to you and replace non-relevant communications with ads that better match your interests.<br>
<br>
<em>
<strong>b.
Disabling Cookies</strong>
</em>
<br>
<br>Most web browsers are set up to accept cookies.
You may be able to set your browser to warn you before accepting certain cookies or to refuse certain cookies.
However, if you disable the use of cookies in your web browser, some features of our Website and other services may be difficult to use or become inoperable.<br>

<br>
<strong>Functionality cookies:</strong> These cookies allow our Sites to remember choices you make (such as remembering your username and password, language preference or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personalized features.
These cookies may also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other personalizations.

Other Tracking Technologies</strong>

<br>We, and our service providers, may use other technologies, such as beacons, tags and scripts, on our Sites for analytics and administrative purposes.
These technologies may be used in analyzing trends, administering the Site, recording users’ movements around the Site and gathering demographic information about our visitor base as a whole.
We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an aggregated basis.<br>
<br>We may partner with third parties who provide certain features on our Sites, or to display advertising, based upon your web browsing activity using local storage objects (LSOs) such as Flash to collect and store information.

Data Collected Through Our Websites</strong>
<br>
<br>We will sometimes give you the opportunity to provide information directly to us through our corporate Websites – such as if you are a business interested in a relationship with us or an individual completing one of our surveys.
Additionally, as you interact with our Websites, we may use (or engage with business partners and vendors that use) automatic data collection technologies such as cookies (described above) to collect certain information about your equipment, browsing actions, and patterns.<br>
<br>As you browse the internet or go across mobile apps, you may see advertisements on the web pages or the apps you visit.
Some of these ads may be more relevant to you based on a variety of factors, such as the previous websites or apps you have visited, your perceived interests and your demographic information.
This practice is called Interest-Based Advertising or Cross-App Advertising.
To learn more about this practice, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s website.<br>
<br>We may work with our advertising partners to enable the delivery of relevant messages to the right consumers while protecting consumer privacy and offering choices about participating in such activities.
Our third-party partners may use technologies, such as cookies, to gather information about your activities on this Site and other sites in order to provide you with relevant advertising.
Relevant advertising does not result in more ads, but rather the relevancy of the ads you see.<br>
<br>To learn about how to opt out of receiving relevant advertisements on the web or mobile apps, visit the Relevant Advertising Opt-Out section below.</p>

<strong>7.
Information We Receive from Clients, and our “Agency” Services</strong>
<br>
<br>Epsilon, as a service provider, provides its Clients with agency services as well as an email platform and loyalty service platform.
For instance, Clients leverage Epsilon to schedule and manage their email campaigns and manage their loyalty and incentive programs.
When our Clients provide us with information relating to their customer, prospective customers or other individuals, we handle it on behalf of our Clients as a service provider.<br>
<br>Our Clients determine how to engage with their customers and thus act as the business that determines the purposes and means of handling customer or “CRM” data.
Under these circumstances, Consumers are ultimately subject to the privacy policy(ies) of the Clients controlling their data, and they should read those policy(ies) carefully.
We are not responsible for the privacy practices of our Clients.
Accordingly, this Privacy Policy and the rights acknowledged herein do not apply to data that Epsilon handles on behalf of its Clients.<br>
<br>As a service provider, Epsilon may only process its Clients’ data upon instruction from the respective Client.
(Accordingly, Epsilon shares or discloses its Clients’ data to service providers, Clients, and Clients’ service providers per our Client’s instructions.) Epsilon may also share Client data (1) to comply with applicable laws and regulations or to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information received by us, whether or not a response is required by applicable law.
(2) to enforce our terms of use and other agreements or to protect our rights.
and (3) to protect the safety of members of the public and users of the service.<br>
<br>While Epsilon strongly encourages its Clients to adopt responsible approaches to its marketing practices, Epsilon is not responsible for the information practices of such Clients.</p>
