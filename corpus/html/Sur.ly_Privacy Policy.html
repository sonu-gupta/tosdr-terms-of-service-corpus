This also applies to any profiling based on these provisions.
To determine the legal basis, on which any processing of data is based, please consult this Data Protection Declaration.
If you log an objection, we will no longer process your affected personal data, unless we are in a position to present compelling protection worthy grounds for the processing of your data, that outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms or if the purpose of the processing is the claiming, exercising or defence of legal entitlements (objection pursuant to Art.
21 Sect.

If you object, your personal data will subsequently no longer be used for direct advertising purposes (objection pursuant to Art.
21 Sect.
2 GDPR).</strong>
</p> Right to log a complaint with the competent supervisory agency <p>In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects are entitled to log a complaint with a supervisory agency, in particular in the member state where they usually maintain their domicile, place of work or at the place where the alleged violation occurred.
The right to log a complaint is in effect regardless of any other administrative or court proceedings available as legal recourses.</p> Right to data portability <p>You have the right to demand that we hand over any data we automatically process on the basis of your consent or in order to fulfil a contract be handed over to you or a third party in a commonly used, machine readable format.
If you should demand the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will be done only if it is technically feasible.</p> SSL and/or TLS encryption <p>For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as purchase orders or inquiries you submit to us as the website operator, this website uses either an SSL or a TLS encryption programme.
You can recognise an encrypted connection by checking whether the address line of the browser switches from “http://” to “https://” and also by the appearance of the lock icon in the browser line.</p>
<p>If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p> Information about, blockage, rectification and eradication of data <p>Within the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you have the right to at any time demand information about your archived personal data, their source and recipients as well as the purpose of the processing of your data.

During the time that this investigation is ongoing, you have the right to demand that we restrict the processing of your personal data.</p>
<p>If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an unlawful manner, you have the option to demand the restriction of the processing of your data in lieu of demanding the eradication of this data.</p>

on your location, the content of the website you are visiting at the time or the search terms you are using.

<p>Please keep in mind that even the use of the non-personalized mode of Google Adsense results in the potential archiving of cookies.
According to Google, these cookies are used to combat fraud and misuse.
These cookies will remain on your device until you delete them.</p>
