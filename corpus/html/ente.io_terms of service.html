        Scope of these terms<ol>
<li>
<p>ente ("Drizzle Technologies Private Limited", "we", "us") provides cloud storage with user-controlled encryption.
We provide services ourselves at our website at https://ente.io, subdomains and related sites ("website"), using our mobile apps ("mobile apps"), and our application programming interface (“API”).
Using ente, you and other users can encrypt your files and data by way of user-controlled encryption ("UCE") with a key derived from your "password" (or "passphrase"), upload, access, store, manage, share, communicate, download and decrypt files and other data (all of which we call "data" in these terms) and give access to that data to others (all together, "services" and each, a "service").</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These terms are binding and apply to any use of the services, website and our mobile apps by you and anyone who you allow to access your data or our services.
By using our services, the website or our mobile apps, you and they irrevocably agree to these terms.
If you do not like these terms or don't want to be bound, you can't use our services, the website or our mobile apps.
In particular, OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED SUBJECT TO CERTAIN DISCLAIMERS BY US AND UNDERTAKINGS BY YOU, INCLUDING AN INDEMNITY FROM YOU IF YOU BREACH THESE TERMS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can change these terms at any time by providing you at least 30 days' prior notice of the change, whether via our website, via our mobile apps, by sending you an email or via any messaging service we provide.
Your continued use after that notice means that you agree to the changed terms.
If you have paid for a subscription that is due to expire after that 30 day notice period and you do not wish to continue to use our services under the new terms, you may terminate your subscription before the new terms come into force.
We will then (but not otherwise) refund the unexpired portion of your subscription payment within 30 days and close your account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you comply with these terms, then we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license to access and use our services via the website, our mobile apps and our API if applicable, in accordance with these terms and any plan you have subscribed for.</p>
</li>
</ol>Your data<ol>
<li>
<p>If you allow others to access your data (e.g.
via any of the sharing features within ente), in addition to them accepting these terms, you are responsible for their actions and omissions while they are using our services and you agree to fully indemnify us for any claim, loss, damage, fine, costs (including our legal fees) and other liability if they breach any of these terms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UCE is fundamental to our services.
This means that you, not us, have encrypted control of who has access to your data.
You should keep your password and Recovery Key safe and confidential.
You must not share your password with anyone else and should not release encryption keys to anyone else unless you wish them to have access to your data.
If you lose or misplace your password, you will lose access to your data.
Encryption won’t help though if someone has full access to your system or device.
We strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety and security of your system and devices (e.g.
via unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing and encrypting your devices).
We will never send you emails asking for your password.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must maintain copies of all data stored by you on our services.
There could be a loss of data and we cannot guarantee that the services will be bug free.
You should download all data prior to termination of services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will store and process your data on our service subject to these terms and any plan you subscribe to.
If you choose to stop using our services, you must download your data first because we will schedule your uploaded files for deletion within the next 30 days.
We may still maintain minimal metadata about the now deleted files to ensure that clients who at one point had access to these files can render these deletions gracefully.
Post account-deletion we may also maintain your email address, IP address and user agent information in a hashed form to prevent an abuse of free trials.
If we suspend or terminate our services to you because you have breached these terms, or someone you have given access to has breached these terms, during the term of that suspension we may, if we wish, delete your data immediately or deny you access to your data but keep it for evidential purposes.
In circumstances where we cease providing our services for other reasons, we will, if we consider it appropriate, it is reasonably practicable and we are not prevented by law or likely to incur any liability in doing so, give you 30 days' notice to retrieve your data.</p>
</li>
</ol>Your obligations<ol>
<li>
<p>Once you have subscribed to a plan for our services (with payment having been made via the website, or one of our mobile apps, you need to pay the fees (if any) for that plan (and any other taxes or duties).

We do not review the material before processing the takedown notice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may file a counter-notice if you believe that access to a file you have uploaded has been wrongly disabled because it was the subject of an incorrect takedown notice.
You should only do so if you are confident that no other party owns copyright in the material, or you have rights to store the material and, if you are sharing it, that you have the right to do so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please understand that:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>21.1.
When we receive your counter-notice, we pass it, including your address and other contact information, to the party who issued the original takedown notice.
By submitting your counter-notice you authorise us to do so.</p>
<p>21.2.
Filing a counter-notification may lead to legal proceedings between you and the complaining party.</p>
<p>21.3.
There may be adverse legal consequences in India and/or your jurisdiction if you make a false or bad faith allegation by using this process.</p>
<p>21.4.
If, when using this counter-notice process, you make a false or bad faith allegation or otherwise breach these terms or any of our policies and that causes us any loss, costs (including legal costs), damages or other liability, we reserve the right to claim for and recover from you that loss, those costs (including full legal costs on a solicitor-client basis), damages and other liability, by deduction from any balance in our account and/or by proceedings in India and/or the jurisdiction of the address in your counter-notice.</p>
<p>21.5.
We provide this counter-notice process voluntarily for the purposes of all applicable copyright takedown and counter-notice regimes in India and other jurisdictions, but, in doing so, we do not submit to any jurisdiction, law, tribunal or court other than those of India, as set out in these terms.
We may amend, suspend or withdraw this counter-notice process at any time, provided that any counter-notices in train at that time shall continue to be processed.</p>

Counter-notifications must be submitted from the email address associated with the ente account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we do not receive any further communication from or on behalf of the person who originally submitted the takedown notice, or any communication we do receive does not in our sole opinion adequately justify the original takedown notice, we may, but shall not be obliged to, reinstate the material in approximately 10-14 days provided we have no reason to believe that the material infringes copyright.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in this counter-notice section prejudices our right to remove or disable access to any material at any time, for any reason or no reason.</p>
