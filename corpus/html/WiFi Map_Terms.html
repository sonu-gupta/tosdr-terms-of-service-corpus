<p>These terms of use (“Terms”) apply to persons anywhere in the world<br>
(each such person, a&nbsp;“User” or “you”) who install, access or<br>
use the mobile application (“App”) published by WiFi Map LLC (“WiFi<br>
Map” or “we”).
PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY, AS THEY ARE A<br>
LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND WIFI MAP.</p>
<p>PLEASE BE ADVISED: THESE TERMS CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT GOVERN HOW<br>
CLAIMS THAT YOU AND WIFI MAP HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER CAN BE BROUGHT<br>
(SEE SECTION&nbsp;4 BELOW).
THOSE PROVISIONS WILL, WITH LIMITED<br>
EXCEPTIONS, REQUIRE YOU TO SUBMIT CLAIMS YOU HAVE AGAINST WIFI MAP<br>
TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, NOT AS A<br>
PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS, GROUP OR REPRESENTATIVE<br>
ACTION OR PROCEEDING.</p>
<p>In order to install, access or use the App, you must be of legal age<br>
for those activities in the jurisdiction in which you are located.<br>
If you are not of legal age, you must not install, access or use the<br>
App.</p>
<p>1.
<u>Binding Agreement.
Termination</u>
</p>
<p>Your installation of, access to or use of our App constitutes your<br>
binding agreement to those Terms, including the dispute resolution<br>
and arbitration provisions.
If at any time you disagree with these<br>
Terms, you must refrain from installing our App, or, if you have<br>
already installed our App, refrain from accessing or using it and<br>
delete it.
These Terms contain the entire agreement between you and<br>
WiFi Map, and supersede any prior agreements or arrangements with<br>
you that relate in any way to WiFi Map or the App.</p>
<p>WiFi Map reserves the right to immediately terminate these Terms and<br>
any services provided by WiFi Map, including its publication of the<br>
App and provision of any content, information, functionality or<br>
other services through the App, at any time, either with respect to<br>
you or generally, for any reason, including your violation of these<br>
terms, or for no reason.
The preamble above, this{” “}<br>
<u>Section&nbsp;1, 2–4 and Sections&nbsp;6–19</u> shall survive the<br>
termination of these Terms.</p>
<p>2.
<u>Governing Law</u>
</p>
<p>These Terms, and any claims, disputes or controversies related to<br>
your use of the App or any content, information and related<br>
materials (“<u>Content</u>”) provided through the App or otherwise<br>
related to the relationship between you and WiFi Map, whether<br>
contractual or non-contractual, are governed by the laws of the<br>
State of New York, United States of America, without giving effect<br>
to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule, whether in the<br>
State of New York or any other jurisdiction, that would cause the<br>
laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York to apply.</p>
<p>3.{” “}<br>
<u>Jurisdiction and Venue for Claims not Subject to Arbitration</u>
</p>
<p>The New York state and United States federal courts sitting in New<br>
York County, New York shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any<br>
claims, disputes or controversies related to these Terms, your use<br>
of the App or any Content provided through the App, or otherwise<br>
related to the relationship between you and WiFi Map, whether<br>
contractual or non-contractual, that are not subject to mandatory<br>
arbitration under <u>Section&nbsp;4</u>.</p>
<p>4.
<u>Mandatory Binding Arbitration</u>
</p>
<p>
<u>
<br>
<i>(a) Agreement to Arbitrate</i>
<br>
</u>
</p>
<p>Any claims, disputes or controversies related to these Terms, your<br>
use of the App or any Content provided through the App, or otherwise<br>
related to the relationship between you and WiFi Map, whether based<br>
in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other<br>
legal theory, regardless of when they arise and regardless of any<br>
termination of these Terms, shall be determined by mandatory binding<br>
individual (not class) arbitration.</p>
<p>The arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her<br>
own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the<br>
existence, scope or validity of the this agreement to arbitrate or<br>
to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.
Arbitration is<br>
more informal than a lawsuit in court.
THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN<br>
ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.<br>
There may be more limits on the availability and scope of discovery<br>
than in court.
The arbitrator must follow these Terms and can award<br>
the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees),<br>
except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including<br>
declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties<br>
to the arbitration.
This arbitration provision will survive<br>
termination of these Terms.</p>
<p>
<u>
<br>
<i>(b) Exceptions</i>
<br>
</u>
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding <u>Section&nbsp;4(a)</u>, nothing in these Terms,<br>
including this <u>Section&nbsp;4</u>, will be deemed to waive,<br>
preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to<br>
(i)&nbsp;bring an individual action in a U.S.
small claims court for<br>
a matter within the jurisdiction of that court or (ii)&nbsp;bring an<br>
individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary<br>
individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final<br>
ruling from the arbitrator.
In addition, the agreement to arbitrate<br>
in this <u>Section&nbsp;4</u> doesn’t stop you or us from bringing<br>
issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.
Those<br>
agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your<br>
behalf (or vice versa).</p>
<p>
<u>
<br>
<i>
<br>
(c) No Class or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver<br>
</i>
<br>
</u>
</p>
<p>YOU AND WIFI MAP EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN<br>
YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS<br>
MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.
Unless both<br>
you and WiFi Map agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more<br>
than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a<br>
representative or class proceeding.
The arbitrator may award<br>
injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking<br>
relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted<br>
by that party’s individual claim.
If a court decides that applicable<br>
law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as<br>
to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that<br>
claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in<br>
court.</p>
<p>
<u>
<br>
<i>(d) Arbitration Rules</i>
<br>
</u>
</p>
<p>Either you or WiFi Map may start arbitration proceedings.
Any<br>
arbitration between you and WiFi Map will take place in the English<br>
language under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American<br>
Arbitration Association (“<u>AAA</u>”) then in force (the “<br>
<u>AAA Rules</u>”), as modified by this <u>Section&nbsp;4</u>.
The<br>
Federal Arbitration Act shall apply to, and govern the<br>
interpretation and enforcement of, this provision (despite the<br>
choice of law provision above).
The AAA Rules, as well as<br>
instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA,<br>
appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.
WiFi<br>
Map can also help put you in touch with the AAA.</p>
<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish)<br>
of your residence, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or<br>
less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted<br>
(i)&nbsp;solely on the basis of documents submitted to the<br>
arbitrator.
(ii)&nbsp;through a non-appearance based telephonic<br>
hearing.
or (iii)&nbsp;by an in-person hearing as established by the<br>
AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your residence.</p>
<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required<br>
to pay a filing fee, WiFi Map will reimburse you for that filing<br>
fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case<br>
you will be responsible for the filing fee.
WiFi Map will pay any<br>
other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator<br>
compensation, unless otherwise required by the AAA Rules or court<br>
order.
Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is<br>
conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision<br>
sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on<br>
which the decision and award, if any, are based.
The arbitrator may<br>
make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and<br>
reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding<br>
and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the<br>
arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.</p>
<p>
<u>
<br>
<i>(e) Notice.
Process</i>
<br>
</u>
</p>
<p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written<br>
notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal<br>
Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or if we do not<br>
have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (“<br>
<u>Notice</u>”).
WiFi Map’s address for Notice is: WiFi Map LLC,<br>
Attn: President, 25 Broadway, 9th Floor, New York, NY 10004, USA.<br>
The Notice must (i)&nbsp;describe the nature and basis of the claim<br>
or dispute.
and (ii)&nbsp;set out the specific relief sought (“<br>
<u>Demand</u>”).
You and WiFi Map each shall use good faith efforts<br>
to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement<br>
to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or WiFi<br>
Map may commence an arbitration proceeding.
During the arbitration,<br>
the amount of any settlement offer made by you or WiFi Map shall not<br>
be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a<br>
final decision and award, if any.
All documents and information<br>
disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly<br>
confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient<br>
for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the<br>
enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be<br>
disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know<br>
for such purposes or as required by applicable law.</p>
<p>
<u>
<br>
<i>(f) Enforceability</i>
<br>
</u>
</p>
<p>If the agreement to arbitrate in this <u>Section&nbsp;4</u> is<br>
invalidated in whole or in part, the exclusive jurisdiction and<br>
venue described in <u>Section&nbsp;3</u> shall govern any claim in<br>
court arising out of or related to these Terms.</p>
<p>5.

<br>

</p>
<p>The primary function of our App is crowdsourcing from our Users<br>
information about WiFi hotspots and making that information<br>
available to our Users to help them locate and access WiFi hotspots.<br>
Accordingly, we may, in our sole discretion, permit you from time to<br>

<p>
