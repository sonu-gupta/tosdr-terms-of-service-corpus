Privacy and data consent policy
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>We do not collect any privacy information from our users unless they explicitly agree to share such information with us.</p>
Where do we access user data?
In all apps
<strong>Bug reports&nbsp;</strong>
<p>
<strong>What is collected:</strong> The bug report contains the user’s email address, his locale, version and name of the used software, device firmware version and a portion of the device log.</p>
<p>Sending of a debug report requires user action (needs to be explicitly send from the user’s mail application) and user may review all the information before sending and decide whether they want to share it with us or not.</p>
<p>We do not ask for explicit consent as we consider collecting bug report data via email to be a legitimate interest under GDPR.</p>
<p>
<strong>How it is used by us: </strong>We use information enclosed in the bug report to provide direct customer support and&nbsp;to help improve the quality of our services and applications and analyse</p>
<p>
<strong>Third parties involved: </strong>We use Google GMail&nbsp;(email service) and Help Scout&nbsp;(email helpdesk service) to handle and store email and bug reports.
Place of processing is USA.</p>
<p>
<strong>How to modify or delete the information:&nbsp;</strong>Request modification or deletion on our email.</p>
<p>
<strong>How to opt-out from future communications:&nbsp;</strong>Sending of a debug report requires user action (needs to be explicitly send from the user’s mail application), so there is no need to opt out.
We aren’t initiating any communication by ourselves.</p>
<p>
<strong>Data retention:</strong>&nbsp;The bug reports and conversations related to an app are kept for the lifetime of the app (i.e.
as long as the app is publicly offered).</p>

Data backup
Via Android’s data backup framework
<p>Urbandroid offers data backup through Android’s <em>data backup framework</em>, and, in case of the Sleep as Android app, also through SleepCloud (see here).</p>
<p>Android’s data backup framework uses whichever <em>backup transport</em> is available on the device.</p>
<p>Urbandroid does not have access to the backed up data.</p>
<p>More information about the data backup transport is available at https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/keyvaluebackup.</p>
<p>
<strong>What is collected: </strong>All user-generated app data (including user settings) except files are subject to backup.</p>
<p>
<strong>How it is used by us: </strong>We provide the user with means to back up and restore app data from the data backup framework.
The backup itself is not under our control and none of the data is accessible to us.</p>

<strong>How to modify or delete the information: </strong>To delete the data, backup can be disabled in system settings.</p>
<p>
<strong>How to opt-out from future personal data collection: </strong>To stop backing up the data, backup can be disabled in system settings.</p>
In Sleep as Android
<strong>Usage analytics</strong>
<p>
<strong>What is collected: </strong>All analytics data collected are completely anonymous, i.e.

Location
<p>We do not read device location in our apps unless it is absolutely necessary for the core functionalities of our apps.
We try to use the most coarse information needed for that purpose and retrieve the data in a battery efficient way.
In most of our apps this information never leaves the device by default, unless not specified differently below.</p>
Location in Twilight
<p>The <strong>Twilight</strong> app which needs to timely react on any changes in location with respect to local sunrise and sunset times and adjust screen filtering accordingly.
For this the apps need to access location in background.
Twilight does not collection location and the location information never leaves the device.
Twilight is basically completely offline and the Internet permission is only used to allow Twilight to talk to smart light devices on the local network.</p>
<p>Location retrieval can be disabled in the main screen under <em>Sun &amp.
Location &gt.
Automatic location.</em>
</p>
Location in Air
<p>The core feature of <strong>Air</strong> is to notify the users’ about worsening in pollutant levels at their current location automatically without touching the app.
This can only be done though retrieving location regularly though out the day.
The location information is not stored, but only used to quite the pollutant level server for local data.</p>
<p>Location retrieval cannot be disabled in-app as this would break app’s core functionality.
But users may decide to not grant the location permission to the app.</p>
Location in Sleep as Android
<p>Sleep as Android only retrieves location when the app is used.
typically when sleep tracking starts.
It stores s very coarse geo cell location ~+/-10km at each sleep record to allow users to compare their sleep quality in different locations.
The location does not leave the device unless users explicitly install the <em>SleepCloud Backup addon</em> and decide to send those data to their selected services.</p>
<p>Location gathering and storing at sleep records can be disabled in <em>Settings &gt.
Privacy</em>.</p>
<p>Sleep as Android may query a weather service to show you current weather at your location in the morning.</p>
