<li> Is my response anonymous? <p> This depends now the form creator has configured the service.
We have a range of powerful anonymity features which are enabled by default but can be disabled by the creator.<br>
<br>Your IP address is always pseudonymised before it is recorded with your survey responses and is therefore unavailable to the creator.<br>
<br>
<strong>Anonymous surveys (Default): </strong> This will be anonymous unless you enter any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) into the form.
For survey creators wanting to record the PII separately see mixed mode below.<br>
<br>
<strong>Tracked surveys:</strong> Creators can enable a tracking option which will use tracking links in the URL to link a survey to a known recipient.<br>
<br>
<strong>Mixed mode (Pro customers)</strong> We also offer an advanced feature which allows the creators to mark individual questions as containing PII.
These are then recorded separately from the other answers you give.
We ensure the PII questions and normal question responses are delivered in a random order in our downloads and reports once a configured number of responses have been received to make it difficult to link up.
