To this end and as permitted by law, we may transfer your contact data to Facebook, so that an audience of similar users is built on that basis by Facebook.
Lookalike audiences help reach people who are similar to you for purposes such as customer acquisition, site registration and brand awareness.
We do not provide data subject to the GDPR for Facebook Lookalike Audience.</p>

<strong>Other Sites, Mobile Applications and Services</strong>
<p>The Service may contain links to other websites, mobile applications, and other online services operated by third parties.
These links are not an endorsement of, or representation that we are affiliated with, any third party.
In addition, our content may be included on web pages or in mobile applications or online services that are not associated with us.
We do not control third party websites, mobile applications or online services, and we are not responsible for their actions.
Other websites and services follow different rules regarding the collection, use and sharing of your personal information.
We encourage you to read the privacy policies of the other websites and mobile applications and online services you use.</p>
<strong>Security Practices</strong>
<p>The security of your personal information is important to us.
We employ a number of organizational, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the personal information we collect.
However, security risk is inherent in all internet and information technologies and we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information.</p>
<strong>Retention</strong>
<p>We retain personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, to establish or defend legal claims, or for fraud prevention purposes.</p>
<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
<p>When we no longer require the personal information we have collected about you, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
If we anonymize your personal information (so that it can no longer be associated with you), we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>
<strong>International Data Transfers</strong>
<p>We are headquartered in the United States and may have service providers in other countries.
Accordingly, your personal information may be transferred to the United States, or other locations outside of your state, province, or country, where privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your state, province, or country.
European Union users should read the important information provided below about transfer of personal information outside of the European Union.</p>

<p>The Service is not directed to, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from, anyone under the age of 18.
If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should contact us.
We will delete such information from our files as soon as reasonably practicable.
We encourage parents with concerns to&nbsp;contact us.</p>
<strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong>
<p>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time.
If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by updating the date of this Privacy Policy and posting it on the Service.
We may, and if required by law will, also provide notification of changes to this Privacy Policy using additional methods that we believe are reasonably likely to reach you, such as via e-mail (if you have an Enphase Account where we have your contact information).</p>
<p>Any modifications to this Privacy Policy will be effective upon our posting the new terms and/or upon implementation of the new changes on the Service (or as otherwise indicated at the time of posting).
In all cases, your continued use of the Service after the posting or effective date as stated in the notification of any modified Privacy Policy indicates your acceptance of the terms of the modified Privacy Policy.</p>

Because your consent and actions in relation to those developers/users are a deliberate interaction directing us to provide this information to the developer/user we do not consider this sharing a “sale,” but because we are not always privy to the consent that you provide the developer/user or the nature of those interactions, in some cases our transfer of data may be classified as a “sale” under law.
We also may provide your personal information to installers or their partners for the purpose of introducing that installer or partner to you, but only when you consent or instruct us to do so.
Additionally, in certain circumstances, for example when the installer of your existing system is no longer available, we will pass on your contact information and site information to a follow-on installer to service your system at your direction.
You may nonetheless submit a request to opt-out.
In addition, if you direct us not to sell your Personal Information, we will consider it a request pursuant to California’s “Shine the Light” law to stop sharing your personal information covered by that law with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Opt-out of Sharing.</strong>&nbsp;We use certain advertising services that help deliver an improved advertising experience to you, such as providing interest-based ads to you.
We allow these services to collect information from our website users (specifically, online identifiers and browsing activity) and they use this data to serve interest-based ads to you.
You may submit a request to opt-out of such sharing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Correction.</strong>&nbsp;You may request that we update or correct inaccuracies in your Personal Information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Appeal.</strong>&nbsp;If we decline to take action on your data subject request for any reason, we will provide you a written statement of the reasons why.
you are entitled to an appeal by contacting us with information relevant to the issue, or by contacting your state Attorney General or other privacy protection agency, which may take up the matter depending on your state of residence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Nondiscrimination.</strong>&nbsp;You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination in the form of legally prohibited increases in the price or decreases in the quality of our Service.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>How to Exercise Your Rights</strong>
</p>
<p>You may exercise your privacy rights by any of the methods listed in the “How to Contact Us” section above.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to confirm your residence to process your requests and will need to confirm your identity to process your requests to exercise your information, access/data portability, or deletion rights.
We generally seek to validate your request without collecting any additional personal information and seek to rely for example on information we already have in our possession -- the email address from which you sent the request and/or a recent months’ energy usage.
Consistent with law, you may designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf.
To designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf, you must provide a valid power of attorney, the requester’s valid government-issued identification, and the authorized agent’s valid government-issued identification.
We cannot process your request if you do not provide us with sufficient detail to allow us to understand and respond to it.</p>
