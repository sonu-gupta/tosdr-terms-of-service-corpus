<p>DigitalOcean, LLC <br>Attn: Legal<br>101 Avenue of the Americas, 10th Floor <br>New York, NY 10013</p>Consequences of Sending A DMCA Notice<p>The Company will review your notice for accuracy, validity, and completeness.
If we find that it satisfies these requirements, we will forward the notice to the customer or user associated with the allegedly infringing material.
If the person who posted the material believes that the notice is incorrect or that they have the right to use the material at issue, they may send a counter-notice under Section 512(g)(3) of the DMCA.</p>
<p>Please be aware that under 17 U.S.C.
§ 512(f), you may be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred by us or our users, if you knowingly materially misrepresent that material or activity is infringing.
So before you send a DMCA notice, make sure that you are the actual copyright holder (or are authorized to act on behalf of the owner), that you have a good-faith belief that the material you are identifying is actually infringing, and that you understand the repercussions of submitting a false claim.</p>Repeat Infringer Policy<p>Consistent with the requirements of the DMCA, the Company will terminate, in appropriate circumstances, the accounts of subscribers who repeatedly infringe the copyrights of others.</p>
