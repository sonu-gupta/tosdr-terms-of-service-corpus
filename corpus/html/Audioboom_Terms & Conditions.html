<ul>
<li>
<p>be over 18 and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>possess a valid credit or debit card issued by a bank acceptable to us.</p>
</li>
</ul> What subscription packages does Audioboom offer? <p>We describe the subscription package(s) we offer from time to time on the platform.
Each subscription is sold subject to that description.</p>
<p>By the way, we might change the subscriptions we offer from time to time, including on what basis they are offered, for example whether we charge for them or make them available for free, or what is included in the account (e.g.
advertising, length of clips etc.).</p> Your subscription package says that it is limited to 10,000 or 25,000 plays per month.
What happens if I exceed that? <p>Your account will continue to work as normal, but if your channel consistently exceeds your limit Audioboom will contact you to let you know that we will be moving you to a more suitable plan by a certain date.
If you do not want to be part of the new plan you can cancel your subscription at any time - see below for instructions on how to cancel.</p>
<p>Payment for your new plan will be taken on the date your channel is moved to that plan.
The payment will be pro-rated based on how much time remained on your previous plan.</p> How long is each subscription? <p>You subscribe on a monthly basis (<strong>Monthly Subscription Period</strong>) or an annual basis (<strong>Annual Subscription Period</strong>).
The subscription automatically renews at the end of each period, unless you cancel.</p> Free trial <p>The purpose of any free trial we may offer at the beginning of a subscription is to allow new users to try out our service.
We decide whether you are eligible for that at our sole discretion.
If we think you are not eligible, we reserve the right to revoke the free trial and suspend your account.</p>
<p>If you have multiple subscriptions with us, you will only be offered a free trial for the first subscription you open with us.</p>
<p>Any free trial offered will begin when you receive access to your account (see Step 3 in At What point is a contract made for a subscription).</p>
<p>If you cancel at any time during your free trial period, you will not be charged.
If you are enjoying Audioboom, do nothing and your membership will automatically continue and we will charge you at the subscription rate for your chosen plan.</p> At what point is a contract made for a subscription? <p>Here we describe the steps that are taken to lead to a binding contract between you and us for a subscription.</p>
<p>
<em>If you buy a subscription on our platform:</em>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<em>Step 1</em>
</p>
<p>after selecting the subscription, you’ll be prompted to start setting up your podcast.
You will then be asked to click to confirm that you accept these Terms, Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy.
If you don’t want to agree to our Terms, do not place an order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<em>Step 2</em>
</p>
<p>you are then taken to your Dashboard to set up your podcast.
If you are offered a free trial, you then click on the ‘Start My Free Trial’ button and submit your payment details.
If you don’t have a free trial as part of your subscription, you just enter your payment details.
If you want to cancel your payment details, you can do so on the Billing and Payments section on your Dashboard.
You’ll see an on-screen acknowledgement that your order has been placed and you’ll then receive an email confirming that your order has been placed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<em>Step 3</em>
</p>
<p>we accept your order and a contract for the subscription is made between us at the time we make the account available to you for use.
The only exception to that is if we notify you that we don’t accept your order (see My order has been refused.
What happens now? below).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not keep a record of the contract between you and us, so please print out a copy of any/all your orders and a copy of these Terms, for your own record.</p>
<p>
<em>Offline Advertising Agreement:</em>
</p>
<p>If you enter into an advertising agreement offline with Audioboom, a contract will be made between us (that may include a subscription plan) when both you and we sign a written agreement.
These Terms will also apply to your (and any of your authorised users’) use of the platform.</p> How much does a subscription cost? <p>You will find the total price of your order, when you go to the Billing and Payment page in your Dashboard.
All payment is in USD, please check with your debit or credit card provider for the exchange rate on the day payment is taken.
It is quoted inclusive of VAT.</p>
<p>We may change the price of our subscription packages from time to time.
If we do that, unless we tell you otherwise, any price change will only apply after the next complete month has expired.
So it means you can cancel, before the price change takes effect.</p> How and when do I pay? <p>
<em>Payment method</em>
</p>
<p>We accept various credit/debit cards for payment.
When you place an order you are confirming that you have authority to place the order.
You can change your payment method at any time by clicking on ‘My account’.
If we have been unable to obtain payment, we may suspend your access to our platform, until we have obtained payment.
When you update your payment method you are authorising us to continue charging your new payment method.
This may result in a change to your usual payment date.</p>
<p>
<em>Billing</em>
</p>
<p>You will be charged the first monthly subscription fee on the day after your free trial period expires and a further monthly subscription fee at the beginning of each Monthly Subscription Period after that.
In some cases, your payment date may change, for example, if payment using your chosen payment method was unsuccessful.
Please click on your ‘Account’ to see your next billing date.</p>
<p>It is always possible that, despite our best efforts, a subscription package may be incorrectly priced.
If that happens, then:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>where the correct price is less than the price stated on the platform at the time you placed your order, we’ll charge you the lower amount.
and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>where the correct price is higher than the price stated on the platform at the time you placed your order, we’ll let you know about the error and we’ll give you the option of continuing to buy at the correct (higher) price or cancelling your order.
We won’t process your order until we have your instructions.
If we’re unable to contact you using the contact details you’ve given us, we’ll treat the order as cancelled and let you know.</p>
</li>
</ul> My order has been refused.
What happens now? <p>If we decline your order for any reason, we’ll let you know by sending you an e-mail.
It might be, for example because of an error in pricing or because we can’t process your payment.
If we haven’t been able to process your payment, we may invite you to pay by another method.</p> Cancellation Do I have a right to cancel? <p>If you have an advertising agreement with us (i.e.
a separate off line agreement with us), any rights to cancel will be set out in that agreement.</p>
<p>If you have bought a subscription online, you can cancel at any time.
See What’s the effect of my cancellation? to understand what happens when you cancel.</p> How do I cancel my subscription? <p>Click on Billing and Payment in the Dashboard and select ‘Cancel My Plan’.
Your subscription will then be cancelled upon renewal.</p> What’s the effect of my cancellation? <p>If you cancel, your subscription will stop at the end of your current Monthly Subscription Period.
At that point, your podcast will become private.
You you will no longer be able to upload new content, but you will be able to listen or download your existing content.
Your existing RSS feeds and web embeds will continue to work for a period of 1 month.
After 12 months, Audioboom reserves the right to delete all content and your account.</p>
<p>Once you cancel your subscription it will no longer automatically renew and no further subscription fees will be charged.
If you cancel within the first month of either a Monthly or Annual Subscription Plan you will receive a full refund.
You will not be charged if you cancel during a Free Trial period.</p>
<p>If you are using a Monthly Subscription Plan and cancel during your first paid month you will receive a full refund.
If you cancel after your first month you will not receive a refund, but you won’t be charged the monthly subscription fees after the current Monthly Subscription Period has expired.</p>
<p>If you are using an Annual Subscription Plan and cancel during the first month of an Annual Subscription Period you will receive a full refund of the annual subscription fees paid to us.
If you cancel after the first month of an Annual Subscription Period you will not receive a refund, but you won’t be charged the annual subscription fees after the current Annual Subscription Period has expired.</p>
<p>Except as expressly described in these Terms, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, we will not refund any subscription fees to you that have already been paid to us for the Monthly or Annual Subscription Periods in which you cancel.</p>
<p>You may have additional rights as a consumer under the laws of your country (e.g.
if your account is defective).
These remain unaffected.</p> Our Liability to you What we don’t restrict our liability for <p>Nothing in these Terms restricts our liability relating to:</p>
