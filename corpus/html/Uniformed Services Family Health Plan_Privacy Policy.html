<strong>Privacy and Security on the Public Site</strong>
<p>US Family Health Plan understands that privacy of information is of great importance to our members and the people who visit our website.
We want you to know that US Family Health Plan does not sell information obtained through use of this website to anyone.
In addition, we have established the following privacy and security practices with respect to the public portions of usfamilyhealth.org.</p>
<p>Because we want&nbsp.
the website&nbsp;to better serve visitors’ needs, we collect some basic information about visitors’ computers, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>IP address (the computer’s unique signature)</li>
<li>Operating system (e.g., Windows Vista)</li>
<li>Browser software (e.g., Microsoft Internet Explorer, Firefox)</li>
<li>Internet Service Provider (e.g., AOL)</li>
<li>Geographic location (e.g., Boston, Mass.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The information we collect about visitors’ computers will not be used to identify individuals.
Instead, we check which Web pages and services people use while they are here.
For example, we use the browser information to help us design our website so that as many people as possible will be able to view the pages correctly.
The information helps us determine what parts of the site people like and what parts they don’t, so that we can adjust information appropriately.</p>
<strong>Privacy and Security on the Secured Sites</strong>
<p>The secure member portal that is password protected and requires individuals to register and log-in contains protected health information (PHI) and allows individuals to perform certain transactions (e.g., order an ID card).
Because of this, a user’s activity needs to be linked back to the user’s identity.
For example, when a member changes his or her PCP, we must be able to make that change within our systems and we cannot do that without linking the information back to the member.
In addition, it is important for us to keep track of what functionality a member uses.
Therefore, in the secure member portal, certain identifiable information is collected about users.
This includes information about the user’s computer as listed above, and information related to the user, such as pages visited and PHI submitted or changed.</p>
<p>The confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your PHI are important to US Family Health Plan.
To protect against unauthorized access to PHI that is accessible on the password-protected portions of our site, stringent security standards are followed.
Data transmitted between your browser and the secure member portal is protected by 128-bit encryption.<br>PHI that is collected from users on the secure member portal is confidential.
All PHI US Family Health Plan has regarding our members is available only to authorized users and is protected from unauthorized access by multiple layers of security controls and monitoring.
In addition, PHI that is collected and maintained by US Family Health Plan is used and disclosed only in accordance with our Notice of Privacy Practices in the Member Handbook.</p>
<p>E-mail addresses are collected as part of the registration process for the secure member portal.
These e-mail addresses are used to notify registrants of online activity related to the security and privacy of their accounts, such as retrievals of username.
In addition, e-mail addresses may be used to send members health and wellness information and other updates that might be of interest to them as members of US Family Health Plan.
Each time we send health and wellness information and other updates, the recipient will be given the opportunity to opt out of receiving similar e-mails in the future.
Please note that registrants cannot opt out of receiving e-mails that notify them of online activity, since these are necessary to protect the privacy and security of Web accounts.</p>

<p>We use “cookies” on the public site and the secure member portal to help users better navigate the sites.
They are used only for that distinct purpose.
A “cookie” is a small piece of information sent by our Web server to store on your Web browser.
