         Cookies, Web Beacons and Other Technologies <p>Like most sites, Logitech uses cookies that are essentially small data files placed on your computer, tablet, mobile phone, or other devices (referred to collectively as a "device") that allow us to record certain pieces of information whenever you visit or interact with our sites, services, applications, messaging, and tools, and to recognize you across devices.</p>
<p>Web beacons (sometimes called transparent GIFs, clear GIFs, or web bugs) are small strings of code that provide a way for us to deliver a small graphic image (usually invisible) on a web page or in an email.
Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on your computer such as cookies, the time and date a page is viewed, and a description of the page where the web beacon is placed.</p>
<p>Other technologies, including Web storage and identifiers associated with your device, may be used for similar purposes.
In this notice, we say "cookies" to discuss all of these technologies.</p>
<p>Because cookies are used throughout our websites, disabling them may prevent you from using certain parts of the sites.</p> How We Use Cookies
