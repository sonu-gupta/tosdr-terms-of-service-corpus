<strong>OnDeck Privacy Policy</strong>
</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy has been updated effective October 13, 2020.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Overview</strong>
</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) applies to data collected by On Deck Capital, Inc.
and ODK Capital, LLC, which are wholly owned subsidiaries of Enova International, Inc.
doing business under the OnDeck brand (collectively with their respective subsidiaries and affiliates, “OnDeck,” “Us,” Our” or We”), a provider of business loan products and related services (collectively “Services”).
&nbsp;The Policy has two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Part 1 </strong>provides our U.S.<strong>&nbsp;Privacy Policy,&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;including our Privacy Policy for&nbsp;Ondeck.com (“Website”),&nbsp.
which is owned by &nbsp;Enova and operated by OnDeck.
This Policy describes how OnDeck collects and uses the personal information you provide (directly or through third parties), or which is automatically generated when you interact with our Website, and our mobile application (“Mobile App”).</li>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Part 2</strong>&nbsp;is our California Supplement, which provides our&nbsp;<strong>California Consumer Privacy</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Act&nbsp;of 2018</strong>&nbsp;<strong>(“CCPA”) Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</strong>The CCPA&nbsp.
provides various rights to consumers who reside in California with regard to personal information.&nbsp.
A natural person, including a &nbsp;business owner or guarantor, is considered to be a consumer under the CCPA.&nbsp.
Any terms defined in the CCPA have the same meaning when used in Part 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Part 1: OnDeck US Privacy Policy</strong>
</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update such information.&nbsp.
For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information” means information that personally identifies you, including your contact information, IP address, and loan application information.
A large portion of the Personal Information we collect, use, share, and store is sensitive in nature, including your social security number and financial account information (“Sensitive Personal Information”).</p>
<p>

<ul>

OnDeck is providing these rights to California consumer residents who have provided their personal information as part of an OnDeck application or loan.&nbsp.
This section describes the CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<em>Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights:</em>
</p>

<em>Deletion Request Rights:</em>
</p>
<p>You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions.&nbsp.
Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.</p>
<p>
<em>Exceptions</em>
</p>
<p>We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service providers to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.</li>

<li>Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal.
Penal Code Section 1546 seq.).</li>
<li>Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the deletion of the information may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research’s achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.</li>
<li>Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with expectations based on your relationship with us.</li>
<li>Comply with a legal obligation, such as retaining personal information collected to verify/identify under federal anti-money laundering laws (“AML”).</li>
<li>Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<em>Exercising Access.
Data Portability and Deletion Rights</em>
</p>
<p>To exercise the access, data portability and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable request to us by one of these methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Call:<br>888-556-3483&nbsp;or</li>
<li>E-mail:</li>
</ul>
<p>OnDeck_Privacy@ondeck.com</p>
<p>Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State or other state agency that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a Request related to your personal information.</p>
<p>You may only make a Request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.&nbsp.
The Request must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.</li>
<li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate and respond to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can’t respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we are unable to verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.&nbsp.
Making a Request does not require you to create an account with us.&nbsp.
We will only use personal information provided in a Request to verify your identity or authority to make the request.</p>
<p>
<em>Response Timing and Format</em>
</p>
<p>We endeavor to respond to a Request in writing within 45 days of its receipt.&nbsp.
If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.&nbsp.
If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account.&nbsp.
If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.&nbsp.
Any disclosures we provide will cover the 12-month period preceding the receipt of the Request.&nbsp.
The response we provide will also explain the reasons we can’t comply with a request, if applicable.&nbsp.
For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide the information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>
<p>We do not charge a fee to process or response to your Request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.&nbsp.
If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>
<p>
<strong>Non-Discrimination</strong>
</p>
<p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of these rights.&nbsp.
Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not, because you have exercised rights under the CCPA:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deny you goods or services.</li>
<li>Charge you different prices for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.</li>
<li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
