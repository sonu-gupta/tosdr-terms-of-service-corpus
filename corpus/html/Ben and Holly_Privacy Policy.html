<p>Parents or guardians should read this Privacy Policy and explain to any children using this website and/or mobile app the implications of this Privacy Policy.</p>
About us
<p>This website and/or mobile app is operated by Entertainment One UK Limited, a company registered in England and Wales, with company number 02989602, and whose registered office is at 45 Warren Street, London, W1T 6AG, UK (eOne, we, us).</p>
<p>We are committed to protecting your privacy.
This privacy policy (Privacy Policy) tells you how we collect, store, process and use your/your children’s personal information when you use this website and/or mobile app (the Services).
It also provides you with details about your rights in relation to your/your children’s personal information.
You should read this Privacy Policy in conjunction with our&nbsp;Terms of Use</p>
<p>Our legal status is that of a “data controller” and in this capacity we will securely store and process your/your children’s personal information which you/your children have provided to us or which we otherwise collect.
Data controller is a legal term used in EU legislation to signify the person who controls what to do with any given personal information.
We are registered as a data controller with the Information Commissioner’s Office (registration number Z9919769).</p>
Children
<p>The Services are designed partly for children.
Therefore we are aware that we must be extra cautious when processing personal information.
Most of our Services contain a children’s section (the “Children’s Area”) and a separate parents’ (or guardians’) section (the “Grown-Up Area”).
In the Children’s Area, children mainly participate only by playing games, reading e-books and/or watching videos.
We generally do not offer any place in the Children’s Area where a child can sign up or enter personal information themselves.
Typically, the only part of the Services where anyone can enter personal information directly is the Grown-Up Area.
Accordingly, in most cases, we do not anticipate that we will be collecting personal information directly from any children.
We anticipate and assume that we will be collecting personal information only from parents or guardians.</p>
<p>If you are under the age of 13, you may only use the Services and provide personal information if you have the consent of, and are supervised by, a parent or guardian.</p>
<p>If we believe a child using the Services is under 13 we will not process any personal information of that child without the consent of the parent or guardian.
If the user is 13 or over we will only collect and process personal information as the long as we believe the user understands what is involved.</p>

Legal basis for processing your personal information
<p>We will only process your/your child’s personal information where we have a legal basis to do so.
The legal basis will depend on the purposes for which we have collected and use the personal information.
In almost every case the legal basis will be one of the following:</p>
<p>• Consent: For example, where you have provided your consent to receive certain marketing from us.
You can withdraw your consent at any time, including by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of any marketing email we send you.</p>
<p>• Our legitimate business interests: Where it is necessary for us to understand our customers, promote our services and operate effectively as a provider of children’s content and related services, provided in each case that this is done in a legitimate way which does not unduly affect your or your child’s privacy and other rights.</p>
<p>• Compliance with law: Where we are subject to a legal obligation and need to use your personal information in order to comply with that obligation.</p>
