<p>
<strong>EAB’s Commitment to Privacy.&nbsp;</strong>EAB is deeply committed to maintaining the privacy and security of confidential and sensitive information we may collect, retain, process, or transfer or which is provided to us directly by our clients.</p>

<p>
<strong>Scope of your institution’s privacy policies.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;If you are an employee, student, prospective student, or other end user of our client, and we are collecting your personal information in connection with the products and services we provide to our clients, we are a data processor.

</p> End User of an Institution That Uses Our Products <p>
<strong>Your institution decides how your personal information is used.&nbsp;</strong>We provide nearly all of our products and services to end users of an institution as a “data processor” on behalf of our clients (e.g., colleges, universities, and school districts).
This means that the main responsibility for data privacy compliance lies with your institution as a “data controller.” It also means that your institution’s privacy policy governs the use of your personal information (rather than ours).
Your institution determines what information we collect through our products and services and how it is used, and we process your information according to your institution’s explicit instructions.</p>

<p>
<strong>Do Not Track Signals.
</strong>Currently, various browsers – including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari – offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to websites visited by the user about the user’s browser DNT preference setting.
With respect to our Virtual Tour Program, EAB does not currently commit to responding to browsers’ DNT signals with respect to our websites, in part, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent.</p> Other types of disclosures <p>We will also share your information to the extent required in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>To comply with legal or regulatory requirements and to respond to lawful requests, court orders, and legal processes.</li>

<li>To process transactions when you use our services to make a deposit to one of our clients, we will share your payment and transaction data with third party payment processors.</li>
<li>To carry out operational tasks for legitimate business purposes.</li>
</ul> Children’s Privacy <p>EAB’s products and services are not intended for children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect any information from children.
If we learn that we have collected or received personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information upon request.
Please contact us at&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>privacy@eab.com</strong>&nbsp;if you believe we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under 13 without proper consent.</p> Security <p>In order to protect personal information, EAB has established a data privacy program based on the ‘privacy by design’ framework which proactively embeds privacy protection into the design of our IT systems, networked infrastructure, business practices, and software applications.
We employ a variety of physical, administrative, and technological safeguards designed to protect personal information against loss, misuse, and unauthorized access or disclosure.
We have dedicated information security programs and work hard to continuously enhance our technical and operational security measures.</p>
<p>Specifically, EAB aligns its policies with the ISO 27001 framework.
We maintain a comprehensive list of policies and procedures that are readily accessible by all workforce clients via an internal portal.
Information is encrypted at rest on laptops, removable devices, and at the data centers we partner with for our technology products and services.
EAB requires the secure transmission of personal information to and from our network.
we work with clients to discourage transmission that is otherwise not secure.
This is accomplished through a combination of secure technologies like SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) for in-transit encryption of bulk file transfers and SSL/TLS encryption in transit for web traffic.</p>
<p>Datacenter controls include the use of SOC-audited data centers with physical controls including multi-factor authentication for access, 24×7 monitoring, video monitoring, and locked cages.
We also have active detection (IDS monitoring, log consolidation, alerting) and prevention (IPS, firewall, security zones) programs to protect personal information, and vetted third party providers for centralized audit logging capabilities.</p>
<p>All of our products and services that use payment data maintain the applicable Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance levels.</p> Specific Regional &amp.
