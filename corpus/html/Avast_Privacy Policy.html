<strong>On the basis of legal obligations</strong>,&nbsp;we process your Personal Data when it is necessary for compliance with a legal tax, accounting, anti-money laundering, legal order, or other obligation to which we are subject.</p>
<p>
<strong>On the basis of our legitimate interest</strong>&nbsp;we will use your Personal Data for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communications about possible security, privacy and performance improvements and products that supplement or improve our purchased products and to optimize the content and delivery of this type of communication;</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the above mentioned processing operations, we have balanced your interests against our interests.
In any case, you have the right to object, on grounds relating to our particular situation, to those processing operations.
For more details please see section Your Privacy Rights .</p>Balancing Legitimate Interests <p>Before relying on our legitimate interests, we balanced them against your interests and made sure they are compelling enough and will not cause any unwarranted harm.
With respect to the purposes below we consider necessary to explain what our interests are in detail.</p>Systems, Apps and Network Security<p>We process Personal Data for network and information security purposes.
In line with EU data protection law, organizations have a recognized legitimate interest in collecting and processing Personal Data to the extent strictly necessary and proportionate for the purposes of ensuring network and information security.
This primarily covers the ability of a network or of an information system to resist events, attacks or unlawful or malicious actions that could compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of stored or transmitted data, or the security of the related services offered by, or accessible via those networks and systems.</p>
<p>Both as an organization in our own right, and as a provider of cybersecurity technologies and services which may include hosted and managed cybersecurity technology services, it is necessary for the functionality of our systems, products and services and in our legitimate interests as well as in our users’, to collect and process Personal Data to the extent strictly necessary and proportionate for the purposes of ensuring the security of our own, and of our users’ networks, devices, and information systems.
This includes the development of threat intelligence resources aimed at maintaining and improving on an ongoing basis the ability of networks and systems to resist unlawful or malicious actions and other harmful events (“cyber-threats”).
</p>
<p>The Personal Data we process for said purposes includes, without limitation, network traffic data related to cyber-threats such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sender email addresses (e.g., of sources of&nbsp;SPAM);</li>
</ul>
<li>Recipient email addresses (e.g., of victims of targeted email cyberattacks including&nbsp;phishing);</li>
<li>Reply-to email addresses (e.g., as configured by cybercriminals sending malicious email);</li>
<li>Filenames and execution paths (e.g., of malicious or otherwise harmful executable files attached to emails);</li>
<li>URLs and associated page titles (e.g., of web pages broadcasting or hosting malicious or otherwise harmful contents).
and/or</li>
<li>IP addresses (e.g., of web servers and connected devices involved in the generation, distribution, conveyance, hosting, caching or other storage of cyber-threats such as malicious or otherwise harmful contents).</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on the context in which such data is collected, it may contain Personal Data concerning you or any other Data Subjects.
However, in such cases, we will process the data concerned only to the extent strictly necessary and proportionate to the purposes of detecting, blocking, reporting (by removing any personally identifiable elements) and mitigating the cyber-threats of concern to you, and to secure your network, device and systems.
When processing Personal Data in this context, we do not seek to identify a Data Subject.</p>In-product and Email Messages<p>We have a legitimate interest for messaging our users about possible security, privacy and performance improvements and products that supplement or improve purchased products.</p>
<p>If you are our customer, we feel a responsibility to inform you about security and utility improvements and possible problems to your device and software that go beyond our product that is installed and provide you with effective solutions relevant to these problems, which may include also our own solutions.
We thus have legitimate interest to optimize the content and delivery of this type of communication to you so that you will be most likely to find them relevant and non-intrusive at the same time.</p>New Product Development<p>We have a legitimate interest to use necessary Personal Data to develop new products or features so that we are able to provide you with state-of-the-art security, privacy and performance products.</p>Third-party Analytics Tools (user acquisition, user interactions) <p>We have a legitimate interest to use necessary Personal Data for third-party analytics to understand user conversions, acquisitions and campaign performance through various distribution channels, and users’ download, activation and interactions with our products because these analytics help us maintain functionality, effectiveness, security and reliability of our products and business activities.</p>How We Process Your Personal Data<p>We do our best to disconnect or remove all direct identifiers from the Personal Data that we use:</p>
<li>For free versions, this disconnection or removal of identifiers begins when the products and services are initially activated.
For paid users we keep Billing Data in a separate database and minimize its use for anything other than handling payments and our own finances.
</li>
<li>For both paid and free versions, we continuously monitor for, minimize, disconnect and remove all direct identifiers during the normal performance of the products and services.</li>Processing of IP Addresses<p>For paid products including antivirus, virtual private network (“VPN”), and performance, your IP address is collected at the time at which your product or service is being provided, for the purpose of facilitating our billing process.
Specifically, our third-party billing partner will collect your IP address for its billing process.
we do not store the IP address from this process.</p>
<p>For free and paid products including antivirus, your IP address is also processed for the purpose of downloading certain products and malware detection.
</p>
<p>Please refer to our Products Policy for specific use of IP address by our products and services.</p>No Automated Decision-Making, Including Profiling<p>We do not take any decisions involving the use of algorithms or profiling that significantly affects you.</p>How We Disclose Your Personal Data<p>We only disclose your Personal Data as described below, within our group, with our partners, with service providers that process data on our behalf and with public authorities, as required by applicable law.
Processing is only undertaken for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and the relevant Products Policy sections.
If we disclose your Personal Data, we require its recipients to comply with adequate privacy and confidentiality requirements, and security standards.</p>Payment processors<p>If you opt to pay for use of our services, we will use a third party payment processor to take payment from you.
These third parties are properly regulated and authorized to handle your payment information and are prohibited from using your Personal Data for any other purposes other than arranging these services for us.
However, they are independent controllers of your data with their own responsibility.</p>
<p>These are our long-term payment processors:</p>

<p>Your Billing Data is processed by the payment processor from whom you purchased the product.
Your data is processed according to the relevant processor’s privacy policy.
</p>Service Providers<p>We may use contractors and service providers to process your Personal Data for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and Products Policy .
We contractually require service providers to keep data secure and confidential.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such service providers may include in particular contact centers, professional consultants (including for defence or exercise of our rights), and marketing/survey/analytics/software suppliers.</p>
<p>Sometimes these service providers, for example, our distributors, resellers, and app store partners, will be independent controllers of your data and their terms and conditions, end user license agreements (“EULA”) and privacy statements will apply to such relationships.</p>Advertising Companies<p>To be able to offer our products and services for free, we serve third-party ads of advertising companies in our products for mobile devices.
To enable the ad, we embed a software development kit (“SDK”) provided by an advertising company into the product, which then collects Personal Data in order to personalize ads for you.
</p>
<p>Please note that only few of our free products serve third-party ads.
You will be asked for consent during the installation process of such product.
For further information, including the exact scope of processed Personal Data and names of relevant products, please refer to our Consent Policy which includes the list of our advertising partners and their privacy policy.</p>Distributors, Resellers<p>We may provide your Personal Data to our partners for the purpose of&nbsp;distribution, sale or management of our products.
Our partners may use your Personal Data to communicate with you and others about Avast products or services.
In addition, you purchase our products directly from our distributor, a reseller, or an app store.
Because your relationship in these cases is with that distributor, reseller or an app store, such third party will also process your Personal Data.</p>Cookies Providers<p>Our websites use cookies to personalize your experience on our sites, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, help us measure the effectiveness of campaigns, and give us insights into user interactions and user base as a whole so we can improve our communications and products..
While using our websites, you will be asked to authorize the collection and use of data by cookies according to the terms of the Cookie Policy .</p>Analytics Tool Providers<p>We use analytical tools, including third-party analytical tools, which allow us to, among other things, identify potential performance or security issues with our products, improve their stability and function, understand how you use our products, and websites, so that we can optimize and improve your user experience, as well as evaluate and improve our campaigns.
We use Service and Device data for analytics.</p>
<p>While we generally prefer using our own analytical tools, we sometimes need to partner with other parties, which have developed and provide us with their own tools and expertise.
Below, we list these partners and tools and their privacy policies.</p>

<p>Please note that not all of our products use all of these third-party analytics tools.
Analytics tools that we use for diagnosing your product are necessary for service provision.
You will find relevant tools listed under each product in our Products Policy .
</p>Public Authorities<p>In certain instances, it may be necessary for us to disclose your Personal Data to public authorities or as otherwise required by applicable law.
No Personal Data will be disclosed to any public authority except in response to:</p>
<ul>
<li>A subpoena, warrant or other process issued by a court or other public authority of competent jurisdiction;</li>
</ul>
<li>A legal process having the same consequence as a court-issued request for data, in that if we were to refuse to provide such data, it would be in breach of local law, and it or its officers, executives or employees would be subject to liability for failing to honor such legal process;</li>
<li>Where such disclosure is necessary for us to enforce its legal rights pursuant to applicable law.
or</li>
<li>A request for data with the purpose of identifying and/or preventing credit card fraud.</li>Mergers, Acquisitions and Corporate Restructurings<p>Like any other company, we too go through its own cycle of growth, expansion, streamlining and optimization.
Its business decisions and market developments therefore affect its structure.
As a result of such transactions, and for maintaining a continued relationship with you, we may transfer your Personal Data to a related affiliate.</p>
<p>If we are involved in a reorganization, merger, acquisition or sale of our assets, your Personal Data may be transferred as part of that transaction.
We will notify you of any such deal and outline your choices in that event, when applicable.</p>Cross-Border Transfers of Personal Data among Avast Entities and to Third-Party Vendors<p>We are a global business that provides its products and services all around the world.
In order to reach all of our users and provide all of them with our software, we operate on an infrastructure that spans the globe.
The servers that are part of this infrastructure may therefore be located in a country different than the one where you live.
In some instances, these may be countries outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”).
Regardless, we provide the same GDPR-level of protection to all Personal Data it processes.</p>
<p>At the same time, when we transfer Personal Data outside of the EEA, we always make sure to put in place appropriate and suitable safeguards, such as standardized contracts approved by the European Commission or specialized regimes such as Privacy shield, which legally bind the receiving party to adhere to a high level of protection, and to ensure that your data remains safe and secure at all times and that your rights are protected.</p>
<p>Situations where we transfer Personal Data outside of the EEA include provision of our products and services, processing of transactions and your payment details, and the provision of support services.
Further, an outside-EEA transfer may also occur in case of a merger, acquisition or a restructuring, where the acquirer is located outside of the EEA (see the Mergers, Acquisitions and Restructurings section).</p>How We Protect Your Personal Data<p>We maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards for the protection of your Personal Data.</p>Administrative Safeguards<p>Access to the Personal Data of our users is limited to authorized personnel who have a legitimate need to know based on their job descriptions, for example, employees who provide technical support to end users, or who service user accounts.
In the case of third-party contractors who process personal information on our behalf, similar requirements are imposed.
These third parties are contractually bound by confidentiality clauses, even when they leave.
Where an individual employee no longer requires access, that individual's credentials are revoked.</p>Technical Safeguards<p>We store your personal information in our database using the protections described above.
In addition, we utilize up-to-date&nbsp;firewall &nbsp;protection for an additional layer of security.
We use high-quality antivirus and&nbsp;anti-malware &nbsp;software, and regularly update our&nbsp;virus &nbsp;definitions.
Third parties who we hire to provide services and who have access to our users' data are required to implement privacy and security practices that we deem adequate.</p>Physical Safeguards<p>Access to user information in our database by Internet requires using an encrypted VPN, except for email which requires user authentication.
Otherwise, access is limited to our physical premises.
Physical removal of Personal Data from our location is forbidden.
Third-party contractors who process Personal Data on our behalf agree to provide reasonable physical safeguards.</p>Proportionality<p>We strive to collect no more Personal Data from you than is required by the purpose for which we collect it.
This, in turn, helps reduce the total risk of harm should data loss or a breach in security occur: the less data we collect, the smaller the overall risk.</p>Children’s Privacy<p>We have products and services designed specifically to assist you as a parent by providing child online protection features.
In such cases, we will only collect and process Personal Data related to any child under 13 years of age, which you choose to disclose to us or otherwise instruct us to collect and process.
Details about this processing is included in our Products Policy .
Please refer to the specific applicable notices for this information.</p>How Long We Store Your Personal Data<p>We will hold your Personal Data on our systems for the following periods: </p>
<li>For Billing Data, for as long as we have a legal obligation or for our legitimate interests in establishing legal rights.
</li>
<li>For Account Data, for as long as you maintain your account.
</li>
<li>For Product Data, only as long as necessary for the purposes of a particular product or service.
We use rolling deletion periods which means we regularly delete collected data in the given periods starting from the collection of that respective data.
The rolling deletion periods for Product Data are not longer than six years.
You can find specific rolling deletion periods for each of our products and their purposes in our Products Policy .
Please note that when you uninstall our product, processing for service provision, in-product messaging, third-party analytics and third-party ads, if applicable, dependent on the installed product shall cease.
After the uninstallation, we will continue to process your Product Data for statistical purposes for up to six years, however, we have appropriate measures in place, including pseudonymization.
</li>Storage of Your Personal Data<p>The data we collect from you may be stored, with risk-appropriate technical and organizational security measures applied to it, on in-house as well as third-party servers in the Czech Republic, in the United States, as well as anywhere we or our trusted service providers and partners operate.
</p>
<p>In all cases, we follow generally accepted standards and security measures to protect the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.

<li>Right to information - Right to receive information about the processing of your Personal Data, prior to processing as well as during the processing, upon request.</li>

<li>Right to restriction of processing - You have the right to restriction of processing of your Personal Data if: You are contesting the accuracy of your Personal Data, for a period enabling us to verify the accuracy of your Personal Data.

In all cases, we strive to fulfill your request.</p>
<p>We will action your request within one month of receiving a request from you concerning any one of your rights as a Data Subject.
Should we be inundated with requests or particularly complicated requests, the time limit may be extended to a maximum of another two months.
If we fail to meet these deadlines, we would, of course, prefer that you contact us to resolve the situation informally.</p>
<p>Where requests we receive are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, we may either: (a) charge a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action requested.
or (b) refuse to act on the request.</p>
<p>For the free versions, we do not and will not maintain, acquire or process additional information solely in order to identify the users of our free products and services.
This is simply not necessary for the free versions of our products to be provided to you and function.
