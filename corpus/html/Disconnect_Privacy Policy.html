such as a legitimate and properly scoped court order, or a search warrant supported by probable cause and issued by an appropriate law enforcement authority.
We interpret requests narrowly, and we will oppose unlawful or overbroad requests for specific user data.
</p>
<p> Recipients of&nbsp;National Security Requests can only publish reporting bands instead of specific figures.
If we receive such a request, we may challenge these reporting bands, in addition to opposing any unlawful or overbroad requests.
