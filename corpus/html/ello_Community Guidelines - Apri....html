         Community Guidelines <p>Ello was created by idealists who believe that the essential nature of all human beings is to be good — kind, considerate, helpful, intelligent, responsible, supportive and respectful of others.
However, this does not mean that everyone always acts accordingly.
Therefore, we’ve created a list of community guidelines that we ask all Ello members adhere to.
Members found to be acting outside of our guidelines risk account suspension or removal from Ello.</p>
