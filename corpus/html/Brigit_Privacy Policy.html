General Disclosures
<p>The below are disclosures related to information that we may collect, use, or disclose outside of the context of U.S.
financial information laws.</p>
<p>
<em>
<b>Contact Information</b>
</em>
</p>
<p>We may collect your contact information, to the extent you provide it to us, such as by signing up for a blog post, emailing us, or otherwise submitting an inquiry to us via our Website or Services.
We use service providers to assist in our customer support and mailing communications, such as Zendesk and MailChimp, respectively.</p>
<p>
<em>
<b>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</b>
</em>
</p>
<p>Brigit uses “cookies” and similar technologies (e.g., pixel tags, SDKs) to track your use of the Website and Services.
These technologies collect information in relation to your experience on our Website and Services, such as pages clicked, navigation path, bounce rates, actions taken (typically called “events”), and other metrics.</p>
<p>We and our vendors use these technologies to optimize our Website and Services and understand user engagement in relation thereto.</p>
<p>
<em>What Are Cookies?</em>
</p>
<p>Essentially, cookies are small files that are stored within your browser and store data in relation to your visit to our Website or Services.</p>
<p>Cookies serve a variety of purposes, such as securely maintaining your authenticated session and preferences (e.g., remembering log-in details or other settings), understanding your use of the Website or Services, and servings ads (whether our own ads on third-party websites or services or others’ ads on our Website or Services) based on your interests or actions.
Each cookie typically has a pseudonymous ID associated with them (a set of randomized characters, typically alphanumeric) and may also store information related to your device or browser, such as IP address, browser and Operating System type, device type, etc.</p>
<p>
<em>What Are “Pixel Tags”?</em>
</p>
<p>Essentially, pixel tags are small pieces of JavaScript in a webpage or email used to (a) store the cookies mentioned above and (b) track when the page or email has been viewed.
The mobile app equivalent could be considered an “SDK” (software development kit).
We will refer to either as pixel tags for purposes of simplicity.</p>
<p>With respect to (a) above, pixel tags often create the cookies that are stored on your browser.
Then, when you revisit a site, the pixel tag will recognize such cookie and “read” the information stored within, typically sending it to the server (typically either Brigit’s or a third-party vendors, depending on whose pixel it belongs to).</p>
<p>Relatedly, with respect to (b) above, pixels will often send data to a server (again, typically depending on whose pixel it belongs to) when a set of user-initiated “events” occur, such as clicking on an ad, a button on the Website, a link in an email (or the fact that you opened the email), or other information related to your browser or device, such as a device identifier or other information similar to what is described in the <em>“What Are Cookies?”</em> section above.
We may have access to this data via dashboards or APIs.</p>
<p>
<em>Opt-Out</em>
</p>
<p>Most Internet browsers are set up to accept cookies automatically.
You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, allowing you to decide whether or not to accept those cookies, block all third-party cookies (cookies dropped by third-party vendors), or all cookies generally (both Brigit’s and third-party vendors’ cookies).
Users choosing not to accept any cookies or similar technologies may not be able to take full advantage of the Website or Services.</p>
<p>Brigit uses services such as Google Analytics, Segment, Facebook Analytics, Hotjar, Bing Ads, and Snap Pixel to carry out the types of activities described above (e.g., advertising and analytics).
To opt out of interest-based advertising (IBA), you could visit one of the following websites, to the extent that a third-party partner participates in such industry self-regulatory frameworks: Ad Choices Opt-Out Page.
Further, you may want to visit the websites of our partners, which may provide an opt-out for any tracking over time and across third-party websites.</p>
<p>
<em>
<b>Server Logs</b>
</em>
</p>
<p>Like most websites today, our servers may keep log files that record data each time a device accesses our Website or Services.
The log files may contain data about the nature of such access, including the device’s IP address, user agent string (e.g., operating system and browser type/version), and referral URL (i.e., the external source by which you arrived at our Websites or Services, or the pages you’ve clicked on while on our Websites or Services).
We may use these log files for purposes such as assisting in monitoring and troubleshooting errors and incidents, analyzing web traffic, or optimizing the user experience.</p>
<p>
<em>
<b>Marketing Communications</b>
</em>
</p>
<p>You can manage your receipt of marketing communications by clicking on the “Unsubscribe” (or similar) link located on the bottom of an applicable Brigit marketing email and following the instructions found on any page to which the link may take you.
Note, however, that you cannot opt-out of transactional or administrative emails.</p>
<p>
<em>
<b>Retention</b>
</em>
</p>
<p>Brigit retains your personal information for as long as it is deemed necessary and relevant by Brigit for Brigit’s operations unless a longer or different retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>
<p>
<em>
<b>Your California Privacy Rights</b>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>“Do Not Track”</em>
</p>
<p>We don’t respond to “Do Not Track” signals or similar mechanisms at this time.</p>
<p>
<em>
<b>Other Disclosures</b>
</em>
</p>
<p>In addition to the purposes described above, we may collect, use, or transfer your information (a) as part of, or during negotiations of, a merger, consolidation, sale of our assets, as well as equity financing, acquisition, strategic alliance or in any other situation where personal information may be transferred as one of the business assets of Brigit, (b) for purposes of responding to requests by law enforcement, regulators, and other government bodies, (c) in aggregated or anonymized fashion for further analysis and optimization of the Website or Services, (d) for our everyday businesses purposes, or (e) as otherwise permitted by applicable law.</p>
