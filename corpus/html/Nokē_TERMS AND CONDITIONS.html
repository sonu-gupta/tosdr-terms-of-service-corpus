You are encouraged to change your Password regularly and to select a strong password (i.e., 12+ characters and a combination of upper and lower case, symbols (e.g., !@#$%), and numbers).
You are responsible for requesting Nokē to issue to you a new Password if needed for any reason.
Repeated incorrect attempts to log-on may result in deactivation of your Password, in which event you will need to request Nokē to issue to you a new Password.
In the event of a security breach of your Password, you shall provide such assistance to Nokē as may be requested by Nokē in the investigation of any unauthorized use and any enforcement proceedings in connection therewith.</li>

You will be responsible and liable for any use of the Software by any person to whom you make your ID or Password available or to whom you otherwise make available any portion of the Software, as well as for all acts and omissions of others who use your ID whether or not such person’s use of your account or Password was authorized by you.</li>
