requesting that the content be removed.
The notice must include: (a)

counter-notice.
You may read more information about the DMCA at http://www.loc.gov/copyright.
</p>
<p>

YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR DISSATISFACTION WITH THE SITE IS TO STOP USING THE SITE.

We reserve the right to take exclusive control and defense of any claim, and you will cooperate fully with us in asserting any available defenses.</p>
Disputes, Including Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action
Waiver
<p>
<strong>ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM RELATING IN ANY WAY TO YOUR USE OF THE SITE, OR TO PRODUCTS OR SERVICES SOLD, DISTRIBUTED, ISSUED, OR SERVICED BY US OR THROUGH US, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION, RATHER THAN IN COURT</strong>, with the following exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>You may assert claims in small claims court if your claims
apply;</li>
<li>If a claim involves the conditional license granted to you
as described in the Ownership of Content and Grant of Conditional
License section (Section 3) above, either of us may file a lawsuit in a federal
or state court located within Los Angeles County, California, and
we both consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such
purposes.
and</li>
<li>In the event that the arbitration agreement in these Terms
is for any reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against
us (except for small-claims court actions) may be commenced only in
a federal or state court located within Los Angeles County,
California, and we both consent to the jurisdiction of those courts
for such purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The arbitration agreement in these Terms is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), including its procedural provisions, in all respects.
This means that the FAA governs, among other things, the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration agreement and all of its provisions, including, without limitation, the class action waiver discussed below.
State arbitration laws do not govern in any respect.</p>
<p>This arbitration agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted and will survive termination of these Terms.
The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to the extent permitted by law to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable.</p>
<p>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.
However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages) and must follow these Terms as a court would.
For the avoidance of doubt, the arbitrator can award public injunctive relief.</p>
<p>
To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter
requesting arbitration and describing your claim to: Live Nation
Entertainment, Inc., 9348 Civic Center Drive, Beverly Hills, CA
90210, Attn: General Counsel.
You may download the forms located at http://www.jamsadr.com.
The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS under its Streamlined
Arbitration Rules and Procedures or, if applicable, its
Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, and any applicable
supplemental rules including its Consumer Arbitration Standards of
Minimum Fairness.
The JAMS Rules are available online at http://www.jamsadr.com
or by calling (800) 352-5267.
Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by JAMS’s rules.
We will automatically reimburse administration and arbitrator fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 regardless of who the prevailing party is (unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous), but we will not pay for attorneys’ fees unless ordered to do so by the arbitrator.
You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.
</p>
