You agree that, in the event you conduct a search for yourself on the Websites or you authorize another person else to conduct a search for you on the Websites, you have expressly consented to the use and display of information about you (including, without limitation, your name and other attributes of your identity) on the Websites for any and all commercial and non-commercial purposes.
Moreover, by submitting a Review to the Review Page, you automatically grant the Company, for a period of ten (10) years, renewable at the Company’s option, a royalty-free, irrevocable, non-exclusive, assignable, transferable and sublicensable right and license to use, reproduce, modify, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, transmit, perform, and display such content or information (in whole or in part) contained in the Review worldwide for any purpose and/or to incorporate into other works in any form, media, or technology now known or later developed for the full term of any rights that may exist in such content or information.
You hereby represent that you have all necessary rights to make the Review available to the Company and the Websites, and you also acknowledge and agree that such Reviews are non-confidential for all purposes and that the Company has no control over the extent to which any idea or information within a Review may be used by any party or person once such content is posted or displayed on the Websites.
Accordingly, notwithstanding this right and license, you hereby acknowledge and agree that by merely permitting your information, content, and materials to appear on the Websites, the Company has not become and is not a publisher of such information, content, and materials and is merely functioning as an intermediary to enable you to provide and display your Review.
Moreover, the Company assumes no responsibility for the deletion of or failure to store any Review and recommends that you do not post, display, or transmit any confidential or sensitive information.
All users shall remain solely and exclusively responsible for any liability arising from their own Reviews.</p> 3.
Arbitration And Class Action Waiver
<p>EXCEPT WHERE PROHIBITED BY LAW, YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT ALL CLAIMS, DISPUTES OR CONTROVERSIES BETWEEN YOU AND THE COMPANY (including disputes against any agent employee, subsidiary, affiliate, predecessor in interest, successor, or assign of the other), ITS PARENTS, AFFILIATES, SUBSIDIARIES OR RELATED COMPANIES, relating to our Websites, the SERVICES AND MATERIALS published by the Company on or through the Websites, any transaction or relationship between us resulting from your use of our Websites, communications between us, or the purchase, order, or use of our MEMBERSHIP PLANS, the information provided in connection with our background information services, and your use of our background information services, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, TORT AND CONTRACT CLAIMS, CLAIMS BASED UPON ANY FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL STATUTE, LAW, ORDER, ORDINANCE OR REGULATION, AND THE ISSUE OF ARBITRABILITY, SHALL BE RESOLVED BY THE FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION PROCEDURES SET BELOW.
THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ANY SUCH CLAIMS SHALL BE BROUGHT SOLELY IN THE PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY.
THE PARTIES FURTHER AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.
THE PARTIES VOLUNTARILY AND KNOWINGLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT THEY HAVE TO A JURY TRIAL.
ANY CONTROVERSY CONCERNING WHETHER A DISPUTE IS ARBITRABLE SHALL BE DETERMINED BY THE ARBITRATOR AND NOT BY THE COURT.
JUDGMENT UPON ANY AWARD RENDERED BY THE ARBITRATOR MAY BE ENTERED BY A CALIFORNIA STATE OR FEDERAL COURT HAVING JURISDICTION THEREOF.
THIS ARBITRATION CONTRACT IS MADE PURSUANT TO A TRANSACTION IN INTERSTATE COMMERCE AND ITS INTERPRETATION, APPLICATION, ENFORCEMENT AND PROCEEDINGS HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT ("FAA").</p>
<p>
<strong>The following procedures shall apply:</strong>
</p>
<p>In the event a party elects to proceed with binding arbitration, it shall provide written notice thereof to the other party by registered or certified mail and shall describe in such notice, with reasonable particularity, the nature and basis of such claim and the total amount of the claim.
Within thirty (30) days of receipt of such notice, the party receiving notice of a claim shall provide a written response which, with reasonable particularity, sets forth its position concerning the claim.
If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute arising from the claim by good faith negotiations to be conducted within the thirty (30)-day period following the written response, either of them may initiate binding arbitration pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth herein.
The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and will be administered by the AAA.
If the AAA is unavailable or refuses to arbitrate the parties' dispute for any reason, the arbitration shall be administered and conducted by a widely-recognized arbitration organization that is mutually agreeable to the parties, but neither party shall unreasonably withhold their consent.
The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org.
Unless otherwise agreed, the arbitration shall take place in the capital city of the state in which the consumer resides, but may proceed telephonically in the event the total amount of the claim does not exceed $2,500 U.S.
dollars (if the claimant so chooses).</p>
<p>
<strong>BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL</strong>.
In arbitration, a dispute is resolved by a neutral arbitrator or panel of arbitrators, rather than by a judge or jury.
Arbitration is more informal than a court trial.
however, an arbitrator can award the same relief that a court can award.</p>
<p>Separate and apart from the agreement to arbitrate set forth above, the parties hereby independently waive any right to bring or participate in any class action in any way related to, or arising from, this agreement.
You acknowledge that this class action waiver is material and essential to the arbitration of any disputes between the parties and is nonseverable from the agreement to arbitrate claims.
If any portion of this class action waiver is limited, voided, or cannot be enforced, then the parties' agreement to arbitrate shall be null and void.
<strong>YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, WHICH CONTAINS THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER, YOU MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY, ITS AGENTS, OFFICERS, SHAREHOLDERS, MEMBERS, EMPLOYEES, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, PREDECESSORS IN INTEREST, SUCCESSORS AND/OR ASSIGNS IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER, YOU MUST TELL US IN WRITING AND NOT USE OUR WEBSITES OR MEMBERSHIP PLANS.</strong>
