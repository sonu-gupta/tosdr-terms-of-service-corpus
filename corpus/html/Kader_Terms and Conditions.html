Kader provides a service (the “Service”) that allows its customers (“Customers”) to access Kader’s network of contractors (“Kaderos” or “you” or “Contractor”) to identify local providers to meet intermittent needs for services.
The Kaderos have access to the Application to receive and review requests for services from Customers and to determine their interest in and availability to respond to such requests.</p>
<p>
<b>Acknowledgment and Acceptance of Independent Contractor Services Agreement</b>
</p>
<p>This Independent Contractor Services Agreement (“Terms of Use” or “Agreement”) is an electronic contract that sets out the legally binding terms of the relationship between Kader and you.
By registering to become a Kadero, you accept and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.
Please read it carefully.
By accessing the Application, or becoming a Kadero, you accept this Agreement and agree to the terms, conditions and notices contained and/or referenced herein.</p>
<p>Kadero reserves the right to change this Agreement, and add additional terms at any time, effective upon making the modified provisions available on the Application or by notifying Kaderos directly.
You are responsible for regularly reviewing the Terms of Use for modifications and updates to its terms.
Continued use of the Application after any such changes are made to this Agreement shall constitute your consent to such changes.
Other than making the changes available on the Application, Kader does not assume any obligation to notify Kaderos of any changes to this Agreement, or the creation or modification of any additional terms.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that you are able to electronically receive, download, and print this Agreement, any other terms, notices, forms and any other notices or documents required by, or incorporated into, this Agreement by reference, any amendments to this Agreement, or any other items required by regulation or law.
Further, you agree to keep the contact information in your Account current at all times including, but not limited to, your email address, physical address, and phone number.</p>
<p>Use of the Application is permitted only by individuals who can form legally binding contracts under applicable law.
Without limiting the foregoing, you must be at least 18 years old [or the age of legal majority in the jurisdiction in which you work] and legally authorized to work in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan to become a Kadero.

Definitions</p>
<p>Capitalized terms are defined as set forth below or elsewhere in the Agreement.</p>
<p>
<b>1.1</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>“Services”</b>&nbsp;means the services described in a Kader Request for services by a Kadero to a Kader Customer.</p>
<p>
<b>1.2</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>“Kader Request</b>” means a notice provided, through the Application, to one or more Kaderos, which includes a description of the services to be provided by the Kaderos, the times at which the Kader Request begins and must be completed, and the fee associated with the Kader Request (the “Payment”).
An open request is a request for services that has not yet been accepted by a Kadero (“Open Request”).
Kaderos can use the Application to review Open Requests and to indicate their availability for Open Requests.
Once a Kadero has accepted a Kader Request pursuant to Section 2, the Kader Request will become a “Kader Engagement”.</p>

<p>
<b>2.1&nbsp;Customer Conditional Offer Requirements and Privacy Information.</b>&nbsp.
Some customers may require completion of certain steps or requirements after you accept a Kader Request before you perform the Kader Request (“Conditional Offer Requirements”).&nbsp.
Any Conditional Offer Requirements will be explained after you accept the Kader Request.&nbsp.
Failure to complete such Conditional Offer Requirements to the satisfaction of the Customer will result in your inability to perform accepted Kader Requests.&nbsp.
Please note that some of the Conditional Offer Requirements will require Kader or a designated third-party provider to ask for your social security number and share it with entities who require the information to facilitate the Conditional Offer Requirements.&nbsp.
Kader may also share your social security number with our payment vendor, in order to verify your payment account to ensure the safety of your account.</p>
<p>
<b>2.2 Best Efforts.</b>&nbsp;By registering to become a Kadero and accepting an Open Request, you agree to use your best efforts to perform the Kader Engagement such that the Services meet the requirements and specifications of the Customer, for whom the Open Request was created.
Once a Kadero has accepted a Kader Request, the Open Request will no longer be available for performance by other Kaders who received the Open Request.
By accepting an Open Request, you are entering into a binding legal agreement to provide the Services for the Payment specified in the Open Request.
Do not accept an Open Request unless you are sure that:&nbsp.
(1) you understand what you are being asked to deliver.
(2) you can perform the Services identified in the Open Request.
(3) you can deliver the Services in the requested time period.
and if required, you can get to and from the Customer’s location.
If you fail to show up at the Customer location by the specified start time as noted on the Kader Request, Kader or Customer in their sole discretion may cancel the Kader Request without any penalty.
Failure to timely deliver the Services consistent with the Customer’s requirements and specifications will constitute a breach, resulting in non-payment.
Further, in the event of such a breach, you will be responsible for payment of any additional fees (e.g., rush fees) or costs incurred as a result of your failure to timely complete the Open Request in accordance with the Customer requirements.
You agree to not possess, sell, receive, or operate under the influence of any drugs or alcohol while performing any Kader Engagement.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>3.
Independent Contractor Relationship</p>
<p>Nothing in this Agreement is intended or should be construed to create a partnership, joint venture, or employer-employee relationship between Kader and you or between the Customer and you.
You will take no position with respect to or on any tax return or application for benefits, or in any proceeding directly or indirectly involving Kader that is inconsistent with your being an independent contractor (and not an employee) of Kader.
You are not the agent of Kader or the Customer and you are not authorized, and must not represent to any third party that you are authorized, to make any commitment or otherwise act on behalf of Kader or the Customer.</p>
<p>As an independent contractor, you are solely responsible for determining which Open Requests you will choose to accept and how, when and where you will provide the Services under this Agreement.</p>
<p>Kader does not restrict the Kaderos right to provide services through other parties, including competitors of the Kader Mobile Application.
Kader expects the individual performing services as a Kadero will provide services for other parties;</p>
<p>Kadero acknowledges and represents Kadero can earn income from other sources.
Kader does not guarantee the Kadero any minimum amount of Kader Engagements;</p>
<p>Kader does not provide a performance assessment for Kaderos, and does not oversee the actual work or instruct the individual as to how the work will be performed, or the method or process the Kadero uses to perform services;</p>
<p>Kader does not pay a salary or hourly rate but rather facilitates Requestor’s payment of the rate set by the Requestor;</p>
<p>Kader does not terminate the work during the term of this Agreement unless the Kadero violates the terms of this Agreement or fails to produce a result that meets the specifications of the Agreement;</p>
<p>Kader does not provide training, tools, equipment, benefits, or expense reimbursement to the Kadero;</p>
<p>Kader does not dictate the time of performance;</p>
<p>Kader does not combine its business operations in any way with the Kadero’s business, but instead maintains such operations as separate and distinct.
Kadero shall have no legal authority to enter into contracts on Kader’s behalf or otherwise bind Kader in any way.</p>
<p>Kadero is responsible for obtaining and maintaining any required registration, licenses, or other authorization necessary for the services Kadero renders.</p>
<p>Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:</p>
<p>
<b>3.1</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Benefits and Contributions.</b>&nbsp;You are not entitled to or eligible for any benefits that Kader, its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates or other related entities may make available to its employees, such as group insurance, profit-sharing or retirement benefits.
Because you are an independent contractor, Kader will not withhold or make payments for social security, make unemployment insurance or disability insurance contributions, or obtain workers’ compensation insurance on your behalf.</p>
<p>
<b>3.2</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Taxes.</b>&nbsp;You are solely responsible for filing all tax returns and submitting all payments as required by any local, or foreign tax authority arising from the payment of Payments to you under this Agreement, and you agree to do so in a timely manner.
You will comply with all applicable local, and foreign laws governing self-employed individuals, including laws requiring the payment of taxes, such as income and employment taxes, and social security, disability and other contributions.
To the extent required by the local tax services, Kader will report the Payments paid to you for services rendered as part of Kader engagements.
You agree to indemnify Kader for the cost of any tax liabilities incurred by Kader as a result of your failure to pay all applicable taxes in a timely manner.</p>
<p>
<b>3.3 &nbsp;Third Party Payment Processing Services.</b>&nbsp;Payment processing services for Kaderos are provided by Elaf Payment Solutions (“<b>Gate to Pay</b>”) and are subject to the&nbsp;Gate to Pay Wallet Holder Agreement (collectively, the “Gate to Pay Services Agreement”).
These documents can be found at the provided links or by using a search engine (such as Google or Bing) to seek the terms “Gate to Pay Connected Account Agreement” or “Gate to Pay Terms of Service,” respectively.” By agreeing to these terms or continuing to operate as a Kadero on Kader, you agree to be bound by the Gate to Pay Agreement, as the same may be modified by Gate to Pay from time to time.
As a condition of Kader enabling payment processing services through Kader, you agree to provide Kader accurate and complete information about you and your business, and you authorize Kader to share it and transaction information related to your use of the payment processing services provided by Kader.&nbsp.
You further authorize Kader to electronically debit your Gate to Pay account and, if necessary, electronically credit your account to correct erroneous debits.</p>

Kader specifically denies any obligation to defend and/or indemnify you from and against any third party claims made against you arising from any negligent or intentional act or omission committed by you in connection with the performance of any Kader engagement.</p>
<p>

Service Request</p>
<p>Customer may from time to time submit a Service Request to Kader via the Application.

Fees And Payment</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>
<b>3.1 &nbsp;Fees.</b>&nbsp.
Kader charges fees and collects payment for each Service Engagement.
&nbsp;&nbsp;You agree to provide Kader with complete and accurate billing and contact information, including but not limited to, Customer’s legal name, street address, e-mail address, and the name and telephone number of an authorized billing contact.
You agree to update this information within thirty (30) days of any change to it.
If the contact information you have provided is false or fraudulent, Kader reserves the right to terminate your access to the Service, and any outstanding Service Engagement, in addition to pursuing any available legal remedies.
Generally, you will be billed each day for services provided that day.
&nbsp;Special payment arrangements may be made when appropriate.
&nbsp;The Service Fee for engaging a Kadero as an independent contractor is a percentage of the Payment amount and is generally for creating, hosting, administering, maintaining and providing the Application (collectively, the “Invoice Amount”).
&nbsp;A Service Request shall be considered complete once the Deliverables have been accepted by Customer in accordance with Section 4.
The charge for Service Engagements that involve Kader’s payroll application for hiring Kaderos as employees will be determined based on the type of engagement and geographic location of the Kadero&nbsp;and that is mutually agreed upon by Kader and you.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>
<b>3.2 &nbsp;Taxes.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Kader’s fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including but not limited to value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any local, state, provincial, federal or foreign jurisdiction (collectively, “Taxes”).
Customer is responsible for paying all Taxes associated with its purchases hereunder.
If Kader has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which Customer is responsible under this section, the appropriate amount shall be invoiced to and paid by Customer.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>
<b>3.3 Direct Hire&nbsp;Fee</b>.&nbsp.
In the event Customer or any Customer director, officer, or employee (collectively, “Customer Personnel”) desires to Hire or otherwise directly engage a Kadero outside of the Kader Application in the twelve (12) months following Customer’s or any Customer Personnel’s last contact with Kadero through the Kader Mobile Application, Customer will notify Kader and subsequently Customer will be billed and Customer agrees to pay a sum based on the number of hours worked by the Kadero for the Customer.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>Customer shall pay to Kader any Hiring Fee owed on the same schedule as the payment of all other fees or invoices to Kader.
&nbsp;In the event Customer does not notify Kader within thirty (30) days that it has Hired a Kadero, Customer shall be obligated to immediately pay to Kader $2,000 for each such Kadero it has Hired.
&nbsp;The amounts described in both instances (<i>i.e.,</i>&nbsp;with or without notice from Customer) shall be referred to as the “Hiring Fee”.</p>
<p>Such Direct Hire Fee shall be charged regardless of whether: (a) Kadero contacts Customer or applies to Customer independently or otherwise through a public job posting or other job board.
