Whistleblower system <p>Bundesdruckerei operates a whistleblower management system in order to meet its special responsibility as a federal government security company.
This system can be used at any time to report a situation that violates the values or policies of the Group or its business ethics or that has a negative impact on the life or health of individuals ('whistleblowing').
In addition to regular information and reporting channels, suspected cases can also be reported anonymously if necessary.
Bundesdruckerei is in charge of this procedure, but it takes place under the joint responsibility of D-Trust GmbH.
The point of contact for the persons concerned is Bundesdruckerei.
