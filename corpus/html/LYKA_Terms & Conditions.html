Wallet &amp.
Our Service Fee <ol>
<li>
<p>It is important to understand that we are not a bank and that we do not act as a fiduciary or escrow holder in respect of any balance in your Wallet.
The Wallet functionality is provided by Blue Cat and is subject to Blue Cat T&amp;C.
LYKA is not providing the Wallet and is not responsible or liable for its operation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to fund a Wallet with GEMs, payments for the issuance of GEMs by Blue Cat must be made through any permitted payment method available from time to time under “BUY GEMS” in the account owned by the relevant registered LYKA user.
Payments to, and surrenders from Wallet will be handled by Blue Cat and any of its third party payment processors, such as PayPal.
LYKA will at no time hold or handle your debit or credit card or bank account information.
All legal compliance matters relating to anti-money laundering and/or data privacy, including implementation of Know-Yoour-Client protocols are governed by the terms and conditions of Blue Cat’s chosen payment processing provider at any given time.
AS such, any concern relating to the same must be coursed through the chosen payment processing provider directly and not with LYKA.
LYKA will reflect the GEMs in your Wallet once Blue Cat confirms with LYKA the receipt of payment in cleared funds, or when another user sends you GEMs in accordance with this Agreement.</p>

<li>
<p>No LYKA app user may be the user of more than one Wallet registered through the LYKA App.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Payments received by Blue Cat for GEMs bought by a user is not considered income of Blue Cat, instead it is a fund kept in trust by Blue Cat until the GEMs are used by the user for the purchase of goods or service with a LYKA Merchant.
Payment by Blue Cat will be directed by LYKA to such LYKA Merchant upon surrender by the latter to Blue Cat of the GEMs used by a user to pay for goods or services.
Please note that no interest will be paid on any balance in your Wallet.
In using the LYKA app, you warrant and accept responsibility in paying any and all taxes that arise from your personal transactions through any LYKA Service.
Blue Cat, from time to time, may issue you more GEMs (than the value paid for in GEMs) as a marketing strategy or promotion to convince you and other users to use the GEMs.
These marketing GEMs do not earn interest, neither are they interest earned from existing GEMs in you’re Wallet, nor are they a gift or donation by Blue Cat to you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to surrender GEMs for conversion to fiat currency, we or any LYKA Merchant may require you to provide at least one (1) valid government-issued photo ID (such as a passport or driver’s licence), in case of doubt as to the legality of your transactions or the identity of the true owner of the GEMs, which ID may likewise be shared with Blue Cat.
Please note that the surrender options of GEMs, from your Wallet may vary depending upon your country of residence and may also vary from time to time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blue Cat will try to process all conversions of GEMs to fiat currency upon surrender as soon as possible, but neither Blue Cat nor LYKA can or shall be responsible for payment processing, banking clearance or other matters that may delay conversions.
Please ensure you provide your account details accurately to us and Blue Cat and/or its third party payment processors.
You are solely responsible for any errors in information we receive from you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All payments to and from an Wallet must be made in your Wallet's base currency (i.e.
the currency in which your Wallet is maintained).

Blue Cat may change the amount it charges from time to time by notifying you or the LYKA Merchant through the LYKA Service in accordance with Clause 12.3.
