and its affiliates (collectively, "Huawei", "we", "us", or "our") respect your privacy.
Therefore, we have developed a Privacy Statement (hereinafter referred to as "this Statement") that covers how we collect, use, disclose, protect, store and transfer your personal data.
Please take a moment to read and understand our privacy statement and let us know if you have any questions.</p>
<p>Personal data means any electronic or other information which alone or jointly with other information can be used to identify a natural person or make him/her identifiable.
This Statement explains how Huawei processes your personal data, but does not cover all processing scenarios as you will be informed in specific processing activity.
Therefore, before using a specific product or service, it is recommended that you read the privacy notice or supplementary statement released by Huawei for that product or service to understand how it processes your personal data, how you can exercise your data subject rights, and how to contact the data controller.</p>
<p>This Statement applies only to Huawei personal and home products, including feature phones, smartphones, laptops, tablets, smart screens, wearable devices, mobile broadband devices, smart household appliances, accessories, computer applications, mobile services, software, toolkits, websites, and services that display or mention this Statement.</p> How Huawei Collects and Uses Your Personal Data <p>A.
Personal Data Collected by Huawei</p>

Here are some examples of personal data we may collect:</p>

<p>Huawei may provide you with cloud storage services where you can sync and back up some of your files, pictures and data.
</p>

When you use a Huawei product to share things with your family and friends, you may need to create a HUAWEI ID that includes certain information which will be made public, including a nickname and avatar.
Huawei may collect information related to those people, such as their names, email addresses, and phone numbers.
Huawei will take appropriate and necessary measures to ensure the security of the information that you provide.
You must ensure that the people, whose information you provide, have consented to you providing their information to Huawei.</p>
<p>To meet some jurisdictions' requirements on real-name authentication of accounts, prevention of electronic game addiction, or Internet payment, Huawei might ask you to provide a proof of identity issued by the government or relevant card information that can identify you.</p>

The notification may take the form of an email, text message, push notification, etc.
If it is difficult to notify data subjects one by one, we will take appropriate and effective measures to release a Security Notice.
In addition, we will also report the handling status of personal data security incidents as required by supervisory authorities.</p> How You Can Manage Your Personal Data <p>A.
