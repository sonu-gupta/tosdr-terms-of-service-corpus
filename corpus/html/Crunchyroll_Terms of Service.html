Access to Certain Content: Fees and Billing.
<p>Crunchyroll Members may be able to access and/or purchase Crunchyroll Content (as defined below) through the Site or Services in a few different ways including: (i) Crunchyroll Members can pay a monthly membership fee to view certain Crunchyroll Content for the applicable time period ("Membership Fee").
or (ii) Crunchyroll Members may initially sign-up for a free trial and then convert such free trial to a membership to view Crunchyroll Content via a Membership Fee.
PAYMENTS ARE NONREFUNDABLE AND THERE ARE NO PRORATED REFUNDS OF ANY FEES UPON ANY TERMINATION OR CANCELLATION.
Fees are refundable in Ellation's sole discretion.
You agree to immediately pay any amounts accrued, but remaining unpaid, as of termination (if any).
You hereby authorize Ellation to collect fees by charging the credit card you provide to us as part of your Crunchyroll account information, either directly or indirectly via a third party online payment service, such as PayPal ("Payment Method").</p>
<p>Your access to Crunchyroll Content may start with a free trial.
The free trial period of your membership lasts for seven (7) days, or as otherwise specified during sign-up.
For combinations with other offers, restrictions may apply.
Free trials are for new and certain former members only.
Ellation reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to determine your free trial eligibility.</p>
<p>We will begin billing your Payment Method for monthly Membership Fee at the end of the free trial period of your membership unless you cancel prior to the end of the free trial period.
To view the specific details of your membership, including the monthly Membership Fee, visit the Site and click on the "Your Account" link available at the top of the pages of the Site.
You will not receive a notice from us that your free trial period has ended or that the paying portion of your membership has begun.
We will continue to bill your Payment Method on a monthly basis for your membership fee until you cancel.</p>
<p>By starting your Crunchyroll membership and providing or designating a Payment Method, you authorize us to charge you a monthly Membership Fee at the then current rate, and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the Service to your Payment Method.
You acknowledge that the amount billed each month may vary from month to month for reasons that may include differing amounts due to promotional offers, including gift card redemption and promotional code redemption, and/or changing or adding a channel or bundle, and you authorize us to charge your Payment Method for such varying amounts, which will be billed monthly in one or more charges.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to adjust pricing for our service or any components thereof in any manner and at any time as we may determine in our sole and absolute discretion.
Except as otherwise expressly provided for in these Terms of Use, any price changes to your service will take effect in accordance with the time frame outlined in the email notice to you.</p>
<p>The Membership Fee for the Service will be billed at the beginning of the paying portion of your membership and each month thereafter unless and until you cancel your membership.
We automatically bill your Payment Method each month on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your paying membership.
We reserve the right to change the timing of our billing, in particular, as indicated below, if your Payment Method has not successfully settled.
In the event your paying membership began on a day not contained in a given month, we may bill your Payment Method on a day in the applicable month or such other day as we deem appropriate.
For example, if you started your Crunchyroll membership or became a paying member on January 31st, your next payment date is likely to be February 28th, and your Payment Method would be billed on that date.
Your renewal date may change due to changes in your membership.
As used in these Terms of Use, "bill" shall indicate a charge, debit or other payment clearance, as applicable, against your Payment Method.</p>
<p>You may edit your Payment Method information by visiting our website and clicking on the "Your Account" link, available at the top of the pages of the Site.
If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not edit your Payment Method information or cancel your account (see, "Cancellation" below), you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts and authorize us to continue billing the Payment Method, as it may be updated.
This may result in a change to your payment billing dates.
For certain Payment Methods, the issuer of your Payment Method may charge you a foreign transaction fee or other charges.
Check with your Payment Method service provider for details.</p>
<p>You may cancel your Crunchyroll membership at any time, and you will continue to have access to the Site and/or Services through the end of your monthly billing period.

Arbitration.
<p>Arbitration Agreement.
All disputes arising out of, relating to, or in connection with these Terms of Use or your use of the Site and/or Services that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court will be resolved through binding arbitration on an individual basis, except you and Ellation are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>Arbitration will be initiated through the American Arbitration Association ("AAA").
In the event the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.
The rules of the arbitral forum will govern all aspects of this arbitration, except to the extent those rules conflict with these Terms.
The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules ("AAA Rules") governing the arbitration are available online at&nbsp;www.adr.org&nbsp;or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.
The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator.</p>
<p>If the claim is for $10,000 or less, the party initiating the arbitration may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.
In the case of an in-person hearing, the proceedings will be conducted at a location which is reasonably convenient for both parties with due consideration of the ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances.
If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination will be made by the arbitration institution.</p>
<p>Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be limited to those fees set forth in the AAA Rules with the remainder paid by Ellation.
If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the arbitration is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
In such case, you agree to reimburse Ellation for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.
Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.
The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.</p>
<p>The arbitrator will decide the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Ellation.
The dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.
The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute.
The arbitrator will have the authority to award all remedies available under applicable law, the arbitral forum's rules, and the Terms.
The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.
The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Ellation.</p>
<p>You and Ellation waive any constitutional and statutory rights to go to court and have a trial in front of a judge or a jury.
Rather, you and Ellation elect to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration.
In any litigation between you and Ellation over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, you and Ellation waive all rights to a jury trial, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p>
<p>YOU AND ELLATION AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
If this specific provision is found to unenforceable, then the entirety of this provision shall be null and void, and all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as specified in Section 13 above.</p>
<p>YOU MAY OPT-OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.
If you do so, neither you nor Ellation can force the other to arbitrate.
To opt-out, you must notify Ellation in writing no later than thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this arbitration agreement.
Your notice must include your name and address, and the email address you used to set up your Crunchyroll account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt-out of this arbitration agreement.
You must send your opt-out notice to one of the following physical or email addresses: Ellation, LLC., ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out, 444 Bush Street, San Francisco, CA 94108.

Relationship of the Parties.
<p>Notwithstanding any provision hereof, for all purposes of these Terms of Use each party will be independent and act independently and not as a contractor, partner, joint venturer, agent, employee or employer of the other and will not bind nor attempt to bind the other to any contract.</p> 17.

The failure of a party to enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision.
You may not assign or transfer these Terms of Use (by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of Ellation and any prohibited assignment will be null and void.
Ellation may assign these Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent.
You agree that these Terms of Use and the rules, restrictions and policies contained herein, and Ellation's enforcement thereof, are not intended to confer and do not confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than you and Ellation.
