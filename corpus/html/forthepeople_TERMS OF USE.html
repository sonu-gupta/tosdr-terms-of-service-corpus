Some states have a two-year period for negligence injury claims.
the time period in other states may be longer or shorter.
Insurance policies, particularly homeowners insurance, may require that suit be filed within one year of a loss.
Some states allow claims against government agencies, but require a written notice very soon after the accident, perhaps within three months.
