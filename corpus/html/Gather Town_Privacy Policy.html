<br>Opening Statement<p>Gather does its best to make sure your data is safe and that your privacy is respected.</p>
<p>This starts with us internally acknowledging and understanding any incentives that we might have that might be misaligned with the health and interests of our users.
We then try to minimize or counteract those incentives so that we can systematically be trusted to make the right choices as often as possible.
This approach applies not just to our incentives as an organization or as a company, but also as a team and as individuals.</p>
<p>This attention to our alignment with our users shows up both in our choice of what ideas to pursue and also in the implementation of those ideas.
We design our services to use the minimum amount of data needed for us to provide those services and to minimize how much of that data has to pass through our own servers or stay in storage.
We also strive to use and design technologies and user interfaces that make it really clear to our users how our systems work.</p>
<p>Implementing all of this is a never-ending process and we have a lot of work left to do just to reach our current targets for user safety and privacy.</p>
<p>In the meantime, this page will describe or provide links to the data practices for this website and any of the services that we offer.</p>
<br>
<br>Product-specific Policies<p>The following sections describe policies and practices specific to each of Gather’s services.
We have two services: the "Mapmaker" (at https://gather.town/mapmaker) and the "Gather App" (all other parts of our website).</p>Gather App<p>Here are some of our data practices that we use for the Gather App:</p>
<ul>
<li>We do NOT store or view any user video/audio.
They are encrypted in transit, not end-to-end, which is the same encryption policy taken by services like Google Meet</li>
<li>By default, we store chat messages on our servers.
There is a space-wide option available to the host that allows them to turn this off and store all chats locally, though chat messages will no longer persist between sessions.</li>
<li>We store any images or documents that you upload to Gather in build mode.
They are encrypted at rest in cloud storage.</li>
<li>If you log into our site, we store your email address, when you created your account, and the last time you logged in.</li>
<li>We keep store metadata about our spaces, including:<ul>
<li>Which map that space was created with</li>
<li>The unique URL for that space</li>
<li>A salted hash of the space password, if there exists one</li>
<li>Who created the space, and who are the moderators</li>
<li>The list of emails and names in the guestlist, if any is set</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We store anonymized metrics, like how many users visit our site in total, or how many seconds are spent on video everyday.
This helps us understand the usage of the Gather App, which helps us what to prioritize.</li>
<li>We store small bits of information that let us run our service, like the name you set in a room, whether or not you’ve indicated that you’re over 13, or what spaces you have access to.</li>
<li>If you use our feedback form, we store your message, along with your name and email if you provide them.
This lets us read and respond to your feedback</li>
<li>We use Google Analytics on all of our webpages.
You can learn more about how Google Analytics collects and processes your data on the following page: “How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps.”<ul>
<li>We use Google Analytics to count and log the number of unique visitors on each page of our websites and to understand where that traffic is coming from.
Both of these help inform our writing and decision-making so we can provide this service to you..</li>
<li>We only chose to use Google Analytics after reading through their privacy policy and deciding that it met our standards.
If this choice doesn’t meet your standards, you can disable this feature on our websites below.
If you'd like to disable this feature across your web browser, Google provides an add-on that prevents your data from being used by Google Analytics on other websites.
As always, we also welcome you to tell us about your concerns.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>If you'd like to disable Google Analytics on "gather.town" and all its subdomains, just click here:DisableMapmaker<p>Here are some of our data practices that we use for the Mapmaker, specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>We store everything you upload to mapmaker.
This includes background images and assets.
Everything uploaded is encrypted at rest in cloud storage.</li>
<li>We store metadata about the map, like what squares are impassable, where the spawn points are, and who owns what maps.</li>
<li>We do not share maps with other users unless you explicitly share it yourself, invite them to a space with your map, or give us explicit consent.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>We made these lists of practices in an effort to be informative beyond the typical legal requirements, so that you get a better picture of how your data is being used.
It might not be completely exhaustive.
Refer to later sections in this document for a more general policy.</p>
