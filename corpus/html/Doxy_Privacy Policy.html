<b>If You are a Provider</b>
<p>This section applies only if You sign up and have been given access to a Provider account.
Some features are not activated automatically and require explicit authorization by You.</p>
<b>Types of Data Collected</b>
<b>Personal Data</b>

<li>Position or title*</li>
<li>National Provider Identifier (NPI)*</li>
<li>States licensed to practice*</li>
<li>Mobile number*</li>
<li>Country, phone number **</li>
</ul>
<p>
<i>* This information is optional.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>** Only required if using Stripe payment services.
this information is not stored in the Service.</i>
</p>
<p>By using the Service, You allow Us to contact You by email regarding Service features, changes, maintenance, and other products that may be introduced from time-to-time.
In addition, if You enable email notifications within the Service, We will send You an email notifying You that a Patient is waiting in the Waiting Room.</p>
<p>If You wish to be notified by text message that a Patient is waiting in the Waiting Room, You may optionally provide Your mobile number.</p>
<p>All Your data are processed in secure and HIPAA-compliant cloud services using HealthCare Blocks.
This allows Us to focus on creating solutions where high security and privacy are enabled by default.
We use industry-best security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or unauthorized destruction of all Your data.&nbsp;</p>
<b>Single Sign-On</b>
<p>You may elect to login to the Doxy.me Service via a third-party authentication service.
This is called Single Sign-On (SSO) and means that You must first authenticate to that third-party identity provider prior to accessing the Service.
Facebook and Google identity connectors are built into the Service for the You to optionally use.
Also, doxy.me offers a custom feature whereby You may specify Your own SSO service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By using SSO, You will be transferred to an authentication agent for that particular identity provider where Your login credentials (usually a name and password) are used to verify Your identity.
Doxy.me does not have access to credentials used by a third-party identity provider.
Once You have authenticated via SSO, a token is returned to Us indicating that Your identity has been verified and You will be granted access to the Service.</p>
<b>Invitations</b>
<p>You may invite Patients to Sessions by the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Email sent by the Service</li>
<li>Email sent by Your computer or smartphone email system</li>
<li>Email sent by a web service (e.g., Gmail, Hotmail)</li>
<li>Mobile text message</li>
<li>Calendar&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Any information You enter into the invitation will be used to create and send the message.
Once that task is completed, the information is no longer used and is permanently deleted.</p>
<b>Screenshare</b>
<p>The Service provides a feature whereby You may share all or part Your computer screen with the Patient or You may request to view the Patient’s screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are obvious privacy issues associated with sharing one’s screen.
It is up to You to ensure that no sensitive or confidential information (other than that which the Patient is allowed to see) is viewable during the screensharing session.</p>
<p>Conversely, it is up to the Patient to ensure that there is no sensitive or confidential information on their screen prior to agreeing to the screenshare.</p>
<b>Protected Health Information (PHI)</b>
<p>Although the Doxy.me Service is targeted to the healthcare community, no PHI is collected during the video conference between Patient and Provider.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any health or other sensitive information You discuss or share with Your Patient is encrypted over a secure channel using the SSL Internet protocol.
Doxy.me will not, and is not, able to view the audio-video component of the Session.</p>
<b>File Transfer</b>
<p>If You choose to send a file to the Patient, that file will be automatically deleted from Our server 15 minutes after the transfer completes.
Conversely, if a Patient sends You a file, it will be automatically deleted 15 minutes after the transfer completes.</p>
<b>Photo Capture</b>
<p>If You capture a photo of the Patient, that image will be sent securely and then destroyed after 15 minutes.</p>
<b>Chats</b>
<p>Any chats between You and the Patient are temporarily stored in Your computer memory, not on doxy.me servers.
Your chat history stays after the Session ends so You may copy to an internal system.
Once the browser is closed, the chat history is permanently deleted.</p>
<b>Patient Payment Information</b>
<p>If You choose to ask the Patient to pay You during the Session, You may use the third-party Stripe credit card payment system.
Prior to requesting payment, You must setup a Stripe account in the settings section of Your Account.
The Patient will receive a payment pop-up screen asking to provide their name and credit card details.
All credit card transactions are handled by Stripe.
Doxy.me does not capture or utilize any information entered in the payment pop-up screen.

<b>Service Payment Information</b>
<p>If You choose to upgrade the Service for a fee, You have the option to pay via the Stripe third-party credit card payment system.

<b>Teleconsent Appointment Consent Form</b>
<p>You may ask or require a Patient to sign a Teleconsent Appointment Consent Form.
The purpose of the form is to convey what Telehealth communication is, Patient rights, and obligations for each party.
Doxy.me provides a template form or, depending on Your Account type, You may upload Your own form.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the Patient signs the form, it should be downloaded by both You and Your Patient as it is not stored by the Service and will be permanently deleted.</p>
<b>Session Privacy</b>
<p>At any time during the Session, You may disable the audio, video, or both.
Doing so may prevent effective communication with the Patient.
However, there may be times when You wish to disable the audio or video for personal reasons.</p>
<p>You may terminate the Session at any time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>If You are a Patient</b>
<p>This section only applies if You have received a unique web link (such as https://yourclinic.doxy.me/DrSmith) by a Provider and wish to communicate with the Provider by video conference using the Service.
Some features are not activated automatically and require explicit authorization by You.</p>
<b>Types of Data Processed</b>
<b>Name to Enter Waiting Room&nbsp;</b>
<p>A Patient does not need an account or register with doxy.me in order to use the Service.</p>
<p>A Provider will email or text You a Provider Website link in order to enter the Waiting room.
When You click on that link, it will take You to the welcome screen and You will be asked to enter Your name and click a “Check In” button.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your name is only seen by the Provider and used for an initial identification.
There is no verification of the entry, nor is there a requirement that You use Your full name.
Your name is used only for the current session and is not stored or otherwise used by the Service.</p>
<b>Session Privacy</b>
<p>At any time during the Session, You may disable the audio, video, or both.
Doing so may prevent effective communication with the Provider.
However, there may be times when You wish to disable the audio or video for personal reasons.</p>
<p>You may also terminate the Session at any time.</p>
<b>Protected Health Information (PHI)</b>
<p>Although the Doxy.me Service is targeted to the healthcare community, no PHI is collected during the Session between Patient and Provider.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any health or other sensitive information You discuss or send the Provider is sent over a secure channel using the SSL Internet protocol.</p>
<b>File Transfer</b>
<p>If You choose to send a file to the Provider, that file will be sent securely and then destroyed after 15 minutes.&nbsp;</p>
<b>Photo Capture</b>
<p>If Your Provider chooses to capture a photo of You, that image will be sent securely and then destroyed after 15 minutes.</p>
<b>Chats</b>
<p>Any chats between You and the Provider are temporarily stored in computer memory, not on doxy.me services.
Once the browser is closed, the chat history is permanently deleted.</p>
<b>Payment Information</b>
<p>If You choose to pay the Provider during the Session, a credit card authorization screen will pop-up asking You to provide Your name and credit card details.
All credit card transactions are handled by Stripe, a third-party.
Doxy.me does not capture or utilize any information You enter in the payment pop-up screen.
For more information, please visit https://stripe.com/</p>
<b>Teleconsent Appointment Consent Form</b>
<p>Your Provider may ask You to sign a Teleconsent Appointment Consent Form.
The purpose of the form is to inform You of what Telehealth communication is, and Your rights and obligations.
You should read the form completely and not hesitate to ask Your Provider for any clarifications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If You are required to sign the form, Your signature will be electronically captured by using Your mouse and be embedded in the form.
The form may be downloaded by both You and Your Provider and is not stored by the Service.</p>
<b>Screenshare</b>
<p>The Service provides a feature whereby You may share all or part of Your computer screen with the Provider.
You will be sent a message to confirm that You wish to share Your screen or a specific window.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are obvious privacy issues associated with sharing one’s screen.
It is up to You to ensure that no sensitive or confidential information (other than that which You wish to show the Provider) be viewable during the screensharing session.</p>
<p>For instance, if You do not wish the Provider to see Your email system or other open windows, it would be best to terminate those applications prior to the screenshare.</p>

<li>provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify You are the person about whom We collected personal information or an authorized representative;</li>
<li>describe Your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will not respond to any request if We are unable to verify Your identity and therefore confirm the personal information in our possession actually relates to You.</p>
<p>If You cannot personally submit a verifiable request, You can authorize a person registered with the California Secretary of State to act on Your behalf.</p>
<p>If You are an adult, You can make a verifiable request on behalf of a minor under Your parental authority.</p>
<p>You can submit a maximum number of two (2) requests over a period of 12 months.</p>
