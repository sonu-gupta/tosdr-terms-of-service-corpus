<strong>What is WatchMojo's policy on copyright infringement?</strong>
</p>
<p>WatchMojo is NOT a user-generated content and/or video file sharing website.
WatchMojo showcases professionally-produced premium content.</p>
<p>As a producer of content, we respect the rights of other content producers and expect others to respect our copyright.
</p>
<p>- WatchMojo produces content and publishes all of the WatchMojo-produced and owned content with the WatchMojo Branding Elements (an opening and closing bumper and watermark in the lower right area of the video).
When you see those branding elements, those represent WatchMojo's videos.
</p>
<p>- WatchMojo.com also displays professional content from our partners in their respective video players.
The rights holders to these videos have given WatchMojo the expressed written permission to display this content in our Video section.
When you see videos on the WatchMojo.com Video section without the WatchMojo Branding Elements, then these represent content from our partners.
</p>
<p>- Occasionally, WatchMojo's writers may embed in our Blogs section a video from various services and content sources.
WatchMojo writers make their best efforts to only embed content from the accounts and channels of the rights holders, but it is possible that on rare occasions, some of the embedded videos in the Blogs section might violate the intellectual property rights of others.
When the latter is the case, the content is embedded under Fair Use, but we respect and understand that some content owners might prefer that we do not embed the video.
<br>
<strong>
<br> What measures do you take to prevent copyrighted material from showing up on WatchMojo?</strong>
<br> Since there is no mechanism for outsiders to publish content on either the Video or Blog sections on WatchMojo.com, it is impossible for pirated content to be uploaded by users.
If a video appears on our Blogs section and violates your copyright, please email us at watch@watchmojo.com and we will remove the embedded Video promptly.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, WatchMojo writers do not upload user-generated content.<br>
<strong>
<br>
</strong>
<strong>Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) </strong>
