<i>Effective 12 October 2018*</i>
</p> What We Collect <p>Our podcast feed is handled by a self-hosted instance of PodcastGenerator (GPL v3).
Our traffic is monitored by our hosting's built-in awstats (GPL v3).</p> How we use this data <p>We use this info to get a rough idea of listership.
This is an important metric for a podcast, since this ratio gives us insight into the topics that our listeners might be interested in hearing more--or less--of.</p>
<p>Given how flakey YouTube has been with who actually sees new videos, we're curious to discover the real ratio between subscriber vs download.</p> Personally Identifiable Information <p>We do not collect personally identifiable information from our listeners.</p> Our Pledge <p>We believe in <b>transparency</b>.</p>
<p>Should we ever find ourselves needing to change the types of information we collect, we pledge to make an announcement at the very beginning of our podcasts at least one week ahead of the change.</p>
<blockquote>*10 Oct 2018 - Previous to this change, we were using a custom built analytics/rss engine that was quickly shown to be unstable and incompatible with popular podcasting apps.
As such, we switched to PodcastGenerator and awstat.</blockquote>
