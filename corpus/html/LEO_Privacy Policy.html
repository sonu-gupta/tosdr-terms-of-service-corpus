To achieve this, please send an Email to the LEO Team&nbsp;<br>We will notify you in accordance with Art.
19 GDPR of the rectification.</p>
<b>Right to erasure (“Right to be forgotten”)</b>
<p>Under Art.
17 GDPR you have the right to have this data erased.
If you wish this to be done, please send an Email to the LEO Teamand supply your user name in order to expedite identification<br>We will notify you in accordance with Art.
19 GDPR of the erasure.</p>
<b>Right to restriction of processing</b>
<p>Under Art.
18 GDPR you have the right to restrict the processing of your data by LEO for a number of specific reasons.
If this is your wish, please send an Email to the LEO Team stating your reasons for requesting this restriction of processing.<br>We will notify you in accordance with Art.
19 GDPR of the restrictions carried out.</p>
<b>Right to data portability / to be informed</b>
<p>On request, we will inform you in accordance with Art.
13 and Art.
20 GDPR whether we have stored personal data about you and what these data are.</p>
<p>For data which are visible in your user account and in the corresponding context, there is an exception to the duty to provide data which we also use in some individual cases.
this relates, among others, to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your forum contributions, since you can already have your own contributions displayed to you, and also the context in which they were made (as, for example, responses to your questions, the questions themselves or other contributions to which you supplied a response).
The questions or responses of other users would not be contained in the download.</li>
<li>Your entire collection of vocabulary items, since you can have this displayed to you.
The data stored in the database comprises exclusively the IDs of the individual translations and not the vocabulary items themselves.
The download of your data would thus contain only these IDs, which would make any further use of these data more or less impossible.</li>
<li>If you have tested or bought a language course, then your learning progress with relation to the particular course(s) is also available.
Since here, once again, the database stores only the IDs of the vocabulary items, exercises and lessons, the content of the exercises would not be contained in the download either.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<b>Right to object</b>
<p>Under Art.
21 Abs.
1 GDPR you have the right to object to the processing of personal data carried out on the strength of Article 6, paragraph 1, sentences (e) or (f).
This also applies to profiling on the basis of these provisions.
If you wish to object, please send an Email to the LEO Team stating your reasons for requesting this restriction of processing.</p>
<b>Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority</b>
<p>We also draw your attention to the fact that you, naturally, have the right under Art.
77 GDPR to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you consider that the processing of personal data relating to you has been in contravention of the GDPR.</p>Legal Validity <b>Controller and commissioned data processor</b>
