         Slipfox Network Suite About Me Site Status Slipfox E-Mail <p>I do run an E-Mail service on this domain.
An account can be generated for you upon request.</p> Rules: <ol>
<li>No spam.</li>
<li>Nothing illegal under US law.</li>
</ol>
<p>To sign up, send an email to webmaster at slipfox dot xyz with the subject "Email Request", your erquested username, and the sum of 69420 and 1337 somewhere within the body.</p>
<br> Password Reset: <p>When you sign up, I will give you a random password to use.
*This is not recommended to be used as a permanent password.* You should absolutely set your own email password.<br>To do so, simply ssh into [username]@slipfox.xyz and you will be provided with a password reset prompt.
Note that pubkey auth is explicitly <i>disabled</i> on any mailgroup accounts, so you will need to enter the password you were given at signup.</p>
<br> Third Party Client Usage: <p>Some third party clients, namely Thunderbird, will automatically attempt to use imap.slipfox.xyz and smtp.slipfox.xyz for IMAP/SMTP.
This is incorrect, and will result in issues.
Please use the following configuration:</p>
<ul>
<li>IMAP: mail.slipfox.xyz:993</li>
<li>SMTP: mail.slipfox.xyz:587</li>
</ul>
