</p>PART III.
INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS, SECURITY, AND DATA RETENTIONProcessing of personal information in the US and other territories<p>Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which
you are resident.
These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country.
Specifically, please be aware that our facilities are located in the United States, and our third party service providers and partners operate around the world.
This means that when we collect your personal information we may process it in different countries.
However, regardless of where your data is processed we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Notice.</p>European Data Transfers<p>If you are resident in the EEA, UK or Switzerland, we will protect your personal information when it is transferred outside of your jurisdiction by: (i) processing it in a territory that provides an adequate level of protection for personal information based on the receiving country's data protection laws.
and/or (ii) implementing appropriate safeguards to protect your personal information, such as requiring the recipient to comply with the Standard Contractual Clauses, or another lawful and approved transfer mechanism.</p>Security safeguards<p>We use technical and organizational security measures designed to protect personal information we process about visitors to our Website against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
However, please note that no Internet transmission can ever be guaranteed 100% secure, and so we encourage you to take care when disclosing personal information online and to use readily available tools, such as Internet firewalls, secure email, and similar technologies to protect yourself online.</p>Data retention<p>We retain your personal information where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax, or accounting requirements) and for a period of time consistent with the original purpose as described in this Notice.
We determine the appropriate retention period for personal information on the basis of the amount, nature, and sensitivity of your personal information processed, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information and whether we can achieve the purposes of the processing through other means, as well as on the basis of applicable legal requirements (such as applicable statutes of limitation).</p>
<p>After expiration of the applicable retention periods, we will either delete or anonymize your personal information or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>PART IV.
YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS<p>Depending on your location and subject to applicable law, you may have the following rights with regard to personal information we control about you:</p>Access, review, change, update, or delete your information (EEA, UK and Swiss residents, and California residents)<p>You may access (data portability), review, modify, and request deletion of any personal information that we process about you, as required by law.
You may submit such a request by one of the following: (i) send an email to privacy@sift.com, (ii) complete this webform, or (iii) call us toll free at 877-571-0124.
To protect your privacy and security, we may need to take reasonable steps to verify your identity before responding to your request.
Specifically, we (or our third party service provider acting on our behalf) may need to collect a copy of your photo ID and any other information necessary to confirm your identity.
Such information will be securely processed in accordance with this Notice and only used for the purpose of verifying your identity.</p>Objection to processing of, or requesting restriction or portability of, personal information (EEA, UK, and Swiss residents)<p>In addition, if you are a resident of the European Economic Area (<strong>“EEA”</strong>), United Kingdom or Switzerland and we can properly verify your identity, you can object to processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict processing of your personal information, or request portability of your personal information.

If you choose to no longer receive marketing information, we may still communicate with you regarding such things as your security updates, product functionality, responses to service requests, or other transactional, non-marketing/administrative related purposes.</p>Withdrawal of consent<p>If we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time.
Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
To withdraw your consent to any processing, email privacy@sift.com.</p>Right to complain to a data protection authority<p>You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information.
