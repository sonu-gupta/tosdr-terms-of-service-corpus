&nbsp;Cookies and How We Use Them
<p>Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or device by websites that you visit or HTML-formatted emails you open, to make our websites work, or to make them work more efficiently, to understand the effectiveness of our emails, and confirm that you received the necessary communications.
We use the word “cookie” in this notice as a synonym for all similar tracking technologies which we use, such as pixel tags and web beacons (collectively “cookies”).
For instance, cookies are used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enable the proper functioning of our websites and the proper delivery of legitimate electronic communications;</li>
<li>Tailor information presented to you based on your browsing preferences, such as language and geographical region;</li>
<li>Collect statistics regarding your website usage;</li>
<li>Provide us with business and marketing information.
and</li>
<li>In some cases, to enable a third party to deliver future advertising for our Services to you when you visit certain websites owned by third parties.</li>
</ul>
<p>The cookies we use include “session” cookies that are erased when you leave our websites, or they may be “persistent" cookies that remain on your computer or device after you leave the site, in preparation for your next visit to our websites.</p>
<strong>How We Use Third-Party Cookies</strong>
Cookies may also be placed on our websites by third parties to deliver tailored information and content that may be of interest to you, such as promotions or offerings, when you visit third-party websites after you have left ours.
We do not permit these third parties to collect personal data about you (e.g., email address) other than that collected using such&nbsp.
cookies unless such data is provided to the third party in their role as a service provider acting solely on our behalf.

<p>
<strong>Cookie Banner Information</strong>
</p>
<p>To provide transparency and control of cookies to our visitors, we use a cookie banner displayed when you first visit a NortonLifeLock website.
The cookie banner informs you about the cookies we create and use.
You can use the cookie banner to provide or withdraw consent for the placement of cookies.
This applies except for cookies in the "Essential" category, as these cookies are indispensable for the proper functioning of the website and are activated automatically.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you reject all cookies, we may be unable to offer you some of our functionalities, services, or support.
If you have previously visited our websites, you may also have to delete any existing cookies from your browser.
If you would like to view or manage your cookie settings, please see our cookie banner which is displayed when you first access our website, or the “privacy settings” link located in the footer or as a tab on the lower right on our websites.</p>
<p>Once you have provided us with your consent, the key and consent status will be stored in a cookie so that the site can automatically read and follow your consent in all subsequent page requests and future end-user sessions for up to 12 months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, the settings always work per browser and device.
If you delete the browser history and/or cookies, the settings you made are also affected.
This means that the next time you visit our website, you will again be shown our cookie banner and will have to select the settings again.</p>
