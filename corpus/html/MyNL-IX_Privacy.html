<p>To be able to provide the best possible service to you, it important for us to know which products and services you purchase from us and how you use our products and services.
We link the information we receive from you in order to respond quickly and adequately to your questions, service requests (e.g.

<p>We aim to inform you personally and at a time when the information is relevant to you.
This information may consist of tips about products you use or newsletters.
Your interests are paramount in processing your data!</p>
<p>We therefore promise that:

We also register similar information about the technical and administrative (billing) contacts you provide for the performance of the contract.</p>
<p>If you or other employees of your company contact us, for example, if you ask a question by telephone, via an NL-ix website or via social media, we record this question.
We need to record it for the purposes of answering the question and performing actions arising therefrom.
Your data will also be recorded if you report a service disruption, lodge a complaint, or fail to pay an invoice.</p>
<p>We refer to this data as ‘contact details’.</p>For what purpose do we process this data?Provision of services<p>First and foremost NL-ix processes your data for the provision of our services to you.
Processing of your data is necessary for dealing with requests, establishing a link, building connections, sending an invoice, making an enquiry into an invoice, and handling fault reports or complaints.
We cannot provide our services to you without processing your data.</p>Marketing and sales purposes<p>NL-ix processes your contact details for marketing and sales activities with respect to services provided by NL-ix (even after termination of the contract) unless you have objected to this.
For example you may be approached about our services when you register for an Event.
Your data will be processed by NL-ix, or a processor contracted by NL-ix, for the purpose of making offers, unless you have objected to our approaching you by letter, text message, email or telephone.</p>
<p>NL-ix does not provide your data to third parties for purposes of marketing, sales, and other business activities.
Insofar as data is provided to third parties for the benefit of their activities, this will only be done in a format that is anonymised and aggregated in such a way that this data cannot be traced to your person in any way whatsoever.</p>Compliance with legal obligations<p>NL-ix has a legal obligation to provide your data to third parties, for example, to the competent authorities within the context of a criminal investigation.</p>Network quality, availability and security of the network, and connections of our customers<p>NL-ix is responsible for the network used for the conveyance of (internet) traffic.
This involves the maintenance, planning and improvement of the network and management such as routing traffice, resolving disruptions, monitoring peak loads and overload.
By analysing the use made of our network we obtain essential information on the network use and load.
We can make targeted additions, upgrades and improvements to our network on the basis of this information.
NL-ix processes your data for these technical and statistical analyses.
The results of these analyses are anonymised for reporting within NL-ix and cannot be retraced to individuals.
We are not interested in the content of your or your customers’ communication and we never record the content of the communication about our network.</p>Visits to our website, login to the 'MyNL-ix' environment<p>When you visit our website, we process the following data:</p>
