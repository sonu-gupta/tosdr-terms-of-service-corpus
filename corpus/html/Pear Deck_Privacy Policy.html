<p>Although no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, we follow all PCI-DSS requirements and implement additional generally accepted industry standards.

</p>OUR POLICY TOWARD CHILDREN<p>We are required under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), with limited exceptions, to obtain verifiable parental consent in order to collect, use, or disclose personal information from Children.
COPPA allows the Child’s School to obtain consent for the online collection of personal information from Children who are students of the School.</p>
<p>If a Child wants to use our Service, he/she must first obtain an Account from his/her School.
Before an Account is provided to a School, we require that the School (on behalf of the Parent) (a) consent to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information of the Child, through the Service, in accordance with this Children’s Privacy Policy, and (b) agree that the Child’s online activities are subject to the Terms of Service.</p>
<p>As required under COPPA, we allow Parents certain choices regarding the personal information submitted by their Children Parents should make any permitted requests with the School and have the School, as the Parent’s agent, pass on those requests to Pear Deck.
We may rely on the instructions that we receive from the School that we reasonably believe are given by a Child’s Parent to the School.

A Child’s registration information is always accessible to him/her.
A Parent has the right to review her Child’s Personal Information, which the Parent can obtain by contacting her Child’s School.
After reviewing the Child’s Personal Information, the Parent may ask us to update or delete the Child’s Personal Information by requesting such changes through the Child’s School.
A Parent may prohibit us from sharing a Child’s Personal Information with a third party by requesting such prohibition through the Child’s School.
Notwithstanding any such requests, we may continue to share a Child’s Personal Information with third parties for the Internal Purposes and Enforcement Purposes (each as described above).</p>
<p>If a Parent chooses to prohibit any future collection, use or disclosure of the Child’s Personal Information, the Parent may do so by terminating the Child’s Account through the School, and requesting the deletion of the Child’s Personal Information through the School.
Upon receiving such request from the Child’s School, we will delete the Child’s Account information from our live databases and all the information and data stored for such Account.
Company will not have any liability whatsoever for any termination of the Account or related deletion of the Child’s Personal Information.
When we delete Personal Information, it will be deleted from our active databases but may remain in our archives.</p>DATA LOCATION<p>If you reside outside the U.S., the information we collect will be transferred to the U.S.
