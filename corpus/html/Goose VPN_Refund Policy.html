After your trial period, your selected payment method will be billed.
You have a right to cancel your account at any time.
You can cancel a recurring subscription from your website profile or iTunes/App Store.
Cancelled accounts will not be refunded for the unused part of the ongoing service period.</p>
<p>All new GOOSE VPN accounts have a no-questions-asked 30-day money back guarantee if less than 100MB of data has been used and if the user is still in their trial period.
If a customer cancels their GOOSE VPN subscription, they will have their payment refunded if the above conditions are met.</p>
<p>Refund of payments for subscriptions where bandwidth usage exceeded 100MB and other cases are at the discretion of the GOOSE VPN management.
As a rule of thumb, we do issue refunds for services with overused bandwidth in cases when users experience ongoing unresolved technical problems with GOOSE VPN software.
All deposit payments to GOOSE VPN are non-refundable.</p>
