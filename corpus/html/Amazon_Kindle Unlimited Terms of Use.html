</i> Digital Services and Device Support&nbsp;›&nbsp;Amazon Device and Digital Services Terms, Warranties, and Notices› Kindle Unlimited Terms of Use <p>
<strong>Last updated: June 11, 2020</strong>
</p>
<p>Welcome to the terms of use (“<strong>Terms</strong>”) for Kindle Unlimited.
These Terms are between you and Amazon.com Services LLC and/or its affiliates (“<strong>Amazon.com</strong>”, “<strong>We</strong>” or “<strong>Us</strong>”) and govern our respective rights and obligations.
Please note that your use of the Amazon.com website and your Kindle Unlimited membership are also governed by the agreements listed and linked to below, as well as all other applicable terms, conditions, limitations, and requirements on the Amazon.com website, all of which (as changed over time) are incorporated into these Terms.
If you sign up for a Kindle Unlimited membership, you accept these terms, conditions, limitations and requirements.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Amazon.com Conditions of Use
</li>
<li>
Amazon.com Privacy Notice
</li>
<li>
Kindle Store Terms of Use
</li>
<li>
Audible Service Conditions of Use </li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>The Program</strong>
</p>
<p>As a member of Kindle Unlimited, you may read Kindle books and listen to Audible audiobooks from a designated list of titles an unlimited number of times for so long as you are a member of the program.
From time to time, we may add or remove titles from the program and we make no guarantee as to the availability of specific titles or the minimum number of titles available.
If you are located outside of the United States, the program may not be available to you.
If your membership ends, you will no longer have access to the titles you selected from the program.</p>
<p>
<strong>Fees and Renewal</strong>
</p>
<p>The membership fees for Kindle Unlimited are stated in our Help pages.
From time to time, we may offer different membership terms, and the fees for such membership may vary.
Membership fees may be subject to tax and are non-refundable except as expressly set forth in these Terms.</p>
<p>Unless you notify us before a charge that you want to cancel or do not want to auto renew, you understand your Kindle Unlimited membership will automatically continue and you authorize us (without notice to you, unless required by applicable law) to collect the then-applicable membership fees and any taxes, using any payment method we have on record for you.</p>
<p>If all payment methods we have on file for you are declined for payment of your membership fees, your membership will be canceled unless you provide us with a new payment method.
If you provide us with a new payment method and are successfully charged before your membership is cancelled, your new membership period will be based on the original renewal date and not the date of the successful charge.</p>
<p>From time to time we may also offer non-recurring memberships.
The provisions in this section regarding automatic renewal are not applicable to those memberships.</p>
<p>
<strong> Membership Cancellation</strong>
</p>
<p> You may cancel your membership by visiting Your Account https://www.amazon.com/youraccount and adjusting your membership settings.
If you cancel your membership, you will not receive a refund of any membership fees already paid.
When your membership is cancelled, the titles you have selected from the program will be removed from your account, devices and applications.</p>
<p>
<strong> Restrictions</strong>
</p>
<p> We reserve the right to accept or refuse membership in our discretion.
You may not transfer or assign your membership or any Kindle Unlimited benefits.
We may take reasonable actions necessary to prevent fraud, including placing restrictions on the number of titles that can be accessed from the program at any one time.</p>
<p>
<strong> Promotional Trial Memberships</strong>
</p>
<p> We sometimes offer certain customers various trial or other promotional memberships, which are subject to these Terms except as otherwise stated in the promotional offers.
Trial members may at any time (through Your Account) choose not to continue to paid membership at the end of the trial period.</p>
<p>
<strong>Agreement Changes</strong>
</p>
<p> We may in our discretion change these Terms, the Kindle Store Terms of Use, Audible Service Conditions of Use, Amazon.com Conditions of Use and Amazon.com Privacy Notice, or any aspect of Kindle Unlimited membership, without notice to you.
If any change to these Terms is found invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that change is severable and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining changes or conditions.
Your continued membership after we change these Terms constitutes your acceptance of the changes.
If you do not agree to any changes, you must cancel your membership.
</p>
<p>
<strong> Termination by Us</strong>
</p>
<p> We may terminate your membership at our discretion without notice.
If we do so, we will give you a prorated refund based on the number days remaining in your membership.
However, we will not give any refund for termination related to conduct that we determine, in our discretion, violates these Terms or any applicable law, involves fraud or misuse of the membership, or is harmful to our interests or another user.
Our failure to insist upon or enforce your strict compliance with these Terms will not constitute a waiver of any of our rights.</p>
<p>
<strong> Disputes.
Limitation of Liability</strong>
</p>
<p>Any dispute or claim arising from or relating to these Terms or your membership is subject to the binding arbitration, governing law, disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability and all other terms in the Amazon.com Conditions of Use.
You agree to those terms by signing up for Kindle Unlimited.
Without limiting the disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability in the Amazon.com Conditions of Use, our total liability under these Terms will not exceed the total membership fees you paid in the twelve months prior to the claim.
