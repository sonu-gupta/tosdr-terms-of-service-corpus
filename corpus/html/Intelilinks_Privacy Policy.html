<br> Support LyrArc <p>
We took a different way to help millions around the world build educated informed mindsets that affects and shapes their lives.
For a future that is open, global and digital, with everyone having access to high quality information.
We believe in the renewal of America, renewal of Europe, the renewal of India, the rest of Asia, Latin America and Africa.
The renewal of our supply chains, health, education, infrastructure, as we rebuild our countries after the pandemic.
Literacy and knowledge we believe cannot thrive and grow in a world of web bots, web crawlers, or AI.
This requires human curiosity, human learning, and human imagination.
We take as inspiration the saying- “One has to be free, and as broad as sky.
One has to have a mind that is crystal clear, only then can truth shine in it.” Every contribution whether big or small is precious- in this crisis and ahead.
