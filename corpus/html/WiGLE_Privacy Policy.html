</p> WiGLE WiFi Android Client: How it interacts with the website <p>
<strong>How do you keep my identity and location safe?</strong>
</p>
<p> Just like the website, WiGLE WiFi Wardriving doesn't require real identifying information.
We may profile your device, but don't need or want information that could be used to identify it directly.
Your observed networks and traces are available directly <em>only</em> to you, but not traceable to you.
If you're the first person to observe any individual network, you'll be credited with its discovery internally but the publicly accessible network data will not list your name.
As a website, WiGLE doesn't re-vend your individual observations, only a trilaterated location based on a number of observations by any number of participants.
