<p>We created Discord to be a place where it’s easy to communicate genuinely, build relationships, and have fun hanging out.
Our Community Guidelines ensure everyone finds belonging, but not at the expense of anyone else.</p>
<p>These guidelines explain what is and isn’t allowed on Discord.
Everyone on Discord must follow these rules, and they apply to all parts of our platform, including your content, behaviors, servers, and bots.
We may consider relevant off-platform behavior when assessing for violations of specific Community Guidelines.</p>
<p>Our Trust &amp.
Safety team reviews reports by users, moderators, or trusted reports.
When someone violates these guidelines we may take a number of enforcement steps against them including: issuing warnings.
removing content.
suspending or removing the accounts and/or servers responsible.
and potentially reporting them to law enforcement.If you come across a user, message, or server that appears to break these guidelines, please report it to us.</p>Respect Each Other<ul>

Disagreements happen and are normal, but making continuous, repetitive, or severe negative comments or circumventing a block or ban can cross the line into harassment and is not okay.</li>
<li>
<strong>Do not organize, promote, or participate in hate speech or hateful conduct</strong>.
It’s unacceptable to attack a person or a community based on attributes such as their race, ethnicity, caste, national origin, sex, gender identity, gender presentation, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, age, serious illness, disabilities, or other protected classifications.</li>
