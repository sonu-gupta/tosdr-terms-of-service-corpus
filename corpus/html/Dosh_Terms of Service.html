</strong>Last Updated: July 8, 2021<br>THESE TERMS OF SERVICE INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, A BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION THAT CONTAINS A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
PLEASE REFER TO SECTION 21 BELOW FOR MORE INFORMATION.
Dosh Holdings LLC (the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our”) offers a rewards program in the United States to help consumers save money.
These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of (1) our website located at www.dosh.cash and all of our other websites to which these Terms are posted (collectively, the “Website”).
(2) our mobile applications to which these Terms are posted (collectively, the “Application”).
and (3) any services, content, and features made available by us through the Website or the Application (together with the Website and the Application, the “Services”).
In these Terms, “you” and “your” refer to any user of the Services.<br>
<br>‍<strong>1.
YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS</strong>
<br>By accessing or using the Services in any way or by clicking to agree to these Terms when that option is made available to you, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated by this reference into these Terms.
If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of these Terms, your sole recourse is to terminate your access to and use of the Services and forfeit any DOSH (as defined below) balance in your Account.
If your access to or use of the Services is prohibited by applicable law, you are not authorized to access or use the Services.
We are not responsible if you access or use the Services in any manner that violates applicable law.<br>‍<br>
<strong>2.
CHANGES TO THESE TERMS</strong>
<br>We may, without prior notice or liability to you, discontinue the Services or modify the Services by adding or removing features or functionalities, even though such changes may affect the rewards (“DOSH”) provided to you.
We may also revise these Terms from time to time in our sole discretion, subject to applicable law.
When we revise these Terms, we will post a revised version on the Website and the Application and such revised version will take immediate effect upon posting on the Website and the Application and, subject to applicable law, become binding on you.
For the avoidance of doubt, except as otherwise expressly stated by us, your access to and use of the Services are subject to the version of these Terms currently in effect.<br>‍<br>
<strong>3.
ADDITIONAL TERMS AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY PARTNERS</strong>
<br>In connection with your access to or use of the Services, you may be subject to additional terms, rules, policies, and conditions imposed by us (“Additional Terms”), which are hereby incorporated by reference into these Terms.
To the extent of any inconsistency between these Terms and any Additional Terms, these Terms will control, unless otherwise expressly provided by us.<br>
<br>Certain financial institutions, digital payment platforms and neo banks (each a “Powered By Partner”) use our platform to manage their own rewards programs (“Powered By Programs”).
If you are a participant of any Powered By Program, you are bound by separate terms incorporated into your agreement with such Powered By Partner.<br>‍<br>
<strong>4.
FEES<br>‍</strong>Our application is free to download and there are no costs to you associated with the creation of your user account with us (an “Account”).
However, we cannot maintain your Account indefinitely if your Account remains Inactive.
If at any time your Account becomes Inactive for longer than twelve (12) months (an “Inactive Account”), we reserve the right to reduce, on a monthly basis, the amount of DOSH held in your Account in the amount of the lesser of (i) DOSH representing the equivalent of $4.99 USD, or (ii) the DOSH balance then reflected in your Account (the “Inactive Account Rewards Deduction”).
The Inactive Account Reward Deduction shall be assessed each consecutive month that the Account remains Inactive.
“Inactive” is defined as failing to either complete an eligible transaction or redeem DOSH from your Account in the trailing twelve (12)-month period.
Each time you complete an eligible transaction or redeem DOSH from your Account, you will reset the twelve (12)-month period by which we measure activity.
Though not required, we may, in our sole discretion, elect to notify you prior to your Account becoming Inactive so that you can avoid the assessment of the Inactive Account Rewards Deduction.
Inactive Account Maintenance Fees will only be debited from DOSH in your Account and will never be charged to a card on file.
While we may assess an Inactive Account Rewards Deduction and reduce the DOSH in your Account as stated above, we will never bill you in relation to an Inactive Account.
Inactive Account Reward Deductions cannot be recredited to your Account, but your DOSH balance will never become negative.
&nbsp;If your Account remains Inactive for longer than twelve (12) months and your DOSH balance represents the equivalent of $0.01 USD or less, we reserve the right to terminate your Account.
Unless you are advised otherwise, you will be eligible to create a new account at a later time when you are able to actively use the Services.<br>‍<br>
<strong>5.
THE SERVICES</strong>
<br>The purpose of the Services is to help you save money with minimal effort by rewarding you with DOSH for certain qualifying purchases and other activities.<br>‍<br>(a) Certain Requirements<br>‍<br>In order to access or use the Services (other than merely browsing the Website), you must: (i) be 18 years of age or older, reside in the United States, and have a U.S.-based, non-VoIP mobile phone number.
(ii) accept and agree to these Terms, including our Privacy Policy and any Additional Terms.
(iii) create an Account and maintain your Account in good standing.
and (iv) provide all information requested by us, such as your name, phone number, email address, and payment account information (“User Information”).
All determinations as to whether a phone number is authorized by the Company is at our sole discretion.
Each individual user of the Services may only have one Account.
You represent and warrant that all User Information you provide us from time to time is truthful, accurate, current, and complete, and you agree not to misrepresent your identity or your User Information.
You must promptly notify us of changes to your User Information by updating your Account.
Our Privacy Policy governs our collection, use, storage, and disclosure of User Information.<br>‍<br>You are solely responsible for ensuring the confidentiality of your Account login information and maintaining the security of such information.
You agree not to authorize any other person to use your Account for any purpose.
Except as otherwise provided by applicable law, you are solely responsible for all transactions and other activities authorized or performed using your Account, whether authorized by you or not.
If you believe any of your Account credentials, such as your password, have been obtained or used by any unauthorized person or you become aware of any other breach or attempted breach of the security of the Services or your Account, you must notify us immediately.<br>
<br>(b) Linking Your Payment Card<br>
<br>In order to receive DOSH from us for qualifying purchases of goods or services, or for referring other users to download our application, you must link at least one eligible debit or credit card (a “Payment Card”) to your Account.
Please note that not all debit and credit cards are eligible to be linked to your Account.
All determinations as to whether a card is eligible to be a Payment Card are at our sole discretion.
For example, certain Visa, Mastercard, and American Express cards are not eligible to be linked to your Account, including, but not limited to, the following: prepaid cards, corporate cards, purchasing cards, store cards which can only be used at their respective retailers’ stores, government-administered prepaid cards (including Electronic Benefit (EBT) cards), healthcare cards (including Health Savings Account (HSA) cards, Flexible Spending Account (FSA) cards, and insurance prepaid cards), Visa Buxx, and cards that are not processed through the Visa U.S.A payment system, the Mastercard payment system, or the American Express payment system.
In order to be eligible as a Payment Card, it must be issued by a U.S.
bank.
In addition, you may not be able to link a debit or credit card to your Account if the card is already linked to certain other card-linked-offer programs offered by us or by third parties.<br>
<br>(c) Use of Enrolled Cards and Transaction Information<br>
<br>By registering a Payment Card in connection with transaction monitoring, and in order to enable us to provide the Services, you authorize us to share your payment information with third-party service providers.
any Payment Card Networks (e.g., Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Accel, AFFN, CU24, Jeanie, NYCE, PULSE, SHAZAM, STAR) with which your Payment Card is affiliated.
and banks, financial intermediaries, and providers of payment processing services (together the "Card-Related Parties") .
In particular, you authorize the Card-Related Parties to monitor transactions on your linked Payment Card(s) to identify qualifying purchases in order to determine whether you have qualified for or earned an offer linked to your Payment Card, and for the Card-Related Parties to share such transaction details with us to enable your card-linked offer(s) and target offers that may be of interest to you.
You agree that the Company and the Card-Related Parties may view transactions made by you with participating merchants.
You authorize participating merchants to provide the Company with historical transaction data.<br>
<br>For more information on how we use your Payment Card transaction information, see the "Information Collected from Payment Card Networks and Transaction Information" section of the Privacy Policy.
You may opt-out of transaction monitoring on the Payment Card(s) you have registered by de-linking then through the Services or by terminating your Account.
To terminate your Account and this Agreement and your right to use the Services at any time and for any reason and for no reason, contact Customer Support and immediately discontinue all use of the Services.
Please note that if you opt-out of transaction monitoring, certain features of the Services may not be available to you or the performance of certain features of the Services may be limited or not work at all.<br>‍<br>(d) Receiving DOSH<br>
<br>Subject to these Terms, we will automatically provide DOSH to you when you purchase qualifying goods or services with your Payment Card or perform other qualifying actions identified by us.
The Company, in its sole discretion, establishes the terms and conditions for each qualifying purchase or action and determines whether you have satisfied such terms and conditions to receive DOSH.
Such terms and conditions are set forth on the Website and the Application and may be updated, modified, suspended, or cancelled by the Company at any time in its sole discretion.
All offers made available to you through the Application are temporary and may become unavailable without notice.
You may also have a limited, prescribed window of time to take advantage of an offer.
Always check the Application for offers currently available to you.<br>
<br>Not all qualifying purchases made with your Payment Card may be eligible for DOSH if we are unable to obtain certain transaction information from the Payment Card Network associated with your Payment Card.
For example, we may be unable to obtain certain transaction information from the Payment Card Network (and you may therefore be unable to receive DOSH) for the following transactions made with your Payment Card: (i) purchases that require you to enter your Personal Identification Number (“PIN”) for your Payment Card, (ii) purchases you initiate through identification technology that substitutes for a PIN, (iii) payments made through other payment methods (such as a digital wallet or a third-party payment application, where you may choose your Payment Card as a funding source but you do not present your Payment Card directly to the merchant), (iv) payments of existing balances, balance transfers, or (v) transactions that are not processed or submitted through the Payment Card Network.
Do not use a PIN when paying for a qualifying purchase with your Payment Card if you want the purchase to be eligible for DOSH.<br>
<br>Without limiting any of the other terms of these Terms, if you return, charge back, cancel, dispute, or otherwise request a refund for a qualifying purchase for which you have already received DOSH, we will reduce the balance of DOSH in your Account by the amount of DOSH you received for such transaction.
If the balance of DOSH in your Account is less than the amount of DOSH you received for such transaction, we will offset the applicable amount of DOSH from DOSH you would otherwise receive for future qualifying actions.<br>
<br>DOSH that you receive as a result of a qualifying physical purchase at a participating merchant will generally be reflected in your Account within 1-7 Business Days after the date of purchase.
DOSH that you receive as a result of a qualifying online purchase at a participating merchant will be reflected in your Account after the return period for the purchase has expired and generally within 60-90 Business Days after the online purchase is completed.
DOSH that you receive for a travel-related purchase will be reflected in your Account between 30-60 Business Days after check out.
In some cases, it may take longer for DOSH to be reflected in your Account.
For purposes of these Terms, “Business Day” means Monday through Friday, excluding federal banking holidays.
&nbsp;If you do not automatically receive DOSH for purchasing qualifying goods or services with your Payment Card or for performing other qualifying actions as identified by us, you have thirty (30) days from the date of transaction if made in store or ninety (90) days from the date of transaction if made online to contact us, provide evidence of the purchase and request DOSH earned.
Any requests for DOSH earned after these deadlines will not be honored and the DOSH associated with the transaction will be forfeited.<br>
<br>Without limiting any of the other conditions of these Terms, if we award DOSH to you in error (e.g., we later determine that you did not comply with the terms and conditions of a qualifying purchase or if you charge back a qualifying purchase), we reserve the right to remove the applicable DOSH from your Account.
You are responsible for making sure the DOSH balance reflected in your Account is correct.
If you believe that your Account does not accurately reflect DOSH that you are eligible to receive, please contact us.<br>
<br>DOSH will remain in your Account until we approve redemption of DOSH as described below.<br>
<br>(e) Redeeming DOSH<br>
<br>Subject to these Terms and our approval, you may request that we redeem DOSH from your Account.
Upon redemption 1 DOSH will equal $1 USD (“Reward Redemption”).
Prior to redeeming DOSH, (i) you must verify an email address associated with your Account, (ii) DOSH may only be redeemed from your Account through the Website or the Application, (iii) the value of the balance of DOSH in your Account must be equivalent to a Reward Redemption amount of at least $25 USD, and (iv) you must have completed an offer-qualifying transaction with a participating merchant.
We will generally redeem DOSH from your Account and credit the corresponding Reward Redemption amount to your designated U.S.
bank account, PayPal account, or other payment method permitted by us and designated by you (“Redemption Method”) within 1-5 Business Day(s) of when we receive your redemption request.
Credits to your bank account will be completed within 2-3 Business Days from when we receive the redemption request.
Credits to your PayPal account may be completed on the same day we receive the redemption request or up to 5 Business Days after your Reward Redemption request is received and approved by us.<br>
<br>We use Cash Flow Solutions, Inc.
(“CFSI”) and Plaid Technologies, Inc.
(“Plaid”) to gather users’ data from financial institutions.
By using the Services, you grant us, CFSI, and Plaid the right, power and authority to act on your behalf to access and transmit your personal and financial information from the relevant financial institution.
You agree to your personal and financial information being transferred, stored and processed by CFSI and Plaid in accordance with the CFSI Privacy Policy and Plaid Privacy Policy.
By redeeming DOSH from your Account, you authorize us to electronically credit your Redemption Method for the applicable Reward Redemption amount.
This authorization will remain in full force and effect until the termination of your Account or until you otherwise notify us by contacting us.
You must notify us of any change in your Redemption Method at least 3 Business Days before any such change by contacting us or by updating your Account.
If we do not receive notice at least 3 Business Days before any such change, we may attempt, in our sole discretion, to implement such change prior to any credit transaction performed hereunder.
However, we assume no responsibility for our failure to do so.<br>
<br>You are solely responsible for verifying the accuracy and completeness of any credits of the Reward Redemption amount to your Redemption Method performed by us hereunder.
You must notify us of any errors within 15 days of such information being made available to you.
If you do not notify us of any such errors within such 15 days, you will forfeit the right to contest a transaction, except to the extent such forfeiture is prohibited by applicable law.<br>
<br>For example, unless otherwise permitted by us, you may only redeem DOSH for the equivalent of up to a Reward Redemption amount of $500 USD in any day.
Without limiting any of the other conditions of these Terms, we may establish additional limits on your redemption of DOSH and otherwise modify the redemption terms for DOSH at any time in our sole discretion.<br>
<br>(f) Taxes<br>
<br>All amounts paid to you hereunder are exclusive of any applicable withholding, sales, use, excise, value added, or other taxes.
You acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for determining, paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services.

In accordance with such laws, we may be required to send to you and file certain forms with tax authorities, such as the IRS Form 1099-MISC (Miscellaneous Income), for any year in which rewards are issued to you.
If we request information from you in order to complete a required tax form, and you fail to provide the requisite information, you will be prohibited from redeeming DOSH from your Account until we receive the required information.<br>

<strong>21.
DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION.
JURY TRIAL WAIVER.
CLASS ACTION WAIVER</strong>
<br>For any and all controversies, disputes, demands, claims, or causes of action between you and us (including the interpretation and scope of this Section and the arbitrability of the controversy, dispute, demand, claim, or cause of action) relating to the Services or these Terms (as well as any related or prior agreement that you may have had with us), you and we agree to resolve any such controversy, dispute, demand, claim, or cause of action exclusively through binding and confidential arbitration.
In the event of any such controversy, dispute, demand, claim, or cause of action, the complaining party must notify the other party in writing thereof.
Within 30 days of such notice, you and we agree to use reasonable efforts to attempt to resolve the dispute in good faith.
If you and we do not resolve the dispute within 30 days after such notice, the complaining party may seek remedies exclusively through arbitration.
Except as otherwise expressly provided by applicable law, the demand for arbitration must be made within a reasonable time after the controversy, dispute, demand, claim, or cause of action in question arose, and in any event within two years after the complaining party knew or should have known of the controversy, dispute, demand, claim, or cause of action.<br>
<br>The arbitration will take place in the federal judicial district of your residence.
As used in this Section, “we” and “us” mean the Company and its subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors, successors, and assigns and all of our and their respective employees, officers, directors, agents, and representatives.
In addition, “we” and “us” include any third party providing any product, service, or benefit in connection with the Services or these Terms (as well as any related or prior agreement that you may have had with us) if such third party is named as a co-party with us in any controversy, dispute, demand, claim, or cause of action subject to this Section.<br>
<br>Arbitration will be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state arbitration law.
The arbitration will be conducted before one commercial arbitrator from the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes.
As modified by these Terms, and unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties in writing, the arbitration will be governed by the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, the “Rules and Procedures”).
You should review this Section carefully.
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights EXCEPT for matters that you file in small claims court in the state or municipality of your residence or as otherwise provided in the Rules and Procedures within the jurisdictional limits of the small claims court and as long as such matter is only pending in that court.
Additionally, notwithstanding the agreement to arbitrate included in this Section, you and we may seek emergency equitable relief in federal court if it has jurisdiction or, if it does not, in a state court located in the federal judicial district of your residence in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration, and you and we hereby agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the federal judicial district of your residence for such purpose.
A request for interim measures will not be deemed a waiver of the obligation to arbitrate.<br>
<br>Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT A JUDGE OR JURY.
You are entitled to a FAIR HEARING, BUT the arbitration procedures may be SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT.
Arbitrators’ decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT.<br>
<br>You and we must abide by the following rules: (A) ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR US MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
(B) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS.
MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.
AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF.
(c) we will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as required by the Rules and Procedures and/or as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation.
(d) we also reserve the right, in our sole and exclusive discretion, to assume responsibility for any or all of the costs of the arbitration.
(e) the arbitrator will honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law.
(f) the arbitration will be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by applicable law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award.
(g) subject to the limitation of liability provisions of these Terms, the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are expressly permitted by applicable law.
and (h) each party will pay its own attorneys’ fees and expenses, unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees and litigation expenses and the arbitrator awards such attorneys’ fees and expenses to the prevailing party, and, in such instance, the fees and costs awarded will be determined by the applicable law.<br>
<br>This Section will survive termination of these Terms as well as any voluntary payment of any debt in full by you or any bankruptcy by you or us.
With the exception of subparts (A) and (B) of this Section (prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis), if any part of this Section is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures, then the balance of this Section will remain in effect and will be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal, or conflicting part was not contained herein.
If, however, either subpart (A) or (B) of this Section is found to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the entirety of this Section will be null and void, and neither you nor we will be entitled to arbitration.
If for any reason a controversy, dispute, demand, claim, or cause of action proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the controversy, dispute, demand, claim, or cause of action will be exclusively brought in federal court if it has jurisdiction or, if it does not, in a state court located in the federal judicial district of your residence.<br>
<br>If you wish to opt out of the agreement to arbitrate included in this Section, you must notify us of your election in writing within 30 days of the date that you first became subject to these Terms, or within 30 days of the effective date of any material change to these Terms, by sending a written notice to us by certified mail at the following address: 675 Ponce de Leon Avenue, Suite 6000, Atlanta, GA 30308.
Attn: Arbitration Opt-Out.
Your opt-out notice must include your name, address, phone number, and email address.<br>
<br>For more information on the AAA, the Rules and Procedures, and the process for filing an arbitration claim, you may call the AAA at 800-778-7879 or visit the AAA website at http://www.adr.org.<br>

The failure by us to enforce at any time any of the provisions of these Terms, to exercise any election or option provided herein, to require at any time your performance of any of the provisions herein, or to enforce our rights under these Terms or applicable law will not in any way be construed as a waiver of such provisions or rights.
