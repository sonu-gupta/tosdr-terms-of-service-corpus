</p>
<p>This is applicable to the public services/instances that avoidthehack! hosts for all to use.

<p>Like the avoidthehack! privacy policy, we aim to keep this ToS simple, short, and sweet.</p>
Conditions of use
<p>By using <em>services provided by avoidthehack</em>, you are therefore agreeing to this Terms of Service agreement.</p>
<p>If you <strong>do not</strong> agree with this document, then it's assumed that you <strong>will not</strong> use any <em>service</em> provided by avoidthehack!</p>
<p>Continued use of the general website assumes you have read and agree to the avoidthehack Privacy Policy..</p>
Acceptable Use
<p>By using any of the services provided by avoidthehack, you agree not to use any provided service in a way that will:</p>
<ol>
<li>bring harm upon avoidthehack's infrastructure or availability to other users (ex: using exploits to gain unauthorized access to certain parts of the site/service)</li>
<li>launch web attacks on other persons/websites/businesses (ex: doxing individuals)</li>
<li>violate the copyrights/intellectual rights of any other individual or businesses (ex: posting direct links for pirating purposes)</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, users are solely responsible for any user-generated content they may post - this includes any ramifications that are real or imagined as a result of the user generated content.
Some services that allow for user generated content are blind to our servers (such as our PrivateBin instance) - so yes, what you post in most cases is <strong>on you.</strong>
