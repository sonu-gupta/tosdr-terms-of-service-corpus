Revocation of your consent does not affect the legality of the processing that has taken place on the basis of your consent until revocation.</p>
<p>The processing is lawful until your revocation – the revocation therefore only affects the processing after receipt of your revocation.
You can informally revoke your consent by mail or e-mail.
Your personal data will then no longer be processed, subject to the permission of another legal basis.
If this is not the case, your data must be deleted immediately after the revocation in accordance with Art.
