bank account information from you.
We will not collect, store, or have any access to your credit card, debit card, or bank account information during the payment process.

<p> If a credit card account is being used for a transaction, we may obtain preapproval for an amount up to the amount of the payment.
If you enroll to make recurring payments automatically, all charges and fees will be billed to the credit card you designate during the setup process.
If you want to designate a different credit card or if there is a change in your credit card, you must change your information online.
This may temporarily delay your ability to make online payments while we verify your new payment information.</p>

<p>
<strong>FEES</strong>
<br>
<br> The Digital Services are available under subscription plans of various durations.
All accounts are offered as-is at the time of purchase and subject to changes in the applicable fee structure.
&nbsp;Your subscription will be automatically renewed at the end of each subscription period unless you inform us that you do not wish to renew the subscription.
At the time of automatic renewal, the subscription fee will be charged to the Credit Card last used by you.
We provide you the option of changing the details if you would like the payment for the renewal to be made through a different Credit Card.
If you do not wish to renew the subscription, you must inform us a reasonable period of time, no less than 72 hours, prior to the renewal date.
If you have not downgraded to a free plan and if you have not timely informed us that you do not wish to renew the subscription, you will be presumed to have authorized Private-Mail to charge the subscription fee to the Credit Card last used by you.
</p>
<p> From time to time, we may change the price of any Digital Service or charge for use of Digital Services that are currently available free of charge.
Any increase in charges will not apply until the expiration of your then current billing cycle.
You will not be charged for using any Digital Service unless you have opted for a paid subscription plan.

<p>
<strong>Inactive User Accounts Policy</strong>
<br>
<br> We reserve the right to terminate unpaid user accounts (which include accounts signed up for paid service where payment has not been timely made) that are inactive for a continuous period of 120 days or more.
In the event of such termination, all data associated with such user account will be deleted.
We will provide you prior notice of such termination and the option to back-up your data.
The data deletion policy may be implemented with respect to any or all of the Digital Services.
Each Digital Service will be considered an independent and separate service for the purpose of calculating the period of inactivity.
In other words, activity in one of the Digital Services is not sufficient to keep your user account in another Digital Service active.
In case of accounts with more than one user, if at least one of the users is active, the account will not be considered inactive.
</p>
<p>
<strong>REFUND POLICY</strong>
<br>

&nbsp;Refunds may also be withheld in the event of a violation of this Agreement.
Gift cards cannot be refunded to alternative payment gateways.
cards that cannot be refunded to the source will be applied as a credit on your Private-Mail account.<br> You understand that by paying for Private-Mail service using BitCoin or another cryptocurrency as a preferred transaction method, you are using a payment means that is not backed by an official governmental entity or international financial institution, and that the payment system may be prone to fluctuations in market value in a very short period of time.
The Client agrees that any refunds for transactions using BitCoin or another cryptocurrency will be assessed as the lower of the BitCoin or another cryptocurrency exchange rate to USD at the time of the refund disbursement, and that at the time of the original transaction or refund request.<br>
