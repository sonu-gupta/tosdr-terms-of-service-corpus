</ul> b.
Customers (those who use the Chartbeat Product) <p> For Customers specifically, We collect and store Personal Data that Our Customers submit to Us, such as their names, job roles, e-mail addresses, and billing information, to allow Us to identify Customers, provide the Service and notify Customers of changes or updates to the Service.
</p>
<p> If a Customer elects to provide it, We also collect and store the Customer's phone number, which We use to assist Us in providing the Service, including to contact them in account recovery and other scenarios.
</p>
<p> We also collect other information from Customers, such as IP address and browser type.
We use the IP addresses of Customers to assist in login and other uses related to Customers' use of the Service.
Customers' sessions on Our Site are also tracked for systems administration purposes and to track user trends.

</p>
<p> We also collect Customers' user ID and password information to enable them to log into and use the Service.
</p>
<p> Finally, Customers will start receiving marketing emails from us when they register for the Service, as we believe it is of our common interest for the Customer to know more about our services and products.
Customers can opt-out of marketing emails by utilizing the unsubscribe links provided therein, but We may still need to send Customers e-mails relating to their accounts (e.g.
support requests response, security warnings, updates to our Terms and Conditions), as strictly needed, so We can continue to provide our Services in accordance with our obligations to you.
</p> c.
Customer Visitors (individuals who visit publisher's websites) <p> For Customer Visitors, when a Customer Visitor visits a Customer Website, We collect certain information regarding their use of the Customer Website, such as their IP address and browser type on behalf of our Customer.
Their session on the Customer Website will be tracked.
We may use their IP address to identify the general geographic area from which they are accessing the Customer Website.

<p> As part of the Service, We collect information relating to traffic on the Customer Websites ("Traffic Data") on which Customers choose to activate the Service.
In connection with the collection of this Traffic Data, Chartbeat does not collect any Personal Data from Customer Visitors, (i) so long as the Customer configures the Chartbeat code on the Customer Website in accordance with the instructions and documentation provided by Us, so that URLs containing Personal Data of Customer Visitors are not captured by the Service, and (ii) provided that We do collect IP addresses from Customer Visitors in order to show geolocation information but We remove the last octet of the IP address and therefore do not store IP addresses in a manner that would permit personal identification.
</p>
<p> Traffic Data is used to provide Customers with real-time analytics and uptime monitoring.
We may aggregate and anonymize Traffic Data with that from other sites to provide benchmarking data and other functionality, but We will not use or disclose aggregated Traffic Data in a manner that reveals the identity of a Customer or Customer Website without the Customer's express prior consent.
</p>
<p> We also collect first party cookie IDs on behalf of Customers.
Chartbeat code, by default, sets and reads a cookie on the Customer's website domain containing a randomly-generated user ID for purposes of determining unique visitor counts and visitors' loyalty to a site.

</p>
<p> Our Customers are required to: (a) make appropriate disclosures using the Customer's privacy policy or via statements on the Customer's website(s).
and (b) obtain all Customer Visitors' consent to the use of cookies, if applicable and when required by Data Protection Laws.
