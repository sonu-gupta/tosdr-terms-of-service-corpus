The user cannot choose a username that is already in use or which has already been used.
The username is unique to the member.
The member will systematically be asked to provide this username when using the Site in order to identify him/her and to provide him/her with a personalized response.</p>
<p>The username chosen by the user must comply with French legislation and more particularly, with legislation relating to public policy and morality.

<p>
<b>
<i>Use of the Accounts</i>
</b>
</p>
<p>A member can open as many Geneanet accounts as he/she may wish, provided that each account created with Geneanet corresponds to as many registrations, with a separate username and password allocated for each account.</p>
<p>All of his/her information is accessible via the ‘My Account’ menu on the Site.</p>
<p>Use of the accounts is exclusively for non-commercial purposes, except with the express prior approval of Geneanet, to the exclusion notably of any solicitation or attempted solicitation.</p>

<ul>
<li>to only access the Site using an ordinary web browser and solely to carry out personal or professional research;</li>
<li>not to share his/her login details, which are strictly personal, so as to share his/her Geneanet access with other people;</li>
<li>not to use a temporary email address;</li>
<li>never to use a web robot, for any reason.
A “robot” shall be deemed to be any software tool designed to reproduce the actions of a human user with a view to entering data, migrating such data, mass downloads, load or performance tests and/or “stress tests”.
The use of any automatic access tool is expressly prohibited;</li>
<li>not to bypass or try to bypass functionalities related to the security of the Geneanet sites, or the functionalities related to restriction of their use or to the copying of their contents or services;</li>
<li>not to extract, download or copy this data other than for genealogical purposes.</li>
<li>not to use this data for commercial purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Geneanet reserves the right to block access to its services if the level of access indicates an abnormal use of the Site and of the information it contains.</p>
<p>Failure to comply with any one of these undertakings may result in the immediate cancellation of the user’s account.
Geneanet reserves the right to undertake any legal action it may consider appropriate against any users who act contrary to these Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p>(back to top)</p>5.
Geneanet Premium<b>5.1.
Subscription Details</b>
<p>The Premium subscription allows the user to benefit from, amongst other things, the services found on the webpage accessible via the following link: www.geneanet.org/premium.</p>
<p>When a member has several separate Geneanet accounts, access to Premium services will only be via the specific username of the account for which the member is a Premium Member.</p>
<p>A user subscribing to Geneanet Premium confirms that he/she has full legal capacity to subscribe to it and pay for the subscription.</p>
<p>Subscription irrevocably commits the Premium member for the duration of subscription chosen at the time of registration, from the date at which Geneanet validates the Premium membership subscription.</p>
<p>Conversely, in the event that a Premium member were to be denied access to Premium services due to a fault (<i>faute</i>) on the part of Geneanet, or due to a case of force majeure, the member can request either the cancellation of his/her subscription and reimbursement pro rata for the period during which access was not or will not be possible during the remainder of the subscription, or, the subsequent extension of the subscription for a duration equal to the period of unavailability.</p>
<p>In order to allow renewal of subscription without interruption of access to Premium services, Geneanet will notify Premium members, by email and the posting of messages on the Site, at least fifteen (15) days prior to expiry of their subscription.</p>
<p>In the event of subscription renewal, Geneanet will ask the Premium member to pay the subscription amount.
Failure to pay the amount by the renewal date will automatically result in the account reverting to ordinary member status, and access to Premium services will be withdrawn.</p>
<p>In the event of renewal of the subscription before expiry, the renewal will take effect the day after the subscription anniversary date.</p>
<p>Access to Geneanet as a Premium member is for individual and personal access.
It is reserved exclusively for private individuals.
Premium members undertake not to disclose Geneanet account login details to any third party.
Breach of this provision may result in the cancellation of the Premium subscription, with the amount relating to the remainder of the annual subscription being retained by Geneanet.</p>
<p>The terms and conditions of sale of this service are accessible here.</p>
<b>5.2.
Fair Use</b>
<p>The Geneanet Premium subscription gives access to all public data provided on the Site (except information contained in family trees to which access has been restricted by the owners and which they use for personal purposes only).</p>
<p>This information is provided to Premium members for their personal or professional genealogical research only, within the limits defined at article&nbsp;4.2.3.</p>
<p>(back to top)</p>6.
<b>Hosting of Genealogical Data</b>
<p>Geneanet provides tools and hosting space to allow its Users to conduct Genealogy research.
In this respect, Geneanet notably offers users the possibility of creating their family trees and of searching various historical collections.</p>
<p>When Geneanet is not the data publisher of this data, in particular when Geneanet did not create the Family Tree in question, it is considered as a host pursuant to article&nbsp;6-1-2 of the French Law for Confidence in the Digital Economy (<i>Loi pour la confiance dans l’économie numérique</i>).</p>
<p>
<b>6.1.
Family Trees</b>
</p>
<p>The genealogical data is published on Geneanet, host of the family trees, under the responsibility of the member, who shall alone ensure the data is used and published in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.</p>
<p>Geneanet offers three levels of family tree privacy to allow a member to publish their genealogy while respecting the privacy of their living contemporaries, through the three following options: “Public”, “Semi-Public” (information apart from first name and surname, filiation and /or relationship is hidden (dates, photos, places and notes), or “Private” (living persons are not displayed)&nbsp;</p>
<p>The member must choose the appropriate level of privacy depending on the persons they enter in their family tree.
Living persons have the right to access, correct and delete data concerning them in any family tree.</p>
<p>If an account which created a family tree is inactive for more than three years, Geneanet reserves the right to make any correction that it may consider appropriate.</p>
<p>
<b>6.2.
Personal Archive Collections</b>
</p>
<p>Geneanet provides multiple archive sharing services on its Site allowing contributors to share their personal archives.</p>
<p>A “personal archive” is any digitized or transcribed document, of genealogical or historical interest (hereinafter, “contribution”), for which the member owns the rights of reproduction and exploitation, and which can be freely published.</p>
<p>These files are published under the sole and full responsibility of the member.
It is notably the member’s sole responsibility to ensure that they have the relevant rights with respect to these personal archives, and in particular, the consent of the persons identified or identifiable in these published archives, of which Geneanet is only a host.
Any document published which does not comply with applicable legal and regulatory provisions (in particular, those relative to dates for release of public archives and to the conditions for communication and use as defined by the terms and conditions of the public or private archive services which held it.
or those relative to compliance with privacy policy provisions) or which infringes intellectual property rights owned by a third party, shall be deleted by Geneanet, from the moment it becomes aware of such non-compliance or infringement.
To this end, the member must cite the source of the information and documents published on the Site.</p>
<p>Geneanet reserves the right to enter into business partnerships (<i>contrats de partenariat</i>) with other genealogy service providers for the purposes of sharing and/or enriching this indexed data.</p>
<p>It should however be noted that the database belonging to Geneanet is not physically transferred to its partners, so use of the data is limited solely to access by the Users of the genealogy service.</p>
<p>(back to top)</p>7.&nbsp;<b>‘Genealogical Data Legacy’ Service</b>
<p>By default, the data and research of members that is online at the time of their death will remain online.
However, Geneanet offers its members the possibility of declaring their wishes concerning the future of their family tree and associated documents in the event of their death.</p>
<p>In order to declare their wishes in the event of their death, members can tick the relevant box found on the page ‘My Genealogical Profile / Genealogical Data Legacy’.
In addition, a member can write a message for the attention of their heir(s).
This message will be held by Geneanet exclusively for such purpose, and will be sent to the relevant heir(s) on his/her (their) request.</p>
<p>Each member can thus choose to leave their data and research online after they die.
This decision is binding as against Geneanet (without prejudice to the provisions of the article hereof concerning the case of total cessation of the service) and for information purposes with respect to the heir(s), in addition to the legal provisions mentioned below.</p>
<p>In accordance with article&nbsp;85 of the French Data Protection Law (<i>Loi Informatique et Libertés</i>) dated January&nbsp;6, 1978, following the death of a member, his/her heir(s) may, subject to proof of their identity and inheritance rights, require that the death be recorded and that the personal data of that deceased member be updated (within the meaning of article&nbsp;2 of the French Data Protection Law dated January&nbsp;6, 1978).</p>
<p>(back to top)</p>8.&nbsp;<b>Ownership of Members’ Genealogical Data and Non-Commercialization</b>
<p>
<b>8.1.
Ownership of Members’ Genealogical Data</b>
</p>
<p>Genealogical data remains fully the property of the members who publish it on Geneanet.
With the exception of the indexations of images carried out on the Site which remain Geneanet property.</p>
<p>The filing of genealogical data under the Creative Commons license ‘CC BY-NC-SA 2.0FR’ (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/fr/) does not alter its ownership but does allow the reuse of this data by Geneanet and all Geneanet members.</p>
<p>In the case of a member’s account being deleted, certain data, particularly the collaborative genealogical data published by the respective member, will remain accessible on Geneanet.
This includes, for example, old postcards, photos of tombs or monuments, family crests, and records.</p>
<p>
<b>8.2.
Non-Commercialization of Members’ Genealogical Data&nbsp;</b>
</p>
<p>‘Non-commercialization’ means that Geneanet undertakes NOT TO SELL to third-party companies the information submitted freely and free of charge by its members via the sharing services as defined in article 6 of these Terms and Conditions proposed by Geneanet.</p>
<p>For the avoidance of doubt, ‘non-commercialization’ does not prevent Geneanet from using the information submitted by its members to set up services or options reserved for its Premium members, such as research, notifications or matches.</p>
<p>(back to top)</p>9.&nbsp;<b>‘Discussion Forum’ Service</b>
<p>With respect to the use of discussion forums, a Charter including ‘advice for posting a message’ is displayed at the top of certain discussion forums.
The Charter and ‘advice for posting a message’ must be read and respected prior to sending a message on the forum.
Messages not conforming to the guidelines may be subject to modification, deletion and/or the exclusion of the member concerned.</p>
<p>The user expressly recognizes that forums are exclusively for sharing information between, and for providing assistance to, other users, relating to genealogy.
Users undertake not to use the forums for any other purposes (particularly political and religious) and shall refrain from using controversial usernames or profile images and any behavior that may be judged as damaging to the convivial nature of the service.
Users expressly acknowledge Geneanet’s right to delete any messages, images and/or pseudonyms that breach this provision.</p>
<p>Users undertake not to use this service for commercial purposes, or, generally, to propose products or services remunerating them either directly or indirectly.</p>

<p>(back to top)</p>10.
<b>‘Geneanet Mailbox’ Service</b>
<p>Geneanet provides a messaging system, of which it is the owner, for its members to allow them to exchange messages relating to genealogy in an exclusively non-commercial context.</p>
<p>All messages sent by a member to a single addressee via the Site’s internal messaging system is considered a private correspondence, for which the sender of the message is solely responsible.
Geneanet cannot be held responsible for the contents of private messages between members sent via the internal messaging system.</p>
<p>In cases of abuse or misuse of the messaging system (notably by sending ‘spam’ aimed at canvassing, in the event of insulting language, harassment or any other form of prejudicial behavior that compromises the harmonious use of the Services) Geneanet reserves the right to delete the account of an offending member 24 hours after having notified that member by email or internal message.
No claim may be made in this respect by the member whose account has been deleted.</p>
<p>(back to top)</p>11.&nbsp;<b>Users’ Liability</b>

In particular, the user undertakes to respect the image rights of third parties, the right to privacy and intellectual property rights.
The user undertakes not to slander (<i>diffamer</i>) or insult (<i>injurier</i>).
In more general terms, the user undertakes to not contravene the applicable legal or regulatory provisions.</p>
<p>The User is fully aware that he/she is the publisher of the Family Tree that he/she creates and that he/she is considered as such under the law, Geneanet’s liability being limited to that of a host pursuant to article 6-1-2 of the French Law for Confidence in the Digital Economy (<i>Loi pour la confiance dans l’économie numérique</i>).</p>
<p>In this respect, the user undertakes to indemnify Geneanet for and against any claims and/or actions and/or complaints based directly or indirectly on this information and/or data, which may be brought against Geneanet.
In particular, the user undertakes to bear the cost of any payments whatsoever, which may be claimed from Geneanet, or payments which Geneanet may be ordered to make by a Court decision, including lawyers’ fees and court expenses.</p>
<p>Likewise, the user undertakes to indemnify Geneanet for and against any detrimental consequences directly or indirectly related to the use that he/she makes of the service.</p>
<p>This undertaking also applies as regards Geneanet’s partners.</p>
