Overview
<p>This Agreement governs Cloudflare’s cloud-based solutions that are provided as part of a subscription or require a Cloudflare account (<strong>“Cloud Services”</strong>) and software and software development kits made available in connection with the Cloud Services (collectively, <strong>“Software”</strong>).
<strong>Section 2 (Cloud Services)</strong> applies specifically to the Cloud Services (including Cloudflare’s application programming interfaces (<strong>“APIs”</strong>)), and <strong>Section 3 (Software)</strong> applies specifically to Software (including Cloudflare’s software development kits (<strong>“SDKs”</strong>)).

Cloud Services
2.1 Access to Cloud Services
<p>Subject to your compliance with this Agreement (including, without limitation, all payment obligations), Cloudflare hereby grants to you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and non-sublicensable (except to Affiliates) right, to access and use the Cloud Services (“<strong>Cloud License</strong>”).
If you are agreeing to this Agreement on behalf of an Entity, such Entity’s Affiliates may also access and use the Cloud Services provided that such Affiliates agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, and the Entity remain fully liable for such Affiliates’ actions and omissions in connection with this Agreement as if the Entity had performed such acts and omissions itself.

Software
3.1 License Grant
<p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Cloudflare grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and non-sublicensable (except to Affiliates (as defined above)) license to install and use the Software during your use of the applicable Cloud Services in accordance with this Agreement and any Cloudflare documentation (“<strong>License</strong>”).
Your License will end upon the earlier of the termination of your use of the Cloud Services requiring such Software or the termination of this Agreement.

If however, directly applicable law prohibits enforcement of the foregoing, you may engage in Reverse Engineering solely for purposes of obtaining such information as is necessary to achieve interoperability of your own or third party software with the Software, and to the limited extent permitted by directly applicable law, but only if: (a) Reverse Engineering is strictly necessary to obtain such information.
and (b) you have first requested such information from us and we fail to make such information available (for a fee or otherwise) under reasonable terms and conditions.</p>
3.3 Software Modifications
<p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, for any elements of the Software provided to you in source code form you may modify such source code solely to the extent necessary to support your permitted use of the Software (collectively, “<strong>Modifications</strong>”).
Unless expressly stated otherwise, you may not distribute your Modifications to any third party.
Cloudflare has no support, warranty, indemnification or other obligation or liability with respect to your Modifications or their combination, interaction or use with our Cloud Services.
You agree to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, costs, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) arising out of or in connection with any claim brought against us by a third party relating to your Modifications.</p>

Cloudflare does not make any representations, warranties, or guarantees regarding the Third Party Products and the providers thereof, including, but not limited to, as to their continued availability, security, and integrity.
If Cloudflare makes a Third Party Product available to you, it is on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis, and Cloudflare may cease providing it without entitling you to any refund, credit, or other compensation.
Each Third Party Product is governed by the terms of service, end user license agreement, privacy policies, and/or any other applicable terms and policies of the third party provider.
Your access or use of a Third Party Product is solely between you and the applicable Third Party Product provider.
Cloudflare will not be directly or indirectly responsible or liable to you in any manner, for any harms, damages, loss, lost profits, special or consequential damages, or claims, arising out of or in connection with the installation of, use of, or reliance on the performance of any of the Third Party Products.

17.
Dispute Resolution and Arbitration
17.1 Generally
<p>In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Cloudflare in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Cloudflare agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with this Agreement will be resolved by binding arbitration.
Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.
Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts.
Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.
Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of this Agreement, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of this Agreement.
YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND CLOUDFLARE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>
17.2 Exceptions
<p>Notwithstanding <strong>Subsection 17.1</strong>, we both agree that nothing herein will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.</p>
17.3 Arbitrator
<p>Any arbitration between you and Cloudflare will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures ("<strong>AAA Rules</strong>") of the American Arbitration Association ("<strong>AAA</strong>"), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA.
The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.</p>
17.4 Notice.
Process
<p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail ("<strong>Notice</strong>").
Cloudflare's address for Notice is: Cloudflare, Inc., 101 Townsend St., San Francisco, CA 94107.
The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.
and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought ("<strong>Demand</strong>").
We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Cloudflare may commence an arbitration proceeding.</p>
17.5 Fees
<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in San Francisco, CA provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.
(ii) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.
or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.
If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
In such case, you agree to reimburse Cloudflare for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.
Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.
The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.</p>
17.6 No Class Actions
<p>YOU AND CLOUDFLARE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
Further, unless both you and Cloudflare agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>
17.7 Modifications
