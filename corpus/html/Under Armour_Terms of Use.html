Disputes and Arbitration, Jurisdiction and Venue <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you and Under Armour agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.
Except where prohibited, you and we agree to submit to the personal and exclusive arbitration of disputes relating to your general use of the Services under the rules of the American Arbitration Association.
Please visit www.adr.org for more information about arbitration.</p>
<p>Any arbitration between you and us, to the extent necessary, will be conducted in Baltimore, Maryland, and you waive any right to claim that such location is an inconvenient forum.
You agree not to sue us or bring arbitration in any other forum.</p>
<p>The arbitration will be conducted in English.
A single independent and impartial arbitrator will be appointed pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration Association.
Both you and we agree to comply with the following rules, which are intended to streamline the dispute resolution process and reduce the costs and burdens for everyone involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner to be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the arbitration will not require any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by the parties.
and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Barring extraordinary circumstances, the arbitrator will issue his or her decision within 120 days from the date the arbitrator is appointed.
The arbitrator may extend this time limit for an additional 30 days in the interests of justice.
All arbitration proceedings will be closed to the public and confidential and all records relating thereto will be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award.
The award of the arbitrator will be in writing and will include a statement describing the reasons for the disposition of any claim.</p>
<p>You also acknowledge and understand that, with respect to any dispute with us arising out of or relating to your choice to maintain an account, access or use the Services:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You are giving up your right to have a trial by jury;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are giving up your right to serve as a representative, as a private attorney general, or in any other representative capacity, or to participate as a member of a class of claimants, in any lawsuit involving any such dispute.
and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must file any claim within one (1) year after such claim arose or it is forever barred.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If this arbitration provision is found to be null and void, then all disputes arising under the Terms between us will be subject to the jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Baltimore, Maryland, and you and we hereby submit to the personal jurisdiction and venue of these courts.</p>
<p>This agreement to arbitrate will not preclude you or Under Armour from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration, including without limitation orders to stay a court action, compel arbitration or confirm an arbitral award, from a court of competent jurisdiction.
Furthermore, this agreement to arbitrate will not preclude you or Under Armour from (i) applying to the appropriate court of competent jurisdiction for a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or other interim or conservatory relief, as necessary, or (ii) seeking relief in any state or federal court for disputes related to a violation or possible violation of Under Armour’s intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>In the event of any litigation or arbitration arising from or related to these Terms, or the Services provided, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the non-prevailing party all reasonable costs incurred including staff time, court costs, attorneys’ fees, and all other related expenses incurred in such litigation or arbitration.</p>
<p>If you are a resident of the European Union: Notwithstanding anything in these Terms to the contrary, if there is a dispute that you and Under Armour cannot resolve, you have the right to submit a complaint through http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr.
Other than as set out in these Terms, we do not participate in any ADR scheme.</p>
<ul>
<li>In addition, nothing in these Terms limits your rights to bring an action against Under Armour in the local courts of your place of domicile.
All disputes arising under the Terms between you and Under Armour will be subject to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in your place of domicile, or the courts located in the Netherlands, and you and we hereby submit to the personal jurisdiction and venue of these courts.</li>

</p>
Appendix A: Under Armour Shopping <p>By shopping with us using Under Armour Shopping, you agree to these terms and conditions.
These terms and conditions apply to all offers and agreements in connection with the online sale and delivery of Under Armour apparel, shoes and accessories (“<b>UA Apparel</b>”), but excluding digital products and services (e.g., Premium Memberships), which are expressly addressed in Section 8 of the Terms above.
Accordingly, the specific terms and conditions set forth below apply when you order any UA Apparel (i) from underarmour.com, or UA.com, of any of its country extensions.
(ii) from any site that is directly connected to UA.com.
or (iii) any Under Armour e-commerce or shopping application (collectively, “Under Armour Shopping”).</p>
(a)	Account Registration
<p>An account is not required to shop via Under Armour Shopping.
To make online shopping faster and easier, however, you may register for an account with us on one of our websites or applications.
Please confirm your email address when creating your account as we will use the email address on file to contact you.
If you have an account, you will have the ability to track shipments, view past orders, and quickly access your shipping and billing information with a username and password.
If you do not want to set up an account, you can still purchase from Under Armour Shopping as a “Guest.”</p>
(b)	Online Availability
<p>When shopping, once you’ve selected the item you wish to purchase you can determine what color/size is in stock by first selecting the color (1.Select Color), and then the size (2.Select Size).
If the size you want is not listed for the selected color, it is not available.
Although Under Armour Shopping is designed to feature “real-time” inventory levels so that only in-stock items are visible and available for purchase, we may experience shortages of stock due to overwhelming popularity of a particular style, color or size, and cannot guarantee that items which appear to be in stock are actually available.
If the item you would like to purchase is currently out of stock, we apologize for the inconvenience and encourage you to call our customer service line so that we may help you find a similar product.</p>
©	Locating the Style Number
<p>If you are looking for a product’s style number, it is located inside your garment on a small white tag.
It will read, for example, FW081100200 or on older styles FW060375.
The first four characters reference the season of the style (ex.
FW06=Fall/Winter 2006) (although, depending on region, the style number for some products may not include the first four characters) and the last seven (on new styles) or four (on older styles) characters reference the style number.
You can search this style number on our Services to find exactly what you are looking for.
If no results are found, the style may no longer be manufactured by Under Armour.
Please contact our customer service team for assistance in finding a replacement product.</p>
(d)	Ordering and Changes to Orders
<p>When you place an order we will send a confirmation email to the address you have provided.
If you are using your workplace email address, be aware that many corporations use spam filters to disqualify incoming automated emails, which could hamper delivery of our confirmation email to you or send it to junk mail.</p>
<p>The “confirmation” stage sets out the final details of your order.
Following this, we will send you an order acknowledgement email detailing the products you have ordered.
Please note that this email is not an order confirmation or order acceptance from Under Armour.
Acceptance of your order and the completion of the contract between us will occur upon our dispatch to you of the products ordered, unless we have notified you that we do not accept your order or you have cancelled it.</p>
<p>Due to the close time frame between order and shipment, it is difficult to make changes once your order has been placed.
However, if you contact us within an hour of placing your order and we will attempt to facilitate a change.</p>
(e)	Tax
<p>Sales Tax and similar taxes, such as value added tax (“VAT”), are calculated using local and national rates depending on where you are located.
Where VAT is applicable, you will be charged at the local rate and it will be included in the product price.</p>
(f)	Payment
<p>Under Armour reserves the right to supplement the list of acceptable forms of payment for Under Armour Shopping.
We may require credit cards and debit cards to be issued by an institution in the jurisdiction in which you are located, and those forms of payment must be linked to a billing address in the same jurisdiction.
For most jurisdictions, you must ensure that the billing address on file with the credit or debit card-issuing bank is the same billing address you enter when ordering.
We do not accept personal checks, money orders or cash payments online.</p>
<p>Because Under Armour does not charge for items until they ship, we may use a pre-authorization process to reserve your products for shipment.
In order to avoid unnecessary overdraft charges, a method called a “pre-authorization” is often used by banks to verify that the credit/debit card in use is valid and has sufficient funds.
Please note that the transaction description will show up on your statement as “UNDER ARMOUR.” Most authorizations expire within five to seven days.
however, the issuing bank ultimately determines the length of the authorization.
The final credit or debit card charge will only reflect the value of your shipped merchandise plus applicable shipping and taxes.
If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to call our customer service team.</p>
<p>If you are experiencing problems with payment, please contact our customer service team-a member of our team will be happy to assist you.</p>
(g)	Delivery and Shipping
<p>There are some locations that we cannot ship to, and we do not ship to post office boxes, so please confirm that we can deliver to you before placing your order.</p>
<p>The estimated delivery time and shipping costs for each order will be presented at checkout.
While we make every effort to deliver goods within the estimated timelines, delays occasionally occur.
Under Armour shall not be liable for any delay or failure to deliver goods within estimated timelines.</p>
<p>Under Armour reserves the right to require goods to be signed for by an adult aged 18 years or over upon delivery.
It is not always possible for customers in one jurisdiction to purchase from Under Armour Shopping in another jurisdiction.
Please visit our local website to see what stock is currently available to you.</p>
<p>You will generally receive a tracking number via email once your package has been shipped.
You can also find your tracking number(s) by logging into your account and entering the Order Number from your order confirmation email to track your package.
Please allow two to four business days between placing your order and using the tracking tool.</p>
<p>If you tracked your order on our website and received the message that your order is “in transit”, this simply means that your order is being processed for shipment, or that the tracking information has not yet been updated with the shipping carrier.
It typically takes two to four business days for the carrier to receive our tracking information.</p>
<p>We strive to ship all items in an order together, but we reserve the right to deliver your products in separate shipments if one or more items are unavailable at the time of initial shipment.
In the event that we split your order into more than one shipment, you will not be charged separate shipping costs for each shipment.
Further, each shipment will have a confirmation/tracking email.
If we experience an issue fulfilling one part of your order, that will not serve as a basis for canceling any of the other items included in that order.</p>
<p>Any orders that are delivered to you will become your property at the time that you receive them, provided that Under Armour has received full payment for the order.</p>
(h)	Cancellations, Exchanges and Refunds
<p>The cancellation, exchange and refund policies and procedures that apply to your order may vary depending on where you are accessing Under Armour Shopping.
For additional information about the policies that apply to a particular order, please review the policies listed in the Customer Service and Additional E-Commerce Terms section of the local website that you used to place the order.</p>

UNDER ARMOUR EUROPE B.V.
Article 1 - General and Applicability
<p>
<strong>1.1</strong> These General Terms and Conditions of Sale (“<em>Conditions</em>”) comprise the basis on which UNDER ARMOUR sells its products (the “<em>Goods</em>”) and shall form an integral part of any Agreement.
In these Conditions UNDER ARMOUR and the counter party to any Agreement shall be referred to as “Seller” and “<em>Buyer</em>”, respectively.
Seller and Buyer may also be referred to as “<em>Party</em>” and together as “<em>Parties</em>”.
“<em>Agreement</em>” means the relevant Confirmation and these Conditions.
“<em>Confirmation</em>” means the confirmation in writing (including confirmation by email, per Seller’s EDI system, Seller’s web shop or through any other digital (communication or order) system of Seller) by Seller to Buyer unambiguously expressing Seller’s acceptance of Buyer’s order.
Any order requires the issue of a Confirmation by Seller to Buyer to constitute an Agreement binding upon Seller.</p>
<p>
<strong>1.2</strong> No other general terms and conditions shall be applicable or supplement or set aside (any part of) these Conditions unless expressly agreed to by Seller in writing.
Reference by Buyer to any other general terms and conditions is hereby explicitly rejected.</p>
<p>
<strong>1.3</strong> In case of any inconsistency between the English version of these Conditions and a version in any other language, the English version shall prevail.</p>
Article 2	Offers, Confirmation and Agreement
<p>
<strong>2.1</strong> Any offer of Seller shall not be an offer but merely an invitation to enter into negotiations with respect to the sale of Goods.
For completeness’ sake, all Seller’s offers (including actual offers as well as invitations to enter into negotiations), also including verbal offers or other declarations by Seller’s (sales) representatives and/ or employees, either as price lists or otherwise (“Offers”) are completely free of obligation and do not oblige Seller in any way to conclude a contract with Buyer.</p>
<p>
<strong>2.2</strong> No Agreement will be constituted but after Confirmation by Seller after receipt of the order or after Seller has commenced to carry out the order.</p>
<p>
<strong>2.3</strong> Seller is allowed to accept and reject orders of Buyer at its sole discretion.
Buyer will be entitled to cancel an order only after receiving written consent from Seller, which consent may be made subject to conditions as deemed appropriate by Seller.</p>
<p>
<strong>2.4</strong> Seller is at all times entitled to effect adjustments in the Goods to be delivered, in order to improve them or comply with government regulations.</p>
<p>
<strong>2.5</strong> Any and all images and specifications of Goods in catalogues, price lists, advertisements, as well as any samples of Goods or any images and specifications of Goods shown at any sales events or meetings of Seller or where Seller is present etc.
must be deemed to be representations by approximation only, unless Seller has explicitly indicated the contrary in writing with regard to a specific delivery.</p>
<p>
<strong>2.6</strong> Seller will be entitled to charge the costs of any packaging separately.
The packaging will not be taken back.
Should Seller, however, be obliged by law or any regulations to take packaging back, any costs related to taking back or processing packaging will be borne by Buyer.</p>
<p>
<strong>2.7</strong> If Seller, by virtue of law, is under any obligation, other than resulting from an improper performance, to take back any Goods sold, Buyer shall pay to Seller all costs related to such taking back of the Goods.</p>
<p>
<strong>2.8</strong> All Agreements are entered into on the assumption that Buyer is sufficiently creditworthy and if Seller has any reason to doubt such, Seller may require full or partial payment in advance or set other payment conditions for delivery and suspend, delay or cancel any credit delivery or any other performance of its obligations.</p>
Article 3 - Delivery
<p>
<strong>3.1</strong> Delivery terms shall be set out in the Confirmation and be interpreted in accordance with the Incoterms 2010.
In case no other delivery term is declared applicable in the Confirmation, delivery of the Goods takes place Ex Works Seller’s warehouse in Venlo or any other destination indicated by Seller.</p>
<p>
<strong>3.2</strong> Communicated or acknowledged delivery dates are approximate only and shall not, unless explicitly stated otherwise, be considered as fatal terms.
Seller shall not be liable, nor in breach of its obligations to Buyer, because of any delivery made within a reasonable time before or after the stated delivery date.
Buyer will give Seller a written “notice of failure to deliver” and a reasonable time, which will be no less than 30 days, in within which to cure.
Buyer’s sole remedy for Selling failing to cure such breach within such reasonable time will be specific performance.</p>
<p>Where the parties will have expressly agreed that time is of the essence, Seller must be declared to be in default in writing in the event of late delivery, and be granted a reasonable term of at least 30 days as of the date of the receipt of notification to fulfill its obligations.
In the event that such extended term is exceeded, Buyer will be entitled to dissolve the Agreement or part of the Agreement only with respect to the Goods not delivered within such reasonable time.
In such an event, Seller will not be liable to pay damages, unless such damages are the consequence of gross negligence or willful misconduct of Seller’s executive management.</p>
<p>
<strong>3.3</strong> Seller is entitled to deliver the Goods sold piecemeal.</p>
<p>
<strong>3.4</strong> Buyer is obliged to accept delivery of the Goods upon Seller’s first request thereto.

Article 4 - Retention of title
<p>
<strong>4.1</strong> The Parties expressly acknowledge and agree that the Goods may only be re-sold in the context of normal business activity of the Buyer and that as a security for payment by the Buyer to the Seller the Goods are subject to the reservation of legal title to the Goods.
Seller shall retain title to all Goods delivered and to be delivered to Buyer until Seller has received full payment of all purchase amounts of all Goods delivered and to be delivered, as well as any amounts owed by the Buyer pertaining to work performed by Seller in connection with such purchase agreements and any claims pursuant to any failure in the performance of such purchase agreements on the part of the Buyer.</p>
<p>
<strong>4.2</strong> Buyer will be obliged to store the Goods delivered under retention of title with due care, ensuring that they are recognizable as the property of Seller.
In addition, it will be obliged to insure such Goods against, inter alia, fire and water damage and theft.
Buyer will pledge to Seller any claims it has pursuant to such insurance policies upon Seller’s first request, as additional security with respect to Seller’s claims against Buyer.</p>
<p>
<strong>4.3</strong> If Buyer fails to fulfil its obligations or if in the opinion of the Seller reasonable grounds exist to suggest that Buyer shall fail to do so, Seller shall be entitled to take possession of the Goods which are subject to retention of title or have the Goods collected from the Buyer or from third parties holding them for Buyer.
Buyer shall cooperate accordingly and provide any assistance necessary to effect the foregoing.
Buyer will bear the costs of recovery, without prejudice to Seller’s right to further damages.</p>

Seller will add taxes, duties and similar levies to the sales price where the Seller is required by law to pay or collect them which will thereupon be paid by Buyer.</p>
<p>
<strong>5.2</strong> The price for the Goods is based on the cost price for the Goods applicable at the time of the Offer.
In case of a change in the cost price resulting from any government measures, an increase in the prices of energy, raw materials or other materials necessary for the manufacture of the Goods ordered by Buyer and/or an increase in freight, storage, insurance charges, wages and exchange rates occurring prior to the agreed date of delivery, Seller shall have the right to increase the price of the Goods ordered accordingly, even if such an increase was foreseeable at the time of concluding the Agreement.</p>
<p>
<strong>5.3</strong> In the event the increase of the cost price for the Goods exceeds 15%, Buyer shall have the right to cancel the Agreement within 3 days after Buyer has received the prior written notice of each such an increase.</p>
Article 6 - Payment terms
<p>
<strong>6.1</strong> The entire purchase price shall be paid, or the remainder thereof in the event of advance payment, effectively in the currency referred to in the Confirmation, to the bank account of Seller in accordance with the payment terms stated on the invoice or otherwise within 8 days after the date of invoice.
Buyer shall not be entitled, on any basis whatsoever, to suspend performance of its obligations under any offer, order, Offer, Confirmation, Agreement, these Conditions or any ensuing agreement, and Buyer shall neither be entitled to any deduction, discount or set-off.

<ol>
<li> interest will accrue on all late payments, at the rate of 12% per annum or the applicable statutory rate, whichever is higher and to the extent permitted by applicable law, from the due date until payment in full;</li>

</ol>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>6.3</strong> In the event that Seller is fully or largely successful in legal proceedings against Buyer, Buyer will be obliged to compensate all costs incurred by Seller in connection with such proceedings, even to the extent that such costs exceed the cost award made by the court.

<p>
<strong>6.4</strong> Amounts paid by Buyer shall be credited by Seller against the debts receivable by Seller from Buyer, including those pursuant to the previous paragraphs, in the chronological order of the due dates of the debts.</p>
<p>
<strong>6.5</strong> Without prejudice to Article 6.1 claims of Buyer regarding the purchase price referred to in any invoice shall be made in writing and shall be sent by registered mail and must be received by Seller within 15 days after the invoice date, failing which any such claims shall lapse.</p>

<p>
<strong>7.7</strong> Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall have no obligations for breach of warranty in case of any deviations in shape, size and color that are customary in the industry or technically unavoidable.</p>
<p>
<strong>7.8</strong> Any and all claims for payment of an amount of money and/or replacement of the Good and/or supply of any missing part, on whatever basis, as well as any right to dissolve the Agreement will lapse at the earliest of the following times: a) upon late reporting pursuant to Article 7.2 or b) 12 months after the delivery date.</p>

If any (additional) tax becomes due because Buyer has not timely provided Seller with such documents or information, or because of any fraud, loss or misappropriation in relation to the Goods, documents or information, Buyer shall indemnify Seller against all liabilities for such Tax which Seller reasonably needs to pay to a third party, including any interest, penalties and costs.
If Seller is subsequently able to obtain a credit or repayment of such Tax from a third party, Seller shall reimburse Buyer the amount so credited or repaid less all reasonable costs, penalties and interest incurred by Seller.

<p>a.
Internet Dealer’s domain(s) and URL(s) must not contain any Under Armour trademark, including “Under Armour,” “UA,” or any other trademark used or owned by Under Armour (e.g.

unless that trademark appears to the right of the country code domain name suffix i.e., co.eu.</p>
<p>b.
Internet Dealer may use terms such as “Under Armour Headquarters,” “Under Armour Outlet,” “Under Armour Depot” or “Under Armour Store” only when clearly and obviously associated with Internet Dealer, e.g., “Under Armour Store at Ian’s Rugby Shop,” or “Ian’s Authorized Under Armour Shop.”</p>
<p>c.
In all sponsored links for any Under Armour trademark, the Internet Dealer must include “Authorized Dealer” in either the ad title or text.</p>
