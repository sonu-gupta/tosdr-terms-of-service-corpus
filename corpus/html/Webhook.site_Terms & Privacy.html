Pro Upgrade <p>Webhook.site provides a Pro Upgrade (formerly known as <i>Premium</i>) to all users who subscribe through Paddle.
A Pro Upgrade will result in all URLs created by the user as being upgraded to Pro, which includes additional features and removal of some limitations.
</p>
<p>A user, and the URLs associated with the users' account, will retain the upgrade status as long as their subscription is valid and their current payment period has been paid.
</p>
<p> If the user cancels their subscription, the upgrade remains valid until the end of the subscription period.
</p>
<p> If the payment is repeatedly rejected, the user is notified through the payment provider, and the URLs associated will lose the Pro upgrade at that time and Webhook.site will automatically cancel the subscription.
</p>
<p>A list of Webhook.site Pro features are listed in the documentation.</p> 3.1 Refunds <p>A full refund of a subscription period can be issued at most 14 days after creating the subscription and requires a reason.
