Citizen Science
<p>Our citizen-science projects are designed to benefit the entire scientific research community, which in turn benefits the larger public.
Therefore, if you participate in any Cornell Lab citizen-science projects, you grant the Cornell Lab and its collaborators, permission to use your contributions in any way to further this goal.
We will do our best us to protect your data and your privacy to the extent that it does not impede scientific research.</p>
<p>We ask you to grant us these broad permissions because they allow us to change the legal details by which we keep the data available.
this is important because the legal environment can change and we need to be able to respond without obtaining permission from every single contributor.</p>
<p>eBird includes several ways that you can manage your preferences in terms of how your name appears, and what functionality you would like to appear for other eBird users.
You can adjust that information from&nbsp;My eBird Preferences.</p>
<p>When you submit records to eBird, you authorize us to have our team of regional editors contact you about questions they may have about your observations.
This helps us maintain a high level of data quality so we can use these data for scientific and conservation purposes.
This is limited to official volunteers who help with data quality.&nbsp;Find out more about this process click here.&nbsp;</p>
Sensitive species
<p>Because a primary goal of eBird is to maintain a universally accessible, centralized database of bird observations, the bird observations you submit are available to all eBird users (eBirders), scientists, and others who are interested in examining the distribution, abundance, and trends of bird species.</p>
<p>eBirders are able to view their personal observations and the observations of others, so please be aware that your observations of sensitive species and their locations will be available to other eBird users.
Taxa on our Sensitive Species list, which can be global or customized by region and date range, are automatically protected so that specific location information is not available to the public but can be used by scientists working to protect those species.&nbsp;See eBird’s Sensitive Species policy for more information.</p>
<p>When you upload photos, videos, sounds, and other rich media to eBird and the Macaulay Library at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, you also agree to the&nbsp;eBird Media Licensing Agreement.</p>
<p>You must not contribute data to the Cornell Lab that you do not own.
For example, do not submit photos from Flickr or other third party services if you do not hold copyright of those photos.</p>
