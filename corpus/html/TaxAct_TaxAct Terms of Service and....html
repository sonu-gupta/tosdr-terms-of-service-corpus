<p>If you have any questions regarding privacy, please read our privacy policy at http://www.taxact.com/privacy-policy.</p> Electronic Filing Services <p>If you choose to file your return electronically, your tax return will be forwarded to TaxAct's Electronic Filing Center, where it will be converted to and stored in a standardized format and, then, transmitted to the applicable federal or state taxing authority.
TaxAct cannot guarantee that the taxing authority will accept your return, as rejections may occur due to circumstances beyond TaxAct's control (e.g., incorrect user information, malfunction of the taxing authority's system, etc.).
Your e-filing fee, if any, is non-refundable even if your return is rejected by the taxing authority.
You are responsible for verifying the status of your return to confirm that it has been received and accepted by the applicable taxing authority and, if necessary, for filing it manually.
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires TaxAct to provide notification to it of information relating to your use of the Services, such as notice of your electronic filing of your tax return, of the Internet Protocol (IP) address and other device information of the computer from which your return originated, and of whether your email address was collected.
By using the Services to prepare and submit your tax return, you consent to the disclosure to the IRS and any other tax authority, revenue authority, or other governmental authority with jurisdiction of all information pertaining to your use of the Services.
You agree that TaxAct is permitted to access and use any tax return and other information provided by you to perform the Services and, if necessary, to access such information to obtain contact information in order to provide notifications relating to the Services to you.</p> Modifications <p>TaxAct has the right at any time and for any reason to modify or discontinue the Services or any aspect or feature of the Services, including but not limited to their Content, functionality or hours of availability, the equipment needed for its access or use, or pricing.
In addition, TaxAct reserves the right, at any time, to change the terms of this Agreement.
If TaxAct makes changes to this Agreement, TaxAct will provide you with notice of such changes, such as by sending an email, posting a notice on the Services or updating the date at the top of this Agreement.
Your continued use of the Services after any such changes will confirm your acceptance of the then-current version of this Agreement.
For avoidance of doubt, TaxAct's posting a notice or updating the terms of this Agreement for the then current tax year will not amend or modify the terms for any prior tax year unless the terms expressly indicate prior year terms are also amended or modified.
If you do not agree with any such changes, you must immediately discontinue your use of the Services.</p> Satisfaction Guaranteed for Registered Users <p>If you are a registered user using the Services online and are dissatisfied with the Services prior to completing the billing steps within the program, your exclusive remedy is to immediately discontinue using the Services.
If you are a registered user who completed the billing steps after calling in to our support center and your return was rejected by the IRS and you cannot re-file, it is your responsibility to contact TaxAct's Customer Service Department by phone at the contact number located at https://www.taxact.com/support/request (currently 319.373.3600) within 30 days of the original billing date to request a full refund of the fees paid.
If your return was printed, TaxAct will not issue a refund.
You must reference the SSN (Social Security Number) associated with the billing transaction when requesting a refund of services to ensure proper identification.</p> Limited Warranty for TaxAct Products <p>TaxAct warrants the accuracy of its calculations to registered users of its consumer (not professional or small business) tax filing products.
If you are a registered user of one of these consumer products and you (a) e-file your return (b) are not a current and former employees of TaxAct or any other company offering tax return preparation products, and (c) either ultimately receive a smaller tax refund, ultimately owe a larger tax liability, or pay an IRS penalty solely because of a calculation error within the product and not as a result of, among other things, your failure to enter all required information accurately, your overriding of the results of calculations generated by the product, your willful or fraudulent omission or inclusion of information on your tax return, your misclassification of information on your tax return, or your failure to file an amended return to avoid or reduce your penalty after TaxAct has announced updates or corrections to its products, then TaxAct will (i) pay to you the amount of the difference attributable to any smaller tax refund ultimately received or larger tax liability ultimately owed as compared to the amount determined without error by another tax preparation product using the same data.
and (ii) pay to you the original assessment amount of the IRS penalty and interest paid by you to the IRS.
provided that any such amounts to be paid to you by TaxAct shall not exceed one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000).
TaxAct encourages you to visit TaxAct's website for updated information on the Services (www.taxact.com/support).
You are responsible for keeping TaxAct apprised promptly of any change in your email so that notices of such updates or corrections can be provided by TaxAct.
If you believe that a product calculation error occurred and you have complied with the above conditions, please notify TaxAct in writing at TaxAct, Inc., Customer Support, 1425 60th Street NE, Cedar Rapids, IA 52402 as soon as you learn of the mistake (and in no event later than 60 days from when you filed your return or, in the event of a claimed penalty, 30 days after the penalty is assessed).
You must include a copy of the IRS notice, a copy of the applicable hardcopy tax return, and your user identification information.
Your filing of such a claim shall constitute your authorization for TaxAct to obtain and review any data files that may be in TaxAct's possession or control in order to evaluate your claim.
You are responsible for paying any additional tax liability you may owe, and providing assistance and additional information as reasonably requested by TaxAct.</p> Third Party Offerings <p>THE SERVICES AND CONTENT MAY CONTAIN LINKS TO, OR INFORMATION REGARDING, THIRD PARTY WEBSITES, PRODUCTS, OR SERVICES (COLLECTIVELY, "THIRD PARTY OFFERINGS").

Binding Arbitration <p>
<strong>Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with TaxAct and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.</strong> Except for small claims disputes in which you or TaxAct seek to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county of the defendant’s billing address or disputes in which you or TaxAct seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, you and TaxAct waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services resolved in court.
Instead, all disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or our Services will be resolved through confidential binding arbitration held in Dallas County, Texas in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures ("<em>
<strong>Rules</strong>
</em>") of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services ("<em>
<strong>JAMS</strong>
</em>"), which are available on the JAMS website <i>and hereby incorporated by reference</i>.
You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS or waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.</p>
<p>
<strong>You and TaxAct agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services is personal to you and TaxAct and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.</strong>
</p>
<p>You and TaxAct agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.
§ 1, et seq.
(the "FAA"), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.
As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court.
provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms.
The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual's claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.
You and TaxAct agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee and TaxAct will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs.
For any arbitration initiated by TaxAct, TaxAct will pay all JAMS fees and costs.
You and TaxAct agree that the state or federal courts of the State of Texas and the United States sitting in Dallas County, Texas have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.</p>
<p>ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR OUR SERVICES OR CONTENT MUST BE FILED WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER SUCH CLAIM AROSE.
OTHERWISE, THE CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED, WHICH MEANS THAT YOU AND TAXACT WILL NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASSERT THE CLAIM.</p>
<p>You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within thirty (30) days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section by sending an email to arbitration@taxact.com.
In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration.
By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Disputes in accordance with the following Section (Jurisdiction and Venue).</p> Jurisdiction and Venue <p>THE VALIDITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY TEXAS LAW (WITHOUT REFERENCE TO CHOICE OF LAW PRINCIPLES), AND APPLICABLE FEDERAL LAW.
