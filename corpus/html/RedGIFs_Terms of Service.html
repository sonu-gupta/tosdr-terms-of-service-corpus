ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER – IMPORTANT – PLEASE REVIEW CAREFULLY AS THIS AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.
<p> This Section 12 requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with RedGIFs and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Arbitration.
Class Action Waiver.</strong>
</p>
<p> YOU AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US OR OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS OR EMPLOYEES IN THEIR CAPACITY AS SUCH (WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DISPUTE INVOLVES A THIRD PARTY) WITH REGARD TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH US, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DISPUTES RELATED TO THESE TERMS, YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, AND/OR RIGHTS OF PRIVACY AND/OR PUBLICITY, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STREAMLINED ARBITRATION RULES AND PROCEDURES OF JAMS, INC.
THEN IN EFFECT, AND YOU AND WE HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY.
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU HAVE IN ANY MANNER VIOLATED OR THREATENED TO VIOLATE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, WE MAY SEEK INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER APPROPRIATE RELIEF IN ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT IN THE STATE OF ARIZONA.
DISCOVERY AND RIGHTS TO APPEAL IN ARBITRATION ARE GENERALLY MORE LIMITED THAN IN A LAWSUIT, AND OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU AND WE WOULD HAVE IN COURT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.
AS AN ALTERNATIVE, YOU MAY BRING YOUR CLAIM IN YOUR LOCAL “SMALL CLAIMS” COURT, IF PERMITTED BY THAT SMALL CLAIMS COURT'S RULES AND IF WITHIN SUCH COURT’S JURISDICTION, UNLESS SUCH ACTION IS TRANSFERRED, REMOVED OR APPEALED TO A DIFFERENT COURT.
YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS ONLY ON YOUR OWN BEHALF.
NEITHER YOU NOR WE WILL PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION FOR ANY CLAIMS COVERED BY THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE.
YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER ON ANY CLASS CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST US INCLUDING ANY RIGHT TO CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY CONSOLIDATION OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS.
You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person’s account, if we are a party to the proceeding.
This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and not by any state law concerning arbitration.
In the event JAMS, Inc.
is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either we or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the American Arbitration Association.
Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction.
The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language.
Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>30 Day Opt-Out Period.</strong>
</p>
<p> If you do not wish to be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions in Section 12(a), you must notify us in writing within 30 days of the date that you first accept these Terms (unless a longer period is required by applicable law).
Your written notice must be mailed to us at the following address: </p>
<p>Vergil Services Inc.</p>
<p>11766 Wilshire Blvd</p>
<p>Suite 900</p>
<p>Los Angeles, California 90025</p>
<p>United States</p>
<p> Your written notice must include: (i) your name, (ii) your email and mailing addresses, and (iii) a statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with us through arbitration.
If you do not notify us in accordance with this Section 12(b), you agree to be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions of these Terms, including such provisions in any Terms revised after the date of your first acceptance.
If we make any changes to the arbitration and class action waiver provisions of these Terms (other than a change to the address at which we will receive notices of dispute, opt-out notices, or rejections of future changes to the arbitration and class action waiver provisions of these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the address set forth in this Section 12(b).
This notification affects these Terms only.
if you previously entered into other arbitration agreements with us or enter into other such agreements in the future, your notification that you are opting out of the arbitration provision in these Terms shall not affect the other arbitration agreements between you and us.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Severability.</strong>
</p>
<p> If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Section 12 will be null and void.
This Section 12 will survive the termination of your relationship with us.
</p>
<p>
<strong>In other words: We truly hope that we can resolve any problems with our users informally, and we imagine that most people feel the same way.
If it unfortunately gets to the point where we need to engage in legal proceedings, you agree to these provisions.</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>13.
Use of the Services on a Mobile Device.<p> We make available software to access the Services via a mobile device.
Such software is considered part of our Services and subject to the terms and restrictions herein.

(“Apple”) or an application obtained through the Apple App Store, the following shall apply: </p>
<ul>

</li>
<li> The application is licensed to you on a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferrable, non-sublicensable basis, solely to be used in connection with the Services for your private, personal, non-commercial use, subject to all the terms and conditions of these Terms as they are applicable to the Services.

upon notification, Apple’s sole warranty obligation to you will be to refund to you the purchase price, if any, of the application.
</li>
<li> You acknowledge and agree that RedGIFs, and not Apple, is responsible for addressing any claims you or any third party may have in relation to the application.
</li>
<li> You acknowledge and agree that, in the event of any third party claim that the Application or your possession and use of the application infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, RedGIFs, and not Apple, will be responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such infringement claim.
</li>
<li> You represent and warrant that you are not located in a country subject to a U.S.
Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S.
Government as a “terrorist supporting” country, and that you are not listed on any U.S.
Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.
</li>
<li> Both you and RedGIFs acknowledge and agree that, in your use of the application, you will comply with any applicable third party terms of agreement which may affect or be affected by such use.
and </li>
<li> Both you and RedGIFs acknowledge and agree that Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third party beneficiary hereof.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>In other words: These provisions apply to you if you are using the Services through an Apple device or application.</strong>
</p>15.
Miscellaneous.<p> These Terms contain the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of the Services.
If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.
Our failure to enforce any part of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of our right to later enforce that or any other part of these Terms.
In order for any waiver of compliance with these Terms to be binding, we must provide you with written notice of such waiver.
You and we are independent contractors, and no agency, partnership, or joint venture relationship is intended or created by these Terms.
The section and paragraph headings in these Terms are for convenience only and shall not affect the interpretation of these Terms.
You agree that, except as otherwise expressly provided in these Terms there shall be no third party beneficiaries.
We may assign, transfer or delegate any of our rights and obligations hereunder without consent.
