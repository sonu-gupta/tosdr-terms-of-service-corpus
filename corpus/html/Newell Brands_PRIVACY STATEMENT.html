COOKIES, WEB BEACONS AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES Our Sites use Cookies.
Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your device when you visit a website.
Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognize a user’s device.
Cookies help with a variety of website functions including allowing users to “log in” to websites (making your navigation of websites more efficient), remembering your preferences (such as language), and generally improving your experience on our Sites.
Cookies can also help ensure that the advertisements and content you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.
We may also include web beacons in marketing e-mail messages or our newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and links contained within clicked on.
<br> Some of our business partners set web beacons and Cookies on our site.
In addition, third-party social media buttons may log certain information such as your IP address, browser type and language, access time, and referring website addresses.
Further, if you are logged in to those social media sites, they may also link such collected information with your profile information on that site.
<br>
<br>If you would like to opt-out of cookies, visit www.aboutcookies.org or www.allaboutcookies.org for further information.
These websites also tell you how to set your browser not to accept cookies and how to remove cookies from your browser.

This includes when you log in through a third party site such as Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.
We may also disclose information collected from third parties to customize ads and to manage and facilitate messaging on third party sites.
Please note that when you unsubscribe from our marketing email there may be a delay in the discontinuation of our ads directed to you on third party sites.
13.
DO NOT TRACK Newell does not track its customers over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals.
However, some third party sites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you.
If you are visiting such sites, you may be able to set the DNT signal on your browser so that third parties (particularly advertisers) know you do not want to be tracked.
14.
USING MOBILE AND OTHER DEVICES Newell, our affiliates and third parties that we have engaged, may collect and store unique identifiers matched to your mobile device in order to deliver customized ads or content while you use our Sites, navigate the internet, to deliver location-based services and advertising, or to identify you in a unique manner across devices or browsers.
In order to customize these ads or content, we, or third parties, may collect Personal Data, e.g., your email address, or data passively collected from you such as your device identifier, location, or IP address.
Most mobile devices allow you to turn off location services.
<br>By adjusting the privacy and security settings on your device, you can manage how your mobile device and mobile browser share information, as well as how your mobile browser handles Cookies and other tracking identifiers.
Please refer to instructions provided by your mobile service provider or the manufacturer of your device to learn how to adjust your settings.

<br>
<br>We will process opt-out/unsubscribe requests as quickly as possible, and in most cases, within 10 days.
However, Newell Brands is made up of a complex web of many inter-connecting companies and service providers so it may take time for all our systems to reflect these updates.
We ask for your understanding that during this period you may still get messages from us while your request is being processed.
