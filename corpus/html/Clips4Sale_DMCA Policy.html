</strong>
<strong>Last Updated: July 6, 2021</strong>
<strong>Termination of User Account</strong>
<ol>
<li>We will terminate a user’s access to the service if, under appropriate circumstances, the user is determined to be a repeat infringer.</li>
<li>We reserve the right to decide whether material or activity violates our Terms of Service for reasons other than copyright infringement, such as child pornography, obscenity, or excessive length.
We may at any time, without prior notice and in our sole discretion, remove that material or terminate a user’s account for submitting that material in violation of our Terms of Service.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Removal of Material for Which Copyright Infringement Is Claimed</strong>
<p> We take claims of copyright infringement seriously.
We will respond to allegations of copyright violations under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).
The DMCA provides a process for a copyright owner to give notice to an online service provider concerning alleged copyright infringement.
When an effective DMCA notice is received, the online service provider responds under this process by taking down the offending content.
On taking down content under the DMCA, we will take reasonable steps to contact the owner of the removed content so that a Counternotification may be filed.
On receiving a valid Counternotification, we generally restore the content in question, unless we receive notice from the DMCA Notice provider that a legal action has been filed seeking a court order to restrain the alleged infringer from engaging in the infringing activity.
Our privacy policy does not protect any information contained in any DMCA Counternotification.</p>
<strong>To File a DMCA Notification.</strong>
