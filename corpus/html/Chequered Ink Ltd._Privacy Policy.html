Cookies
<p>This website uses a variety of cookies to store information for the next time you visit.
Cookies are text files saved in your browser to help websites remember information about you.
We use cookies to check if users are logged in, to save information about your preferences using the website and to check whether or not you are a brand new visitor or if you have visited before.

Embedded content from other websites
<p>Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g.
YouTube videos, social media buttons, images, articles, adverts etc.).
Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.
These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.</p>
Analytics
<p>We use <em>Jetpack</em> and <em>Google Analytics</em> to help us understand our customers.
Both of these analytics services use cookies to store information about you.
They may store information from other websites in order to build a profile of your browsing habits.
This information is then available to us (and other Google Analytics users) to help us understand who is using our site and what their interests are.
You can find Jetpack’s privacy policy here, and information on Google Analytics usage of your data here.

What data breach procedures we have in place
<p>We regularly check for breaches to the security of our website.
Should any breach become apparent we will immediately act to prevent further damage by securing our servers and we will inform all users that there has been a breach – even if their data wasn’t specifically affected.
We will do this via email (if we have a user’s email on file) and by public announcement.</p>
What automated decision making and/or profiling we do with user data
<p>We do not personally use customer data to profile our users, however our third party analytics services do provide us with an overview of our visitors’ demographics.
They show us the estimated gender, age and interests of our users to help us better understand our customers.
