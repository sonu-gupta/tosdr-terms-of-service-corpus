<p>This Privacy Policy describes the practices of Replit, Inc.
(<b>“Replit”</b>, <b>“we”</b> or <b>“us”</b>) regarding our collection, use, and disclosure of information (including Personal Information, defined below) through our website at https://repl.it and the related software and services provided there (collectively, the<b>“Service”</b>).</p>Applicability of this Privacy Policy<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy only applies to the Services.
We process Personal Information (defined below) lawfully pursuant to one of three bases: where we have your consent (such as where you opt-in to marketing communications), where we have a legitimate interest in doing so (such as providing you with customer support), where necessary for performing a contract with you (such as our Terms of Service, to which you agree as a condition of using the Services), or where we have a legal obligation (such as where a court order compels us).
This Privacy Policy does not apply to any website, offering, product or service of any third party, even if it links to our Site or incorporates the Service – please refer to the applicable privacy policies before deciding to provide any information to third parties.</p>A Note to Users Outside the United States.<p>We are based in the United States.
The Services are controlled and operated by us from the United States and are not intended to subject us to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country or territory other than that of the United States.
Your Personal Information may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers, and by using the Services you consent to the transfer of information to countries outside of your country of residence, including the United States, which may have data protection rules that are different from those of your country.
In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those other countries may be entitled to access your Personal Information.
If you are in the European Union and would like additional information on how we legitimize transfers of personal data outside the European Union, the European Economic Area, and Switzerland, please see the “International Transfers” section, below.</p>Information We Collect.<p>We collect information from visitors to our website (<b>“Visitors”</b>) and from users of our Services (<b>“Users”</b>).

Please note that doing so may negatively impact your experience using the Site or Service, as some features may not work properly.
</p>How We Secure Information.<p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the information we collect and store.
Unfortunately, no security measures are 100% foolproof, and as such no network or system (including ours) can be guaranteed to be 100% secure against destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to information we collect and store.
If you believe your information may not be secure for any reason, please contact us immediately at security@repl.it.</p>Managing Your Information.<p>You have many choices to access information we collect about you and about how we use or disclose that information.
This section details many of those choices, including how you can exercise rights you may with respect to your information (including Personal Information), how you can opt out of collection and use of certain types of information for certain purposes (such as marketing), and how you can use your browser or third-party tools to disable certain collection methods (such as cookies or tracking technologies).</p>
<p>You may access, correct, amend or delete information by accessing it within your account.
If you are unable to do so, or if you’re a Visitor who would like to exercise your right to access Personal Information we may have about you, or if you have any other questions about Personal Information we have collected about you, please contact us at contact@repl.it.</p>
<p>If you would prefer not to accept cookies or otherwise wish to disable our use of tracking technologies, most browsers and mobile devices allow you to change your settings so as to notify you when you receive cookies or other tracking technologies are being used, and to choose whether or not to accept/allow it.
Most browsers also allow you to disable or delete existing cookies or to automatically reject future cookies.
Please note that our Services do not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals.</p>
