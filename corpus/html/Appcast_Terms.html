Customer acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement conveys a limited right to use the Service and the Appcast Software and does not convey title or ownership of the Service or the Appcast Software, to Customer.
The Service and Appcast Software and related source code, web beacons, pixels, and any and all materials relating thereto, including all associated intellectual property rights, shall remain at all times the sole, exclusive property of Appcast and its licensors.&nbsp.
Customer agrees and acknowledges that the Appcast Software contains the valuable trade secrets and proprietary information of Appcast and its licensors.&nbsp.
Appcast acknowledges and agrees that: (i) Customer Data and Customer Aggregate Data is Confidential and shall not be disclosed to any third party excepted as required for the fulfillment of Service.
