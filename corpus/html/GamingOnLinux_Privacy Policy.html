Suggestions
<p>For additional privacy, we always recommend seeking out extra privacy plugins for your browser! Look out for Privacy Badger from the Electronic Frontier Foundation and uBlock Origin.
They exist for a reason.</p>
<p>We also recommend DuckDuckGo for your search engine (instead of Google), as they don't track you.
They also have handy "bangs" to search website directly, like ours! Simply enter "!gol" followed by your search term to search our site from DDG.</p>
