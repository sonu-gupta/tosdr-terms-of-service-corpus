</ul> Unbound for Mac Privacy Policy The World’s Simplest Privacy Policy <p>Hi, I’m Tyler, the indie developer for Unbound.</p>
<p>I take your privacy <em>very</em> seriously.</p>
<p>The Unbound app itself collects no information behind the scenes.
No tracking, no analytics, no “telemetry,” nothing.</p>
<p>If you’ve chosen (at the macOS system level) to opt in to sharing crash &amp.
usage data with developers, I will have access to that (heavily anonymized) data, but that’s it.
(And there’s no way as an Apple developer to opt out of that!)</p>
<p>UnboundApp.com collects no information itself—we use no cookies, no analytics, no tracking of any kind.</p>
<p>However, my web site host, GitHub, says that:</p>
<blockquote>GitHub may collect User Personal Information from visitors to your GitHub Pages website, including logs of visitor IP addresses, to comply with legal obligations, and to maintain the security and integrity of the Website and the Service.</blockquote>
<p>(There’s not much I can do about that… Unbound makes next to nothing, so I’m stuck using a free web host, and I can’t control their collecting IP logs, unfortunately.)</p> Unbound for Mac Support Support: Email Tyler at unboundapp.com &nbsp.
