</p>
<p>
<b>However, uses made of your presentation, video or other User Content, whether by Prezi or its users, are subject to the licenses that were in place at the time such use was originally made by the person or entity who originally made the use.

</p>
<p>
<b>7.4 THIRD-PARTY AND LINKED/EMBEDDED CONTENT</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Prezi gives you the option, when creating or editing a presentation, to search for and insert third-party content, including but not limited to images and content from other web-based platforms (such as Infogram), into your User Content (presentations, videos, etc.).
Such third-party content is subject to the license terms and contractual provisions that accompany it, and you are solely responsible for compliance with all such terms and provisions.
For example, if you use an image that is licensed pursuant to a Creative Commons license that prohibits commercial use, you may not use the image for commercial purposes.
Similarly, if you use Infogram charts, custom images, YouTube videos, or other third-party content in your User Content, including presentations, videos, your use must be consistent with the terms of use provided by those third parties, and the licenses applicable to that content.
Some license terms and contractual provisions may limit the manner in which you are permitted to use your User Content, such as share it with others, or allow re-use of presentation, video.&nbsp;</b>

</p>
<p>
<b>You will provide all assistance and cooperation to Prezi reasonably necessary to permit Prezi to perform the Professional Services.
You acknowledge that failure to provide such assistance and cooperation may impair Prezi’s ability to provide the Professional Services and may result in additional charges being invoiced to you as a result of additional time or expenses incurred by Prezi as a result.

</p>
<p>
<b>Prezi reserves all rights to the Deliverables that are not expressly granted in these Terms of Service.

<b>8.2 FRAUD PROTECTIONS</b>
<p>
<b>To protect against potential fraud, Prezi may take steps to verify the validity of the credit card information you provide to us.
The verification process may include debiting an amount between $0.01 and $0.99 from your credit card account and then immediately crediting the same amount back to your credit card, as well as asking you to verify the amount debited in order to confirm that you are in possession of your credit card.
Prezi will only use this process to screen for fraud and will not otherwise debit your credit card account except as part of a transaction conducted through your account for the Service.
By providing Prezi with your credit card information, you authorize Prezi to debit and credit your credit card account for an amount less than one dollar for such verification purposes.
Prezi may also engage third parties to provide fraud detection services.</b>
</p>
<b>8.3 CANCELLATION OF SUBSCRIPTION</b>
<p>
<b>Payment for subscriptions is non-refundable.
If you cancel your recurring payment option, your account will remain active until its next renewal date.
If you delete your account before the end of the term for which you paid, your cancellation will take effect immediately.
In either case (cancellation or deletion), you will not be given any refund.</b>
</p>
<b>8.4 TERMINATION</b>
<p>
<b>If your payment method is invalid or rejected for any reason and a free Prezi Public version of your paid Prezi account type is available, your paid Prezi account will revert to the free Prezi Public account version and will be subject to the limitations of a free Prezi Public account, provided, however, that Prezi reserves the right to cancel your account entirely in such case.
You will have the option of deleting any User Content from your account prior to its reversion to a Prezi Public account.
In the event your paid Prezi account reverts to a free Prezi Public account, any content you previously created with a paid Prezi account and designated as Private User Content will remain Private User Content, but you will not be able to edit such content.
New content you create with such an account will become Public User Content, which means any new content you create from that point forward is going to be public.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>If your paid Prezi account began with a free trial and you do not purchase a subscription to the same or an upgraded version of those services before the end of the trial period, your paid Prezi account will automatically terminate at the end of the trial period.
If your paid Prezi account is terminated for any reason or expires, any content you entered into the Service, and any customizations made to the Service by or for you, which are associated with your paid Prezi account will become unavailable.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Prezi further reserves the right to cancel, or revert to Prezi Public account status, the account of any user who attempts to fraudulently obtain Prezi educational pricing.</b>

</p>
<p>
<b>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court if its claims are within that court’s jurisdiction and are pending only in that court.
You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and Prezi are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.
This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.
This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms of Service.&nbsp;</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>(2) A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written&nbsp;Notice of Dispute&nbsp;("Notice").
The Notice to Prezi should be addressed to: Prezi Inc, 450 Bryant Street San Francisco, CA 94107 ("Notice Address").
The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.
and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand").
If Prezi and you don't reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Prezi may commence an arbitration proceeding.
During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Prezi or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Prezi is entitled.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>(3) The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA.
The AAA Rules are available online at&nbsp;adr.org, by calling the AAA at&nbsp;800.778.7879.&nbsp;</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this agreement.
All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision.
Unless Prezi and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in San Francisco, California.&nbsp;The arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.&nbsp;</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>(4) The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.&nbsp;YOU AND PREZI AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FEDERAL OR STATE CLASS ACTIONS, OR CLASS ARBITRATIONS.
Further, unless both you and Prezi agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
If this specific proviso is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.&nbsp;</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>(5) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Prezi makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) during the term of these Terms of Service, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of change to the Notice Address provided above.
By rejecting any future change, you're agreeing that you'll arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with this provision.&nbsp;</b>

<b>(6) HOW TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION:&nbsp;You may opt-out of this arbitration provision by sending a letter to the Notice Address referenced above, and providing each of the following pieces of information: (a) your full name.
(b) your address.
(c) your phone number.

and (e) a clear statement that you wish to opt-out of this arbitration provision.
This opt-out notice must be emailed no later than 30 days after the date you first accept these Terms of Service.</b>

<b>Summary:</b>
<p>
<b>Most disputes can be resolved informally.
If you have a concern, please contact us.
In the unlikely event that we are unable to resolve your concern to your satisfaction (or if we haven’t been able to resolve a dispute that Prezi has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or small-claims court, instead of in courts of general jurisdiction.
Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.
It uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts.&nbsp;Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.&nbsp;Any arbitration will take place on an individual basis.
class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.
Whether to agree to arbitration is an important decision, and in making it you should not rely solely on the information in this agreement.
You may opt-out of this arbitration provision by following the instructions below.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
