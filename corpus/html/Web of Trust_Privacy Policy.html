Some of this automatically collected information may be considered “Non-Personal Information,” which is anonymous, aggregated or de-identified information that is not collected together, or otherwise associated by us, with any Registration Information or other Personal Information, if any, that we hold about you.
When we automatically collect information, we go to great lengths to make sure that Non-Personal Information remains anonymous, as further described below.</p>How We Use the Data<p>WOT uses the information collected from or about our users for analytical, operational and business purposes in the following ways:</p>
