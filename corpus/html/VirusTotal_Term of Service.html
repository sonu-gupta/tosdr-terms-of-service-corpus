Any comment, post or other activity you engage in with the Community when using your account will generate content attributed to you (“<strong>Content</strong>”).</p>

Community Content Guidelines</strong>
</p>
<p>To the extent you elect to contribute any Sample to the Community, you confirm that all content contained in the Sample complies with these Terms and our Privacy Policy, that you are either the original owner of the Sample you submit or that you have the necessary rights and permissions to irrevocably contribute the Sample and share it, and information about it, with the Community.
</p>
<p>You understand that if you submitting any Sample, the Sample is immediately shared for review by the Service’s Partners, and the resulting intelligence report is shared with you and, and with the Partners, which use the results to improve their own systems.
As such, by contributing a Sample, you are contributing to the effort to raise global IT security levels.</p>

<p>YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT YOU WILL ONLY UPLOAD SAMPLES THAT YOU WISH TO PUBLICLY SHARE AND THAT IN ANY CASE, YOU WILL NOT KNOWINGLY SUBMIT ANY SAMPLE TO THE SERVICE THAT CONTAINS CONFIDENTIAL OR COMMERCIALLY SENSITIVE DATA OR PERSONAL DATA OF ANY INDIVIDUAL WITHOUT LAWFUL PERMISSION.</p>
<p>Although we have no obligation to monitor use of the Service, user Content or any Samples, we may monitor the Service to detect and prevent fraudulent activity or violations of these Terms and retain absolute discretion to remove Samples, Content or users from the Service at any time and for any reason without notice.
At the same time, to promote the security of the Community and information sharing accountability, accounts and Samples contributed by the Community (for example, comments, posts, etc.) generally will not be removed from the Service, unless they are illegal, violate the lawful rights of an individual, serve any other unethical/malicious purpose, or otherwise violate these Terms.
</p>
<p>IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO PUBLICLY SHARE A SAMPLE IN THE MANNER SET OUT IN THESE TERMS OR IN THE&nbsp;PRIVACY POLICY, DO NOT SEND IT/CONTRIBUTE IT TO THE SERVICE AS THE SERVICE IS DESIGNED TO WORK THROUGH THE COLLECTIVE AGGREGATION AND SHARING OF THREAT-INTELLIGENCE WITH AND THROUGH THE COMMUNITY.</p>
