<li>
<strong>Commercial Terms.</strong>
<ol>
<li>Types of Plans.
As described on the FingerprintJS pricing page (located at https://fingerprintjs.com/pricing/) (the “<strong>Pricing Page</strong>”), two tiers of the Service are made available by FingerprintJS: (a) a free tier (“<strong>Free Plan</strong>”) and (b) a paid tier (“<strong>Paid Plan</strong>”).
Except as otherwise expressly noted, both the Free Plan and Paid Plan are subject to the terms of this Agreement.</li>
<li>Fees and Taxes.
Fees are as described on the Pricing Page.
All fees and expenses are non-refundable except as set out in Section 10.i (FingerprintJS Indemnity).
Customer is responsible for any sales, use, GST, value-added, withholding or similar taxes or levies that apply to any amounts payable by Customer hereunder, whether domestic or foreign (“<strong>Taxes</strong>”), other than FingerprintJS’s income tax.
Fees and expenses are exclusive of Taxes.
</li>
<li>Payment.
Billing.
Customer must provide FingerprintJS with a current, valid accepted method of payment (as it may be updated from time to time, “<strong>Payment Method</strong>”) in order to purchase and use a Paid Plan.
FingerprintJS uses a third party payment processor (currently Stripe, Inc.
(“<strong>Stripe</strong>”)) to process payments using the provided Payment Method.
By starting a Paid Plan and providing or designating a Payment Method, Customer agrees to be bound by Stripe’s Services Agreement available at https://stripe.com/us/legal and further authorizes FingerprintJS to charge Customer any applicable fees at the then current rate, and any other charges Customer may incur in connection with Customer’s use of the Service, to Customer’s Payment Method.
Customer acknowledges that the amount billed each period may vary for reasons that may include the particular number of Unique Browser Instances during such period, different plan options or services, promotional offers, and/or changing a plan, and Customer authorizes FingerprintJS to charge Customer’s Payment Method for such varying amounts, which may be billed in one or more charges.
Fees for the Service may be billed at the beginning of the applicable billing cycle or at a later period, depending on the specific details of the Customer’s Paid Plan (as described on the Pricing Page).
After Customer’s initial billing cycle, and again after any subsequent billing cycle, Customer’s subscription will automatically commence on the first day following the end of such period (each a “<strong>Renewal Commencement Date</strong>”) and continue for an additional equivalent period, at FingerprintJS’s then-current price for such subscription.
Customer agrees that its Payment Method will be subject to this automatic renewal feature unless Customer cancels its subscription at least thirty (30) days prior to the Renewal Commencement Date.
By subscribing, Customer authorizes FingerprintJS to charge Customer’s Payment Method for the initial billing cycle and any subsequent billing cycle.
Customer reserves the right to change the timing of its billing as indicated in this Section 5.iii.
FingerprintJS may authorize your Payment Method in anticipation of subscription or other charges.</li>
<li>Fee Changes.
FingerprintJS, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the fees for the Service.
Any fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current billing cycle.
FingerprintJS will provide Customer with reasonable prior notice of any change in fees.
Customer’s continued use of Service after a fee change comes into effect constitutes Customer’s agreement to pay the modified fee amount.</li>
<li>Suspension of Service.
FingerprintJS may suspend Customer’s access to the Service if (a) Customer breaches Section 1.ii (Restrictions) or Section 4 (Customer Obligations), (b) if Customer’s account is 30 days or more overdue or (c) if Customer’s actions risk harm to other customers or the security, availability or integrity of the Service.
Where practicable, FingerprintJS will use reasonable efforts to provide Customer with prior notice of the suspension.
Once Customer resolves the issue requiring suspension, FingerprintJS will promptly restore Customer’s access to the Service in accordance with this Agreement.</li>

<li>Indemnity Procedures.
The party seeking defense and indemnification hereunder (the “<strong>Indemnified Party</strong>”) must provide the party from whom indemnification is sought (the “<strong>Indemnifying Party</strong>”): (a) prompt written notice of any claim for which indemnification is sought (provided that a failure to provide such notice will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Section 10 except to the extent material prejudice results from such failure).
(b) all reasonable cooperation, at the Indemnifying Party’s request and expense, in the defense and settlement of the claim.
and (c) sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim (provided that (i) where Customer is the Indemnifying Party, such control only accrues to the extent FingerprintJS requests Customer’s defense of the claim and (ii) the Indemnifying Party may not agree to any settlement that places any obligation on the Indemnified Party without the Indemnified Party’s written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed).</li>
