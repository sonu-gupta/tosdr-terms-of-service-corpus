<p>We use statistical cookies and similar techniques to create user profiles on the basis of pseudonyms in order to design our websites to meet the needs of our customers.
For this purpose, information is stored on your terminal device and selected.&nbsp.
Pseudonyms enable individual recognition of users.
However, the natural person behind a pseudonym can regularly not be identified directly, in particular by name, without further, additional data.
In addition, it is possible that we retrieve recognition features for your browser or terminal device (e.g.
a so-called browser fingerprint or your unabbreviated IP address) in order to recognize and count returning visitors and to evaluate their interactions pseudonymously.&nbsp.
In the following, we name the statistics cookies and similar techniques, purposes and storage durations as well as third-party providers, if applicable, and provide information on transmission to third countries.

Persistent HTML Local Storage <p>Marketing (19) </p>
<p>We use marketing cookies and similar technologies so that you can be shown cross-device targeted advertising on third-party websites and to recognize how effective our advertising measures have been.
<br>When you visit our websites, we or third-party providers used by us may evaluate your IP address, create pseudonymous recognition features for your browser or terminal device (e.g.
browser fingerprint), store them there or read them.
<br>These characteristics can be used by providers of tracking services and advertising network operators and other site operators to recognize your terminal device.
We can then order these providers to display advertising for you on other websites, based on the pages you visit on our site.
<br>Furthermore, your interactions with the advertisements placed by us can be tracked.
This makes it possible to track whether you were shown an advertisement placed by us, whether you clicked on it and subsequently visited our websites, and how you subsequently used our websites.
<br>Third-party providers can also exchange and match pseudonymous recognition features (ID) with each other in order to merge the features in the event of a match and assign them to the same user pseudonym (so-called ID matching/syncing).
This allows advertising to be played across different advertising networks.
<br>If you log in to social networks or online services of the third-party provider with your own user data, features can also be linked to your user data.
This enables the third-party provider to control our advertising campaigns in a more targeted and interest-oriented manner.
<br>Below, we list the marketing cookies and similar techniques, purposes and storage durations as well as third-party providers, if applicable, and provide information on the transfer to third countries.</p> Name Provider Purpose Expiry Type __gads Google Used to register what ads have been displayed to the user.

<b>3.4 Google Tag Manager</b>
</p>
<p>On our website, we integrate the “Google Tag Manager” of Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, California 94043, USA.</p>
<p>In the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA), Google Tag Manager is offered as a service by Google Ireland Limited Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.</p>
<p>Google Tag Manager is a tag management system (TMS) that allows us to integrate and manage additional website content in JavaScript or HTML code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In particular, so-called tags can be integrated and managed on our website.
Tags are small code fragments or markings (web beacons, tracking pixels or similar markings) that allow services to distinguish or identify users for website analysis or user tracking purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The analysis of website visits or user tracking is not carried out by the Google Tag Manager, but by the services used for these purposes, such as Google Analytics or other third-party solutions.
Rather, the Google Tag Manager merely serves to integrate and manage the tags necessary for analysis or tracking into our website.
Since the Google Tag Manager is provided by Google and is reloaded from its servers when the page is called up, the usage data technically required for calling up the page is also transmitted.
Google also receives your IP address, which is technically required to retrieve the content.&nbsp.

There is a risk that authorities in third countries may access the data for security and monitoring purposes without you being informed or having legal recourse.
We, therefore, take measures in accordance with Art.
44 et seq.
GDPR to ensure an adequate level of data protection despite these risks.
In principle, we have no influence on further data processing by the third-party provider.</p>

In the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA), Google Analytics is offered as a service by Google Ireland Limited Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland, which supports us as a processor according to Art.
28 GDPR.
Google Analytics creates usage profiles based on pseudonyms and usage data.
In the process, user interactions such as button clicks, scroll depth, and the use of filtering and search functions are also recorded.
For this purpose, permanent cookies are stored on your terminal device and read by us.
In this way, we are able to recognize returning visitors and count them as such.
Collected data is stored by us in Google Analytics for a period of 26 months.

<b>3.5.2 Google Ads Conversion Tracking</b>
</p>
<p>On our websites, we integrate the “Google Ads Conversion Tracking” of Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, California 94043, USA.
In the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA), Google Ads conversion tracking is offered as a service by Google Ireland Limited Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
If an ad placed by us via Google Ads is displayed to you on other websites or if you click on it, these other websites store a Google Ads conversion tracking cookie with a pseudonym assigned to us in your terminal device on the basis of your consent given there.
If you subsequently visit our websites within the storage period of this cookie, this cookie will be read by Google ad conversion tracking on our website.
In this way, Google can determine that you were shown an advertisement placed by us or that you clicked on it and subsequently visited our websites as well as, if applicable, how you subsequently used our websites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The conversion of an advertisement into action by the website visitor is referred to as a conversion.
From this information, Google Ads creates statistics for us, from which we can see how many users have responded to our advertisements and in what way.
Based on these statistics, we can optimize the effectiveness of our advertising and control our advertising strategy.

<b>3.11 Social Plugins</b>
</p>
<p>We enable you to use social plugins for Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn.
For reasons of data protection, however, we only integrate the social plugins we use in deactivated form.
When you call up our websites, no data is therefore transmitted to social media services.
However, you have the option of activating and using the social plugins integrated into our websites.
For this purpose, we use a solution that results in all data and functions required to display the social plugin being provided by our web server in a first step.
Only when you decide to activate the respective social plugin and click on the corresponding preview image or icon, a connection to the servers of the operator of the respective social media service is established by your browser in a second step.</p>
<p>When you activate a plugin, the social media service receives in particular your IP address and, among other things, knowledge about your visit to our websites.
This occurs regardless of whether you have an account with the respective social media service.
If you are logged in, the data can be directly assigned to your social media profile.
Overall, we have no influence on whether and to what extent the respective social media service processes personal data after activation.
However, it is likely that the social media service will create usage profiles from your data and use them for the purpose of personalized advertising.
In addition, your data will be used to inform other users of the social media service about your activities on our websites.&nbsp.
The embedding is based on your consent pursuant to Art.

a GDPR, provided that you have given your consent by clicking on the preview image.
Please note that the embedding of many social plugins leads to your data being processed outside the EU or EEA.
In some countries, there is a risk that authorities may access the data for security and monitoring purposes without you being informed or being able to appeal.
If we use providers in unsafe third countries and you consent, the transfer to an unsafe third country will be based on Art.

<p>If you no longer wish your personal data to be processed by the activated social plugins, you can prevent future processing by no longer clicking on the preview image or icon of the respective social plugin.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>4.1 General processing of business contact data</b>
</p>
<p>If you are in contact with us or have a contractual relationship with us, for example as a supplier, customer, interested party or business partner, we may process your data in our programs, such as our CRM systems, to the extent necessary for the respective purpose.
We process and store this data there for as long as necessary or as long as statutory retention obligations may exist.
The legal basis is our legitimate interest in a practicable implementation and maintenance of our business relationships in accordance with Art.

<p>
<b>4.2 Data processing for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims</b>
</p>
<p>In addition, we process your data in individual cases for the purpose and in the interest of asserting, exercising and defending legal claims, provided that your data is relevant to a legal dispute.&nbsp;The legal basis for the processing of your data is Art.

If necessary, your data will be transmitted in individual cases to the required extent to investigating authorities, lawyers, experts, courts or bailiffs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>4.3 Data processing for the documentation of data protection compliance</b>
</p>
<p>Insofar as you provide us with a declaration of consent on our websites, we process your personal data in order to be able to prove that you have consented to the data processing in question as part of the accountability obligation incumbent upon us under Article 5 (2) GDPR.
Insofar as you exercise your data subject rights under the GDPR towards us, we also process your personal data in order to be able to prove within the scope of the accountability obligation pursuant to Art.
5 (2) GDPR that we have complied with the GDPR when processing your request.
In addition, it may happen that we forward your personal data in connection with an inquiry to our company data protection officer, who advises us on all data protection issues and supports us in particular in processing inquiries from data subjects in connection with the assertion of the rights mentioned below.&nbsp;In each case, the processing is carried out on the basis of Art.

<b>4.5 Data transfer to independent third parties in the event of company restructuring</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>5.Recipients or categories of recipients of personal data</b>
</p>
<p>The recipients of your data as well as data transfers to third countries have already been indicated separately in some cases in the data processing described above.
Furthermore, we may transfer your data to service providers who support us, for example, in the operation of our websites or communication tools used, for example, as hosting or cloud services providers, if the legal data protection requirements are met.
For example, if the data protection requirements are met, we transmit personal data to authorities, such as billing data, if applicable, to tax authorities.
If contracts under data protection law are required for the transfers, we have concluded corresponding contracts with the service providers.
Insofar as data processing may also take place outside the EU or EEA in third countries, there is a risk that authorities in third countries may access the data for security and monitoring purposes without you being informed or having the right to appeal.
We therefore take measures in accordance with Art.
44 et seq.
GDPR to ensure an adequate level of data protection despite these risks, for example by concluding standard contractual clauses with our service providers in conjunction with further technical measures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>6.Storage period of data</b>
</p>
<p>Unless a specific storage period is specified separately for the data processing described above, we process your data as long as this is necessary to achieve the stated purposes or a separately granted declaration of consent to longer storage is available.
We then delete your data from all our operational systems.
We proceed in the same way if, in the case of processing based on the consent granted to us pursuant to Art.
6 (1) sentence 1 lit.
a GDPR, you exercise your right of revocation pursuant to Art.
7 (3) GDPR or, in the case of processing based on legitimate interests pursuant to Art.
6 (1) sentence 1 lit.
f GDPR, you exercise your right of objection pursuant to Art.
21 GDPR and the conditions stated therein are met.</p>
<p>In particular, insofar as in the event of your objection there are demonstrably compelling grounds for further processing by us that outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms as a data subject, this would continue to be permissible.
The same applies if the processing serves the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims by us.
Insofar as the fulfillment of a legal retention obligation imposed on us precludes deletion, we transfer the data concerned to archives and restrict further processing for the duration of the retention period.
In this case, final deletion will only take place after the retention period has expired.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>7.
Voluntariness of the provision of your data</b>
</p>
<p>The provision of your personal data is neither legally nor contractually required.&nbsp;However, in certain cases, it is necessary for you to be able to use the services offered on our websites.&nbsp;Failure to provide personal data may result in our websites being restricted in their functions or in you not being able to use the services offered.</p>

<strong>Description of consumer’s rights</strong>
</p>
<p>If you are a California resident, California law, including the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) and California Civil Code section 1798.83, provides you with additional rights regarding our collection and use of your personal information.</p>
<p>
<strong>Right to Know</strong>
</p>
<p>You can request a summary of the personal information 1plusX has collected about you in the last 12 months.</p>
<p>You can find the respective form to submit your request on our Privacy Policy page on the customer’s websites where we have placed our cookie.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can request this information by sending an email to privacy@1plusx.com, after which you will receive a web link to activate the data access request.</p>
<p>
<strong>Right of Deletion</strong>
</p>
<p>You can request Data Deletion by selecting the respective option on our Privacy Policy page on the customer’s websites where we have placed our cookie.</p>
<p>
<strong>Right to non-discrimination</strong>
</p>
<p>1plusx does not discriminate against any consumer and allows consumers to freely exercise their CCPA rights.</p>
<p>
<strong>Right to opt-out</strong>
</p>
<p>You are able to opt-out of the sale of personal information we have collected.
By selecting the respective call to action “Do not sell my personal information” on our Privacy Policy page on the customer’s websites where we have placed our cookie.</p>
<p>The result of opting out from the sale of your personal information will be to stop tracking your behavior and interactions whatsoever.
In addition, you will not be part of any segment and no personalization shall take place.</p>
<p>
<strong>How to submit a request</strong>
</p>
<p>California Law permits residents of California to request specific details on how their data is shared with third-party companies or affiliates for direct marketing or other business-related purposes.</p>
<p>If you are a California resident and you need to submit such a request, send an email to privacy@1plusx.com with the subject “California Privacy Rights”.</p>
<p>Additionally, due to the nature of 1plusX’s business, in the properties of our customers, we provide you specific web forms that allow Californian Residents to exercise their rights.
More specifically, we provide clear call to actions to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Request Deletion</li>
<li>Opt-out from Sale</li>
<li>Request Data Access</li>
</ul> List of PI categories collected or shared by the business in the last 12 months <p>1plusX collects and processes data on behalf of our Customers as a Service Provider.
According to CCPA, Personal Information is defined as the information which can potentially identify, relate to, describe, reference, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or device.</p>
<p>1plusX upon Customer’s request shall collect the following categories of information (according to the categories mentioned in CCPA §1798.140).
These are the categories of information that have been collected in the past 12 months.</p>
<ul>
<li>Identifiers (refers mainly to online identifiers, IP addresses, encrypted email addresses)</li>
<li>Internet or other electronic network activity information</li>
<li>Geolocation Data</li>
<li>Inferences</li>
</ul>
<p>It must be highlighted that 1plusX uses industry-standard encryption and security measures designed to protect any personal data from re-identification.</p>
<p>The sources of the collected data may be the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customer’s web/mobile properties where the user’s activities are observed and recorded either via cookie, an SDK or a Data Layer</li>
<li>Online/ Offline Databases or Data Marketplaces</li>
<li>Ad Networks (including SSPs, DSPs, Ad Servers)</li>
</ul>
<p>1plusX shares only anonymized information with Service Providers and Third Parties only to the extent that is required to fulfill the service.
1plusX does not share any information among customers with respect to user privacy, thus the data for each customer is siloed and cannot be exposed or transferred.</p>
<p>More specifically, the online identifiers (e.g.
hashed cookie ID, hashed emails) will be shared with Advertising Networks, Data Management Platforms, and Data Analytics Providers.
This information is often accompanied by Internet/ Electronic network activity information, Geolocation Data, and Inferences.
At 1plusX we make sure that by providing this information the other party will be unable to re-identify a specific individual or household.
The information that we share with 3rd parties cannot be linked to a specific individual or household due to the hashing functions that we apply on the identifiers (e.g.
cookie, login ID, email address).</p>
<p>The collection of the information allows 1plusX to move towards its business goal.
In that context, the main purposes for collecting the previously mentioned categories are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Internet-based marketing</li>
<li>Data Analysis &amp.
Behavioural reporting</li>
<li>Other operational purposes</li>
</ul>
