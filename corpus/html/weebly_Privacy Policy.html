A “cookie” is a text file
that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other internet-connected device
to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings
in the browser.
A “web beacon,” also
known as an internet tag, pixel tag, or clear GIF, is a tiny graphic image that
may be used in our websites or emails.

behalf.
For example, we may use other
companies’ web analytics services (described in the “Third-Party Analytics Services”
section), which use automated technologies to help us evaluate how customers
use our websites.

placed on your device, and how you can stop or disable them via your browser

ONLINE TRACKING AND INTEREST-BASED
ADVERTISING <p>We and the service providers we use to
advertise to you may collect information about your activities on Square.
We
use this information to advertise to you and to tailor our products and
services to your interests.
You may see certain ads on other websites because
we use third-party services to advertise our services to you.

Weebly ads that may be tailored to your individual interests.

websites that serve Weebly ads, such as the pages or ads you view and the
actions you take on those websites.
This data collection takes place both on
our online services, and on third-party websites that serve our ads to you.
This process also helps us figure out if our ads to you are effective.</p> To learn about how to opt out of
interest-based advertising in the U.S., see below <p>Certain web browsers allow you to instruct
your browser to respond to Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals to website you visit,
informing those sites that you do not want your online activities to be
tracked.

to address problems with our Services, to assist with investigations, to

applicable agreements or policies, or to take any other actions consistent with
applicable law.</p>

<p>To request the specific pieces of personal
information we have collected about you, see “How to Exercise Your Rights”
below.
You may find all of the other information listed above in this Privacy
Notice.
</p>
<p>California law gives you the right to ask if
we disclose your personal information to third parties for <i>their</i> direct marketing purposes (we do not disclose your personal
information for others’ direct marketing purposes).
It also gives you the right to ask if we sell
your personal information to third parties (we do not sell your personal
information and have not done so in the past), and if we did (which we don’t),
you’d have the right to opt out of such sales.
</p>
<p>
<b>Right of Deletion </b>
</p>
<p>You have
the right to ask us to delete the personal information we have collected from
you (subject to exceptions the law provides).
Please note that you may no
longer be able to use our Services if you delete your personal information.</p>
<p>
<b>Right of Non-Discrimination</b>
</p>
<p>You have the right to not be discriminated
against if you exercise these privacy rights.
We will not discriminate against you, deny, charge different prices for,
or provide a different quality of goods or services if you choose to exercise
these rights.</p>
<p>
<b>How to Exercise Your Rights</b>
</p>
<p>If you
live in California and would like to send us a request to exercise one of your
above rights, you may contact us as specified in the “How to Contact Us” section of this Privacy Notice or through your

</p>
<p>To help
protect your privacy and maintain security, we take&nbsp;steps to verify your
identity before granting you access to your personal information or complying
with your request.
</p>
<p>You may designate an authorized agent to make
a request on your behalf as permitted under law, though before we process that
request, we will require that you provide the authorized agent written
permission to do so and verify your identity directly with us.
</p>
<p>To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may charge a reasonable fee
to comply with your request.
