<p>The purchasing process includes these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users must choose the desired Product and verify their purchase selection.</li>

</ul> Order submission
<p>When the User submits an order, the following applies:</p>
<ul>
<li>The submission of an order determines contract conclusion and therefore creates for the User the obligation to pay the price, taxes and possible further fees and expenses, as specified on the order page.</li>
<li>In case the purchased Product requires active input from the User, such as the provision of personal information or data, specifications or special wishes, the order submission creates an obligation for the User to cooperate accordingly.</li>
<li>Upon submission of the order, Users will receive a receipt confirming that the order has been received.</li>
</ul>
<p>All notifications related to the described purchasing process shall be sent to the email address provided by the User for such purposes.</p>

<ul>
<li>either exclusive or inclusive of any applicable fees, taxes and costs, depending on the section the User is browsing.</li>

Any such offer or discount shall always be subject to the eligibility criteria and the terms and conditions set out in the corresponding section of this Application.</p>
<p>Offers and discounts are always granted at the Owner’s sole discretion.</p>
<p>Repeated or recurring offers or discounts create no claim/title or right that Users may enforce in the future.</p>
<p>Depending on the case, discounts or offers shall be valid for a limited time only or while stocks last.
If an offer or discount is limited by time, the time indications refer to the time zone of the Owner, as indicated in the Owner’s location details in this document, unless otherwise specified.</p>

<li>A Coupon may only be applied, in its entirety, at the actual time of purchase – partial use is not permitted;</li>

After this period, the Coupon will automatically expire, precluding any possibility for the User to claim the relevant rights, including cash-out;</li>

Therefore, this Application does not collect any payment information – such as credit card details – but only receives a notification once the payment has been successfully completed.</p>

</p> User rightsRight of withdrawal
<p>Unless exceptions apply, the User may be eligible to withdraw from the contract within the period specified below (generally 14 days), for any reason and without justification.
Users can learn more about the withdrawal conditions within this section.</p>
Who the right of withdrawal applies to
<p>Unless any applicable exception is mentioned below, Users who are European Consumers are granted a statutory cancellation right under EU rules, to withdraw from contracts entered into online (distance contracts) within the specified period applicable to their case, for any reason and without justification.</p>
<p>Users that do not fit this qualification, cannot benefit from the rights described in this section.</p>
Exercising the right of withdrawal
<p>To exercise their right of withdrawal, Users must send to the Owner an unequivocal statement of their intention to withdraw from the contract.</p>
<p>To this end, Users may use the model withdrawal form available from within the “definitions” section of this document.
Users are, however, free to express their intention to withdraw from the contract by making an unequivocal statement in any other suitable way.
In order to meet the deadline within which they can exercise such right, Users must send the withdrawal notice before the withdrawal period expires.</p>
<p>When does the withdrawal period expire?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Regarding the purchase of a service</strong>, the withdrawal period expires 14 days after the day that the contract is entered into, unless the User has waived the withdrawal right.</li>
</ul> Effects of withdrawal
<p>Users who correctly withdraw from a contract will be reimbursed by the Owner for all payments made to the Owner, including, if any, those covering the costs of delivery.</p>
<p>However, any additional costs resulting from the choice of a particular delivery method other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by the Owner, will not be reimbursed.</p>
<p>Such reimbursement shall be made without undue delay and, in any event, no later than 14 days from the day on which the Owner is informed of the User’s decision to withdraw from the contract.
Unless otherwise agreed with the User, reimbursements will be made using the same means of payment as used to process the initial transaction.
In any event, the User shall not incur any costs or fees as a result of such reimbursement.</p>
…on the purchase of services
<p>Where a User exercises the right of withdrawal after having requested that the service be performed before the withdrawal period expires, the User shall pay to the Owner an amount which is in proportion to the part of service provided.</p>
<p>Such payment shall be calculated based on the fee contractually agreed upon, and be proportional to the part of service provided until the time the User withdraws, compared with the full coverage of the contract.</p> Legal guarantee of conformity for goods
<p>Under EU law, for a minimum period of 2 years after delivery, traders guarantee the conformity of the goods they sell.
This means that traders must ensure that the goods purchased have the promised quality, or the quality that can be reasonably expected, functionality or characteristics for at least two years after they’ve been delivered to the purchaser.</p>
<p>Where Users qualify as European Consumers, the legal guarantee of conformity for goods applies to the items available on this Application in accordance with the laws of the country of their habitual residence.</p>
<p>National laws of such country may grant such Users broader rights.</p>
<p>Consumers who do not qualify as European may benefit from legal guarantee of conformity rights in accordance with the legislation of the country of their habitual residence.</p> Liability and indemnificationEU UsersIndemnification

Limitation of liability

<p>This does not apply to damages to life, health or physical integrity, damages resulting from the breach of an essential contractual obligation such as any obligation strictly necessary to achieve the purpose of the contract, and/or damages resulting from intent or gross negligence, as long as this Application has been appropriately and correctly used by the User.</p>

EU Users
<p>Should any provision of these Terms be or be deemed void, invalid or unenforceable, the parties shall do their best to find, in an amicable way, an agreement on valid and enforceable provisions thereby substituting the void, invalid or unenforceable parts.<br>
In case of failure to do so, the void, invalid or unenforceable provisions shall be replaced by the applicable statutory provisions, if so permitted or stated under the applicable law.</p>
<p>Without prejudice to the above, the nullity, invalidity or the impossibility to enforce a particular provision of these Terms shall not nullify the entire Agreement, unless the severed provisions are essential to the Agreement, or of such importance that the parties would not have entered into the contract if they had known that the provision would not be valid, or in cases where the remaining provisions would translate into an unacceptable hardship on any of the parties.</p>
US Users
<p>Any such invalid or unenforceable provision will be interpreted, construed and reformed to the extent reasonably required to render it valid, enforceable and consistent with its original intent.
These Terms constitute the entire Agreement between Users and the Owner with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersede all other communications, including but not limited to all prior agreements, between the parties with respect to such subject matter.
These Terms will be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
