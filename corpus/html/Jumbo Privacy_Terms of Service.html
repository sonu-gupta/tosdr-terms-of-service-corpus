Specificities of some Services offered in Jumbo App</strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>3.1 Transferring Your Content to Storing Services</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>3.2.
Privacy Management</em>
</p>
<p>Jumbo Privacy allows You to manage Your privacy settings within Your Accounts by showing You how Your information is used by the Account You select, by following this process :</p>
<ul>
<li>When You choose an Account to inspect, Jumbo Privacy will respond to Your request and review the use of Your data by the selected Account.</li>
<li>Jumbo Privacy then tells You what data is processed by Your Account, where You can find this data and then offers to delete the data You no longer wish to have processed in Your Account.</li>
<li>These are simple suggestions made following Your request to inspect the data processed in Your Account.</li>
<li>Jumbo App’s proposals are based on what is technically possible to do but no guarantee is given as to the practical application of these requests on Your Account.</li>
<li>You are under no obligation to follow these suggestions, You can either simply read the result of the research or do nothing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Jumbo Privacy is not responsible for :</p>
<ul>
<li>the consequences of Your choices on Jumbo App, including the actions taken on Your Account as a result of Your choices, for which You are solely responsible for,</li>
<li>the respect of Your choices made in Your Account.
Only You have the possibility to ensure that the data is no longer processed in accordance with the choices you have made.</li>
</ul>
<p>Jumbo App does not interfere with the privacy settings available within Your Accounts, nor does it offer additional privacy settings.</p>
<p>We encourage You to review the terms of use and privacy statements of Your accounts to understand what is done with Your personal data in Your accounts.</p>
<p>
<em>3.3 Block trackers</em>
</p>
<p>If You enable the “Block Tracker” Feature in the Jumbo App, Jumbo Privacy will block connections to servers you have selected by enabling an extension that will appear as a “VPN” on your phone.
Please note that contrary to a VPN, this extension does not encrypt traffic made on your phone.
You can turn this feature off at any time directly in the Jumbo App or through the iOS or Android device settings.</p>
<p>You are the one responsible to choose which trackers you want to block at any time by selecting or deselecting a tracker in your Jumbo App.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that Jumbo Privacy has relied on lists available online from privacy experts’ blogs to decide what trackers to enable you to block or not (notably the list available here).
Therefore, Jumbo Privacy gives no warranty on whether such trackers are effectively tracking your data, and misusing it, and whether you should or not disable them by using the “Block Tracker” feature.</p>
<p>When using this feature, you acknowledge and agree that the process used to block these trackers cannot determine the origin of a connection attempt and as such may occasionally block content you were trying to access.
This is an unwanted side effect of this feature and cannot be completely avoided.</p>
<p>3.4.
Identity Theft insurance</p>
<p>Depending on your location, we might offer to ou Jumbo Pro subscribers to activate an Identity Theft insurance.
The Identity Theft Insurance is underwritten and administered by our partner, Identity Force, an assurant company under group or blanket policy.
Therefore, once you activate your Identity Theft insurance in the Jumbo App, your insurance coverage will be managed solely by Identity Force.</p>
<p>The description of the Identity Theft insurance in the Jumbo App is a summary, and intended for informational purposes only.
It does not include all terms, conditions and exclusions of the described insurance policy.
Please refer to the actual policy for terms, conditions, and exclusions of coverage available here (Identity Force Terms).</p>
<p>3.5.
