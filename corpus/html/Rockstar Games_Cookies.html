You can block all cookies, or accept all cookies or pick a setting somewhere in between.
This range lets you control your cookie settings, so you can: </p>
<ul>
<li> See what cookies you've got and delete them on an individual basis </li>
<li>Block third party cookies</li>
<li>Block cookies from particular sites</li>
<li>Block all cookies from being set</li>
<li>Delete all cookies when you close your browser</li>

If you’ve set your preferences to opt out of cookies, this setting will be lost too, as that information is stored in a cookie.
Blocking all cookies means functionality on our Websites will be lost, as described above.
We don’t recommend turning all cookies off when using our Websites.
</p>
<p> If you want to reduce your cookie settings at any time – for example, if you accept all cookies, but later decide you don’t want a certain type of cookie – you’ll need to use your browser settings to remove any third party cookies dropped on your previous visit.
