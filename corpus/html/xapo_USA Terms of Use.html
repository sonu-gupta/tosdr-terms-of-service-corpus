#5.
SUSPENDED ACCOUNTS
<p>Xapo reserves the right in its sole discretion to temporarily or permanently suspend and/or Xapo Accounts.
This account blocking or suspension may be a consequence of, among other things, inconsistent information regarding your identity (which are reasonable on the sole discretion of Xapo), a pending compliance or security review, the request of a third party, the request and/or order of an authority, governmental body, regulator, justice Entity, police, etc., which in the sole discretion of Xapo are reasonable.</p>
<p>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCESS FUNDS IF YOUR XAPO ACCOUNT IS SUSPENDED, BLOCKED OR IS OTHERWISE LIMITED, AS DETAILED IN THIS SECTION 5.</p>
<p>In case the cause of the suspension is resolved, Xapo may require you to provide an external bitcoin wallet address in order to send you the available funds in your Xapo Account, or may transfer funds to a third party upon an order of a competent regulator, justice entity, judge, court or other which is reasonable in the sole discretion of Xapo.</p>
#6.

These verification and screening procedures may include, without limitation, checking the information you provide against the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons list maintained by the U.S.
Office of Foreign Assets Control, the U.S.
Department of Commerce Denied Persons list, and any similar list issued by any U.S.

(b) query account information associated with your linked bank account (e.g., name or account balance).
and (c) take action Xapo reasonably deems necessary based on the results of such inquiries and reports.
You further authorize all third parties to which such inquiries or requests may be directed to fully respond to such inquiries or requests.

RISK DISCLOSURES.
ASSUMPTION OF RISKS.
RELEASE OF XAPO
<p>Receiving, storing and transferring Digital Currency, and use of other Services provided by Xapo, involves significant risks and potential for financial losses, including without limitation the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Digital Currency is not legal tender, is not backed by the government, and accounts and value balances are not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or Securities Investor Protection Corporation.</li>
<li>The features, functions, characteristics, operation, use and other properties of any Digital Currency and the software, networks, protocols, systems, and other technology (including, if applicable, any blockchain) (“Underlying Technology”) used to administer, create, issue, transfer, cancel, use or transact in any Digital Currency may be complex, technical or difficult to understand or evaluate.</li>
<li>The nature of Digital Currency means that any technological difficulties experienced by Xapo may prevent the access or use of a customer’s Digital Currency.</li>
<li>Any Digital Currency and its Underlying Technology may be vulnerable to attacks on the security, integrity or operation of the Digital Currency unit or its Underlying Technology (“Attacks”), including Attacks using computing power sufficient to overwhelm the normal operation of a blockchain or other Underlying Technology.</li>
<li>The nature of Digital Currency may lead to an increased risk of fraud or cyber attack.</li>
<li>Any Digital Currency or Underlying Technology may change or otherwise cease to operate as expected due to a change made to the Underlying Technology, a change made using features or functions built into the Underlying Technology or a change resulting from an Attack.
These changes may include, without limitation, a “fork” or “rollback” of a Digital Currency or blockchain.</li>
<li>Any Digital Currency may be cancelled, lost or double spent, or otherwise lose all or most of their value, due to forks, rollbacks, Attacks, or failure of the Digital Currency to operate as intended.</li>
<li>Some Digital Currency transactions shall be deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that the customer initiates the transaction.</li>
<li>The value of Digital Currency may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange fiat currency for Digital Currency, which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular Digital Currency should the market for that Digital Currency disappear.</li>
<li>Any Digital Currency may decrease in value or lose all of its value due to various factors including discovery of wrongful conduct, market manipulation, changes to Digital Currency properties or perceived value of Digital Currency properties, Attacks, suspension or cessation of support for a Digital Currency by Xapo or other exchanges or service providers, and other factors outside the control of Xapo.</li>
<li>The volatility and unpredictability of the price of Digital Currency relative to fiat currency may result in significant loss over a short period of time.</li>
<li>Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of Digital Currency.
Government regulation of Digital Currency is unsettled and rapidly evolving.</li>
<li>Xapo may not be a regulated entity in your jurisdiction, and your Digital Currency or fiat currency held with Xapo may not be regarded as a deposit or be eligible for deposit insurance programs.</li>
<li>Any bond or trust account maintained by Xapo for the benefit of its customers may not be sufficient to cover all losses incurred by customers.</li>
<li>There is no assurance that a person who accepts a Digital Currency as payment today will continue to do so in the future.</li>
<li>Any Digital Currency may be lost if sent to the wrong address (for example but without limitation, if the address is improperly formatted, contains errors, or is intended to be used for a different type of Digital Currency).
On many Digital Currency networks, such as Bitcoin, transactions are generally irreversible and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable.</li>
</ul>
<p>The risks described in this Section 9 may result in loss of Digital Currency, decrease in or loss of all value for Digital Currency, inability to access or transfer Digital Currency, inability to trade Digital Currency, inability to receive financial benefits available to other Digital Currency holders, and other financial losses to you.
You hereby assume, and agree that Xapo will have no responsibility or liability for, such risks.
You hereby irrevocably waive, release and discharge all claims, whether known or unknown to you, against Xapo and its shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives related to any of the risks set forth herein.
You waive application of Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California, or any similar statute or law of any other jurisdiction.
Section 1542 reads as follows: “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.”</p>
<p>You represent and warrant that you have: (a) the necessary technical expertise and ability to review and evaluate the security, integrity and operation of any Digital Currency that you decide to acquire.
and (b) the knowledge, experience, understanding, professional advice and information to make your own evaluation of the merits and risks of any Digital Currency.
You accept the risk of receiving, storing and transferring Digital Currency through the Services, and are responsible for conducting your own independent analysis of the risks specific to the Digital Currency and the Services.</p>
#10.

GENERAL SERVICE TERMS
<p>
<strong>11.1.
Support for Bitcoin Only.</strong> The only Digital Currency supported by Xapo is bitcoin.
If you want to store, transfer and/or use any Digital Currency other than bitcoin, you cannot do it through the Xapo Services.
If you send or transfer to your Xapo Wallet or Vault any Digital Currency that is not bitcoin, Xapo shall not be responsible for receiving or storing it in any way and you may lose any right in connection to such Digital Currency or value without any right or claim to Xapo.</p>
<p>
<strong>11.2.
The Xapo Services.</strong> Xapo provides a way to store, use, and manage bitcoins, using our wallet service, which we call Xapo Wallet, and the Xapo deep cold storage service, which we call Xapo Vault.</p>
<p>
<strong>11.2.1.
Purchase and Sale of Bitcoins.</strong> To purchase from or sell bitcoins to Xapo, simply click on the red [BUY BITCOINS] button or after logging in to our Website or Apps.
You will be taken through a process that locks in a bitcoin price for 300 seconds, then displays different methods, depending on your location and some other factors, to either (a) transfer fiat currency to Xapo pay for your purchased bitcoin or (b) withdraw fiat currency as proceeds from your sold bitcoin.
The purchase, sale and fiat currency transfer options are personalized to each user based upon certain factors involved, so only specific payment options are shown for each purchase or sale order.
Xapo does not charge fees for buying or selling bitcoins, but processing fees may apply depending on the payment method.
The price level at which we sell bitcoins to or purchase bitcoins from our customers is the price listed on our Website or Apps as the Xapo price.
You are solely responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the information included when you initiate your transfer of fiat currency, including by wire transfer or ACH transaction.
This includes the account number, bank routing number, your Xapo-specific reference number and any other information requested by us.
</p>
<p>To withdraw Digital Currency from your Xapo Wallet, simply click on the TRANSFER button after logging in.
You will be taken through a process that will display a quote of the value assigned by Xapo to one bitcoin in your selected fiat currency, allowing you to transfer such value to the selected account.
After accepting the quote, we will display a message indicating that the transfer to the selected account is being processed.</p>
<p>Please review carefully our current Exchange Transactions Rules here.
</p>
<p>When funding or withdrawing funds from your Xapo Wallet through wire transfer and/or any payment processor and/or payment method, incoming or withdrawn funds can be sent from or to an account in your own name or in the name of a third party.
You are solely responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the information included in your transfer of funds, including account number, bank routing number, your Xapo-specific reference number and any other information requested by us.
Xapo cannot revoke or cancel a wire once it has been initiated by a bank.
You shall be solely responsible for all costs, losses, damages and liabilities arising from any reversal of funds initiated by Xapo as a result of your failing to comply with the provisions of this Section 11.
Xapo reserves the right to delay or not process incoming or withdrawing wires and/or other transfers or payment processor method for any reason, including to verify that the wire or other transfer was actually initiated by you or where required or recommended by applicable governmental, regulatory or law enforcement requirements.
Xapo is not liable for any act, omission, mistake, default, delay, negligence, misconduct or insolvency of any third party, including any bank, entity or person.</p>
OTC Transactions
<p>OTC Transactions shall be conducted by Xapo and you in accordance to industry custom and practice, which means industry standards, practices, methods and procedures conforming to the applicable laws and regulations, and the exercise of the degree of skill and care, diligence, prudence and foresight which would reasonably and ordinarily be expected from a skilled and experienced person or body engaged within the cryptocurrency industry and business sector.</p>
<p>Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in connection with the OTC Transaction entered into thereunder, including any question regarding its existence, validity, invalidity or any breach or termination thereof, shall be settled in accordance with Section 22 of these Terms.
The Xapo address provided in these Terms shall be deemed to be the place of performance of all obligations arising under the Agreement and the OTC Transactions entered into hereunder.</p>
<p>
<strong>11.2.2.
Processing Fees.</strong> Please review carefully our current processing fees here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Outgoing transactions.
Outgoing bitcoin transactions from your Xapo Account to another Xapo Account are not subject to any processing fee.
Outgoing bitcoin transactions from your Xapo Account to a bitcoin address outside of Xapo are subject to a processing fee that you can review here: Bitcoin Transaction Fees.</li>
<li>Incoming transactions.
Incoming bitcoin transactions to your Xapo Wallet and/or Vault equal to or below a certain amount are subject to a special processing fee so as to cover the transaction cost of the Bitcoin network.
This special processing fee shall be automatically deducted from the respective transaction.
Please review our current special processing fee here.</li>
</ul>
<p>Xapo reserves the right to charge additional fees or to change the amount of fees, and we will provide you at least 30 days advance notice of any such change.
Xapo reserves the right to waive and/or reduce any fee at any time, with or without notice.</p>
<p>
<strong>11.2.3.
Xapo Bitcoin Reserve.</strong> Xapo maintains a proprietary reserve of bitcoins (“Bitcoin Reserve”) that is designed to ease the impact of bitcoin losses that are a direct consequence of certain incidents, as described below, and that are not related in any way with your own actions, omissions or errors.
The Xapo Bitcoin Reserve is provided to you at no charge.</p>
<p>The Xapo Bitcoin Reserve is designed to cover direct and effective losses suffered by users as a result of attacks of hackers to our systems, theft by any third party and/or Xapo employee from our systems or facilities, break-ins at a physical location of our vaults, and/or our bankruptcy, which are not due to or related to your acts, omissions or errors (“Qualifying Losses”).</p>
<p>The Xapo Bitcoin Reserve does not cover cases of hacking of individuals’ and entities’ systems, devices and personal accounts, such as phones, computers, email accounts, etc.
For example, a loss suffered as a result of your failure to maintain adequate security, control or confidentiality of your Xapo Account information, including any Account Credentials or other codes associated with your Xapo Account and any activity occurring within that Xapo Account, will not be considered a Qualifying Loss.</p>
<p>The Xapo Bitcoin Reserve is primarily designed to cover the loss of bitcoins stored by our users in the Xapo Vault, our deep cold storage service that incorporates multiple layers of cryptographic security to help secure your bitcoins.
These processes include multi-factor authentication and private key segmentation between others.</p>
<p>The Xapo Bitcoin Reserve is also designed to cover bitcoins held by Xapo in “Hot Storage” (i.e., connected to a network in order to meet the liquidity needs of Xapo Wallet users) and it is intended to hold an equal or greater amount of bitcoins than the bitcoins held by Xapo in Hot Storage.</p>
<p>WHILE WE HAVE DESIGNED THE XAPO BITCOIN RESERVE TO HELP LESSEN THE IMPACT OF BITCOIN LOSSES THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF OUR USERS’ CONTROL, WE DO NOT AND CANNOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE XAPO BITCOIN RESERVE WILL HAVE A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF BITCOINS TO COVER ANY OR ALL LOSSES SUFFERED BY OUR USERS IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES.</p>
<p>In the event of a Qualifying Loss, bitcoins stored by users in our Vault will have priority to be covered by the Xapo Bitcoin Reserve.
Qualifying Losses by Xapo Wallet users shall only be covered by the Xapo Bitcoin Reserve after the Qualifying Losses of Vault users have been covered, because bitcoins held in Xapo Wallets are subject to a higher propensity for cyber-attack, and we reward users that take their own security measures, including preferring our Vault Service.</p>
<p>In these cases, the Xapo Bitcoin Reserve shall cover the Qualifying Losses in the following priority order:</p>
<p>(i) Qualifying Losses stored in the Xapo Vault of users.
If the Xapo Bitcoin Reserve is not enough to cover 100% of Vault users’ Qualifying Losses, it shall cover Vault users’ losses on a pro rata basis, based upon the total value of their Qualifying Losses in proportion to the total value of bitcoin lost by all Xapo users as a result of the incident.</p>
<p>(ii) Qualifying Losses stored in the Xapo Wallet of our users.
If the Xapo Bitcoin Reserve is not enough to cover 100% of Wallet users’ Qualifying Losses, it shall cover Xapo Wallet users’ losses on a pro rata basis, based upon the total value of their Qualifying Losses in proportion to the total value of bitcoin lost by all Xapo users as a result of the incident.</p>
<p>For avoidance of doubt, each Entity user is counted only once in the above calculations, regardless of how many authorized persons use the Services on behalf of that Entity user.</p>
<p>The use of the Xapo Bitcoin Reserve is optional for our users.
As a condition to receiving any bitcoins and/or funds from the coverage of the Xapo Bitcoin Reserve, you agree to (i) timely cooperate with Xapo upon its request in connection with any coverage claim relating to your bitcoins, including by timely providing any information or documentation that Xapo reasonably requests, and (ii) sign any documents, including but not limited to a release of further claims against Xapo, that Xapo may require.</p>
<p>
<strong>11.3.
Forks.</strong> If, as a consequence of a “fork” (as such term is commonly known in the bitcoin industry), bitcoin holders are granted an equivalent or proportional amount of a new Digital Currency or values that are not bitcoin, Xapo shall not have any obligation whatsoever in connection to such new Digital Currency or value, provided, however, that Xapo may grant you, at its sole discretion, a reasonable term to withdraw such Digital Currency or value and transfer it to a third party.
If you choose not to withdraw the total balance of the Digital Currency or value within such term, Xapo reserves the right to automatically convert the total balance of such Digital Currency into bitcoin and credit it to your Xapo Wallet.
The above does not mean and shall not be interpreted in any way as an obligation of Xapo to provide any support or withdraw option of any Digital Currency or value other than bitcoin.</p>
<p>
<strong>11.4.
Continuity of Services.</strong> Our Services may evolve over time.
This means we may make changes, replace, or discontinue (temporarily or permanently) our Services at any time for any reason with or without notice.
In this case, you may be prevented from accessing or using our Services.
If, in our sole discretion, we decide to permanently discontinue our Services, we will provide you with notice via our Website.</p>
<p>
<strong>11.5.
Bitcoin Transactions.</strong> Xapo cannot and does not guarantee the value of bitcoins.
You acknowledge and agree that the value of bitcoins is highly volatile and that buying, selling, and holding bitcoins involves a high degree of risk.
Additionally, the bitcoin consensus network is solely responsible for verifying and confirming proposed transactions that you submit via the Services, and Xapo cannot and does not confirm, cancel, or reverse wallet-to-wallet transactions, other than confirmation of the Bitcoin network’s completion of a transaction.
The Bitcoin network is operated by a decentralized network of independent third parties.
Once a transaction request has been submitted to the Bitcoin network via the Services, the Bitcoin network will automatically complete or reject the request and you will not be able to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction request.
You acknowledge and agree that Xapo is not responsible for any errors or omissions that you make in connection with any bitcoin transaction initiated via the Services.
The Services help you submit your bitcoin transaction request for confirmation to the Bitcoin network.
However, Xapo has no control over the Bitcoin network and therefore cannot and does not ensure that any transaction request you submit via the Services will be completed.
You acknowledge and agree that the transaction requests you submit via the Services may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the Bitcoin network.
When you complete a transaction request via the Services, you authorize us to submit your transaction request to the Bitcoin network in accordance with the instructions you provide via the Services.</p>
<p>To increase the security of your bitcoins storage at Xapo, Xapo has designed high-level security measures to the Services.
For that reason, Xapo bitcoin sending addresses are not designed to receive bitcoin for Xapo users.
Therefore, Xapo cannot and does not guarantee that any bitcoin transaction reversed by a third party, and/or bitcoins sent directly to any Xapo sending address, shall be received by the Xapo user intended to receive such reversed transaction or bitcoins sent.</p>
<p>
<strong>11.6.
Bitcoin Transactions.
Transmission Delays.</strong> Xapo Services include several security measures and layers to increase the security of your bitcoins storage at Xapo.
For this reason, transaction(s) to a bitcoin address outside Xapo for a significant amount of bitcoins, may take longer than a standard transaction(s) of bitcoin.
You acknowledge and agree that a transaction(s) to a bitcoin address outside of Xapo system for a significant amount of bitcoins may be delayed.</p>
<p>Before processing any transaction(s), Xapo reserves the right to take necessary time for the purpose of verifying your identity, verifying your activity and conducting security and other internal procedures in relation to your Xapo Account.</p>
<p>
<strong>11.7.
Wallet Address and Private Key.</strong> When you create a Xapo Account as an individual or Entity, the Services generate and store a cryptographic private and public key pair that you may use to send and receive bitcoins via the Bitcoin network.
The public key generated by the Services serves as your bitcoin wallet address, and may be shared with the Bitcoin network and with others to complete bitcoin transactions.
The private key uniquely matches the wallet address and must be used in connection with the wallet address to authorize the transfer of bitcoin from or to that wallet address.</p>
<p>

All disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator.
Arbitration proceedings will be held in New York, New York, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“JAMS Rules”).
The most recent version of the JAMS Rules is available on the JAMS website and are hereby incorporated by reference.
You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive your opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason.</p>
<p>WHETHER THE DISPUTE IS HEARD IN ARBITRATION OR IN COURT, YOU AND XAPO WILL NOT COMMENCE AGAINST THE OTHER A CLASS ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.</p>
<p>You and Xapo agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 22 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.
§1, et seq.
(the “FAA”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.
As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability.
The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.</p>
<p>The arbitrator, Xapo, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including, but not limited to, all information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the dispute(s) therein.
The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary.
The duty of confidentiality does not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.</p>
<p>You and Xapo agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee and Xapo will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs.
For any arbitration initiated by Xapo, Xapo will pay all JAMS fees and costs.
You and Xapo agree that the state or federal courts of the State of New York and the United States sitting in New York, New York have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.</p>
<p>Any claim arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services must be filed within one (1) year after such claim arose.
otherwise, the claim is permanently barred, which means that you and Xapo will not have the right to assert the claim.</p>
<p>If any portion of this Section 22 is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms.
(b) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section 22 or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Section 22.
and (c) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.
Further, if any part of this Section 22 is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section 22 will be enforceable.</p>
#23.

<p>Any dispute arising from these Terms and your use of the Services will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of New York, New York, except to the extent preempted by U.S.
