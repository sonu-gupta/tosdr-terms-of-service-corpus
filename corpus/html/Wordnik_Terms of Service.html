Questions? Please email us at feedback@wordnik.com</p>
<p> Welcome to the Wordnik ("Wordnik" or "we") website, accessible at https://www.wordnik.com (the "Site") and Wordnik services available through our websites, our APIs and the other domains, products, services and/or content provided by Wordnik which may be used on your website or on affiliated websites (the "Services").
The following terms and conditions and our Privacy Policy which is incorporated herein by this reference ("Terms of Service"), govern your access to and use of the Site and Services, and, except as otherwise provided in these Terms of Service, all text, graphics, images, music, software, audio, video, information or other materials available through the Site and Services ("Content").
Please read these Terms of Service carefully.
They constitute a binding legal agreement between you and Wordnik.</p>
<p> By using Wordnik.com, creating an account at Wordnik.com, using the Related Content by Wordnik plugin, or by using other services that we create, you agree to these terms of service.</p>
<p> Certain areas of the Site (and your access to or use of certain Services or Content) may have different terms and conditions posted or may require you to agree with and accept additional terms and conditions.
If there is a conflict between these Terms of Service and terms and conditions posted for a specific area of the Site, Services or Content, the latter terms and conditions shall take precedence with respect to your use of or access to that area of the Site, Services or Content.</p>
<p> Some of our products and services might have other terms and conditions you’ll need to agree to in order to use them (for example, our developer APIs).
If you want to use those services, those terms and conditions will take precedence over these.</p>
<p> YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SITE OR THE SERVICES OR BY DOWNLOADING OR POSTING ANY CONTENT FROM OR ON THE SITE OR THROUGH THE SERVICES, YOU ARE INDICATING THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE REGISTERED WITH THE SITE.
IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, THEN YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO ACCESS OR USE THE SITE, SERVICES OR CONTENT.</p>
<p> Really, we totally mean this.
If you use our site, register, leave a comment, or install something we make, you are telling us that you agree to our terms of service.
That’s why we’re using the all caps.</p> Modification <p> Wordnik reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify, discontinue or terminate the Site or Services or to modify these Terms of Service, at any time and without prior notice.
If we modify these Terms of Service, we will post the modification on the Site or provide you with notice of the modification.
We will also update the "Last Updated Date" at the top of the terms page of the Site.
By continuing to access or use the Site or the Services after we have posted a modification on the Site or have provided you with notice of a modification, you are indicating that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms of Service.
If the modified Terms of Service are not acceptable to you, your only recourse is to cease using the Site and the Services.</p>
<p> Every once in a while we are probably going to have to update these terms and conditions.
When we update them, we will post the new terms here, and put the date of the last change at the top, or we’ll send you an email.</p>
<p> If you keep using our sites, apps, and services after we change the terms, you are implicitly agreeing to the new terms.
If you don’t agree with the new terms, you can stop using our sites, apps, and services.</p> Eligibility and Account Registration <p> In order to access certain features of the Site and Services and to post any Content on the Site or through the Services, you must register to create an account ("Account") through the Site or as a user of a Service provided by us for use on your website or an affiliated website (a "Partner"), (such users collectively being "Members" or a "Member").</p>
<p> To use some site and service features, you’ll need to register and create an account.
You’ll need an account to post comments on Wordnik.com, or to use Related Content by Wordnik, for example.</p>
<p> During the registration process, you will be required to provide certain information and you will establish a username and a password.
You agree to provide accurate, current and complete information during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current and complete.
Wordnik reserves the right to suspend or terminate your Account if any information provided during the registration process or thereafter proves to be inaccurate, not current or incomplete.</p>
<p> In order to set up an account for you, we’ll need some information, including a username and password.
You agree to give us accurate information when setting up your account, and if you don’t, we can close your account.
(For instance, if you give us a fake email address and it bounces, we can close your account, even if your username and password are fine.)</p>
<p> You are responsible for safeguarding your password.
You agree not to disclose your password to any third party and to take sole responsibility for any activities or actions under your Account, whether or not you have authorized such activities or actions.
You will immediately notify Wordnik of any unauthorized use of your Account.</p>
<p> You agree to keep your password secret.
(It’s a good idea.) If someone else uses your account, you’re responsible for what they do, whether or not you gave them permission.
If you find that someone is using your account without your permission, you agree to tell us right away.</p> Privacy <p> See Wordnik's Privacy Policy for information and notices concerning Wordnik's collection and use of your personal information.</p>
<p> We couldn't figure out a way to make that clearer.</p> Ownership <p> The Site, Services and Content are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of the United States and foreign countries.
Except as expressly provided in these Terms of Service, Wordnik and its licensors exclusively own all right, title and interest in and to the Site, Services and Content, including all associated intellectual property rights.
You will not remove, alter or obscure any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Site, Services or Content.</p>
<p> We spent a lot of time coming up with the services we offer and with the name Wordnik (and we trademarked it!).
So please don’t steal our stuff, use our name to refer to things that we haven’t made, or change our sites, apps, and services to remove or hide our name or other ownership markers.</p> Third Party Content Providers, Advertising and Business Dealings <p> Wordnik may run advertisements and promotions from third parties on the Site or may otherwise provide information about or links to third-party content, products or services on the Service or Site.
Your business dealings with or participation in the promotions of such third parties, and any terms, conditions, warranties, or representations associated with such dealings or promotions, are solely between you and such third party.</p>
<p> Wordnik is not responsible for and does not guarantee the price, terms, performance, quality, accuracy, availability or legality of any content, products, services, promotions or information offered by any third party content provider or advertiser.
Wordnik is not responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of such dealings or promotions or as a result of such third party information or advertisements on the Service or Site.
If you have a dispute with one or more advertisers or other third parties, you release Wordnik from any claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.</p>
<p> We might run ads on our sites, in our apps, or via our services.
If you click on any ads, or start any relationships with any advertisers, we are not responsible for (and we don’t guarantee) their behavior.
For instance, if you buy a giant inflatable hedgehog from an ad on our site, and it doesn’t inflate all the way (and therefore ruins your birthday party!) we are not to blame.
If you sue Giant Inflatable Hedgehog, Inc., you agree not to name us in the suit.</p> Content License <p> Subject to your compliance with the terms and conditions of these Terms of Service, Wordnik grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license, without the right to sublicense, to access, view, download and print any Content solely for your personal and non-commercial purposes.
You will not use, copy, adapt, modify, prepare derivative works based upon, distribute, license, sell, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, stream, broadcast or otherwise exploit the Site, Services or Content, except as expressly permitted in these Terms of Service.
No licenses or rights are granted to you by implication or otherwise under any intellectual property rights owned or controlled by Wordnik or its licensors, except for the licenses and rights expressly granted in these Terms of Service.</p>
<p> As long as you behave nicely, you can use our sites, apps, and services.
You don’t have the right to resell our sites, apps, and services, or to misuse them.
Using our sites, apps, and services does not give you any rights of ownership in them.</p>
<p>Please note that the terms of service for our API are different.
You are certainly allowed to create commercial services using our API, with the sole exception being that you can't create a service that is simply a clone or proxy of the Wordnik API service.</p> User Content <p> Members may post, upload, publish, submit or transmit text, graphics, images, music, audio, video, information or other materials to be made available through the Site and Services ("User Content").
By submitting any User Content to Wordnik or displaying, publishing, or otherwise posting any Content on or through the Service or Site, you hereby shall and do grant Wordnik a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid, perpetual, irrevocable, sublicensable and transferable license to use, modify, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, perform, and otherwise fully make use of and/or commercialize the User Content in connection with the Service or Site and Wordnik’s (and its successors and assigns) business.

<p> You can add content to our sites, apps, and services, but please do so only if you have the rights to do so.</p>
<p> By adding content, you agree to let us share that content in our sites, apps, and services.</p>
<p>
</p> We do not claim any copyright in your content.<p>
</p>
<p> Agreeing to let us use your content in this way makes it possible for us to show your comments, lists, and tags on Wordnik.com, and so on.</p>
<p> You give us permission to show your content (for example your word lists on Wordnik.com, or part of your blog post via Related Content), but we don’t own your content.</p>
<p>
</p> You own your content, and none of your rights in your content (to publish, sell, transfer, etc.) are restricted by this agreement.<p>
</p>
<p> You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for all User Content that you make available through the Site or Services.
Accordingly, you represent and warrant that: (i) you either are the sole and exclusive owner of all User Content that you make available through the Site or Services or you have all rights, licenses, consents and releases that are necessary to grant to Wordnik the rights in such User Content, as contemplated under these Terms of Service.
and (ii) neither the User Content nor your posting, uploading, publication, submission or transmittal of the User Content or Wordnik’s use of the User Content (or any portion thereof) on, through or by means of the Site and the Services will infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party’s patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, moral rights or other intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation.</p>
<p> Again, please don’t upload things you don’t have the right to upload.
If you contribute something, we’re going to assume that you have the necessary rights.</p>

The Beta Service is offered to you on the terms set forth in these Terms of Use and in this section.</p>

No side agreements (or bets).</p> Assignment <p> You may not assign or transfer these Terms of Service, by operation of law or otherwise, without Wordnik’s prior written consent.
Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms of Service, without such consent, will be null and of no effect.
Wordnik may assign or transfer these Terms of Service, in its sole discretion, without restriction.
Subject to the foregoing, these Terms of Service will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</p>
<p> You can’t transfer your account to someone else—but they can get their own account! We can transfer our responsibilities under these terms of service to another entity (for instance, if we become part of another organization).</p> General <p> The failure of Wordnik to enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision.
The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Wordnik.
Except as expressly set forth in these Terms of Service, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms of Service will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms of Service or otherwise.
If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms of Service invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms of Service will remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p> The rules are the rules.
Even if you see someone else getting away with something that’s against the rules (or you think you’ve gotten away with something that’s against the rules), that doesn’t make the rules go away.</p>
<p> If a court decides that any of these rules are unenforceable, the rest of our rules remain in effect.</p> Contacting Us <p> If you have any questions about these Terms of Service, please contact Wordnik at feedback@wordnik.com</p>
