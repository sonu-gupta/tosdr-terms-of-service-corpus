If Publisher has failed to notify BRID of changes in Publisher’s account information, causing BRID to be unable to notify Publisher in writing, then this Agreement shall terminate without notice.</p>
<p>Withholding Payment.
BRID reserves the right to withhold payment from Publisher if Publisher has engaged in an activity that is deceptive or fraudulent in nature as determined by BRID at its sole discretion.
Examples of such deceptive or fraudulent acts may include, without limitation, clicks without referring URLs, extraordinarily high numbers of repeat clicks, and clicks from non-approved root URLs.
In addition, with respect to Display Creatives, in no event may more than five percent (5%) of Unique Visitors for any payout calculation come from one IP address.
Impressions that are served but are not received due to end-user blocking technology or software (e.g., pop-up blocking software) shall not count toward any payout calculation.</p>
<p>Taxes.
BRID assumes no responsibility for paying income taxes on behalf of Publisher.
By participating in the BRID ad program, Publisher assumes complete and sole responsibility for any taxes owed as a consequence of such participation and agrees to indemnify and not hold BRID liable for any such taxes.

<strong>Subscription Services.</strong>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Auto-renewal and Cancellation.</strong> If you are purchasing a BRID plan on a subscription basis, you can choose to purchase via PayPal on a monthly or yearly subscription.
and your subscription will renew automatically.
Subscriptions are billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis (as per the option is chosen when you purchased such services).
You also have the option to purchase a recurring monthly subscription via credit card, which will renew automatically as well.</li>
<li>You agree that BRID may process your credit card or PayPal account on each monthly, annual, or other renewal terms (based on the applicable billing cycle), on the calendar day corresponding to the first day you subscribed to a paid subscription.
If your paid subscription to BRID began on a day not contained in a subsequent month (e.g., your service began on January 30, and there is no February 30), BRID will process your payment roughly every 30 days for that month.</li>
<li>All credit card payments will be processed in Serbian currency – dinar (RSD).
The amount your credit card account will be charged for is obtained through the conversion of the price from USD into Serbian dinar according to the current exchange rate of the Serbian National Bank.

As a result of this conversion, there is a possibility of a slight difference from the original price stated on our website.</li>
<li>You may cancel your BRID subscription plan at any time from your account page.
BRID reserves the right to cancel your plan in case of violation of these terms, or in case of some other unexpected reasons.</li>
<li>You must cancel an ongoing subscription before the renewal date.
Cancellations after or on the renewal date will take effect for the next payment period.</li>
<li>BRID does not save any data concerning your credit cards if payment to BRID is made via a supported credit card.&nbsp;</li>
<li>If you are subscribed to an annual subscription package, all subscription cancellations will come into effect at the end of your current annual period.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Late fees.</strong> If any amounts due hereunder are not received by BRID by the due date, then, at BRID’s discretion, such charges may accrue late interest at the rate of 12% per year or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, from the date such payment was due until the date paid.
In addition, upon 10 days’ written notice, BRID may suspend your access to the Services if BRID does not receive the amounts invoiced hereunder at the expiration of such period.</p>
