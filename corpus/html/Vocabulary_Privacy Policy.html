</p> How Child Users May Register and Use Vocabulary.com <p>All Child Users who sign up must provide a parent's email address.
The parent is then notified that the child has signed up to use Vocabulary.com.
We ask that children chose a username that is not their real name.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, a child can be registered to use Vocabulary.com through his or her school, or through an Authentication Provider that is supported by the child’s school, or by teachers, tutors and other similar adults who assist in the educational process who have taken steps to obtain parental consent.
Parents always have the option to delete their Child User’s account.</p>
<p>If a school or district has provided this information, both parties agree to uphold their responsibilities under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”), the Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (“PPRA”), and the Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act (“COPPA”).
We provide the Services as an outsourced institutional function under FERPA 34 CFR Part 99.31(a)(1).
The Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that online service providers obtain clear and verifiable parental consent before collecting personal information from children under 13.
You represent and warrant that you have received consent from parents, or have the authority to provide consent on behalf of parents, for us to receive Personal Information related to children under 13.

For example, children cannot comment on articles.
In addition, we do not collect children's email addresses (unless they are provided by an Authentication Provider or by the child’s school), so all email communication from Vocabulary.com will be sent to the parent's email address.</p>
<p>Some other features of Vocabulary.com, however, may permit a Child User to enter free-form text through which the Child User could enter Personal information that would be visible to other Users.
This may occur, for example, when a child names his or her word list, or enters his or her notes or sentence examples on a word list.
If you are a parent, please advise your child about the risks of posting Personal Information on Vocabulary.com (or any other online service).</p>
<p>If you are a parent, and you agree to let your child use Vocabulary.com, you agree and acknowledge that you permit your child to use Vocabulary.com and all features made available on Vocabulary.com as fully contemplated by us.
As a parent, you understand that any personally identifiable information that your child provides in connection with registration or otherwise may be used by us as provided in this Privacy Policy.
Except where the context indicates otherwise, the remainder of this Privacy Policy (including any discussion of the personally identifiable information that we may collect, use or disclose) shall apply equally to a Child User account and an account for someone over 13.</p>
<p>If you are an educator and you add a student who is under 13 to your class, you acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, including, but not limited to, obtaining parental consent concerning collection of students' personal information used in connection with the provisioning and use of Vocabulary.com.</p> California Children’s Privacy Rights <p> If you are under the age of 18, or the parent of a User under the age of 18, residing in California, you are entitled to request removal of content or information you have posted on Vocabulary.com.
If you would like to request removal of your or your child’s content or information, please email us at support@vocabulary.com for assistance.
Please note that removal of your content or information does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal, as there may be deidentified or recoverable elements of your content or information on our servers in some form.
Additionally, we will not remove content or information that we may be required to retain under applicable federal and state laws.
