<p>
</p> International Privacy and Consent <p>By submitting your personal information to us, you are consenting to the processing of your personal information in the United States.
CaringBridge is located in the United States and all data related to the Service and individual Sites (as defined below) is collected and processed by CaringBridge in the United States.

<p>
</p> Personal Information and Privacy Settings <p>When you use our Service, you may be creating and maintaining a personal, individual page or website on behalf of yourself or another person (“Individual Site”) or visiting and posting to an Individual Site created by someone else.
By their very nature, these Individual Sites contain a great deal of personal information about the subject of the Individual Site and other individuals.
For this reason, we allow the creator of an Individual Site to control the level of privacy they apply to their Individual Site.
Our goal is to balance our users' need to find each other and communicate information and support against our users' desire for a measure of privacy.</p> Privacy Settings and Site Access <p>You may increase the privacy of the Individual Site by making it accessible “By Invitation Only.” This privacy setting can be changed at any time during the lifetime of the Individual Site by going to “Site Settings.”</p> Discoverability: How People Find Your Site <p>CaringBridge also offers a public search listing feature that allows you to publish portions of your Individual Site to the public Internet.
The publicly visible information may include: (1) the first and last name and the subject of the Individual Site.
(2) the title of the Individual Site.
(3) the profile picture of the Individual Site.
(3) the date and time of the first journal post to the Individual Site.
and (4) the date and time of the most recent journal post to the Individual Site.
This public profile will be indexed and displayed through public search engines when someone searches for your name.
You have the option to activate the public profile feature when you initially create an Individual Site or at any time during the lifetime of the Individual Site by going to “Site Settings.”</p>
<p>Every member of a caring community, including the creators of Individual Sites and all users are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the website address of an Individual Site in accordance with the subject's wishes.</p>
<p>
</p> What Information is Collected by CaringBridge? <p>The lawful basis for collection of the information described in this section is your consent, as necessary to fulfil a contract with you, our legal obligations, and our legitimate business interests.</p>
<p>
<em>Information You Volunteer.</em> CaringBridge collects the personal information you and others knowingly and voluntarily provide when you use our Service on our Site or through our mobile application, for example, the personal information you provide when you create or post content on an Individual Site, complete a survey, make a donation, use our "tell a friend" feature, or contact our customer care personnel.
"Personal information" means information about an identified or identifiable individual.
Examples of personal information include your name, your email address and email username, social media sign-in information, address, credit card information and your photograph.</p>
<p>
<em>Google User Information.</em> If you choose to register for or sign into the Site using Google, CaringBridge will access, collect, and store certain personal information associated with your Google User Account, including your first name, last name, email address, and profile picture.
Upon request, CaringBridge will also access, collect, and store your contacts.</p>
<p>
<em>Credit Card Information.</em> If you provide credit card information through the Service, the information you provide is never stored on our server.
Instead, when you click on the "submit" button, it is forwarded immediately to a third-party service provider for processing.
We use industry standard Secure Sockets Layering (SSL) software to encrypt all of your credit card information as it travels over the Internet and via wireless methods to our third-party service provider.
We do not retain a copy of your credit card information.
Our third-party services providers use your credit card information only to process your transaction (and for fraud prevention purposes) and are bound by contract to keep your credit card information confidential.</p>
<p>
<em>Information Collected From Your Mobile Device.</em> When using our mobile application, we will collect your device type and the operating system you are using to create aggregate statistics in order to improve our mobile application.</p>
<p>We do not ask you for access or track any location-based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our mobile application or services.</p>
<p>
<em>Information Sent to Us by Your Web Browser.</em> We collect information that is sent to us automatically by your web browser and through our mobile application.
This information typically includes your IP address, the identity of your Internet service provider, the name and version of your operating system, the name and version of your browser, the date and time of your visit, and the pages you visit.
Please check your browser if you want to learn what information your browser sends or how to change your settings.
Generally, we do not link the information provided by your browser to information that identifies you by name.</p>
<p>
<em>More About IP Addresses.</em> An "IP address" is a unique number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you connect to the Internet.
It is used to identify your computer's "location" in cyberspace, so that the information you request can be delivered to you.
If you use a dialup connection or a connection that assigns dynamic IP addresses, your computer will be assigned a new IP address each time you connect to the Internet.
If, however, your computer is permanently connected to the Internet using a static IP address, the IP address assigned to your computer will generally be the same each time you use your computer.</p>
<p>IP addresses do not include your name, email address or other information that identifies you personally, but in some cases, they can be used to identify you.
For example, we may link your IP address to account information that identifies you personally.
We may also provide your IP address to our third-party service provider who can use it to identify your state and zip code.
This gives us valuable demographic information about the individuals who use the Service.
The third-party service provider is bound by contract to use the IP addresses we provide only for this purpose.
In addition, if, for example, we suspect fraud or a threat to the security of the Service, we may share our server logs - which contain IP addresses - with the appropriate investigative authorities, who could use that information to trace and identify individuals.</p>
<p>
</p> How CaringBridge Uses Cookies and Similar Technologies <p>We use "cookies" and other web technologies to collect information and support certain features of the Service on our Site.

<li>Estimate the number of visitors using the Service;</li>
<li>Recognize when you return to use the Service;</li>
<li>Support the features and functionality of the Service - for example, to save you the trouble of reentering information already in our database or to prompt the settings you established on previous visits.

<p>Our third-party tracking-utility and ad network partner uses a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a.
Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content by informing us what content is effective on our Site or on Individual Sites.
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.
In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on certain pages on the Site and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>The information we collect using these web technologies does not identify you personally.
If, however, you have created a user identity, for example by registering, we may link the information we collect using these web technologies to other information that identifies you personally.</p>
<p>If you do not wish to receive cookies, you may set your browser to reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer.
You may also deactivate our cookies as soon as you leave the Service.
Although you are not required to accept our cookies when you visit the Service, if you set your browser to reject cookies, you will not be able to use all of the features and functionality of the Service.</p>
<p>The use of cookies by our partners, tracking utility company, and service providers is not covered by our privacy statement.
In some instances, we have access or control over these cookies.
Our partners, tracking utility company, and service providers use session ID cookies to track site visitor data and facilitate our partnerships.</p>
<p>We may also use third-party vendors, such as Google Ad Words, Bing Ads and/or Yahoo Gemini, to promote our Services online.
These ad network partners may display our promotions or information regarding our Services on other websites based on your internet usage.
Any information that these third parties collect via cookies will not be linked to your personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>If you wish to opt-out of targeted promotions based on your internet usage, you may opt-out by going to http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.
