         Mass Mailing Policy Background
<p>
</p>
<p>Hover sends millions of messages around the Internet every day.
In order to achieve this, we rely on third parties to deliver the email you send and receive.
If these other service providers decide that our customers are sending too much spam and other bad forms of email, they might decide that they no longer want to deliver the email we send and receive.</p>
<br>
<p>When this happens, your email accounts with Hover becomes pretty useless.
To avoid this, we need your help so we've developed a very simple acceptable use policy that you can use to guide your decisions about the type of email that you send through Hover.
</p>
Our Email Acceptable Use Policy
<p>
</p>
<p>Please don't send email to people that you don't directly know, and don't send the same email to everyone you know.</p>
Interpreting our policy
<p>
</p>
<p>Hover was designed to help individuals interact with one another on a one-to-one basis.
Our goal is to make it easy to use otherwise complex internet services such as domain names, DNS, forwarding, email and so on.
99% of our clients are people like yourself who use the Internet to share stuff with people that they know.</p>
<br>
<p>Our email service is intended to help you share email with people that you know, but not on an unlimited basis.</p>
Examples:
<p>
</p>
<p>If you would like to send an email out to your parents and siblings, please feel free to do so.
If you would like to send one out to your entire extended family about an upcoming reunion, please think twice (unless you have an extremely small family!)</p>
<br>
<p>If you would like to send out an email to your management team about an upcoming meeting, please free free to do so.
If you would like to send an email out to your entire company of 1000 people about an upcoming picnic, please think twice!</p>
<br>
<p>Email sent out via Hover should be limited to 10-12 people that you know directly (all email addresses used on the to:, cc: and bcc: lines combined should be no more than 10-12 people you know.)</p>
<br>
<p>Using Hover for any sort of mass mailing, whether it be commercial or non-commercial, opt-in, opt-out, solicited, unsolicited, or otherwise is discouraged.</p>
<br>
<p>If we receive complaints about the email you've sent out, your account will likely be suspended.
If your account is suspended, you will need to contact us to re-enable your account.
If this happens on multiple occasions, we may levy a reconnection fee.
All in all, it is really just easier not to use your Hover email for sending out email to large numbers of people.</p> Sending Mass Mail
<p>
</p>
<p>We recognize that there are lots of valid reasons why you might need to send email to more than 10-12 people that you know directly (for instance, soliciting donations for the charity run you signed up for?) In cases like this, we encourage you to work with a company like MailChimp or Campaign Monitor, who run services just for people like you who need to send out email to large numbers of people.</p>
