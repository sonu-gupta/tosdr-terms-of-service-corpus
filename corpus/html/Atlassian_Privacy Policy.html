For example, you may authorize our Services to access, display and store files from a third-party document-sharing service within the Services interface.&nbsp;Or you may authorize our Services to connect with a third-party calendaring service&nbsp;or to sync a contact list or address book so that your meetings and connections are available to you through the Services, so you can invite others to collaborate with you on our Services or so your organization can limit access to certain users.&nbsp;Your administrator may also&nbsp;authorize our Services to connect with a third party reporting service so your organization can review how the Services are being used.&nbsp;The information we receive when you link or integrate our Services with a third-party service depends on the settings, permissions and privacy policy controlled by that third-party service.
You should always check the privacy settings and notices in these third-party services to understand what data may be disclosed to us or shared with our Services.</p>

Below are the specific purposes for which we use the information we collect about you.</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>To provide the Services and personalize your experience</strong>
</em>:&nbsp;We use information about you to provide the Services to you, including to process transactions with you, authenticate you when you log in, provide customer support, and operate,&nbsp;maintain, and improve&nbsp;the Services.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, we use the name and picture you provide&nbsp;in your&nbsp;account to identify you to other Service users.&nbsp;Our&nbsp;Services also include&nbsp;tailored features that&nbsp;personalize your experience, enhance your productivity, and improve your ability to collaborate effectively with others&nbsp;by automatically analyzing the activities of your team to provide search results, activity feeds, notifications, connections and recommendations that are most relevant for you and your team.&nbsp.
For example, we may use your stated job title and activity to return search results we think are relevant to your job function.&nbsp.
We also use information about you to connect you with other team members seeking your subject matter expertise.&nbsp;We may use your email domain to infer your affiliation with a particular organization or industry to personalize the content and experience you receive on our websites.&nbsp;Where you&nbsp;use multiple Services, we combine information about you and your activities to provide an integrated experience, such as to allow you to find information from one Service while searching from another&nbsp;or to present relevant product information as you travel across our websites.&nbsp;Based on your interactions with different Atlassian products and advertisements, we will personalize your experience and tailor our communications and offers to you.
To opt out of this personalization, please contact privacy@atlassian.com.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>For research and development</strong>
</em>:&nbsp.
We are always looking for ways to make our Services smarter, faster, secure, integrated, and useful.&nbsp.
We use information and&nbsp;collective learnings (including feedback)&nbsp;about how people use our Services to troubleshoot, to identify trends, usage, activity patterns, and areas for integration and&nbsp;to improve our Services and to develop new products, features and technologies that benefit our users and the public.&nbsp;For example, to&nbsp;improve the&nbsp;@mention feature, we automatically analyze recent interactions among users and how often they @mention one another to&nbsp;surface the most relevant connections for users.
We automatically analyze and aggregate frequently used search terms to improve the accuracy and relevance of suggested topics that auto-populate when you use the search feature.&nbsp;In some cases, we apply these learnings across our Services to improve and develop similar features, to better integrate the Services you use, or to provide you with insights based on how others use our Services.
We also test and analyze certain new features with some users before rolling the feature out to all users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>To communicate with you about the Services</strong>
</em>: We use your contact information to send transactional communications via email and within the Services, including confirming your purchases, reminding you of subscription expirations, responding to your comments, questions and requests, providing customer support, and sending you technical notices, updates, security alerts, and administrative messages.&nbsp.
We send you email notifications when you or others interact with you on the Services, for example, when you are&nbsp;@mentioned on a page or ticket,&nbsp;when a task is&nbsp;assigned to you, or when you are added to a Trello board.
Depending on your chosen method of contact, we may send you SMS notifications or call you if you are on-call for incident alerts in Opsgenie.&nbsp;We also provide tailored communications based on your activity and interactions with us.&nbsp.
For example, certain actions you take in the Services may automatically trigger a feature or third-party app suggestion within the Services that would make that task easier.&nbsp.
We also send you communications as you onboard to a particular Service to help you become more proficient in using that Service.&nbsp;These communications are part of the Services and in most cases you cannot opt out&nbsp;of them.&nbsp.
If an opt out is available, you will find that option within the communication itself or in your account settings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>To market, promote and drive engagement with the Services: </strong>
</em>We use your contact information and information about how you use the Services to send promotional communications that may be of specific interest to you, including by email and by displaying Atlassian ads on other companies' websites and applications.&nbsp.
These communications may be informed by audits of interactions (like counting ad impressions), and are&nbsp;aimed at driving engagement and maximizing what you get out of the Services, including&nbsp;information about new features, survey requests, newsletters, and events we think may be of interest to you.&nbsp.
We also communicate with you about new Services, product offers, promotions, and contests.&nbsp.
You can control whether you receive these communications as described below under "Opt-out of communications."</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>Customer support</strong>
</em>:&nbsp;We use your information to resolve technical issues you encounter, to respond to your requests for assistance, to analyze crash information, and to repair and improve the Services.&nbsp;Where you give us express permission to do so, we share information with a third party expert for the purpose of responding to support-related requests.</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>For safety and security</strong>
</em>:&nbsp;We use information about you and your Service use to verify accounts and activity, to detect, prevent, and respond to potential or actual security incidents and to monitor and protect against other malicious, deceptive, fraudulent or illegal activity, including violations&nbsp;of Service policies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>To protect our legitimate business interests and legal rights</em>:</strong>&nbsp;Where required by law or where we believe it is necessary to protect our legal rights, interests and the interests of others, we use information about you in connection with legal claims, compliance, regulatory, and audit functions, and&nbsp;disclosures in connection with the acquisition, merger or sale of a business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>With your&nbsp;consent</strong>
</em>: We use information about you where you have given us consent to do so for a specific purpose not listed above.&nbsp.
For example, we may publish testimonials or featured customer stories to promote the Services, with your permission.&nbsp;&nbsp.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>Legal bases for processing (for EEA users)</strong>
</em>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are an individual in the European Economic Area (EEA), we collect and process information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so under applicable EU laws.&nbsp.
The legal bases depend on the Services you use and how you use them.&nbsp;This means we collect and use your information only where:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need it to provide you the Services, including to operate the Services, provide customer support and personalized features and to protect the safety and security of the Services;</li>
<li>It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for research and development, to market and promote&nbsp;the Services and to protect our legal rights and interests;</li>
<li>You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose.
or</li>
<li>We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place.&nbsp.
Where we are using your information because we or a third party (e.g.
your employer) have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the Services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> How we share information we collect <p>We make collaboration tools, and we want them to work well for you.&nbsp.
This means sharing information through the Services and with certain third parties.&nbsp.
We share information we collect about you in the ways discussed below,&nbsp;including in connection with possible business transfers.
We are not in the business of selling&nbsp;information about you to advertisers or other third parties.</p>
<p>
<strong>Sharing with other Service users&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>When you use the Services, we share certain information about you with other Service users.</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>For collaboration</strong>
</em>: You can create content, which may contain information about you, and grant permission to others to see, share, edit, copy and download that content based on settings you or your administrator&nbsp;(if applicable) select.&nbsp.
Some of the collaboration features of the Services display some or all of your profile information to other Service users when you share or interact with specific content.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, when you comment&nbsp;on a Confluence page or Jira issue, we display your profile picture and name next to your comments so that other users with access to the page or issue understand who made the comment.
Similarly, when you publish a Confluence page, your name is displayed as the author of that page, and Service users with permission to view the page can view your profile information as well.&nbsp.
Your team’s story status in Jira Align or certain profile information when you are listed in an Opsgenie on-call schedule, can be seen by other users with certain role permissions or team assignments.
Please be aware that some aspects of the Services like Confluence pages,&nbsp;Bitbucket repositories, or Trello boards&nbsp;can be made publicly available, meaning any content posted in that space,&nbsp;including information about you, can be publicly viewed,&nbsp;indexed by, and returned in search results of search engines.&nbsp.
You can confirm whether certain Service properties are publicly visible from within the Services or by contacting the relevant administrator.</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>Managed accounts&nbsp;and administrators</strong>
</em>:&nbsp;If you register or access the Services using an email address with a domain that is owned by your employer or organization or associate that email address with your existing account, and such organization wishes to establish an account or site, certain information about you including your name, profile picture, contact info, content and past use of your account may become accessible to that organization’s administrator and other Service users sharing the same domain.&nbsp.
If you are an administrator for a particular site or group of users within the Services, we may share your contact information with current or past Service users, for the purpose of facilitating Service-related requests.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>Community Forums</strong>
</em>:&nbsp.
Our websites offer&nbsp;publicly accessible blogs, forums, issue trackers, and wikis (e.g.,&nbsp;Atlassian Community,&nbsp;Atlassian Developer Community,&nbsp;Trello Community, and Trello Inspiration).&nbsp;You should be aware that any information you provide on these websites - including profile information associated with the account you use to post the information - may be read, collected, and used by any member of the public who accesses these websites.&nbsp.
Your posts and certain profile information may remain even after you terminate your account.&nbsp;We urge you to consider the sensitivity of any information you input into these Services.&nbsp;To request removal of your information from publicly accessible websites operated by us, please contact us as provided below.
In some cases, we may not be able to remove your information, in which case we&nbsp;will&nbsp;let you know if we are unable to and why.</p>

<p>
<em>
<strong>Third Party Apps</strong>
</em>: You, your administrator or other Service users may choose to&nbsp;add new functionality or change the behavior of the Services by installing third party apps within the Services.&nbsp;&nbsp;Doing so may give third-party apps access to your account and information about you like&nbsp;your name and email address,&nbsp;and any content you choose to use in connection with those apps.&nbsp.
If you are an administrator, or a&nbsp;technical or billing contact listed on an account, we share your details with the third-party app provider upon installation.&nbsp;Third-party app policies and procedures are not controlled by us, and this privacy policy does not cover how third-party apps use your information.
We encourage you to review the privacy policies of third parties before connecting to or using their applications or services to learn more about their privacy and information handling practices.&nbsp;If you object to information about you being shared with these third parties, please uninstall the app.</p>

You should always check the privacy settings and notices in these third-party services to understand how those third-parties may use your information.</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>Third Party Widgets</strong>
</em>: Some&nbsp;of our services contain widgets and social media features, such&nbsp;as the Twitter "tweet" button or Facebook "like" button.
These widgets and features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on the Services, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.
Widgets and social media features are either hosted by a third-party or hosted directly on our Services.
You should always check the privacy settings and notices in these third-party services to understand how those third-parties may use your information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>With your consent</strong>
</em>: We share information about you with third parties when you give us consent to do so.&nbsp.
For example, we often display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our public websites.
With your consent, we may post your name alongside the testimonial.&nbsp;</p>

Enforcement of Our Rights</strong>
</em>: In exceptional circumstances, we may share information about you with a third party if we believe that sharing is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request,&nbsp;including to meet national security requirements, (b) enforce our agreements, policies and terms of service, (c) protect the security or integrity of our&nbsp;products and services, (d) protect Atlassian, our customers or the public from harm or illegal activities, or (e) respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose information to assist in preventing the death or serious bodily injury of any person.
For more information on how we respond to government requests, see our Guidelines for Law Enforcement and our Transparency Report.</p>
<p>
<strong>Sharing with affiliated companies</strong>
</p>
<p>We share information we collect with affiliated companies and, in some cases, with prospective affiliates.&nbsp.
Affiliated companies are companies owned or operated by us.&nbsp.
The protections of this privacy policy apply to the information we share in these circumstances.</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>Atlassian companies</strong>
</em>:&nbsp;We share information we have about you with other Atlassian corporate affiliates in order to operate and improve products and services and to offer other Atlassian affiliated services to you.&nbsp;This includes companies that own or operate the Services listed here.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>Business Transfers</strong>
</em>: We may share or transfer information we collect under this privacy policy in connection with any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.
You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on the Services if a transaction takes place, as well as any choices you may have regarding your information.</p> How we store and secure information we collect <p>
<strong>Information storage and security</strong>
</p>
<p>We use industry standard technical and organizational measures to secure the information we store.&nbsp;For more information on where and how we store your information, please see the Atlassian&nbsp;Trust, Trello Trust,&nbsp;and Jira Align Trust pages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While we implement safeguards designed to protect your information, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet,&nbsp;we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care,&nbsp;is&nbsp;absolutely&nbsp;safe&nbsp;from&nbsp;intrusion by others.</p>
<p>If you use our server or data center Services, responsibility for securing storage and access to the information you put into the Services rests with you and not Atlassian.
We strongly recommend that server or data center users configure SSL to prevent interception of information transmitted over networks and to restrict access to the databases and other storage points used.</p>
<p>
<strong>How long we keep information</strong>
</p>
<p>How long we keep information we collect about you depends on the type of information, as described in further detail below.&nbsp.
After such time, we will either delete or de-identify your information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>Account information</strong>
</em>: We&nbsp;retain your account information for as long as your account is active and a reasonable period thereafter in case you decide to re-activate the Services.&nbsp.
We also retain some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations, and to continue to develop and improve our Services.
Where we retain information for Service improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and we only use the information&nbsp;to uncover collective insights about the use of our Services, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>Information you share on the Services</strong>
</em>: If your account is deactivated or disabled, some of your information and the content you have provided will remain in order to allow your team members or other users to make full use of the Services.&nbsp.
For example, we continue to display messages you sent to the users that received them and continue to display content you provided,&nbsp;but when requested details that can identify you will be removed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>Managed&nbsp;accounts</strong>
</em>: If the Services are made available to you through an organization (e.g., your employer), we retain your information as long as required by the administrator of your account.&nbsp.
For more information, see "Managed accounts and administrators" above.</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>Marketing&nbsp;information</strong>
</em>: If you have elected to receive marketing emails from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences for a reasonable period of time from the date you last expressed interest in our Services, such as when you last opened an email from us or ceased using your Atlassian account.&nbsp.
We retain information derived from cookies and other tracking technologies for a reasonable period of time from the date such information was created.&nbsp.
&nbsp;</p> How to access and control your information <p>You have certain choices available to you when it comes to your information.
Below is a summary of those choices, how to exercise them and any limitations.</p>
<p>
<strong>Your Choices</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have the right to request a copy of your information, to object to our use of your information (including for marketing purposes), to request the deletion or restriction of your information, or to request your information in a structured, electronic format.&nbsp.
Below, we describe the tools and processes for making these requests.&nbsp.
You can exercise some of the choices by logging into the Services and using settings available within the Services or your account.&nbsp;Where the Services are administered for you by an administrator (see "Notice to End Users" below), you may need to contact your administrator to assist with your requests first.&nbsp;&nbsp;For all other requests, you may contact us as provided in the Contact Us section below&nbsp;to request assistance.</p>
<p>Your request and choices may be limited in certain cases: for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal information about another person, or if you ask to delete information which we or your administrator are permitted by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep.&nbsp.
Where you have asked us to share data with third parties, for example, by installing third-party apps, you will need to contact those third-party service providers directly to have your information deleted or otherwise restricted.&nbsp.
If you have unresolved concerns, you may have the right to complain to a data protection authority in the country where you live, where you work or where you feel your rights were infringed.</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>Access and update your information</strong>
</em>:&nbsp;Our Services and related documentation&nbsp;(see Atlassian Documentation and Trello Help) give you the ability&nbsp;to&nbsp;access and update certain information about you from within the Service.
For example, you can access your profile information from your account and search for content containing information about you using key word searches in the Service.&nbsp.
You can update your profile information within your profile settings and modify content that contains information about you using the editing tools associated with that content.</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>Deactivate your&nbsp;account</strong>
</em>:&nbsp;&nbsp;If you no longer wish to use our Services, you or your administrator may be able to deactivate your Services account.
If you can deactivate your own account, that setting is&nbsp;available to you in your account settings.
Otherwise, please contact your administrator.
If you are an administrator and are unable to deactivate an account through your administrator settings, please contact the appropriate support team (see&nbsp;Atlassian, Jira Align, or Trello support pages).&nbsp.
Please be aware that&nbsp;deactivating your account does not delete your information.
your information remains visible to&nbsp;other&nbsp;Service users based on your past participation within the Services.&nbsp.
For more information on how to delete your information, see below.&nbsp.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>Delete your information</strong>
</em>: Our Services and related documentation&nbsp;(see Atlassian Documentation and Trello Help) give you the ability to delete certain information about you from within the Service.
For example, you can remove content that contains information about you using the key word search and editing tools associated with that content, and you can remove certain profile information within your profile settings.
Please note, however, that we may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes, to complete transactions or to comply with our legal obligations.&nbsp.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>Request that we stop using your information</strong>
</em>:&nbsp;&nbsp;In some cases, you may ask us to stop accessing, storing, using and otherwise processing your information where you believe we don't have the appropriate rights to do so.&nbsp.
For example, if you believe a Services account was created for you without your permission or you are no longer an active user, you can request that we delete your account as provided in this policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Where you gave us consent to use your information for a limited purpose, you can contact us to withdraw that consent, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place at the time.
You can also opt-out of our use of your information for marketing purposes by contacting us, as provided below.&nbsp;&nbsp;When you make such requests, we may need time to investigate and facilitate your request.&nbsp.
If there is delay or dispute as to whether we have the right to continue using your information, we will restrict any further use of your information until the request is honored or the dispute is resolved, provided your administrator does not object (where applicable).&nbsp;&nbsp;If you object to information about you being shared with a third-party app, please disable the app or contact your administrator to do so.</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>Opt out of&nbsp;communications</strong>
</em>:&nbsp;You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us by using the unsubscribe link within each email, updating your email preferences&nbsp;within your&nbsp;Service account settings menu, or by contacting us as provided below to have your contact information removed from our promotional email list or registration database.&nbsp.
Even after you opt out from receiving promotional messages from us, you will continue to receive transactional messages from us regarding our&nbsp;Services.
You can opt out of some notification messages in your account settings.&nbsp;Please note, you will continue to receive generic ads.</p>
<p>You may be able to opt out of receiving personalized advertisements from other companies who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative or who subscribe to the Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.

Tracking Notice.</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>Send "Do Not Track" Signals</strong>
</em>: Some browsers have incorporated "Do Not Track" (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked.
Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, our Services do not currently respond to browser DNT signals.
You can use the range of other tools we provide to control data collection and use, including the ability to opt out of receiving marketing from us&nbsp;as described above.</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>Data&nbsp;portability</strong>
</em>: Data portability is the ability to obtain some of your information in a format you can move from one service provider to another (for instance, when you transfer your mobile phone number to another carrier).&nbsp.
Depending on the context, this applies to some of your information, but not to all of your information.&nbsp.
Should you request it, we will provide you with an electronic file of your basic account information and the information you create on the spaces under your sole&nbsp;control, like your personal Bitbucket repository.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> How we transfer information we collect internationally <p>
<strong>International transfers of information we collect</strong>
</p>
<p>We collect information globally and may transfer, process and store&nbsp;your information outside of your country of residence, to wherever we or our third-party service providers operate for the purpose of providing you the Services.&nbsp.
Whenever we transfer your information, we take steps to protect it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>International transfers within the Atlassian Companies</strong>
</em>:&nbsp;To facilitate our global operations, we transfer information globally and allow access to that information from countries in which the Atlassian owned or operated companies have operations for the purposes described in this policy.
These countries may not have equivalent privacy and data protection laws to the laws of many of the countries where our customers and users are based.
When we share information about you&nbsp;within and among&nbsp;Atlassian corporate affiliates, we make use of standard contractual data protection clauses, which have been approved by the European Commission, and we rely on the EU-U.S.
and Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework to safeguard the transfer of information we collect from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom (the "UK"), and Switzerland.
Please see our Privacy Shield notice below for more information&nbsp;or contact us as provided below.</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>International transfers to third parties</strong>
</em>: Some of the third parties described in this privacy policy, which provide services to us under contract, are based in&nbsp;other countries that may not have equivalent privacy and data protection laws to the country in which you reside.
When we share information of customers in the European Economic Area, the UK, or Switzerland, we make use of the EU-U.S.
and Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield Frameworks, European Commission-approved standard contractual data protection clauses,&nbsp;binding corporate rules for transfers to data processors, or other appropriate legal mechanisms to safeguard the transfer.&nbsp;Please see our Privacy Shield Notice below.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

</p>
<p>Atlassian, Inc.
and its U.S.
subsidiaries (Atlassian Network Service, Inc., Dogwood Labs, Inc., AgileCraft LLC, Opsgenie, Inc., and Trello, Inc.) participate in and comply with the EU-U.S.
and Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield Frameworks and the Privacy Shield Principles regarding the collection, use, and retention of information about you that is transferred from the European Union, the UK, or Switzerland (as applicable) to the U.S.&nbsp;&nbsp;We ensure that the Privacy Shield Principles apply to all information about you&nbsp;that is subject to this privacy policy and is received from the European Union, the European Economic Area, the UK, and Switzerland.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the EU-U.S.
and Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield Frameworks, we are responsible for the processing of information about you we receive from the EU, the UK,&nbsp;and Switzerland and onward transfers to a third party acting as an agent on our behalf.
We comply with the Privacy Shield Principles for such onward transfers and remain liable in accordance with the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents that we engage to process such information about you&nbsp;on our behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To learn more about the Privacy Shield Program, and to view Atlassian’s and Jira Align's certification, please see&nbsp;www.privacyshield.gov&nbsp;and search for 'Atlassian' or 'AgileCraft'.</p>
<p>We encourage you to contact us as provided below should you have a Privacy Shield-related (or general privacy-related) complaint.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third-party dispute resolution provider&nbsp;(free of charge).&nbsp.
Through this third-party dispute resolution provider, we have also committed to cooperating and complying&nbsp;with the information and advice provided by an informal panel of data protection authorities in the European Economic Area, the UK, and/or&nbsp;the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (as applicable)&nbsp;in relation to&nbsp;unresolved complaints (as further described in the Privacy Shield Principles).&nbsp;You may also contact&nbsp;your local data protection authority within the European Economic Area, the UK, or Switzerland (as applicable) for unresolved complaints.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield&nbsp;website, including when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted, you may invoke binding arbitration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S.
Federal Trade Commission (FTC).&nbsp;</p> Other important privacy information <p>
<strong>Notice to End Users</strong>
</p>
<p>Many of our products are intended for use by organizations.
Where the Services are made available to you through an organization&nbsp;(e.g.
your employer), that organization is the administrator of the Services and is responsible for the accounts and/or Service sites&nbsp;over which it has control.
If this is the case, please direct your data privacy questions to your administrator, as your use of the Services is subject to that organization's policies.
We are not responsible&nbsp;for the privacy or security practices of an administrator's organization, which may be different than this policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Administrators&nbsp;are able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>require you to reset your account password;</li>
<li>restrict, suspend or terminate your access to the Services;</li>
<li>access information in and about your account;</li>
<li>access or retain information stored as part of your account;</li>
<li>install or uninstall third-party apps or other integrations&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>In some cases, administrators can also:</p>
<ul>
<li>restrict, suspend or terminate your account access;</li>
<li>change the email address associated with your account;</li>
<li>change your information, including profile information;</li>
<li>restrict your ability to edit, restrict, modify or delete information</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if the Services are not currently administered to you by an organization, if you&nbsp;are a member of a Trello team administered by an organization, or if you use an email address provided by an organization (such as your work email address) to access the Services, then the owner of the domain associated with your email address (e.g.
your employer)&nbsp;may assert administrative control over your account and use of the Services at a later date.&nbsp.
You will be notified if this happens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do not want an administrator to be able to assert control over your account or use of the Services, you should deactivate your membership with the relevant Trello board, team or enterprise, or use your personal email address to register for or access the Services.&nbsp.
If an administrator has not already asserted control over your account or access to the Services, you can update the email address associated with your account through your account settings in your&nbsp;profile.&nbsp.
Once an administrator asserts control over your account or use of the Services, you will no longer be able to change the email address associated with your account without administrator approval.</p>
<p>Please contact your organization or refer to your administrator’s organizational policies for more information.</p>
