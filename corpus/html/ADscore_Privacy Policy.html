<li>Traffic Reporting Services, available through a web-based dashboard, in order to enable the users to report on the type of traffic they receiveid (<strong>“Adscore Reporting Services”</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p>This platform privacy policy explains who we are, what personal data we collect, why and how we process personal data, whom we share your personal data with, and, if you are the subject of any of the personal data concerned, what rights you have and how to get in touch with us if you need to.</p>
<p>
<strong>Please read the following carefully to understand our use of your personal data through our Services (as defined below).</strong>
</p>Changes To This Policy<p>Any changes we make to our privacy policy in the future will be posted on this page.
Please check back frequently to see any updates or changes to our privacy policy.
We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time.</p>Who We Are<p>Adscore is a software company that works with Web Traffic Processors to help them identify fraudulent traffic they may be purchasing as part of the advertising ecosystem.
To do this, Adscore collects and processes personal data on online users, through the Platform.
Reducing fraudulent and invalid activity increases faith in digital advertising.</p>
<p>Adscore’s disclosure of personal data is very limited, as we only temporarily process the data in order to compute statistics before discarding it.
The duration during which we hold the data is 1 second, and further details can be obtained by consulting the section “Who we share personal data with”</p>What Do You Mean By Personal Data?<p>“Personal Data” is defined as any data relating to a living individual who can be identified directly from that data or indirectly in conjunction with other information.
It can take the form of a name or address and, now, under new data protection laws in Europe, this can extend to uniquely generated IDs, IP addresses and other “unique identifiers”.</p>
<p>We cannot identify an online user by name, or find out where they live, but instead it gives us a picture of how a user interacts with an advertising campaign which we may be monitoring in order to detect fraudulent or invalid traffic.</p>Personal Data We Collect And How &amp.
