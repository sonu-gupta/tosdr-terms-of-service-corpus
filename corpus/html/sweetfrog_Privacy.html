We may deny your deletion request if retaining the personal information is necessary for us or our Service Provider(s) to: <ul>
<li>Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, fulfill the terms of a written warranty or product recall conducted in accordance with federal law, or otherwise perform our contract with you.</li>

<li>Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.</li>
<li>Comply with a legal obligation.</li>
<li>Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will delete or deidentify personal information not subject to one of these exceptions from our records and will direct our Service Providers to take similar action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<u>
<strong>Right to Opt-Out:</strong>
</u> You have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information.
At this time we do not sell, and we do not anticipate selling in the future, any consumer’s personal information.</li>

<p>The financial incentive, price, or service difference is equal to the value provided to us by the personal information.
</p> Exercising Your Rights to Know or Delete
<p>You may submit requests on your own behalf or have your legally authorized agent do so for you.
If you would like to submit a Request to Know or a Request to Delete, you or your legally authorized agent may submit a request by:</p>
<ul>

<li>Calling us Toll-Free at 866-452-4252</li>
</ul>
<p>When you submit your request, you must provide us with enough detail so that we can verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information (or that you are a legally authorized representative), and also understand, evaluate, and respond to your request.
At a minimum, we need the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<u>What you are requesting:</u> You must describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
For example, if you are submitting a request to know, you must let us know whether you are requesting to know categories or specific pieces of personal information.</li>
<li>
<u>Who you are:</u> You must let us know who you are, and whether you are a California resident submitting the request on your own behalf or whether you are an authorized agent submitting the request for a California resident.
Specific requirements for authorized agents are detailed under “How We Verify Requests” below.
We will only use personal information provided in the request to verify your identity or your authority to make the request on behalf of a California resident.
</li>
<li>
<u>Information regarding the California resident for whom the request is made:</u> You must provide us enough identifying information so that we can begin processing the request.
We may need further information to verify the request, as detailed under “How We Verify Requests” below.
</li>
</ul> How We Verify Requests
<p>We will confirm receipt of your request within ten (10) business days.
If you do not receive confirmation of your request with the 10-day timeframe, please contact us at the email address or toll-free number provided above.</p>
<p>When you submit a request, we will take steps to verify your identity and the request by matching the information you provide with the information we have in our records.
We may send an email to the email address that we have in our records asking you to verify that you made the request.
We may also require additional information from you that is necessary to verify and respond to your request and you must provide us with all information that we request.
You can provide us this information either through our toll-free telephone number or the email address provided above.

If we verify your Request to Delete, we will delete, and instruct our Service Providers to delete, any personal information we have collected about you, subject to the exceptions provided for in the CCPA.
We will inform you if we cannot verify your request.
If we cannot verify your request, the CCPA prohibits us from deleting or providing you any information regarding what personal information we may have collected.
</p>
<p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded and as permitted under the CCPA.
If we determine that the request warrants a fee that is permitted under the CCPA, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
We accept requests from authorized agents of California residents.
If you are an authorized agent, we may require additional information and documentation, such as a valid power of attorney or written and signed authorization from the consumer.
We may also require a valid email address for the consumer so that we can directly confirm the request and your authorization.
In addition to submitting a Request to Delete, you may also opt out of most third-party cookies, pixels, or tags that may be on our website by adjusting the settings in your browser (i.e., disabling cookies).
However, your settings are browser and device specific, so you may need to check your settings if visiting our website from a different browser or device.
