</ul>
<p>The disclosure described above will be limited to the personal information collected or used over the past 12 months.</p>

<p>You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information, subject to exceptions set forth by the law (such as, including but not limited to, where the information is used to identify and repair errors on iubenda Consent Database, to detect security incidents and protect against fraudulent or illegal activities, to exercise certain rights etc.).</p>
<p>If no legal exception applies, as a result of exercising your right, we will delete your personal information and notify any of our service providers and all third parties to whom we have sold or shared the personal information to do so – provided that this is technically feasible and doesn’t involve disproportionate effort.</p> The right to correct inaccurate personal information

<p>However, if you refuse to provide your personal information to us or ask us to delete or stop selling your personal information, and that personal information or sale is necessary for us to provide you with goods or services, we may not be able to complete that transaction.</p>
<p>To the extent permitted by the law, we may offer you promotions, discounts, and other deals in exchange for collecting, keeping, or selling your personal information, provided that the financial incentive offered is reasonably related to the value of your personal information.</p> How to exercise your rights
<p>To exercise the rights described above, you need to submit your verifiable request to us by contacting us via the details provided in this document.</p>
<p>For us to respond to your request, it’s necessary that we know who you are.
Therefore, you can only exercise the above rights by making a verifiable request which must:</p>
<ul>
<li>provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative;</li>
<li>describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will not respond to any request if we are unable to verify your identity and therefore confirm the personal information in our possession actually relates to you.</p>
<p>Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.
We will use any personal information collected from you in connection with the verification of your request solely for the purposes of verification and shall not further disclose the personal information, retain it longer than necessary for purposes of verification, or use it for unrelated purposes.</p>
<p>If you cannot personally submit a verifiable request, you can authorize a person registered with the California Secretary of State to act on your behalf.</p>

Should we need more time, we will explain to you the reasons why, and how much more time we need.
In this regard, please note that we may take up to 90 days to fulfill your request.</p>
<p>Our disclosure(s) will cover the preceding 12-month period.
Only with regard to personal information collected on or after January 1, 2022, you have the right to request that we disclose information beyond the 12-month period, and we will provide them to you unless doing so proves impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort.</p>
<p>Should we deny your request, we will explain you the reasons behind our denial.</p>
<p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable request unless such request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.
In such cases, we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act on the request.

<li>
<b>non-discrimination.</b> We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the VCDPA.
This means that we will not, among other things, deny goods or services, charge you a different price, or provide a different level or quality of goods or services just because you exercised your consumer privacy rights.
However, if you refuse to provide your personal data to us or ask us to delete or stop selling your personal data, and that personal data or sale is necessary for us to provide you with goods or services, we may not be able to complete that transaction.
To the extent permitted by the law, we may offer a different price, rate, level, quality, or selection of goods or services to you, including offering goods or services for no fee, if you have exercised your right to opt out, or our offer is related to your voluntary participation in a bona fide loyalty, rewards, premium features, discounts, or club card program.</li>
</ul> How to exercise your rights
<p>To exercise the rights described above, you need to submit your request to us by contacting us via the contact details provided in this document.</p>
<p>For us to respond to your request, we need to know who you are.</p>
<p>We will not respond to any request if we are unable to verify your identity using commercially reasonable efforts and therefore confirm that the personal data in our possession actually relates to you.
In such cases, we may request that you provide additional information which is reasonably necessary to authenticate you and your request.</p>
<p>Making a consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.
However, we may require you to use your existing account.
We will use any personal data collected from you in connection with your request solely for the purposes of authentication, without further disclosing the personal data, retaining it longer than necessary for purposes of authentication, or using it for unrelated purposes.</p>
<p>If you are an adult, you can make a request on behalf of a minor under your parental authority.</p> How and when we are expected to handle your request
<p>We will respond to your request without undue delay, but in all cases and at the latest within 45 days of its receipt.
Should we need more time, we will explain to you the reasons why, and how much more time we need.
In this regard, please note that we may take up to 90 days to fulfill your request.</p>
<p>Should we deny your request, we will explain to you the reasons behind our denial without undue delay, but in all cases and at the latest within 45 days of receipt of the request.
It is your right to appeal such decision by submitting a request to us via the details provided in this document.
Within 60 days of receipt of the appeal, we will inform you in writing of any action taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written explanation of the reasons for the decisions.
If the appeal is denied you may contact the Attorney General to submit a complaint.</p>
<p>We do not charge a fee to respond to your request, for up to two requests per year.
