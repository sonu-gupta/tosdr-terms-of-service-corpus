Persons under age fifteen (15) may only use our Websites with the involvement and consent of a parent or legal guardian.
</li>
</ol>Passive Information Collection<ol>
<li> As with many commercial websites, we may also collect information which tells us about visitors to our Websites.
For example, we may collect information about the date, time and duration of visits and which pages of a Website are most commonly accessed.
This information is generally not linked to the identity of visitors, except where a Website is accessed via links in an email we have sent or where we are able to uniquely identify the device or user accessing a Website.
By accessing a Website via links in an email we have sent and/or by accessing a Website generally, you consent to the collection of such information where it is personal information.
</li>
<li> As you navigate through our Websites, certain information can be passively collected (that is, gathered without you actively providing the information) using various technologies, such as Google Analytics features based on Display Advertising (Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting), Unique Device Identifiers (UDI), cookies, Internet tags or web beacons, and navigational data collection (log files, server logs, clickstream).
In certain circumstances, this information may be considered anonymous information or personal information under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).
This is dependent on the device used and the method by which an individual connects to the Internet.
Your Internet browser automatically transmits to the Website you are browsing some of this anonymous information or personal information, such as the URL of the website you just came from, the Internet Protocol (IP) address, the UDI (if applicable) and the browser version your device is currently using.
Our Websites may also collect anonymous information or personal information from your device through cookies and Internet tags or web beacons.
You may set your browser to notify you when a cookie is sent or to refuse cookies altogether, but certain features of a Website might not work without cookies and this may limit the services provided by a Website.
Cookies and other technical methods may involve the transmission of information either directly to us or to another party authorised by us to collect information on our behalf.
</li>
<li> Our Websites may use and combine such passively collected anonymous information or personal information from various third party sources, including as described in paragraph 12, to provide better service to Website visitors and users, customise a Website based on your preferences, compile and analyse statistics and trends, and otherwise administer and improve a Website for your use.
We may combine your visitor session information or other information collected through tracking technologies with personally identifiable information from time to time in order to understand and measure your online experiences and to determine what products, promotions and services are likely to be of interest to you.
By accessing a Website, you consent to information about you being collected, compiled and used in this way.
You can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads using Google Analytics Opt Out Tool.
</li>
<li> "Cookies" are pieces of information that a Website transfers to a computer's hard disk for record keeping purposes.
Most web browsers are set to accept cookies.
Student Edge may use cookies to make use of a Website and services as convenient as possible.
Cookies do not themselves personally identify users, although they do identify a user's browser.
Cookies allow Student Edge to monitor the items you may want to access as you move through a Website, and record how many people are using the different parts of a Website.
</li>
<li> "Session" cookies are temporary bits of information that are used to improve navigation, block visitors from providing information where inappropriate (a Website "remembers" previous entries of age or country of origin that were outside the specified parameters and blocks subsequent changes), and collect aggregate statistical information on a Website.
They are erased once you exit your web browser or otherwise turn off your computer.
</li>
<li> "Persistent" cookies are more permanent bits of information that are placed on the hard drive of your computer and stay there unless you delete the cookie.
Persistent cookies store information on your computer for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided (such as passwords), helping to determine what areas of a Website visitors find most valuable, and customising a Website based on your preferences on an ongoing basis.
Persistent cookies placed by a Website on your computer may hold personally identifiable information, but only if you have registered or have otherwise consented to the retention of personally identifiable information you have provided to the Website.
Otherwise, a Website's server only knows that an unidentified visitor with your cookie has returned to the Website.
</li>
<li> You can set your browser to accept all cookies, to reject all cookies, or to notify you whenever a cookie is offered so that you can decide each time whether to accept it.
To learn more about cookies and how to specify your preferences, please search for "cookie" in the "Help" portion of your browser.
</li>
<li> A Website may use IP addresses.
An IP address is a number assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider so you can access the Internet and is generally considered to be non-personally identifiable information, because in most cases an IP address is dynamic (changing each time you connect to the Internet), rather than static (unique to a particular user's computer).
The IP address can be used to diagnose problems with a server, report aggregate information, determine the fastest route for your computer to use in connecting to a Website, and administer and improve the Website.
</li>
<li> "Internet tags" (also known as single-pixel GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs, and 1-by-1 GIFs) are smaller than cookies and tell a Website server information such as the IP address and browser type related to the visitor's computer.
Tags may be placed both on online advertisements that bring people to a Website and on different pages of a Website.
Such tags indicate how many times a page is opened and which information is consulted.
</li>
<li>"Navigational data" (log files, server logs, and clickstream data) are used for system management, to improve the content of a Website and the user experience, market research purposes, and to communicate information to visitors.</li>
<li>We may also use these technologies in HTML emails that we send to our visitors for a number of purposes including: to determine whether our visitors have opened or forwarded those emails and/or clicked on links in those emails.
to customise the display of banner advertisements and other messages after a visitor has closed an email.
and to determine whether a visitor has made an enquiry or a purchase in response to a particular email.</li>
