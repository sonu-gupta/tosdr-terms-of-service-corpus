<p>
<strong>4.1.
YOUR PREFERENCES</strong>
</p>
<p>You can choose how we use your Personal Data using the Account Management tool.
As we need to verify your identity before we follow your instructions on Personal Data use, you need to have a registered Account in order to access the Account Management tool.
This means that if you are using a demo version of the Account, you will only be able to fully control our use of your data after you complete the Account.
</p>
<p>For example, through the Account Management tool you can: </p>
<ul>
<li>opt-out of receiving direct marketing, offered via email, within Games and online.

</p>
<p>
<strong>4.3.

</p>
<p>We may share Personal Data with our affiliates, subsidiaries, vendors or agents working on our behalf for the purposes described in this Policy.
For example, we may hire companies to assist with protecting and securing our systems or Products.

For this reason, we are offering you other tools to export your Personal Data, delete them, and object to our use of your Personal Data in accordance with Section 8 “Your rights”, as well as to manage your subscriptions.<br>
Also, there are some differences in the Personal Data that we collect about users of the Games for which the Account is created and users of other Games.<br>
With regard to the Games that do not use the Account, you can exercise your rights by contacting directly our Player Support or as otherwise indicated in the respective Game.<br>
Where such function is available, you may link to your Account some of the Games that do not use the Account.
Please note that control over your Personal Data in such Games is separate from control over your Personal Data relating to your Account.
For example, to delete your Personal Data in “World of Warships Blitz” you will need to contact Player Support as suggested in this Game, while deletion of the Personal Data relating to your Account shall be performed through the Account Management tool.</p>

<p>
<strong>6.2.
IN-GAME OFFERS</strong>
<br>
We will also use the Game-Related Information to send you in-game offers that we believe are most useful to you.
To make the offer we first collect Game-Related Information from various players, identify patterns in their behaviour, and create algorithms that identify pools of players following the pattern or particular players who follow the pattern.
To those players who actually follow the pattern – we send the in-game offers, which can be personalized (i.e., we want the in-game offer to reach you or a relatively small number of players specifically) or non-personalized (i.e., we want the in-game offer to reach a large number of players following a pattern).
We always make sure that such offers have no significant impact on you or our other players.
For example, we may notice that you are a player who is very good at playing with French vehicles and has registered the account more than five years ago: so, we may specifically offer you the new French vehicle for rent, but in any case not more expensively than it is offered to other users.
You can unsubscribe from personalized in-Game offers through our Account Management tool.</p>
<p>
<strong>6.3.
PRODUCTS IMPROVEMENT PURPOSES</strong>

<strong>Logistics partners:</strong> to arrange your trips (e.g., as an eSports player) and deliver the prizes you may be entitled to thanks to use of your Products, we can share your post address and other required details with our logistics partners or ask you to share that data with our logistics partners directly.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Third-party websites:</strong> you can choose to log into some websites using Wargaming OpenID.

<li>
<strong>Game Developers and Change of Publisher: </strong> Wargaming is the data controller with regard to certain Games developed by third parties and published by Wargaming.
Such developers can process certain data required for the Games’ and other Products’ further improvement, e.g., to Game-Related Information.
Should Wargaming transfer the right to publish such or other Games and other related Products to a third party, the new publisher will have the right to continue using your data in the manner substantially the same as set out in this Privacy Policy unless you are specifically informed otherwise.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Public authorities and auditors:</strong> some personal data shall be disclosed to public authorities, e.g., tax and customs authorities, auditors, and other competent parties, in accordance with the laws of each local jurisdiction where we operate.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Wargaming subsidiaries and affiliates:</strong> as a global company, we share information with our affiliates and related entities which they act as our processors.
This information may be processed in our offices worldwide.
Your information may also be processed outside of the jurisdiction in which it was collected (e.g.
in the United States, Korea, Russian Federation, the Republic of Belarus, or any other country in which we, our affiliates or subsidiaries maintain a presence).
</li>
<li>
<strong>Change of control:</strong> we may share your information as part of, or during the negotiation/preparation of, our company’s sale, merger, change in control, or any other type of acquisition or business combination of all or any portion of our assets, or transfer of all or a portion of our business to another business.
In addition, should we transfer the right to publish any Games or other related Products to another entity, the new publisher will have the right to continue using your information in the manner substantially the same as set out in this Policy unless you specifically informed otherwise.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Third-party game developers:</strong> We also publish on our platform (Wargaming Game Center) games developed solely by third party developers.
When you choose to play such games, we may share your data with the third-party game developer, such as your Wargaming ID, nickname, in-game purchases, in-game bans of our Games, language preference of Wargaming Game Center.
In such case we and the third-party game developer act as independent data controllers.
Such third-parties are responsible for your activities on their platforms and we recommend you review their privacy policies.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Security and compelled disclosure:</strong> We share information to comply with the law or other legal process (e.g., tax and customs authorities, auditors, and where required, in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet security or law enforcement requirements).
We also share information to protect the rights, property, life health, security and safety of us, the Products, or anyone else.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Competitions:</strong> Our competitions, contests, and tournaments (“<strong>Competitions</strong>“) may be jointly sponsored or offered by other parties.
When you voluntarily enter a Competition, we share information as set out in the official rules that govern the Competition as well as for administrative purposes and as required by law (e.g., on a winners list).
By entering a Competition, and may, except where prohibited by applicable law, allow the sponsor and/or other entities to use your name, voice and/or likeness in advertising or marketing materials.
</li>
</ol>
<p>When your personal data is shared with Wargaming affiliates and subsidiaries, as well as third parties outside the European Union or the European Economic Area, Wargaming guarantees an adequate level of personal data protection, including but not limited to, by entering into standard data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission with Wargaming affiliates and subsidiaries, as well as such third parties.
We will provide you with a copy of the standard data protection clauses upon your request.</p>
<p>
<strong>Sharing anonymous information.</strong> We also may share anonymous information, i.e.
information which does not directly or indirectly disclose your identity, and aggregated information (meaning information about groups and categories of users, including game statistics and behaviour, but which does not identify and that cannot reasonably be used to identify any individual user) with our advertising partners.
We may also allow our advertisers to collect anonymous information and aggregated information within the Products and they may then share that information with us.
Our advertisers may collect this information through the use of tracking technologies like cookies and web beacons.
This enables our advertisers to develop and deliver targeted advertising in the Products and on the websites of third parties, so that they can try to serve you with advertisements for products and services that are most likely to be of interest to you.
Advertisers will also use this information to monitor, improve or modify their operations.</p>

YOUR RIGHTS</strong>
</p>
<p>To allow you to exercise your data protection rights in a simple way we have improved the Account Management tools available here and – for Console Games – here.
If you are using a demo account, you will only be able to fully control our use of your data after you create the Account here or – for Console Games – here.
This means that if you are using a demo version of the Account, you will only be able to fully control our use of your data after you complete the Account here.
Please visit it to make choices about which direct communications you would like to receive, as well as to exercise your rights to data access, data erasure and objection to data processing.
In some cases, for games developed solely by third parties and published by Wargaming on Wargaming Game Center (see section 7(18) above), you can exercise your rights directly from the third-party developer.
You may contact us to assist you on how you can exercise your rights for games developed solely by third parties.</p>
<p> If you have linked your Account with linked services (e.g., Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Steam, Twitch etc) you may unlink your accounts at any time through the Account Management settings.
Please note that unlinking your accounts will not affect any information previously shared through linking.
We are not responsible for the data practices of any other parties, and we recommend that you carefully review their privacy policies and terms of use.</p>
<p>
<strong>8.1.
OPT-OUT OF DIRECT MARKETING AND RIGHT TO OBJECT</strong>
</p>
<p>You can manage your subscriptions to direct marketing through our Account Management tool.
Please note that even if you unsubscribe from all our personalized marketing emails, messages, in-game and web- offers, we will still send you some notifications (we often refer to them as “transactional”), e.g.
to confirm purchases or changes in your Account, give warranty or security information, information about changes to the EULA, Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, as well as will show to you non-personalized marketing in-game and web offers.
We will be able to stop all communications only after your Account is deleted.
Also, even after you have unsubscribed from our in-game and web offers, you may still see them within the Games and on some web-sites: that would mean that such offers are shown to everyone or to a very broad audience and are not specifically directed to you.</p>
<p>You can opt-out of personalized advertising in mobile applications, including our mobile Games, by checking the privacy settings of your Android or iOS device and selecting “limit ad tracking” (Apple iOS) or “opt-out of interest-based ads” (Android).
You can adjust your mobile push notifications in your Android or iOS device settings menu.</p>
<p>Where processing of your Personal Data is based on legitimate interests, you can use your right to object at any time.
If you object we will no longer process your Personal Data unless there are compelling and prevailing legitimate grounds for the processing or the data are necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.</p>
<p>
<strong>8.2.
RIGHT OF ACCESS</strong>
</p>
<p>You have the right to access your Personal Data that we hold about you, i.e.
the right to require free of charge (i) information whether your Personal Data is retained, (ii) access to and/or (iii) duplicates of the Personal Data retained.
You can use the right to access to your Personal Data through the “Data Export” tool available in the Account Management tools here and – for Console Games – here.
Normally, we provide the duplicate of the Personal Data retained within 30 (thirty) days upon your request.
Once the archive with the Personal Data we retain is ready, you will be able to download in it from our resources.
If the request affects the rights and freedoms of others or is manifestly unfounded or excessive, we reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee (taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action requested) or refuse to act on the request.
We also will not be able to provide you with some Personal Data that you may post or provide using our Products regardless of our request not to provide the Personal Data in this particular field, website, etc.
</p>
<p>
<strong>8.3.
RIGHT TO RECTIFICATION</strong>
</p>
<p>You control which nickname, email, phone number, country (only in exceptional circumstances), social networks accounts, trusted sites and payment methods we associate with your Account.
If they change, please modify the data in the Personal Account directly.
Please inform us if any of the Personal Data we retain about you is inaccurate.
</p>
<p>
<strong>8.4.
RIGHT TO ERASURE</strong>
</p>
<p>You have the right to obtain deletion by us of Personal Data concerning you by deleting your Account via our “Account Deletion” tool available in the Account Management tools here and – for Console Games – here.</p>
<p>As a result of deleting your Account, you will lose access to most Products, including the Account and Game-Related Information linked to the Account, subscriptions to Wargaming forums and the possibility to access other services you are using the Account for.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Grace period.</strong> We allow you to restore your Account during a grace period of 45 (forty-five) days from the moment you request deletion of your Account.
This functionality allows you not to lose various Game-Related Information and other important information and options by mistake.
During the suspension period, we will be able to finalise financial and other activities that you may have initiated before sending the Account deletion request.
</p>
<p>
<strong>No payments after Account deletion.</strong> As a result of deleting your Account, you will lose the possibility to make payments in the Premium Shop, including during the grace period.
Should any payment be made after Account deletion due to a technical error or for any other reason, we will refund the amount paid by you and will not grant you the rights to the respective Additional Features.</p>
<p>
<strong>Complicated Account deletion.</strong> In some cases, deletion of your Account, and therefore Personal Data deletion, is complicated.
Namely, if you are a clan commander in the Games, it is highly likely that you will only be able to delete your Account after you have transferred the clan and placed it under the command of another user or dissolve the clan.
In some cases, considering the complexity and number of the requests, the period for Personal Data erasure may be extended, but for no longer than two further months.</p>
<p>
<strong>Earlier Personal Data deletion.</strong> We store most Personal Data we retain about you until you request deletion of your Account through the Account Management tools.
However, certain Personal Data is deleted even while you have a valid Account.
For example, we will delete:</p>
<ul>
<li>your Contact Data, clothes sizes, colour preferences, etc., you have provided for customisation, or for us to send you an award or arrange travel to one of our events, within 45 (forty-five) days after us sending the award to your address.
</li>
<li>the data about you that we have collected in the course of alpha-tests, super tests, UX tests, surveys, analysis of publicly available sentiments in social networks such as YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, at onsite events: within no longer than 45 (forty-five) days after completion of the data analysis, data aggregation and generating of the reports for our Products improvement.
</li>
<li> technical logs such as records of communication between Products, access logs, errors logs: normally within 45 (forty-five) days after their creation.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Information we retain.</strong> Upon expiry of the suspension period we will delete all your Personal Data, except for the data which are required for our compliance with the requirements of applicable laws (e.g.
tax and accounting requirements) or for our detection, investigation and prevention of cheating in the Game and EULA violations or to resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.
We will also retain anonymous or de-identified information after your Account has been deleted.
Information you have shared with others (e.g.
through in-Games chats, updates or group posts) will remain visible after you have deleted your account or deleted the information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control the data that other members/users copied out of our Products.
Groups content associated with deleted accounts will show an unknown user as the source.
Your profile may continue to be displayed in the services of others (e.g.
search engine results) until they refresh their cache.</p>
<p>
<strong>COMPLAINTS</strong>
</p>
<p> If you have any issues with our compliance you may contact our Data Protection Officer as set out in section 2 above.
You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the data protection regulator in your jurisdiction.</p>
<p>
<strong>10.

We disclose the following categories of personal information for commercial purposes: identifiers, customer records, commercial or transactions information, internet activity, geolocation data, and inferences drawn.

NEVADA RESIDENTS</strong>
</p>
<p>Nevada law (NRS 603A.340) requires each business to establish a designated request address where Nevada consumers may submit requests directing the business not to sell certain kinds of personal information that the business has collected or will collect about the consumer.
A sale under Nevada law is the exchange of personal information for monetary consideration by the business to a third party for the third party to license or sell the personal information to other third parties.
If you are a Nevada consumer and wish to submit a request relating to our compliance with Nevada law, please contact us at privacy@wargaming.net.</p>
