<p>If your bank account is in the United States or Canada, Open Banking will be provided by Plaid or MX.
You authorize us to access data from the applicable third party provider such as personal identity information and possibly other data such as transactional data and, if the third party provider is Plaid, by doing so you accept the Plaid End User Services Agreement and Plaid Privacy Policy.
