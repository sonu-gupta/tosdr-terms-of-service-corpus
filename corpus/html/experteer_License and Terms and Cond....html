<dd>
<ol>
<li> In the case of a defect, Experteer shall be entitled to either remove the defect or to offer alternative solutions (subsequent fulfilment).
While subsequent fulfilment attempts by Experteer are ongoing or have not completely failed, user’s claims regarding reduction of the agreed payment or cancellation of the contract shall be excluded.
Once the attempts to subsequent fulfilment have finally failed, the user may reduce payments or cancel the contract insofar as the relevant defect lasts.
Cancellation of the contract is not an option if the defect is insignificant.
The user must provide sufficient support for subsequent fulfilment attempts by Experteer.
</li>
<li> The guarantee is excluded if the user cannot reproduce the error or prove it based on computer readouts.
</li>
<li> With respect to the data used, Experteer is only responsible for checking that the data used is free of viruses using conventional virus software.
Any further-reaching liability for freedom from viruses is excluded.
</li>
<li> The user is not entitled to any claims from this guarantee if the cause of the defect relates to the fact that the user has failed to comply with own obligations or has modified the Experteer software or had it modified.
</li>
<li> If the user is a company within the meaning of Section 14, BGB (German Civil Code), previously mentioned rights can only be asserted within one year of the Experteer software made available to it.
</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt> § 10 Limitations of liability </dt>
<dd>
<ol>
<li> Irrespective of the legal basis, Experteer’s liability is limited to damage caused by intention or gross negligence.
However, this limitation on liability does not apply for any injury or harm to life, body or health, to the breach of major obligations and to claims arising under the Product Liability Act.
</li>
<li> Where Experteer is liable as a result of simple negligence, the compensation claim shall be limited to such damage as must typically be expected and to a total compensation claim of £ 5000.
</li>
<li> Claims for consequential damage, especially damage to hardware, software, or damage incurred due to data loss of the user or lost profit shall be completely excluded.
</li>
<li> If and to the extent Experteer’s liability is excluded or limited, such exclusion shall also apply to the personal liability of Experteer’s employees, job holders, workers, representatives and agents.
</li>
<li> It is agreed that the current state of technology cannot rule out errors in the program, even if great care is taken, and that uninterrupted, error-free operation and the complete removal of program errors cannot be guaranteed.
</li>
<li> Experteer excludes any guarantee for the software and the functionality of the internet platform and makes no undertakings with respect to the correctness, suitability, reliability, punctuality or precision of the information contained therein.
</li>
<li> If its internet platform and/or the functionality of the Experteer software is hampered, interrupted or destroyed as a result of force majeure, strike, lockout, operational disruption or structural damage emanating from outside Experteer’s liability shall be excluded.
</li>
<li> Experteer’s liability for unauthorised, non-purposeful obtainment of knowledge of personal user data by third parties (e.g.
through unauthorised access by ‘hackers’ into the Experteer software database) or information provided by the user himself to third parties, e.g.
by giving out his password, which is then abused by third parties, shall be excluded.
</li>
<li> Experteer’s liability for any delay, deletion, accidental transfer or memory failure in the communication between users or in conjunction with areas designed personally shall be excluded.
</li>
<li> Experteer also draws attention to the fact that it explicitly shall not be liable for any content provided by internet users or users of the internet platform provided by Experteer.
</li>
<li> Experteer shall not be liable for any damages to computer systems, or offences or damages to users of Experteer caused in line with communication with other Experteer users or by accessing external links.

</ol>
</dd>
<dt> § 11 Salary benchmark and third party information </dt>
<dd>
<ol>
<li> The salary benchmark and the salary information provided merely represents an average value at the relevant level with market leaders.
For each company, the actual salary can be up to 15 % lower or higher (in individual cases, greater discrepancies can also apply).
The specific salary to be given depends on factors such as skill at salary negotiation, employee performance and professional experience.
The size and location of the company also plays a role.
We explicitly point out that a salary benchmark quoted by Experteer does not represent a statement on the actual salary for the position offered by the specific company.
They are rather target salaries by market leaders in the relevant sectors of industry.
They should provide users with a guide when assessing open positions, evaluating their own career milestones and as an aid during salary negotiations.
They are explicitly not salary levels offered by the specific company or conventionally paid.
</li>
<li> Experteer’s liability for the content of the job adverts and information provided by the company on the internet and to which there are links from Experteer shall be excluded.
</li>
</ol>

If the user does not agree to the change, Experteer reserves the right to terminate the agreement at the end of the agreed term and the user can no longer use the Experteer software and/or the Experteer Internet portal after the effective date of termination.

<li> The notice of the amendment must include information on the publication of the modified text and information on the option of objecting and the notice period, plus the significance and/or consequences of failure to object.
In particular, this notice may be send to the e-mail address given by the user.

using a different identity or attempts to conclude a licence contract with Experteer in this way, Experteer reserves all rights to take any legal action.
</li>

Experteer is entitled but not obliged to check that the content of any text or any image entered meets the guidelines set out in these terms and, if necessary, to modify it or delete it.
