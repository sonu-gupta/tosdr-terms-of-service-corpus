How We Use the Information We Collect</strong>
</p>
<p>We may use information collected through the Site to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide you with the requested services, such as creating a user account, processing and confirming your reservation, and communicating with you about services requested (e.g., pre-reservation or post booking chat support (excluding credit card number), special request, cancellations, rewards</li>
<li>Send you email marketing communications about products and services that may be relevant to you</li>

</ul>
<p>When you make a reservation on one of our business partners’ websites or apps, we may also receive certain information such as your name and reservation information, including the accommodation reserved, in order to process your reservation and identify which channel your reservation has originated from.</p>
<p>During calls with our customer support team, live listening may be done or calls may be recorded for quality and reference purposes which includes the usage of the recordings for the handling of claims, training and fraud detection purposes.
If you would prefer that your call was not recorded, you can opt out by stating this, or by hanging up.
Call recordings are kept for a limited amount of time and automatically deleted thereafter, unless Agoda has a legitimate interest to keep such recording for a longer period, including for fraud investigation and legal purposes.</p>
<p>If you have not finalized a reservation online, we may send you a reminder to continue with your reservation.
We believe that this additional service is useful to you because it allows you to carry on with a reservation without having to search for the accommodation again or fill in all the reservation details from scratch.
These reminders are one-time only communications and reservation information used for such reminders will be deleted from our systems in accordance with our data retention policy detailed below.</p>
<p>Please note that the confirmation emails and text messages sent after your booking are not marketing messages.
These messages are part of your accommodation reservation process.
Respectively, they contain information for you to check in at your booked accommodation and a separate invitation to complete the guest review form.
You will continue to receive them, even if you have opted out of our marketing messages.
Similarly, opting into receiving Price Alerts will not affect any other choices you have made regarding receiving communications from us.
If you elect to receive Price Alerts, you will be able to opt out of receiving the same by clicking on the “turn off price alerts” or a similar message found in the Price Alert sent to you.
</p>
<p>If you have selected a Mix and Save offer but look to have only finalized part of the offer (e.g.
only finalized the booking for one but not both rooms), we may send you an email confirming you selected Mix and Save and to remind you to complete all bookings for your selected Mix and Save offer.
This message is part of the Mix and Save booking process confirming your selection and in case you have overlooked completing all bookings.
In addition to this, we may also send you a pre-check in email reminding you about changing rooms during your stay at the accommodation.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, if you are completing the booking for another person who will stay at the reserved accommodation, you also have the option to insert the guest’s email address for the purpose that the guest will receive the reservation confirmation and a separate invitation to complete a guest review.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>On occasion, affiliated entities, business partners, or other third party providers may share information with us.
One example is if you access or sign in to our Site through social media, such as Facebook Connect, we may collect information from you such as your username, and other information made available to us via such services, or – another example – your credit card issuer might, via Visa or Mastercard, provide us with your new card details, when the card we have on file is replaced.
In general, your ability to provide such information is through the service provider themselves and you can change those settings in your account settings of the relevant service provider.
In general, we may work with our partners to improve and personalize your use of our website in accordance with this policy.</p>
<p>We have partnered with Facebook to provide personalized content on Agoda for members of Facebook.
If you are a Facebook and Agoda user and you have signed into Agoda via the Facebook single sign on feature, then our Site will be personalized for you to display information/stays of your Facebook friends at accommodation in the past and also future stays at accommodation bookable through the Site.
The information that may be displayed include the name of the accommodation, the date of stay, the location of the accommodation, your review of past accommodation, the hotel room and price of the hotel room ("<b>Stay Information</b>"), and such information may be shown and personalized to you on the search pages of the accommodation on the Site, and the search calendar amongst other places.
Further, your Stay Information will also be displayed to your Facebook friends who are also Agoda customers and who have signed in through the Facebook single sign on feature on the Site, as displayed on their search pages described above within the Site and updated each time you make a booking through Agoda.</p>
<p>
<u>How to opt out</u>: Agoda has made it simple for you to opt out of this feature at any time by toggling "no" through (i) the thank you page after you make a booking, and (ii) your "Manage My Booking" page on the Site.
Further, if you need help to opt out you may contact our customer experience team at any time.</p>

Protecting Your Information</strong>
</p>
<p>We maintain reasonable physical, electronic, and organizational security measures to protect your information against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, or unauthorized disclosure or access.
We use Secure Socket Layer technology to encrypt credit card information during transit.
Through your personal account, you also have the ability to save credit card details for faster future bookings and payments.
Your card details are encrypted and you can always log in to your personal account to delete, edit, or add certain credit card details.
For security reasons, the number cannot be edited (but the card details can be deleted).
When viewing card details, only the last 4 digits of the number will be visible.
Please note that we will store the last 4 digits of your credit card securely upon any booking made (this is required to manage any refund requests for that booking).</p>
<p>
<i>Data Retention</i>
</p>
<p>We will retain your information for the period necessary to provide and secure our Sites and services, and to exercise our legal rights and comply with our legal or regulatory obligations.
When Agoda no longer needs to use your information, we will – unless we need to keep your information to comply with applicable legal or regulatory obligations or the information is required to carry out corporate tasks and conduct our business – remove it from our systems and records and/or take steps to properly anonymize it so that you can no longer be identified from it.
