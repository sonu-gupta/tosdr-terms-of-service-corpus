</li>
</ol>
Payment and Fees
<ol>

<p>You must have an active Paypal Account in order to request and receive payment.
Our users reside in various countries all over the world, and hence, Paypal has proven to be the most efficient and reliable method of payment at this time.
There may be Paypal transfer fees associated in certain countries determined by Paypal, not by us.</p>

If the amount of the payment is less than the Minimum Balance, then the payment will be held until Minimum Balance is reached.
When Minimum Balance is reached, you must click the Request Transfer button on the Revenue tab of your dashboard in order to begin the payment process.
It will take 3-5 business days to transfer the requested payment amount to your Paypal Account.
Tapas Media is not responsible for any error with your Paypal account or information.</p>
</li>
</ol>
Virtual Currency and Purchases

<p>While viewing content on one or more of Tapas Media's platforms, you may have the opportunity to visit an in-app or online store.
From there you may have the opportunity to use an online "currency" to license a variety of virtual goods such as episodes of a story.
You may also be awarded virtual "Ink," "Coins," or other currency to use for virtual "shopping." These currencies have no "real world" value, but may be exchanged by you for designated items.
Certain items have an expiration date, while others have no expiration date.
Each item that you obtain using virtual currency will be included in your account until the earlier of that item's expiration date, your account's expiration or termination date, or such date when the platform is discontinued.
REGARDLESS OF THE CONSIDERATION OFFERED OR PAID IN EXCHANGE FOR VIRTUAL CURRENCY, YOU DO NOT HAVE ANY OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN THE ITEMS OBTAINED WITH VIRTUAL CURRENCY.
Tapas Media no liability for loss of your items from your account, provided we will use reasonable efforts to replace such items under certain circumstances in our reasonable discretion.
We have no obligation or responsibility to and will not reimburse you for any item or any experience lost due to your violations of this and any other rules, policies, notices and/or agreements.
Price and availability of the items are subject to change without notice.
You agree that you cannot and have no right to sell or otherwise transfer any of the items, virtual currency or any other content or information included in any Tapas Media platform, in whole or in part, to any third person or entity whatsoever in return for anything of value (including "real" money) or otherwise.
You acknowledge that any virtual currency you receive on any of Tapas Media's platforms is not "real" currency or any type of real world financial instrument.
Furthermore it is not redeemable for any sum of money from Tapas Media at any time.</p>
</li>
<li>

Without your purchases and participation Tapas Media would not be able to provide you the services we have build and improved upon since 2012.
That said, your purchases and trust are very important to us and we want your experience to be the best it can be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In most instances Tapas Media does not own the content we license to our readers.
That being the case there may be times when content you have paid to be able to view is removed from our platform by the content owners before you have had a chance to view it.
If this happens, and if you have made a purchase to view content that is removed within 7 days of your purchase, please contact hello@tapas.io with the subject CONTENT REMOVED BEFORE VIEWED and we will work with you to exchange your unlocked, unread episodes for Tapas Ink.</p>
</li>
</ol>
Support Program (formerly "Tipping Program")
<ol>
<li>
<p>Tapas enables user's fans to support the user by tipping virtual Ink, which converts to real world currency.
