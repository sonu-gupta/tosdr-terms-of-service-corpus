</ul>How do we use your personal data?<ul>

</ul>
<p>We are entitled to use and process your personal data for these purposes by virtue of the performance of a contractual relationship, a legal obligation or the legitimate interest of Hackster or third party such as but not limited to a real economic interest, direct marketing.
If explicitly provided by you, consent can also be a legal basis for Hackster to process or use your personal data.
This consent can be withdrawn at any time with effect for the future.</p>
<p>If the legal ground for processing your personal data is no longer available, Hackster may only further process your personal data where there is another legal ground for the processing.</p>Does Hackster share your personal data with a third party or country?<p>We do not rent or sell your Personal Information to anyone.
We may share and disclose information (including Personal Information) about our customers in the following limited circumstances:</p>
<p>Hackster may transfer your personal data with other Avnet companies, but only if and to the extent, such transfer is strictly required for the purposes mentioned above.
The other Avnet companies act only upon our instructions and are contractually bound to act in compliance with applicable data protection law and to provide appropriate technical and organisational security measures.
</p>
<p>If legally permitted to do so, Hackster may transfer personal data to courts, law enforcement authorities, regulators or attorneys if necessary to comply with the law or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</p>
<p>In connection with the operation of our websites and the services provided through our websites, Hackster works with service providers (so-called data processors), such as hosting or IT maintenance, which only act upon instructions of Hackster and are contractually bound to act in compliance with applicable data protection law and to provide appropriate technical and organizational security measures.</p>
<p>Recipients of EU citizen personal data may possibly be located in countries outside of the European Union /European Economic Area (“third countries”), in which applicable laws do not offer the same level of data protection as the laws of your home country.</p>
<p>In such cases and unless permitted otherwise by applicable law, Hackster is committed to take measures in order to ensure the recipients in the third country provides an adequate level of protection.</p>
<p>As far as such data transfers involve recipients in countries outside the European Union or outside the European Economic Area (“Third Countries”), we will ensure that the transfers will be made in compliance with the EEA data protection provisions, to ensure that an adequate level of data protection equivalent to the GDPR is maintained.</p>
<p>Such safeguards could either be an adequacy decision by which the European Union has deemed the country in which the recipient is located to have adequate data protection laws in place, or the execution of EU Standard Contractual Clauses (also known as EU Model Clauses) with the recipient, or the implementation of Binding Corporate Rules (“BCRs”) by the recipient.</p>Whitelabel Communities Powered by Hackster.io<p>Hackster provides hosted services for other companies (called "Platforms" on Hackster.io) that want their own project-sharing site.
These sites use a subset of the projects and profile data that is available on Hackster.io.
Consequently, if you're following a specific platform, or create a project and tag it with that platform, or respect, or comment on such a project, your profile information will appear on that platform's Whitelabel project-sharing site (if they have one).
It's important to note that we do not share your data with these companies in any way.
all of it remains on our servers.</p>If the data is not provided by you, what is the source from which your personal data originates?<p>Hackster may collect the above mentioned personal data from other group companies, suppliers, customers, publically available information on internet, social media or any other platform or a system/application used by Hackster.</p>How long will Hackster store your personal data?<p>Unless explicitly indicated otherwise at the time of the collection of the personal data, we erase your personal data if the retention of the personal data is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed and to the extent the processing of personal data is no longer necessary for compliance with a legal obligation under applicable law (e.g.
tax or commercial law).</p>Right of access to and rectification or erasure of personal data, restriction of processing, right to object to processing and right to data portability.<p>Applicable EU data protection law provides you with the right to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Obtain from Hackster information on your personal data Hackster holds and/or processes about you and receive a copy of your personal data being processed in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format,</li>
<li>Obtain from Hackster the rectification of inaccurate personal data,</li>
