<p>To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent CSC Services of Nevada, Inc., 2215-B Renaissance Drive, Las Vegas, Nevada 89119.
The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes.
The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
The AAA's rules will govern payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees.
You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in Clark County, Nevada or at another mutually agreed location.</p>
