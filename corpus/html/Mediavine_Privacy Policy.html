Our legal basis for processing this information is your consent and our legitimate interests, namely monitoring and improving the Sites and Services.</p> COOKIE POLICY <p>We use, and allow certain other companies to use, Cookies on our Sites and in our Services to personalize content and ads, to provide social media features, to store the saved Publisher Content as a user of Grow or Grow.me, to analyze our traffic, and to recognize your device.
We also share information about your use of our Sites and our Services with our social media, advertising and analytics partners.
This section explains what cookies are, how we use Cookies and similar technologies on our Sites and our Service and what you can do to manage how Cookies are used.</p> What are cookies? <p>A cookie is a small text file which is sent to your computer or mobile device (referred to in this policy as a “device”) by the web server so that a website can remember some information about your browsing activity on the Sites and Service.
The Cookie will collect information relating to your use of our Sites, information about your device such as the device’s IP address and browser type, demographic data and, if you arrived at our Sites and Service via a link from a third party site, the URL of the linking page.</p>
<p>In addition to Cookies, our Sites may use web beacons.
Web beacons allow us to count the number of users who have visited or accessed the Sites and to recognize users by accessing our cookies.
We may employ web beacons to facilitate Site administration and navigation, to track the actions of users of the Sites, to compile aggregate statistics about Site usage and response rates, and to provide an enhanced online experience for visitors to the Sites.
We may also include web beacons in HTML-formatted e-mail messages that we send to determine which e-mail messages were opened.
A web beacon is often invisible because it is only 1 x 1 pixel in size with no color.
A web beacon can also be known as a web bug, 1 by 1 GIF, invisible GIF and tracker GIF.</p> What are the different types of cookies and how do we use them? <p>Essential – These are Cookies which are essential for the running of our Sites and Services.
Without these Cookies, parts of our Sites and Service would not function.
These Cookies do not track where you have been on the internet and do not gather information about you that could be used for marketing purposes.</p>
<p>Examples of how we may use essential Cookies include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting unique identifiers for each unique visitor, so that website numbers can be analyzed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Functional – These Cookies are used to remember your preferences on our Sites and Services and to provide enhanced, more personal features.
The information collected by these Cookies is usually anonymized, so we cannot identify you personally.
Functional Cookies do not track your internet usage or gather information which could be used for selling advertising.</p>
<p>Examples of how we may use functional Cookies include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gathering data about visits to our Sites and Services, including numbers of visitors and visits, length of time spent on the site, pages clicked on or where visitors have come from</li>
<li>Eliminating the need for returning users to re-enter their login details.</li>
</ul>
<p>Analytical Performance – Analytical performance Cookies are used to monitor the performance of our Sites, for example, to determine the number of page views and the number of unique users our Sites and Services has.
We use this information to improve user experience or identify areas of the Sites and Services which may require maintenance.
The information is anonymous (i.e.
it cannot be used to identify you and does not contain personal information such as your name and email address) and it is only used for statistical purposes.</p>
<p>Examples of how we may use analytical Cookies include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Measuring users’ behavior</li>

</ul>
<p>Advertising – Behavioral advertising Cookies, which may be placed on your device by us or our trusted third-party service providers, remember that you have visited a website and use that information to provide you with advertising which is tailored to your interests.
This is often called online behavioral advertising and is done by grouping together shared interests based upon web browsing history.
Your web browsing history can be used to infer things about you (e.g.
your age, gender etc.), and this information may also be used to make advertising on websites more relevant to you.
Although behavioral advertising Cookies can track your activity around the internet, these Cookies cannot identify you personally.</p>
<p>Examples of how we may use advertising Cookies include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manage online advertising.
The Services may use Cookies together with web beacons to provide advertising to you on the Publisher Sites and to enable us to manage our relationship with those advertisers by, for example, tracking how many unique users have seen a particular advertisement or followed a link in an advertisement.</li>
<li>To market to specific users across our Sites, the Publisher Sites and third party sites, so that we and third parties can target advertising to users that will be more relevant to users’ interests.</li>
</ul>
<p>Third Party Cookies – You may notice on some pages of our Sites and Services that Cookies have been set that are not related to us.
When you visit a page with content embedded from, for example, YouTube or Facebook, these third party service providers may set their own Cookies on your device.
We do not control the use of these third party Cookies and cannot access them due to the way that Cookies work, as Cookies can only be accessed by the party who originally set them.
Please check the third party websites for more information about these Cookies.</p> How can you manage or opt-out of cookies? <p>Cookies, including those which have already been set, can be deleted from your hard drive.
You can also change the preferences/settings in your web browser to control Cookies.
In some cases, you can choose to accept Cookies from the primary site, but block them from third parties.
In others, you can block Cookies from specific advertisers, or clear out all Cookies.
Deleting or blocking Cookies may reduce functionality of the Sites and the Services.

<p>You authorize us to use and disclose any new or modified information that you provide in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and you agree that we are under no obligation to delete or modify information that you have previously chosen to provide us as to which you have not instructed us to take such action.
Please remember, however, that if we have already disclosed some of your Personal Data to third parties, we cannot access that Personal Data any longer and cannot force the deletion or modification of any such information by the parties to whom we have made those disclosures.</p>
<p>We may retain your Personal Data to comply with laws, prevent fraud, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our contracts, and take other actions otherwise permitted by law.<br>
</p>
<p>Please contact us at webmaster@mediavine.com to submit a request or obtain information regarding any of the above.<br>
</p>
<p>LEGAL BASES FOR PROCESSING DATA UNDER THE GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION (“GDPR”)</p>
<p>Below are the types of lawful basis that we will rely on to process your Personal Data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Legitimate Interest means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience.
We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your Personal Data for our legitimate interests.
We do not use your Personal Data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law).
You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us at webmaster@mediavine.com.</li>
<li>Performance of Contract means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.</li>

<li>Consent means where you have consented to a certain use of your Personal Data.</li>

</ul>
<p>How to File a GDPR Complaint.</p>
<p>We hope that we can resolve any query or concern you raise about our use of your information.
The General Data Protection Regulation also gives you the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in the European Union (or European Economic Area) state where you work, normally live, or where any alleged infringement of data protection laws occurred.</p>
<p>WHERE YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS HELD.</p>
<p>Personal Data may be held at our offices and those of our affiliates, parent or related companies, third party agencies, service providers, representatives and agents as described below (see “Third Party Use of Personal Information”).</p>
<p>Some of these third parties may be based outside the European Economic Area.
For more information, including on how we safeguard your personal information when this occurs, see below.</p>
<p>TRANSFERRING YOUR PERSONAL DATA OUT OF THE EEA<br>
</p>
<p>To provide the Website or deliver products or services to you, it is necessary for us to share your Personal Data outside the European Economic Area (EEA), eg:</p>
<ul>
<li>With our offices outside the EEA;</li>
<li>With your and our service providers located outside the EEA;</li>
</ul>
<p>These transfers are subject to special rules under European and UK Data protection law.
