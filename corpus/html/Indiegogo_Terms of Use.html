<li>
<u>Indiegogo Reserves the Right to Withhold Funds</u>.
Campaign Owners are not guaranteed to receive Contributions made to a
Campaign, even after the Campaign has ended and the fundraising goal
has been reached.
There may be a delay between the end of a Campaign
and Our remittance of Contributions to a Campaign Owner for a number of
reasons including, but not limited to, refunds, chargeback disputes,
fraud, Terms or other policy violations, or any other situation.
For
example, Indiegogo may withhold Contributions made to a Campaign if the
Campaign Owner violates any Terms (as determined by Indiegogo in its
sole discretion).
Additionally, Indiegogo may withhold funds pending the receipt and evaluation of information requested through paragraph (j) above or during the pendency of any investigation Indiegogo may undertake into your account.
If you do not provide information within the requested time or are not able to substantiate claims made in your Campaign, Indiegogo may terminate your Campaign and account and avail itself of any remedies available to it under this Agreement or applicable law.

collection services.

project, or cause they care about and want to help make happen.

will be used as promised, that Campaign Owners will deliver Perks, or
that the Campaign will achieve its goals.
Indiegogo undertakes no duty to investigate claims made by Campaign Owners.
Indiegogo also does not
endorse, guarantee, make representations, or provide warranties
regarding the quality, safety, morality or legality of any Campaign,
Perk or Contribution, or the truth or accuracy of any User Content posted

Campaign Owner (not Indiegogo), and there is no guarantee that the
Campaign Owner will fulfill and deliver the Perk by that date.

<li>
<u>Limited Refund</u>.
Indiegogo offers a limited refund to Contributors, subject to the
Refund Policy, only where the Campaign has not ended, the Contributor has not
received a Perk (as confirmed by Indiegogo), <em>and</em> the
Contribution has not been sent to the Campaign Owner.
Indiegogo does
not offer refunds outside Our Refund Policy, but may do so under our
sole discretion.
Where refunds are not available under the Refund
Policy, a Contributor may contact the Campaign Owner directly to
request a refund.
Indiegogo has no obligation to participate or become
involved in any dispute between Contributor and Campaign Owner
concerning a refund.

<u>Communications Between Campaign Owners and Contributors</u>.
Once you have made a Contribution to a Campaign, the Campaign Owners
may need to contact you to obtain additional information such as
shipping address, specific preferences for a Perk (for example, color
or size of a t-shirt), or may ask for feedback on the Campaign or the
Perk.
In some instances, to receive the Perk, you may need to provide
requested information within a specific time frame to receive the Perk,
not doing so may result in your forfeiting the Perk.
Campaign Owners
should not ask for information that is not required to fulfill a Perk,
including personal information such as Social Security numbers or
credit card/banking information.
Please contact us here if you receive a
request for information that appears to be excessive.
</li>

<li> Legal Disputes Subject to Arbitration, Dispute Resolution, and Class
Action Waiver <p>
<strong>
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.
IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS,
INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
You and Indiegogo agree that this arbitration undertaking is made
pursuant to or in connection with a transaction involving interstate
commerce, and shall be governed by and construed and interpreted in
accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act at 9 U.S.C.
Section 1, et
seq.
</strong>
<strong>
Terms affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act

provisions.

</p>
<p>
<strong>
This Section is intended to be interpreted broadly and governs any and
all disputes between us, including but not limited to claims arising
out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us,
whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or
any other legal theory.

interactions between users).
and claims that may arise after the
termination of these Terms.
The only disputes excluded from this
Section are the litigation of certain intellectual property and small
court claims, as provided below.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
By agreeing to these Terms, you agree to resolve any and all disputes
with Indiegogo as follows:
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Pre-Arbitration Dispute</em>
</strong>
<em>
<strong>Resolution</strong>
</em>
: For any and all disputes, claims, or controversies you may have against
Indiegogo (“Disputes”), whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must
first give us an opportunity to resolve the Dispute informally by
contacting us through this link
with the following information: (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) a
written description of your claim, and (4) a description of the specific
relief you seek.
If we do not resolve the Dispute within forty-five (45)
days after receiving your notification, then you may pursue resolution of
the Dispute in arbitration.
You may pursue your Dispute in a court only
under the circumstances described below.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
<u>Arbitration Procedures</u>
</em>
</strong>
<em>
<u>:</u>
</em>
</p>
<p>
If the Dispute has not been resolved and is not subject to the exclusions
provided above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the
sole means to resolve all Disputes, subject to the terms set forth below.
</p>
<p>
All Disputes shall be resolved before a single arbitrator in accordance
with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures for claims that
do not exceed $250,000 and the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and
Procedures for claims exceeding $250,000, in each case applying the rules
and procedures in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated,
excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.
You can find the JAMS rules and procedures
here at this link.
</p>
<p>
To start an arbitration with JAMS, you must do the following: (1) write a
Demand for Arbitration that includes a description of the claim and the
amount of damages you seek to recover (you may find a copy of a Demand for
Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com).
(2) send three copies of the Demand for
Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee, to JAMS, 2 Embarcadero
Center, Suite 1500, San Francisco, CA 94111.
and (3) send three copies of
the Demand for Arbitration to Indiegogo at 965 Mission St, 6th Floor, San
Francisco, CA 94103, ATTN: Legal Department.
</p>
<p>
You will be required to pay $250 to initiate an arbitration against us.
If
the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, Indiegogo will
pay all other fees invoiced by JAMS, including filing fees and arbitrator
and hearing expenses.
You are responsible for your own attorneys' fees
unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Location of Arbitration</em>
</strong>: If you live in the United States, you may initiate and litigate the
arbitration in your hometown area or through the JAMS office located in San
Francisco, California.
If you live outside the United States, you must
initiate and litigate the arbitration through the JAMS office located in
San Francisco, California.
Either party may ask that the arbitration
including the hearings, arguments, and all conferences be conducted
telephonically or by video conference (<em>e.g., </em>Skype).
</p>
<p>
The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall
have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating
to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these
Terms, Additional Policies, or the Privacy Policy, including but not
limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms, Additional
Policies, or Privacy Policy is void or voidable, whether a claim is subject
to arbitration, or the question of waiver by litigation conduct.
The
arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available
in a court under law or in equity.
The arbitrator's award shall be written
and shall be binding on the parties and may be entered in any court with
jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>
The parties understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision,
they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.
They
further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could
exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more
limited in arbitration than in court.
</p>
<p>
<strong>CLASS ACTION WAIVER</strong>:
<strong>
The parties agree that the arbitration shall be conducted in their
individual capacities only and not as a class action or other
representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to
file a class action or seek relief on a class basis.
THIS MEANS THAT
YOU AND INDIEGOGO AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER
ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A LEAD OR
REPRESENTATIVE CLASS PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS
OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
HOWEVER, THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT
SEPARATE INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS SHALL BE CONSOLIDATED, UPON REQUEST BY
EITHER PARTY, IF SUCH SEPARATE INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS RELATE TO OR
ARISE OUT OF THE SAME OR SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TRANSACTION(S) OR
OCCURRENCE(S).
CONSOLIDATION MEANS THAT ANY AND ALL SEPARATELY
INITIATED ARBITRATIONS THAT RELATE TO OR ARISE OUT OF THE SAME OR
SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TRANSACTION(S) OR OCCURRENCE(S) ARE ALL HEARD BY
A SINGLE ARBITRATOR IN A SINGLE ARBITRATION.
IF EITHER PARTY REQUESTS
CONSOLIDATION OF MULTIPLE ARBITRATIONS, THEN THE PARTIES TO THE
CONSOLIDATED CASE(S) WILL BE DEEMED TO HAVE WAIVED THEIR RIGHT TO
DESIGNATE AN ARBITRATOR AS WELL AS ANY CONTRACTUAL PROVISION WITH
RESPECT TO THE SITE OF THE ARBITRATION.
THE FOLLOWING FACTORS MAY BE
CONSIDERED IN REQUESTING A CONSOLIDATION OF ARBITRATIONS:
</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>The arbitrations have a common question of law or fact;</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>
The issues in the multiple arbitrations are largely identical.
</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>
There are common claims, disputes, defenses, and relationships between
or among the parties in the different arbitrations.
</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>
One or more parties is named in multiple pending arbitrations.
</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>
The arbitrations relate to the same campaign featured on Indiegogo’s
platform.
</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Consolidation will save time and resources;</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>
One party will be seriously prejudiced by having multiple arbitrations
heard separately.
</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
By agreeing to these Terms, you are waiving your right to trial by jury
or to participate in a class action.
We are also waiving these rights.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Exclusions from Arbitration</em>
</strong>:
<strong>
<em>Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims</em>:
</strong>
Notwithstanding the parties' agreement to resolve Disputes through
arbitration, either party may (1) bring enforcement actions, validity
determinations or claims arising from or relating to misuse, infringement,
or misappropriation of intellectual property theft, piracy or unauthorized
use of intellectual property in state or federal court or in the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office to protect its intellectual property rights
("intellectual property rights" means patents, copyrights, moral rights,
trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights).
and/or
(2) seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the
scope of that court's jurisdiction.

To be clear, if you opt out of the
arbitration and class action waiver provision, you will be able to pursue
any potential claims in a court of law<strong>
<em> and </em>
</strong>can
participate in a class action or other class proceeding if you so desire.
If you do not opt out properly, you agree to arbitrate.
If you opt out of
the arbitration and class action waiver provisions, we will not be subject
to them either with respect to any disputes with you, meaning Indiegogo can
also litigate in a court of law and be subject to class action litigation.

<p>
<strong>
<em>Severability</em>
</strong>
<em>: </em>
If a court or arbitrator decides that any portion of this Section regarding
Dispute Resolution, Arbitration and Class Action Waiver is invalid or
unenforceable, then the portion shall be severed from the Terms and/or
deemed modified, only to the extent necessary to make it lawful.
Such
invalidity shall not affect the enforceability of any other provisions of
the Terms that are not invalid or unenforceable.
To affect the modification
of the portion, the portion shall be deemed deleted, added to, and/or
rewritten, whichever shall most fully preserve the intentions of the
parties as originally expressed herein.
</p>
<p>
The Terms and the relationship between you and Indiegogo shall be governed
in all respects by the laws of the State of California, without regard to
its conflict of law provisions.
This “Dispute Resolution, Arbitration and
Class Action Waiver” section shall survive any termination of your account,
these Terms, or the Services.

invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining
provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.
Indiegogo's failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement
shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

waiver of such right or provision.
You agree that regardless of any statute
or law to the contrary, any claim arising out of or related to the Services
must commence within one (1) year after the cause of action accrues.
Otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred.
