We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes or modifications to these Terms of Use&nbsp;from time to time.
We will alert you about any changes by updating the “Last updated” date of these Terms of Use, and you waive any right to receive specific notice of each such change.

The Site is not tailored to comply with industry-specific regulations (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), etc.), so if your interactions would be subjected to such laws, you may not use this Site.
You may not use the Site in a way that would violate the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).
The Site is intended for users who are at least 18 years old.
Persons under the age of 18 are not permitted to use or register for the Site.&nbsp.
<strong>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS</strong> Unless otherwise indicated, the Site is our proprietary property and all source code, databases, functionality, software, website designs, audio, video, text, photographs, and graphics on the Site (collectively, the “Content”) and the trademarks, service marks, and logos contained therein (the “Marks”) are owned or controlled by us or licensed to us, and are protected by copyright and trademark laws and various other intellectual property rights and unfair competition laws of the United States, international copyright laws, and international conventions.

<strong>SUBSCRIPTION</strong> Paypal defines a subscription as a recurring payment.
Memberships paid through PayPal are automatically renewed each month unless the subscription is cancelled or the funding source (e.g.
credit card) Paypal has on file expires.
Note that Clap Charts does not hold any credit card information on file - these are entirely with the external payment processor Paypal and we do not have access to that information.
Paypal "pushes" a payment to us and we renew the subscription/membership.
In order to stop the recurring payment, you have to cancel it on the Paypal site.
<p>To cancel your Paypal recurring payment:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log in to your account, click on Settings at the top right-hand corner.</li>
<li>Select Payments then Manage pre-approved payments to see subscriptions.</li>
<li>Pick any of your subscriptions to see more details and make any changes required.
</li>
</ol> A subscription cancellation will cancel the (future) automatic monthly renewal (recurring payment), but will not affect the current membership for the already paid 1-month term, and we are unable to refund portions of the membership fee for "unused" time within the current term.
