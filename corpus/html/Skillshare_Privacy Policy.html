        Privacy Policy<p>Welcome to Skillshare, a community marketplace to learn anything from anyone.
The Skillshare website and service including (without limitation) www.skillshare.com (the “Site”) and other all websites, mobile applications and other interactive properties through which the service is delivered (collectively, the “Services”) are owned, operated and distributed by Skillshare, Inc., a Delaware corporation (referred to in this Privacy Policy as “Skillshare” or “we” and through similar words such as “us,” “our,” etc.).
By accessing any part of the Services, you are agreeing to the terms and conditions described below (this “Privacy Policy”) and the terms and conditions of our terms of service (the “Terms of Service”).
If you do not agree to any of these terms, you should not use the Services.
This Privacy Policy applies to all users, including both users who are simply viewing content available via the Services and users who have registered as members of Skillshare.</p>
<p>We may, at our sole discretion, modify this Privacy Policy at any time.
Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used.
If we make material changes in the way we collect or use information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the Services or sending you an email.

This Privacy Policy was last modified as of April 25, 2019.</p>General<p>Your privacy is very important to us.
Accordingly, we have developed this Privacy Policy in order for you to understand how we collect, use, communicate and disclose and make use of Personal Data (as defined below).
The following outlines our privacy policy.</p>EU Personal Data<p>If you are located in the European Union (“EU”), United Kingdom, Lichtenstein, Norway, or Iceland, you may have additional rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) with respect to your Personal Data, as outlined in the EU Privacy Notice below.</p>U.S.
School-based Users<p>If you are a high school student and are accessing the Services through an account provided by your school (a “U.S.
School-based User”), you may only access the Services if you are at least 13 years old.</p>Personal Data<p>When your register with us and become a Skillshare Member, when you choose to teach or attend a class, we will ask you for Personal Data.
“Personal Data” refers to information about you that can be used to contact or individually identify you.
This includes, but is not limited to, your name, email address, but does not include your credit card number or billing information.
Transactions on Skillshare involving your billing and payment information are processed by PayPal and Stripe and are subject to their privacy policies.
We do not store any of the credit card or banking information that you provide to these payment processors.</p>
<p>In order to send you email from Skillshare, we need your email address.
To provide you with additional services, we may also request your name, general location, and telephone number.
We may give some or all of this information to the teachers for classes that you sign up for so that they can coordinate their classes.
We will not give your name, email, or other Personal Data to unaffiliated third parties except with your consent or as otherwise set forth in this privacy policy.
Though we employ industry standard measures to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose Personal Data when required by law or when we have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process that we receive or to protect our interests or the safety of others.
In addition, we may provide Personal Data to employees, consultants or other business or persons for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf.
In such circumstances, we require that these parties agree to protect the confidentiality of such information and to comply with the terms of this Privacy Policy.
We may use your Personal Data to operate, improve, understand and personalize our Services.</p>Voluntary Disclosure<p>Any Personal Data or content that you voluntarily disclose in public areas becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by other users for any reason.
Your profile pages (“Profile”) and any online classrooms you participate in are typically publicly available.
You have the ability to change your account settings to limit access to your profile, and may delete content you post to public classrooms.
If you need assistance with controlling your account privacy settings or with deleting content, please contact us at help@skillshare.com.
Removal of posted content does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information (e.g., some content may be “invisible” to other users but remain on our servers in some form).
You should exercise caution before disclosing your Personal Data via these or any other public venues.</p>
<p>For example, if you choose to sign up for a Skillshare account, you may have a Profile on the site, containing your full name and some basic information including your location and bio.
You may also add additional optional information to your Profile.
You may control what type of Profile information is shown to others through your Account Settings.
Any information you choose to provide as part of your Profile should reflect how much you want other Skillshare users to know about you.
We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information and we encourage members to think carefully about what information about themselves they disclose in their profile pages.
You can review and revise your profile information at any time.</p>Children’s Privacy<p>As noted in our Terms of Service, we do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Data from anyone under the age of 16, unless you are a U.S.
School-based User (as defined above).
If you are under 16, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any Personal Data about yourself to us unless you are a U.S.
School-based User.
If we learn that we have collected Personal Data from a child under age 16 who is not a U.S.
School-based User, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.
If you believe that a child under 16 may have provided us Personal Data, please contact us at help@skillshare.com.</p>Information About Cookies<p>We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our Services, and to analyze traffic patterns on the Services.
The Services also use cookies and similar technologies such as pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs, and JavaScript (collectively, “Cookies”) to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you visit and use our Site and Services, to analyze trends, learn about our user base and operate and improve our Services.
For example, we use Cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit, and to track whether emails we send you have been viewed.
Cookies are small files – usually consisting of letters and numbers – placed on your computer, tablet, phone, or similar device when you use that device to visit our Site.
We sometimes combine information collected through Cookies that is not Personal Data with Personal Data that we have about you, for example, to tell us who you are or whether you have an account with us.
We may also supplement the information we collect from you with information received from third parties.</p>
<p>Cookies can either be “session Cookies” or “persistent Cookies”.
Session Cookies are temporary Cookies that are stored on your device while you are visiting our Site or using our Services, whereas “persistent Cookies” are stored on your device for a period of time after you leave our Site or Services.
The length of time a persistent Cookie stays on your device varies from Cookie to Cookie.
We use persistent Cookies to store your preferences so that they are available for the next visit, and to keep a more accurate account of how often you visit our Services, how often you return, how your use of the Services may vary over time.
We also use persistent Cookies to measure the effectiveness of advertising efforts.
Through these Cookies, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services.
Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” or “DNT” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites, and web applications, and services that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites.
Because we collect browsing and persistent identifier data, the Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we may collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave our properties.</p>
<p>Some Cookies are placed by a third party on your device and may provide information to us and third parties about your browsing habits (such as your visits to our Site or Services, the pages you have visited and the links and advertisements you have clicked).
These Cookies can be used to determine whether certain third party services are being used, to identify your interests, to retarget advertisements to you and to serve advertisements to you that we or others believe are relevant to you.
We do not control third party Cookies.</p>
<p>We use the following types of Cookies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Essential Cookies.
Essential Cookies are required for providing you with features or services that you have requested.
For example, certain Cookies enable you to log into secure areas of our Site or Services.
Disabling these Cookies may make certain features and services unavailable.</li>
<li>Functionality Cookies.
Functional Cookies are used to record your choices and settings regarding our Services, maintain your preferences over time and recognize you when you return to our Services.
These Cookies help us to personalize our content for you, greet you by name, and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).</li>
<li>Performance/Analytical Cookies.
Performance/Analytical Cookies allow us to understand how visitors use our Site and Services such as by collecting information about the daily number of visitors to the Services, the daily requests we receive for particular files on the Services, and what geographical areas those requests come from.
These aggregated statistics are used internally to better provide services to the public and may also be provided to others.
Performance/Analytical Cookies also help us measure the performance of our advertising campaigns in order to help us improve our campaigns and the Services’ content for those who engage with our advertising.
For example, Google, Inc.
(“Google”) uses cookies in connection with its Google Analytics services.
Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Services is subject to the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.
You have the option to opt out of Google's use of cookies by visiting the Google advertising opt-out page at https://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html or the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/.</li>
<li>Retargeting/Advertising Cookies.
Retargeting/Advertising Cookies collect data about your online activity and identify your interests so that we can provide advertising that we believe is relevant to you.
For more information about this, please see the section below titled “Third Party Advertising”.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can decide whether or not to accept Cookies.
One way you can do this is through your internet browser’s settings.
Most browsers have an option for turning off the Cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new Cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allow you to decide on acceptance of each new Cookie in a variety of ways.
You can also delete all Cookies that are already on your computer.
If you do this, however, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit a site and some Services and functionalities may not work.</p>
<p>To explore what Cookie setting are available to you, look in the “preferences” or “options” section of your browser’s menu.
To find our more information about Cookies, including information about how to manage and delete Cookies, please visit https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/online/cookies/ or http://www.allaboutcookies.org/.</p>Third Party Advertising<p>We use third party providers, including Facebook and Google AdWords, to advertise the Services across the internet.
These providers may use cookies, web beacons, and other storage technologies to collect or receive information from the Services and elsewhere on the internet and use that information to provide measurement services and display targeted ads to you.
<strong>We only work with providers who undertake not to provide advertising to persons under 18 years of age.</strong>
</p>
<p>A cookie is used to indicate to other websites that you visited a particular page, and allows us to tailor our marketing to better suit your needs and only display ads that are relevant to you.
<strong>This cookie does not in any way give access to your computer or mobile device.</strong>
</p>
<p>If you do not wish to see ads from us, you can opt out in several ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Opt out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting Google’s Ads Settings.</li>
<li>Opt out of a third-party vendor’s use of cookies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page.</li>
</ol>
<p>We may display interest-based ads to you when you are using Facebook through a tool offered by Facebook called the Custom Audience Tool.
This tool allows us to personalize our ads based on your usage of the Services.
We do not share any of your personal information with Facebook.
The tool lets us convert your email address to a unique number that Facebook uses to match to unique numbers Facebook generates from email addresses of its users.
You can find information on how to opt out of this advertising here.</p>Other Sites<p>The Services may contain links to other websites or services.
We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites or services, and you should review the privacy policy of each such website or service to make sure that you are comfortable with it before providing any Personal Data.
For example, all teacher payments for classes are processed through third party payment processors.
As discussed above, we do not receive any of the credit card information you provide to our third party payment processors, and all such information is subject to their privacy policies.</p>Teachers<p>As discussed above, we may give your Personal Data to the teachers for classes (“Teachers”) that you sign up for so that they can coordinate their classes.
As part of our Terms of Use, Skillshare Teachers agree not to abuse other users' Personal Data.
Abuse is defined as using Personal Data for any purpose other than those explicitly specified in the Teachers' Class.
However, please understand that Skillshare Teachers are not our employees or consultants and that we are not party to any transaction between you and the Teacher.
As a result, we cannot control their actions and cannot be held liable for any actions that they may take.</p>Business Transfers<p>In the event that we are acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right to transfer or assign the information we have collected from users, including without limitation Personal Data, as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.
In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your Personal Data is treated, transferred, or used.</p>Transfers to the United States<p>The Services are hosted in the United States.
If you are accessing the Services from the European Union, please see the section titled “Transfers of Personal Data” in the EU Privacy Notice below.
If you are accessing the Services from any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure that differ from United States laws, please be advised that through your continued use of the Services, which is governed by United States law, this Privacy Policy, and our Terms of Service, you are transferring your Personal Data to the United States and you consent to that transfer.</p>California Privacy Rights<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits users of the Services who are California residents to request certain information regarding its disclosure of Personal Data to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
To make such a request, please send an email with ‘California Privacy Rights’ in the heading to help@skillshare.com or write us at the address listed below.</p>EU Privacy Notice<p>If you are located in the European Union (“EU”), United Kingdom, Lichtenstein, Norway, or Iceland, you may have additional rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) with respect to your Personal Data, as outlined below.</p>
<p>For this EU Privacy Notice section, we use the terms “Personal Data” and “processing” as they are defined in the GDPR, but, in addition to the information identified in the Privacy Policy as Personal Data above, “Personal Data” generally means information that can be used to individually identify a person, and “processing” generally covers actions that can be performed in connection with data such as collection, use, storage and disclosure.
Skillshare will be the controller of your Personal Data processed in connection with the Services.</p>
<p>If there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this Privacy Policy, the policy or portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such conflict.
