<p>Your personal data will be stored by us and our service providers in accordance with applicable data protection laws to the extent necessary for the processing purposes set out in this User Privacy Notice (see Purposes and legal basis for data processing and categories of recipients for more information on the processing purposes).
Subsequently, we will delete your personal data in accordance with our data retention and deletion policy or take steps to properly render the data anonymous, unless we are legally obliged to keep your personal data longer (e.g.
for legal compliance, tax, accounting or auditing purposes).
In Europe, the retention periods are generally between 6 and 10 years (e.g.
for contracts, notifications and business letters).
As far as legally permissible or required, we restrict the processing of your data instead of deleting it (e.g.
by restricting access to it).
This applies in particular to cases where we may still need the data for the execution of the contract or for the assertion of or defense against legal claims, or where such retention is otherwise required or permitted by law.
In these cases, the duration of the restriction of processing depends on the respective statutory limitation or retention periods.
The data will be deleted after the relevant limitation or retention periods have expired.</p> Learn more about section 7 <p>The specific retention periods for personal data are documented in our regional data retention guidelines.
How long we retain personal data may vary depending on the Services we provide and our legal obligations under applicable national law.
The following factors typically affect the retention period:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Necessity for the provision of our Services</strong>
<br> This includes such things as executing the User Agreement with you, maintaining and improving the performance of our products, keeping our systems secure, and maintaining appropriate business and financial records.
Most of our retention periods are determined on the basis of this general rule.</li>
<li>
<strong>Special categories of personal data</strong>
<br> If we store special categories of personal data (i.e., personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic or biometric data which is being processed for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation), a shorter retention period is usually appropriate.</li>
<li>
<strong>Consent-based processing of personal data</strong>
<br> If we process personal data on the basis of consent (including consent to the extended storage), we store the data for as long as necessary in order to process it according to your consent.</li>
<li>
<strong>Statutory, contractual or other similar obligations</strong>
<br> Corresponding storage obligations may arise, for example, from laws or official orders.
It may also be necessary to store personal data with regard to pending or future legal disputes.
Personal data contained in contracts, notifications and business letters may be subject to statutory storage obligations depending on national law.</li>
</ul> &nbsp.

&nbsp;Other important information regarding data protection <p>This section contains important additional information about the protection of personal data in connection with the use of our Services, including whether you are required to provide personal data.</p> Learn more about section 11 What happens when you share your personal data on our sites or applications? <p>Other users have access to the information you share on eBay or disclose to other users.
For example, other users can see your bids, purchases, items for sale, saved interests, sellers and searches, storefronts, feedback, ratings, product reviews and associated comments.
Other users can also see any information you chose to share in your profile.</p>
<p>When you use our Services, your public user ID may be displayed and available to the public and associated with all of your public eBay activity.
Notices sent to other users about suspicious activity and notice violations on our sites may refer to your public user ID and specific items.
Accordingly, if you use a username that allows others to identify you, these others may be able to identify your eBay activities.</p>
<p>To help protect your personal data, we allow only limited access to other users' contact, shipping and financial information as necessary to facilitate your transactions and collect payments.
However, when users are involved in a transaction, they have access to each other's name, user ID, email address and other contact and shipping information.&nbsp;For example, we may allow users to exchange telephone numbers in order to contact each other prior to completing a transaction (e.g.
a seller may opt to share their telephone number with a buyer so that the buyer may call with questions about a listed item).
In this case, sellers are prohibited from using a buyer's telephone number for other purposes (e.g.
completing a transaction off eBay or adding the buyer to a marketing list).</p> Your responsibilities over transactional information you receive through eBay <p>When you complete a transaction with another user (or a transaction has been cancelled, failed, or subsequently invalidated), we will provide you with the other user's personal data (such as name, username, email address, contact information, shipping and billing information, or return address).
Independent from us, you are the controller of such data and responsible for any processing that you perform after we have shared this data with you, including compliance with any limitations imposed by this User Privacy Notice and our User Agreement.</p>
<p>Unless you act for purely personal purposes, we recommend that you explain your data processing activities in your own privacy notice and protect the privacy of other users.
As a seller, you must in any case comply with the applicable data protection laws and in particular protect the rights of other users as data subjects, e.g.
give them the opportunity to access the personal data collected by you and demand that it be erased.</p>
<p>You may only use the personal data that you have access to for eBay transaction-related purposes, or for other Services offered through eBay (such as shipping, fraud complaints, and member-to-member communications), and for purposes expressly consented by the user to whom the data relates.
Using personal data of other users that you have access to for any other purpose, such as adding them to a mailing list without their express consent, constitutes a violation of our User Agreement.</p> Personal data relating to third parties <p>If you provide us with personal data relating to another person, you must obtain the consent of this person or the disclosure of the data to us must be otherwise legally permissible.
You must inform the other person of how we process personal data in accordance with our User Privacy Notice.</p> Filtering of messages sent via our messaging tools <p>All messages sent via our messaging tools are first received by us and then forwarded to the recipient.
All messages are automatically filtered according to certain criteria.
If necessary, conspicuous messages are checked manually by our customer service.
In the event of a violation of our User Agreement (including any of our rules and policies), we reserve the right to block the transmission of the message and to restrict the purchase and sales functions of your eBay account or to block your eBay account.</p>
<p>This is to protect our legitimate interests such as protecting against fraudulent or suspicious activities (e.g.
spam, viruses, phishing, or other illegal activities) or enforcing our User Agreement and our other rules and policies (e.g.
illegal and other prohibited content), including but not limited to enforcing the prohibition of purchases and sales outside of eBay.</p> Are you obliged to provide your personal data to us? <p>Some of the personal data that you provide to us (e.g.
data by which we can identify you) are required to enter into the User Agreement and the Payments Terms of Use.
For example, under the Payments Terms of Use you must provide us with certain identification information including legal name, date of birth, and tax identification number or social security number so that we may fulfil our legal "Know Your Customer" (KYC) obligations.
As described elsewhere in our User Privacy Notice and in the Payments Terms of Use, we may share this data with other eBay group companies in order to facilitate transactions and with service providers, including payment processors, credit agencies and bureaus.
Although the provision of any other personal data (e.g.
address and shipping data) is voluntary, it may be necessary for the use of our Services, such as bidding, purchase and sales data to complete a transaction.</p> Children's Privacy <p>Our services are not intended for the use by children.
We do not knowingly collect personal data from users who are considered children under applicable national laws.
Under&nbsp;our User Agreement, children are not permitted to use our Services.</p> Staying Signed in <p>When you sign in to your account on our Services, we give you the option to stay signed in to your account for certain amount of time.

This enables us, in particular, to provide you, with your consent as legally required, with information about products and services, which we believe might interest you, and improve our products, services, content, and advertising by analyzing your use of the services of other eBay Inc.
corporate family members, in particular through the matching of certain data (e.g.
cookie IDs).
Furthermore, this allows us to better prevent, detect, mitigate and investigate fraud, security breaches and other prohibited or unlawful activities, including the assessment of corresponding risks.
We will also grant access to personal data about you to other eBay Inc.
corporate family members for the aforementioned purposes.
To the extent that other eBay Inc.
corporate family members have access to your personal data, they will follow practices that are at least as restrictive as the practices described in this User Privacy Notice.</p> 5.7 Additional information regarding our payment services for sellers <p>With regard to our payment services for sellers in the EU, we additionally point out that eBay S.à r.l.
is subject to professional secrecy, which requires special transparency with regard to the processing and, in particular, the transmission of your personal data.
We therefore expressly draw your attention to the fact that eBay S.à r.l.

&nbsp;International data transfers
&nbsp.
<p>Some recipients of your personal data are located outside your country or have offices in countries where data protection laws may provide a different level of protection than the laws in your country.
When transferring personal data to such recipients, we provide appropriate safeguards.</p> Learn more 6.1 Data transfers to eBay Inc.
corporate family members <p>The transmission of personal data between different eBay Inc.
corporate family members is based on our worldwide data protection principles, which are binding internal data protection regulations (Binding Corporate Rules, BCRs), or on the basis of other appropriate safeguards (e.g.
standard data protection clauses issued or approved by the European Commission (2010/87/EU, 2001/497/EC or 2004/915/EC)).
Through our Binding Corporate Rules, the eBay Inc.
corporate family members undertake to protect your personal data and to comply with data protection obligations.
Further information on our binding company-wide guidelines and our worldwide data protection principles can be found in the eBay Privacy Center - opens in new window or tab.</p> 6.2 Other data transfers (from the European Economic Area to third countries) <p>We will only transfer your personal data from the European Economic Area (EEA) to third countries, i.e.
countries outside the EEA, on the basis of appropriate safeguards.
Third countries providing an adequate level of data protection according to the European Commission currently include Andorra, Argentina, Canada (for companies covered by the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act), Switzerland, the Faroe Islands, Guernsey, the State of Israel, the Isle of Man, Japan, Jersey, New Zealand and Uruguay.
Recipients in the USA can be partially certified according to the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield - opens in new window or tab, so that appropriate safeguards for an international data transfer exist.
In other cases, eBay provides the necessary safeguards, e.g.
through the conclusion of data protection contracts adopted by the European Commission (e.g.
standard data protection clauses (2010/87/EU, 2001/497/EC or 2004/915/EC)) with the recipients, or through other measures provided for by law.
A copy of the documentation of the measures taken by us is available on request.</p> &nbsp.

&nbsp;Storage duration and erasure
&nbsp.
<p>Your personal data will be stored by us and our service providers in accordance with applicable data protection laws to the extent necessary for the processing purposes set out in this User Privacy Notice (see Purposes and legal basis for data processing and categories of recipients for more information on the processing purposes).
Subsequently, we will delete your personal data in accordance with our data retention and deletion policy or take steps to properly render the data anonymous, unless we are legally obliged to keep your personal data longer (e.g.
for tax, accounting or auditing purposes).
In Europe, the retention periods are generally between 6 and 10 years (e.g.
for contracts, notifications and business letters).
As far as legally permissible or required, we restrict the processing of your data instead of deleting it (e.g.
by restricting access to it).
This applies in particular to cases where we may still need the data for the execution of the contract or for the assertion of or defense against legal claims.
In these cases, the duration of the restriction of processing depends on the respective statutory limitation or retention periods.
The data will be deleted after the relevant limitation or retention periods have expired.</p> Learn more <p>The specific retention periods for personal data are documented in our regional data retention guidelines.
How long we retain personal data may vary depending on the Services we provide and our legal obligations under applicable national law.
The following factors typically affect the retention period:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Necessity for the provision of our Services</strong>
<br> This includes such things as executing the User Agreement with you, maintaining and improving the performance of our products, keeping our systems secure, and maintaining appropriate business and financial records.
Most of our retention periods are determined on the basis of this general rule.</li>
<li>
<strong>Special categories of personal data</strong>
<br> If we store special categories of personal data, a shorter retention period is usually appropriate.</li>
<li>
<strong>Consent-based processing of personal data</strong>
<br> If we process personal data on the basis of consent (including consent to the extended storage), we store the data for as long as necessary in order to process it according to your consent.</li>
<li>
<strong>Statutory, contractual or other similar obligations</strong>
<br> Corresponding storage obligations may arise, for example, from laws or official orders.
It may also be necessary to store personal data with regard to pending or future legal disputes.
Personal data contained in contracts, notifications and business letters may be subject to statutory storage obligations depending on national law.</li>
</ul> &nbsp.
