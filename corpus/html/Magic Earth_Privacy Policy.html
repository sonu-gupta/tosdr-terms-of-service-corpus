<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>Your privacy is important to us.
So we’ve developed a Privacy Policy that covers how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your information.
Please take a moment to familiarise yourself with our privacy practices and let us know if you have any questions using the contact information elsewhere in this website.<p>
</p>
<p>Collection and Use of Personal Information<br>
Personal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a single person.</p>
<p>You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are in contact with us or an affiliated company.
We and our affiliates may share this personal information with each other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy.
They may also combine it with other information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising.
You are not required to provide the personal information that we have requested, but, if you chose not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to any queries you may have.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of the types of personal information we may collect and how we may use it.</p>
<p>What personal information we collect<br>
• When you create an account, register your products, apply for commercial credit, purchase a product, download a software update, contact us or participate in an online survey, we may collect a variety of information, including your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, contact preferences, and credit card information.</p>
<p>• When you share your content with family and friends using our products, send gift certificates and products, or invite others to join you on our forums or blogs, we may collect the information you provide about those people such as name, mailing address, email address, and phone number.</p>
<p>• In the U.S., we may ask for your Social Security number (SSN) but only in limited circumstances such as when setting up an account.</p>
<p>How we use your personal information<br>
• The personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted on our latest product announcements, software updates, and upcoming events.
If you don’t want to be on our mailing list, you can opt out anytime by updating your preferences.</p>
<p>• We also use personal information to help us create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our products, services, content and advertising, and for loss prevention and anti-fraud purposes.</p>
<p>• From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies.
Because this information is important to your interaction with us, you may not opt out of receiving these communications.</p>
<p>• We may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve our products, services, and customer communications.</p>
<p>• If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion we may use the information you provide to administer those programs.</p>
<p>Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information<br>
We also collect data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual.
We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose.
The following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it:</p>
<p>• We may collect information such as occupation, language, zip code, area code, unique device identifier, location, and the time zone where a product is used so that we can better understand customer behavior and improve our products, services, and advertising.</p>
<p>• We may collect information regarding customer activities on our website, and store and from our other products and services.
This information is aggregated and used to help us provide more useful information to our customers and to understand which parts of our website, products, and services are of most interest.
Aggregated data is considered non-personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If we do combine non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.</p>
Cookies and Other Technologies<br>
Our website, online services, interactive applications, email messages, and advertisements may use “cookies” and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons.
These technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our website people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches.
We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal information.
However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information.
Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
<p>We and our partners may use cookies and other technologies in mobile advertising services to control the number of times you see a given ad, deliver ads that relate to your interests, and measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns.
If you do not want to receive ads with this level of relevance on your mobile device, you can opt out by accessing the following link on your Apple device: http://oo.apple.com or Android device using: https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en.
If you opt out, you will continue to receive the same number of mobile ads, but they may be less relevant because they will not be based on your interests.
You may still see ads related to the content on a web page or in an application or based on other non-personal information.</p>
<p>We and our partners also use cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our website, online services, and applications.
Our goal in these cases is to make your experience with us more convenient and personal.
For example, knowing your first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit the store.
Knowing your country and language helps us provide a customized and more useful shopping experience.
Knowing someone using your computer or device has shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email communications more relevant to your interests.</p>
<p>If you want to disable cookies and you’re using a computer web browser, go to preferences and then disable cookies.
Check with your provider to find out how to disable cookies.
Please note that certain features of our website may not be available once cookies are disabled.</p>
<p>As is true of most websites, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files.
This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.</p>
<p>We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
We may use this information in our marketing and advertising services.</p>
<p>In some of our email messages, we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on our website.
When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website.
We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications.
If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages.</p>
<p>Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us whether mail has been opened.
We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers.</p>
<p>Disclosure to Third Parties<br>
At times we may make certain personal information available to strategic partners that work with us to provide products and services, or that help us market to customers.
Personal information will only be shared by us to provide or improve our products, services and advertising.
it will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes.</p>
<p>Service Providers<br>
We share personal information with companies who provide services such as information processing, extending credit, fulfilling customer orders, delivering products to you, managing and enhancing customer data, providing customer service, assessing your interest in our products and services, and conducting customer research or satisfaction surveys.
These companies are obligated to protect your information and may be located wherever we operate.</p>
<p>Others<br>
It may be necessary − by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence − for us to disclose your personal information.
We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.</p>
<p>We may also disclose information about you if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations or users.
Additionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third party.</p>
<p>Protection of Personal Information<br>
We take the security of your personal information very seriously.
Our online services such as the store protect your personal information during transit using encryption such as Transport Layer Security (TLS).
When your personal data is stored by us, we use computer systems with limited access housed in facilities using physical security measures.</p>
<p>When you use some of our products, services, or applications or post on our forum, chat room, or social networking service, the personal information you share is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by them.
You are responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these instances.
For example, if you list your name and email address in a forum posting, that information is public.
Please take care when using these features.</p>
<p>Integrity and Retention of Personal Information<br>
We make it easy for you to keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to date.
We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>
<p>Access to Personal Information<br>
You can help ensure that your contact information and preferences are accurate, complete, and up to date by logging in to your account.
For other personal information we hold, we will provide you with access for any purpose including to request that we correct the data if it is inaccurate or delete the data if we are not required to retain it by law or for legitimate business purposes.
We may decline to process requests that are frivolous/vexatious, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law.
Access, correction, or deletion requests can be made through the regional Privacy Contact Form.</p>
<p>Location-Based Services<br>
To provide location-based services on our products, we and our partners and licensees may collect, use, and share precise location data, including the real-time geographic location of your computer or device.
This location data is collected anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you and is used by us and our partners and licensees to provide and improve location-based products and services.
For example, we may share geographic location with application providers when you opt in to their location services.</p>
<p>Some location-based services offered by us, may require your personal information for the feature to work.</p>

Our websites, products, applications, and services may contain links to third-party websites, products, and services.
Our products and services may also use or offer products or services from third parties − for example, a third-party product.
