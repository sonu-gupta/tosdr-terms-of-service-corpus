Information we maintain on behalf of our Customers
<p>The Tailscale Service allows our Customers to directly connect servers, computers, mobile devices, and cloud instances in a simple mesh network, in which every connection is encrypted.
To provide this product to our Customers, we collect, use, and disclose personal information of individuals, including employees of our Customers.
The personal information we collect, use, and disclose includes business contact information such as names, job titles, and company email addresses, as well as information about individual devices (such as device hardware and operating system) and aggregated usage statistics (such as amount of data transmitted in a period of time).</p>
<p>We collect and use information only on behalf of our Customers, and do not use such information for any other purpose except as set out in this privacy policy or as required or permitted by applicable laws.</p>
<p>We rely on our Customers to comply with laws applicable to them (including privacy laws) when using the Tailscale Service to collect, use, or disclose personal information of individuals, including, where applicable, by obtaining appropriate consent to collect, use, and disclose personal information.</p>
How we collect and use personal information
<p>
<strong>To create and administer your account:</strong> You do not have to create a Tailscale account to visit our website or download our client applications.
However, you will be required to create an account in order to use the Tailscale Service.
To create and administer your account, we will collect information such as your email address, as well as your first and last name.
We will ask you to authenticate, using your email address, with your domain’s corresponding OAuth2 or SAML provider.
We will never ask you for your password in any unsolicited communication (such as letters, phone calls or email messages).
If you become aware of any unauthorized access to or use of your account, you are required to notify us immediately.</p>
<p>We may offer Customers or their permitted users (such as employees or contractors) the opportunity to engage with or log into the Tailscale Service using third-party social networking sites or other third-party applications.
When you log into our product through these third-party sites, we may collect certain information associated with your account on the third party’s site (e.g., name, username, email address, profile picture, gender) in order to create and manage your account, or as part of the operation of the third party’s website, plug-in or application.</p>
<p>
<strong>To provide the Tailscale Service:</strong> We collect information about our Customers’ use of the Tailscale Service, including information about each device used (such as the type of device hardware, hostname, all IP addresses, internal and private network routing information, operating system version, cryptographic public key, user agent (where applicable), the version of the Tailscale software installed, aggregate usage information (such as timestamps and connection logs between devices, as well as the sum of data transferred between devices by a given user), language settings, and the date and time the app accesses our servers).
We use this information to provide, monitor, and manage the quality of our services, as well as to provide technical assistance.
In some cases, The Tailscale Service uses this information to assist in establishing connections between pairs of devices.
However, because transmissions through the Tailscale Service are encrypted, we do not collect, use, or disclose, and do not have access to, the personal information transmitted by our Customers through the network (with the exception of log files you may choose to send to Tailscale).
Therefore, while we may collect information about the amount of data transferred by a user, we are not able to access or view the content of that data.</p>
<p>
<strong>To book a demo:</strong> If you apply for a free consultation, demo, event, webinar, or other offer, we may collect your name, job title, and business contact information (including company email and phone number), and certain information about your company and devices.
We use this information to contact you and otherwise facilitate or provide you with your consultation or demo.</p>
<p>
<strong>To send marketing communications:</strong> If you sign-up to receive email marketing communications such as newsletters, we collect your email address as well as other information on an optional basis to help us tailor our communications to you.
You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the “unsubscribe” link included at the bottom of each email.
Alternatively, you can opt-out of receiving email marketing communications by contacting us at the contact information provided in the “Contact us” section below.
Please note that you may continue to receive transactional or account-related communications from us.</p>
<p>If you choose to provide us with your email, we may also submit your email to third-party social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Google or LinkedIn for the purpose of displaying targeted advertisements to you on these platforms.
You can manage your privacy settings directly through your account on these third-party platforms, including by opting out of targeted advertising.</p>
<p>
<strong>To conduct surveys and customer research:</strong> From time to time, we may offer you the opportunity to participate in one of our surveys.

We use this information for the purpose of processing and responding to your application.</p>
<p>
<strong>To provide customer support:</strong> When you contact us with a comment, question or complaint through email, or telephone, or online chat, you may be asked for information that identifies you, such as your name, email address, and a telephone number, along with additional information we need to help us promptly answer your question or respond to your comment.
We may retain this information to assist you in the future and to improve our customer service and service offerings.</p>
<p>We may monitor and record our telephone conversations with you for training and quality assurance purposes.
You will be provided with a notice at the beginning of any call that is being recorded.

These companies may collect information about your activity on our website and third-party websites (such as web pages you visit and your interaction with our advertising and other communications) and use this information to make predictions about your preferences, develop personalized content and deliver ads that are more relevant to you on third party websites.
