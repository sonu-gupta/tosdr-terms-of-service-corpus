In addition, the following information applies to your use of the Automotive navigation system and its features (the “Service”).
The Service includes experiences designed for use by a driver as well as passengers in the vehicle.</p>
<p>The purpose of this document is to give background information on data processing for different features available in the Service.
The features of the Service enable you for example to navigate from one place to another, find places and addresses on a map, interact with them and access relevant content, as well as synchronize information related to your drives to access from other screens and devices.
You can share places, routes and arrival times with your friends.
The Service also helps you to optimize your daily commute by learning your habits.</p>

<p>
<strong>What information do we collect?</strong>
</p>
<p>We collect the following categories of information:</p>
<p>
<strong>Registration and contact details</strong>
</p>
<p>Some features may require the use of an InControl Navigation Account, for example when you want to share your location with other users or sync your favourites.

<p>
<strong>Location data and place information</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Service makes use of information about your actual location (“Location Data”) and expressed interests in points of interest (“Places Data”).
Location Data reveals where you currently are or where you have been.
Location Data is based on available positioning methods, such as GPS.
Places Data is general information pertaining to particular geographical locations (e.g.
a city or a location of a restaurant) that you may have provided to us, for example your favourite places.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise stated, we use random identifiers in connection with your Location Data that do not identify you personally.</p>
<p>When you start to use the Service, the application acquires your current location using underlying positioning technologies in the vehicle.</p>
<p>The Service may send your Location Data to HERE when you use location enabled features of the Service online, such as ask information about nearby content, services or offerings or share your location.
As further defined below, Location Data may be collected when you use the navigation feature for service improvement purposes without identifying you personally.
Places Data may be sent to HERE for example when you synchronise your favourites.</p>
<p>
<strong>Traffic improvement</strong>
</p>
<p>Whenever you use the Service while having traffic features enabled, the Service sends, on regular intervals, your current location, speed, direction and timestamp to us to provide you and other users of the Service with better traffic service such as detect traffic jams, traffic patterns, changed road conditions and other such conditions as well as to identify new routes on the map.
This information is analysed to distinguish independent routes and traffic patterns and contains a changing identifier, which is persistent only for the duration of the route.
This information is sent to us when you use the Service online.

<p>
<strong>My Commute</strong>
</p>
