<p>Welcome to the Tripadvisor websites and mobile properties located at www.Tripadvisor.com and applicable country top level domains (including sub-domains associated with them), related software applications (sometimes referred to as “apps”), data, SMS, APIs, email, chat and telephone correspondence, buttons, widgets and ads (collectively, all of these items shall be referred to herein as the “Services”.
more generally, the Tripadvisor websites and mobile properties shall hereinafter be referred to herein as “websites”).
The Services are offered to you conditioned upon your acceptance of the terms, conditions, and notices set forth below (collectively, this “Agreement”).
By accessing or using the Services, you agree to be bound by this Agreement and represent that you have read and understood its terms.
Please read this Agreement carefully, as it contains information concerning your legal rights and limitations on these rights, as well as a section regarding applicable law and jurisdiction of disputes.

If you have a Tripadvisor account and wish to terminate this Agreement, you can do so at any time by closing your account and no longer accessing or using the Services (a description of how to do so is available <strong>here</strong>).</p>
<p>Any information, text, links, graphics, photos, audio, videos, data, code or other materials or arrangements of materials that you can view on, access or otherwise interact with through the Services shall be referred to as “Content”.

<ol>
<li>Assist customers in gathering travel information, posting Content, and searching for and booking travel services and reservations.
and</li>
<li>Assist travel, tourism and hospitality businesses in engaging with customers and potential customers, by way of free and/or paid-for services offered by or through the Tripadvisor Companies.</li>
</ol>
<p>We may change or otherwise modify this Agreement in the future in accordance with the terms and conditions herein, and you understand and agree that your continued access or use of the Services after such change signifies your acceptance of the updated or modified Agreement.
We will note the date that revisions were last made to this Agreement at the bottom of this Agreement, and any revisions will take effect upon posting.
We will notify registered users of our Services (such registered users to be referred to as “Account Holders”) of material changes to these terms and conditions by either sending a notice to the email address associated with the Account Holder’s profile or by placing a notice on our websites.

<p>Note that any feedback and other suggestions you provide may be used at any time and we are under no obligation to keep them confidential.</p>
<p>The Services may contain discussion forums, bulletin boards, review services, travel feeds or other forums in which you may post your Content, such as reviews of travel experiences, messages, materials or other items ("Interactive Areas").
If Tripadvisor provides such Interactive Areas on the websites, you are solely responsible for your use of such Interactive Areas and use them at your own risk.
The Tripadvisor Companies do not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to any of your Content you provide to the Services or in any Interactive Area.&nbsp.
To the extent that any entity that is one of the Tripadvisor Companies provides any form of private communication channel between Account Holders, you agree that such entity(ies) may monitor the substance of such communications in order to help safeguard our community and the Services.
You understand that the Tripadvisor Companies do not edit or control the user messages posted to or distributed through the Services, including through any chat rooms, bulletin boards or other communications forums, and will not be in any way responsible or liable for such messaging.
&nbsp;In particular, Tripadvisor does not edit or control users’ Content that appears on the websites.&nbsp.
The Tripadvisor Companies nevertheless reserve the right to remove without notice any such messaging or other Content from the Services, where they believe in good faith that such Content breaches this Agreement or otherwise believe the removal is reasonably necessary to safeguard the rights of the Tripadvisor Companies and/or other users of the Services.
Should you disagree with the removal of your Content from the websites, you may contact Tripadvisor using the <strong>Help Center</strong> to make your objections.&nbsp.

As a provider of interactive services, the Tripadvisor is not liable for any statements, representations or any other Content provided by its users (including you as to your Content) in the websites or any other forum.
Although the Tripadvisor has no obligation to screen, edit or monitor any of the Content posted to or distributed through any Interactive Area, Tripadvisor reserves the right, and has absolute discretion, to remove, screen, translate or edit without notice any Content posted or stored on the Services at any time and for any reason, or to have such actions performed by third parties on their behalf, and you are solely responsible for creating backup copies of and replacing any Content you post or otherwise submit to us or store on the Services at your sole cost and expense.</p>
<p>Any use of the Interactive Areas or other aspects of the Services in violation of the foregoing violates the terms of this Agreement and may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Interactive Areas and/or the Services more generally.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<u>Restricting Tripadvisor’s License Rights</u>
</strong>
<strong>.</strong>&nbsp.
You may elect on a going forward basis to limit the Tripadvisor Companies’ use of your Content under this Agreement (as described above) by opting to provide the Tripadvisor Companies with a more limited license as described further below (such limited license to be referred to herein as a “Restricted License”).&nbsp.
You may make this election by selecting such Restricted License grant <strong>here</strong> (note that to do so you shall need to be logged into your account).
If you make this election, the rights you grant the Tripadvisor Companies to your Content pursuant to the license terms set forth above (referred to as the “Standard License”) shall be limited in some important ways described in paragraphs 1 through 6 directly below, such that the Tripadvisor Companies shall not hold a Standard License to any of your Content other than the text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings you post (as to which the Tripadvisor Companies shall continue to be granted a Standard License), but shall be granted a “Restricted License” as to the balance of your Content as defined below:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>When you post your Content to the Services, the license you grant the Tripadvisor Companies in Your Content shall be limited to a nonexclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable, and worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, reproduce, publicly display or perform, translate, and create derivative works of your Content for purposes of displaying such on the Services, as well as using your name and/or trademark in connection with that Content.
Subject to Paragraph 6 below, the Restricted License applies to any of your Content (again, other than text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings) you or another on your behalf (e.g., a third party that contributes to or otherwise manages your account) make available on or in connection with the Services.<br> &nbsp;</li>
<li>As to any individual item of your Content that is subject to the Restricted License, you can terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ license rights hereunder to such by deleting such post from the Services.&nbsp.
Correspondingly, you may terminate the Tripadvisor Companies’ license rights in all of your Content that is subject to the Restricted License by terminating your account (a description of how to do so is available <strong>here</strong>).&nbsp.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, your Content (a) shall remain on the Services to the extent you shared it with others and they copied it or stored it prior to you deleting it or terminating your account, (b) may continue to be displayed upon the Services for a reasonable amount of time after you delete it or terminate your account as we seek to remove it, and/or (c) may be retained (but not publicly displayed) for technical, fraud moderation, regulatory or legal reasons in backup copy form for a period of time.<br> &nbsp;</li>
<li>The Tripadvisor Companies will not use your Content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored Content), although you agree and understand that the Tripadvisor Companies may place advertising and promotions on the Services alongside, near, adjacent, or otherwise in close proximity to your Content (including, for video or other dynamic content, before, during or after its presentation), as well as the Content of others.&nbsp.
In all instances in which your Content is displayed on the Services, we shall provide attribution by using the name and/or trademark that you submit in connection with your Content.&nbsp.
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</li>
<li>The Tripadvisor Companies will not give third parties the right to publish your Content beyond the Services.
However, sharing your Content on the Services (save for our “Trips” feature, which can be made private) shall result in your Content being made "<em>public</em>" and we will enable a feature that allows other users to share (by way of embedding that public post or otherwise) such Content of yours (save, as noted, Trips you configure to be private) onto third-party services, and we will enable search engines to make that public Content of yours findable through their services.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</li>
<li>Except as modified by paragraphs 1 through 6 of this section of this Agreement, your and our rights and obligations shall remain subject to the balance of the terms of this Agreement.
The license you grant the Tripadvisor Companies as modified by these paragraphs 1-6 shall be referred to as a “Restricted License”.<br> &nbsp;</li>
<li>For the sake of clarity, the Content you submit to the Services in connection with other Tripadvisor Companies services or programs is not subject to the Restricted License, but shall instead be governed by the terms and conditions associated with that specific Tripadvisor service or program.</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>BOOKING WITH THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS THROUGH Tripadvisor</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Use of Tripadvisor Booking Services.</strong>&nbsp;The Tripadvisor Companies offer you the ability to search for, select, and book travel reservations with third-party suppliers without leaving the Services.
By booking travel reservations via the websites, you will become an Account Holder if you are not one already.</p>
<p>By booking via the websites, you acknowledge that you accept the practices described in our&nbsp;Privacy Policy&nbsp;and this Agreement.
In addition, you warrant, either in your individual capacity or as a Business Representative, that you are 18 years of age or older, that you possess the legal authority to enter into this Agreement and use the Services (including the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services) in accordance with this Agreement, and that all information you supply is true and accurate.
You further agree that you will use the Tripadvisor Companies’ booking facilitation services only to make legitimate reservations for you or others for whom you are legally authorized to act.
Any false or fraudulent reservation is prohibited, and any user who attempts such a reservation may have his or her account terminated.</p>
<p>AS A USER OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING Tripadvisor COMPANIES’ BOOKING FACILITATION SERVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT: (1) THE Tripadvisor COMPANIES WILL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU OR OTHERS FOR ANY UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTIONS MADE USING YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT.
AND (2) THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OF YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT COULD CAUSE YOU TO INCUR LIABILITY TO Tripadvisor, ITS CORPORATE AFFILIATES AND/OR OTHERS.</p>
<p>When you book a reservation facilitated by the Tripadvisor Companies, your payment information will be collected and transmitted to the supplier to complete the transaction, as described in our&nbsp;Privacy Policy.
Please note that the supplier, not the Tripadvisor Companies, is responsible for processing your payment and fulfilling your reservation.</p>
<p>The Tripadvisor Companies will not interfere with reservations arbitrarily, but reserve the right to withdraw booking facilitation services because of certain extenuating circumstances, such as when a reservation is no longer available or when we have reasonable cause to suspect that a reservation request may be fraudulent.
The Tripadvisor Companies also reserve the right to take steps to verify your identity to process your reservation request.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event that a reservation is available when you place an order but becomes unavailable prior to check-in, your sole remedy will be to contact the supplier to make alternative arrangements or to cancel your reservation.</p>
<p>
<strong>Third-Party Suppliers.</strong>&nbsp;The Tripadvisor Companies are not travel agencies and do not provide or own transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences.
Although the Tripadvisor Companies display information about properties owned by third-party suppliers and facilitate reservations with certain suppliers on or through the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites, such actions do not in any way imply, suggest, or constitute the Tripadvisor Companies’ sponsorship or approval of third-party suppliers, or any affiliation between the Tripadvisor Companies and third-party suppliers.
Although Account Holders may rate and review particular transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences based on their own experiences, the Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse or recommend the products or services of any third-party suppliers, save that Tripadvisor does issue certain businesses awards that are based on the reviews posted by Account Holders.
The Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse any Content posted, submitted or otherwise provided by any user or business, or any opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed therein, and the Tripadvisor Companies expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with such Content.
You agree that the Tripadvisor Companies are not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of information they obtain from third-party suppliers and display on the Services.</p>
<p>If you book a reservation with a third-party supplier, then in addition to this Agreement, you agree to review and be bound by the supplier’s terms and conditions of purchase and website use, privacy policy, and any other rules or policies related to the supplier’s site or property.
Your interactions with third-party suppliers are at your own risk.
The Tripadvisor Companies will have no liability with respect to the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of any third-party suppliers or for any personal injuries, death, property damage, or other damages or expenses resulting from your interactions with third-party suppliers.</p>
<p>The Services may link you to supplier sites or other sites that Tripadvisor does not operate or control.
For further information, please refer to the “Links to Third-Party Sites” section below.</p>
<p>
<strong>Booking Vacation Rentals, Restaurant Reservations and Experiences with Third-Party Suppliers Listed on Corporate Affiliate Sites.</strong>&nbsp;Some of Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates act as marketplaces to facilitate travelers’ ability to (1) enter into vacation rental agreements with property owners and managers (“Vacation Rentals”), (2) make reservations for restaurants (“Restaurants”) and/or (3) make reservations for tours, activities and attractions (variously, “Experiences”) with third-party suppliers of such Experiences (each such supplier of a vacation rental and/or Experience to be referred to as an “Advertiser”).
Those corporate affiliates of Tripadvisor syndicate their advertisements to other entities within the Tripadvisor Companies group and that is why you see them on the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites.&nbsp.
As a user, you must be responsible for your use of the Services (including, in particular, the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites), and any transaction involving Vacation Rentals, Restaurants or Experiences facilitated by Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates.
We do not own, manage, or contract for any Vacation Rental, Restaurant or Experience listed on the Services.</p>
<p>Because neither Tripadvisor nor its corporate affiliates are parties to Vacation Rental transactions, Restaurant reservations or Experience-related transactions between travelers and Advertisers, any dispute or conflict involving an actual or potential transaction between you and an Advertiser, including the quality, condition(s), safety or legality of a listed Vacation Rental, Restaurant or Experience, the accuracy of the listing Content, the Advertiser’s ability to rent a Vacation Rental property, provide you with a reservation, meal or other service at a Restaurant or provide an Experience, or your ability to pay for a Vacation Rental property, a Restaurant meal or service or an Experience, is solely the responsibility of each user.</p>
<p>One of Tripadvisor’ corporate affiliates may act as an Advertiser’s limited agent solely for the purpose of transmitting your payment to the Advertiser.
You agree to pay an Advertiser, or a Tripadvisor corporate affiliate acting as limited payment collection agent on behalf of an Advertiser, any specified fee(s) charged by the Advertiser for any Vacation Rental reservation or Experience.</p>
<p>For further information on Vacation Rental fees, security deposits, fees for Experiences, payment processing, refunds and the like, please consult our affiliates’ terms and conditions (for Experiences visit <strong>Viator</strong>.
for Restaurants visit <strong>The Fork</strong>.
for vacation rentals, visit <strong>Tripadvisor Companies' Vacation Rentals</strong>
<strong>
<u>.</u>
</strong> By making a Vacation Rental reservation, Restaurant reservation or Experience reservation facilitated by one of our corporate affiliates, you will have to acknowledge and agree to its terms and conditions, as well as its privacy policy.</p>
<p>If you enter into a dispute with an Advertiser in the EU, alternative methods for resolving that dispute are available online here:&nbsp;http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/.</p>
<p>
<strong>TRAVEL DESTINATIONS</strong>
</p>

<strong>International Travel.</strong>&nbsp;When you book international travel reservations with third-party suppliers or plan international trips using the Services, you are responsible for ensuring that you meet all foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, including passports and visas, are in order.</p>
<p>For passport and visa requirements, please consult the relevant embassy or consulate for information.
Because requirements may change at any time, be sure to check for up-to-date information before booking and departure.
The Tripadvisor Companies accept no liability for travelers who are refused entry onto a flight or into any country because of the traveler’s failure to carry the travel documents required by any airline, authority, or country, including countries the traveler may just be passing through en route to his or her destination.</p>
<p>It is also your responsibility to consult your physician for current recommendations on inoculations before you travel internationally, and to ensure that you meet all health entry requirements and follow all medical guidance related to your trip.</p>
<p>Although most travel, including travel to international destinations, is completed without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others.
Tripadvisor urges travelers to investigate and review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by their own governments and destination country governments prior to booking travel to international destinations.
For example, information on conditions in various countries and the level of risk associated with travel to particular international destinations is provided by the United States Government at&nbsp;www.state.gov,&nbsp;www.tsa.gov,www.dot.gov,&nbsp;www.faa.gov,&nbsp;www.cdc.gov,&nbsp;www.treas.gov/ofac&nbsp;and&nbsp;www.customs.gov.</p>
