What BECU Is Doing to Protect You
<p>Our websites are secured using digital certificates and industry-standard encryption and time-sensitive session cookies in order to obtain personal information for member transactions.
We only support browsers that can provide industry-accepted encryption protocols.<br>
These protections ensure that you are actually dealing with BECU, and not an imposter site impersonating us.
Your connection to our websites uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) to protect the contents of the message from eavesdropping and interception.&nbsp;</p>
What You Can Do to Protect Yourself
<p>Our security measures are only a part of what it takes to make sure you're protected, because no security is perfect.
It's your responsibility to use up-to-date software, and to enable security features such as anti-virus, anti-malware, and only connect from trusted networks.

Create a Stronger Password
<p>We may have prompted you to create a stronger password.
If you have not done so, we encourage you to help protect your account security by setting a more secure password that meets the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>8-32 characters long</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One upper case letter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One lower case letter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Either a special character or number</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does not contain your user name, real name, or company name</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does not contain a complete word</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is significantly different from previous passwords</p>
</li>
</ul>
Additional Password Recommendations
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use the longest password you're comfortable using, password length adds significant security with every additional character.
We recommend a minimum of 16 characters.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Combine letters (upper and lower), numbers, special characters to create your password, trying to avoid dictionary words and predictable patterns&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As always, use unique passwords across Internet services, especially financial services.</p>
</li>
</ul>
