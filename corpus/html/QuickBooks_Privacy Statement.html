Français Français (Canada) Español Português Intuit Global Privacy Statement <b>Last Updated: December 3, 2020</b>
<br> See previous Privacy Statements Introduction and overview Intuit leverages technology responsibly to power prosperity around the world, and we believe that everyone has a right to privacy.
At Intuit, we view privacy as a key part of the value that we deliver to our customers.
Intuit’s Data Stewardship Principles were developed to describe Intuit’s values regarding the data our customers entrust to us.
Scope of this Privacy Statement and our role As a financial services and technology company, we’re providing this Global Privacy Statement (which we’ll refer to as “Privacy Statement”) to explain how we collect, use, and share information when you interact with us and our offerings, services and experiences.
This Privacy Statement is global in nature, meaning that it is applicable to all websites and offerings in the Intuit group companies, and it describes our privacy practices when we process:<br>
<br>a) Personal information for the purposes of preparing a tax return or in connection with the preparation of a tax return (collectively, “Tax Preparation Information”) as part of providing TurboTax tax preparation services;<br>
<br>b) Personal information for the purposes of providing the benefits of the Intuit platform, which is collectively, all of Intuit’s services, sites, experiences and software (including through our mobile applications and desktop applications) by Intuit Inc.
and its affiliates and subsidiaries other than Tax Preparation Information (the “Intuit Platform”).
and/or<br>
<br>c) Personal information as necessary to manage, run and improve our business.<br>
<br>Intuit Inc.
determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal information (“Information Controller”).
Intuit Inc.
may share your personal data with other Intuit group companies to process as joint controllers for the purposes set out in this Privacy Statement.
If you have any questions about the processing of your personal data, please contact us in the section “How to Contact Us” below.
<br>
<br>This Privacy Statement does not apply where Intuit processes personal information as a service provider on behalf of a customer or entity who acts as the Information Controller, for example, the customers of our professional tax software products.
When we act as a service provider, the privacy statement of the relevant Information Controller and our agreements with such business or entity will govern our processing of personal information.<br>
<br>In certain circumstances, there may be more than one Information Controller processing your information.
For example, your employer or a financial partner may also act as an Information Controller.
In these situations, we act as an independent Information Controller over our processing activities – meaning that we make determinations over how your personal information will be processed independently from the other Information Controller.
The other Information Controller may have their own obligations under applicable information privacy law, and you may need to speak with the other Information Controller directly for questions on how they process your personal information.<br> The Intuit Platform The Intuit Platform and your information When we say “platform” we mean that when you choose to share data with us, or bring over information from third parties (like a bank or loan provider), we use that data together, not just within the individual offering(s) you’re using.
This means your bookkeeping details from QuickBooks, budgets from Mint, and recommendations from Credit Karma all live together.
<br>
<br>The personal information we use in this centralized way is all the information that Intuit knows about you.
It includes your credentials.
your name and contact details.
payment information.
information about your activities, your interests and preferences.
insights about your finances or your business.
the content you place in our Platform.
and information we have collected about you from third-party sources.<br> Organizational account information Some experiences and services within the Intuit Platform allow you to interact with an organization (such as your employer).
If you are granted access to an organization or household account (for example, a business's account in QuickBooks), the owner of the organization or a designated administrator may control and administer details of your account, for example, by deciding your access rights.
making decisions about your personal information (such as details about your payroll).
or requiring you to take certain actions (for example, use location tracking to clock in for a shift).
If your access rights are amended by the owner or designated administrator, then you may lose access to the information that is in the control of the organization.<br>
<br>Your use of the Intuit Platform as part of an organization’s account may be subject to the organization’s policies, which may be different from this Statement.
We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of other organizations, and you should consider both the organization's policies and whether you are comfortable enabling the organization with access to your information prior to connecting to their services.
Information we collect Information we receive from you The personal information that we receive about you depends on the context of your interactions with Intuit, how you configure your account and the choices that you make, including your privacy settings.
Personal information that you provide may also depend upon what services or experiences you use, your location and applicable law.
