To get basic information about the traffic on our website we use the privacy concerned Google Analytics alternative plausible.io which is handling all data absolutely anonymously without persistent identifiers (cookies).
Data is neither tracked across-sites or devices nor used for any other purposes.
</p> 3.3 Using the Mailvelope download server <p>Our server download.mailvelope.com collects anonymous technical data, such as the name of your web browser, operating system, information about the website from which you linked to us and the pages on our server that you visit.
These data are stored automatically.
They are analyzed in anonymous form and solely for statistical purposes with the aim of further improving our service for you.</p> 3.4 Download the Mailvelope Chrome Extension <p>Chrome Extensions are hosted on the Chrome Web Store.
Please refer to www.google.com/policies/privacy for information on which data is collected if you download the extension or during the regular updates.</p> 3.5 Download the Mailvelope Firefox Add-on <p>Firefox add-ons are hosted on addons.mozilla.org (AMO).
Please refer to www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy for information on which data is collected if you download the extension or during the regular updates.</p> 3.6 Using the browser extension <p>In general no data is collected during the usage of the browser extension, no analytics is used to track user behavior.
Mailvelope stores data only locally in the local storage of the browser, which is not accessible by other applications.
Sensitive or personal user data is stored in Mailvelope only in the form of PGP keys, which contain user name and email address, and are stored in the keyring of Mailvelope.
When a new PGP key is generated, Mailvelope has the option (default: on) to upload the key to the Mailvelope key server (see 3.7).
Apart from that, when the resp.
options are activated in the key server settings of Mailvelope (default: on), the following mechanisms could leak meta data of the user:</p>
<ul>
<li>The browser extension by default searches for keys on the Mailvelope key server for unknown email addresses.
In the process of this key search, the email address of a contact is sent from the extension to the key server.</li>
<li>The browser extension by default searches for keys in the Web Key Directory (WKD).
In the process of this key search, the hashed email address of a contact is sent from the extension to mail providers that support WKD.</li>
</ul> 3.7 Using the Mailvelope key server <p>By uploading a key to the key server you give us your revocable consent to store the key (which may contain personal information like your real name and your email address) on the key server so that we can serve it to other users who are addressing encrypted messages to your email address.
You can delete your keys from the server at any time at keys.mailvelope.com/manage.html.</p>
<p>When searching for keys on the key server we collect anonymous technical data, such as the name of your web browser and operating system.
These data are stored automatically.
They are analyzed in anonymous form and solely for statistical purposes with the aim of further improving our service for you.</p> 3.8 Using the Gmail API integration <p>If you grant the Mailvelope browser extension access to your Gmail account via Google API Services, it will solely use this access for enhancing Gmail with PGP encryption services.
Specifically, this means:</p>
<ul>
<li>The browser extension will use its access only to read Gmail message bodies (including attachments), metadata and headers to display the content of encrypted emails and attachments within the Gmail UI.
Furthermore the Mailvelope email editor component allows users to compose and send encrypted emails.</li>
<li>Your emails and your user data are processed only in the local installation of the browser extension and will never be shared with any third party nor transmitted to a Mailvelope server.</li>

Emails and other data from your Gmail account are never stored in the browser extension.</li>
<li>Mailvelope does not include advertisements.
Your Gmail data will not be used for serving advertisements.</li>
