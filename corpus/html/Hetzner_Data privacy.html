If you pay using a credit card, we do not collect and store any payment information such as credit card numbers or verification codes.
You disclose this information only to the respective payment service provider.
One exception with credit card payments is what is known as the pseudo card number: in order for you not to have to enter your credit card information for every payment, a pseudo card number is saved for your account.
The pseudo card number only enables payment for products on our website that you order using your customer account.
A pseudo card number is not identical to the credit card number.

<br>Cookies and the right to object to direct advertising <p> "Cookies" are small files that are stored on a user's computer.
Cookies can store different kinds of data.
Cookies are primarily used to store information about users.
They are stored on the users' devices during and/or after users visit a website or online store.
"Temporary cookies", "session cookies", or "transient cookies" are cookies that are deleted after users leave an online store and close their browsers.
With such cookies, for example, the content of a shopping basket can be stored in an online shop or a login bottleneck.
However, other cookies are referred to as "permanent" or "persistent" and remain stored even after the browser is closed.
For example, users' login status can be saved when they visit a shop after several days.
Likewise, permanent cookies can measure the "range" of a website (where the users are geographically located) or information on the users' interests.
This information is used for marketing purposes.
"Third-party cookies" are cookies that are offered by the original providers (who operate the online store or website) to other parties.
(If the original provider is the one using the cookies, they are often called "first-party cookies").
It is useful to know the above terms so that you understand our cookie policies and data protection agreement.
