In addition, we automatically gather general statistical information about our website and visitors, such as IP addresses, browsers, pages viewed, number of visitors, goods and services purchased, etc., but in doing so we do not reference you by individual name, email address, home address, or telephone number.

Preference and options configurations in your browser determine if and how a cookie or beacon will be accepted.
You can change those configurations on your computer if you desire.
By changing your preferences, you can accept all cookies, you can be notified when a cookie is sent, or you can reject all cookies.
If you do so and cookies are disabled, you may be required to re-enter your information more often and certain features of our site may be unavailable.
Disabling cookies will also prevent beacons from tracking your unique information when visiting our website.<br>
In addition, our retail partners, advertisers, and other third parties appearing at our site or linked to our site may use their own cookies and beacons and may collect personally-identifiable information, including credit card information, in connection with your use of their websites.
The privacy policy of such third parties may differ from ours.
We encourage you to read the third party’s privacy policy before responding to the offer to determine how the personally-identifiable information is used by that third party.<br>
Our site does not engage in the collection of personally identifiable information from users across third-party websites or third-party online services or applications, except as specified by you when you elect to register and login to our site, via certain third-party sites or applications, such as, for example, Google+, Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.
Aside from the foregoing, we do not knowingly enable other parties to collect personally identifiable information about our users’ activities over time and across different sites, applications, or services.
If your browser or similar mechanism gives our site a “do not track” signal, our site will make commercially reasonable attempts to honor your settings (although we still may deliver and use cookies and other tracking technologies for non-marketing purposes).
However, we do not make any promises or guarantees about the effects of any “do not track” choice that you may make because: (a) such nuanced treatment is not necessarily available or effective for all browsers, mechanisms, or tracking technologies, and our commercially reasonable attempts to honor your settings might not be effective to preclude tracking or behavioral advertising at all or over any particular period of time.
(b) third parties may not honor your settings or our policies and may use cookies or other tracking technologies for behavioral advertising despite our commercially reasonable attempts to prevent them from doing so.
and (c) tracking technologies, browsers, and access devices may change from time to time and our commercially reasonable attempts might not be effective for each technology or across all platforms.</p>

The Way We Use Information</strong>
</p>
<p>We use your personally-identifying information to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site usage, to improve our content and product offerings, and to customize our site’s content, layout, and services.<br>
We may use your information to deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests, such as articles, targeted banners, new services, advertisements, and promotions.
You can opt out of receiving this information by so indicating in your registration/preferences file or otherwise notifying us in writing.
We may ask you to provide us voluntarily with additional information regarding your personal or business interests, experience, or requests, which we may use to customize our services for you.<br>
We may use your email address, your mailing address, and phone number to contact you regarding administrative notices and communications relevant to your use of our site.<br>
If you place a request for goods or services, we use your information to deliver your order.
Payments for goods and services ordered from us through our site are handled by a third-party provider.
This provider, as well as other providers, may collect additional information, including billing information, credit card number, expiration date, and security code, and tracking information from checks or money orders.
If you obtain goods or services directly from one of our retail partners or service providers, we may exchange with the vendor personally-identified information about you for purposes of your transaction.<br>
We may also use or disclose information to resolve disputes, investigate problems, or enforce our Website User Agreement (Terms of Use).
At times, we may review the status or activity of multiple users to do so.
We may disclose or access information whenever we believe in good faith that the law so requires or if we otherwise consider it necessary to do so to maintain service and improve our goods and services.<br>
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to manage our website, and to enhance our site based on the usage pattern data we receive.</p>

<strong>4.
Security</strong>
</p>
<p>We employ reasonable and current security methods to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure correct use of information.<br>
To use some of our services, you may be required to set up a password-protected account or profile on our website.
We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone.
It is your responsibility to keep your password protected.
Our personnel will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email.
Remember to sign out of your account, close your browser window, and delete your temporary Internet files when you have finished your session.
This helps ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place where others may have access to it.<br>
Whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online — for example, on message boards or blogs, through email, or in chat areas — that information can be collected and used by others.<br>
No data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be perfectly secure.
As a result, while we try to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.</p>

California Residents – Your California Privacy Rights</strong>
</p>
<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California residents to request from us certain information regarding the disclosure of certain categories of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes within the immediately preceding calendar year.
A company may also comply with the law by disclosing in its privacy notice that it provides consumers choice (opt-out or opt-in) regarding sharing personal information with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes (as we do), and information on how to exercise that choice.<br>
If you are a California resident and you have questions about our practices with respect to sharing information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes and your ability to exercise choice, please send your request to us via the email address or the mailing address set forth in Section 7.
You must put the statement “Your California Privacy Rights” in the subject field of your email or include it in your writing if you choose to write to us at the designated mailing address.
You must include your name, street address, city, state, and zip code.
We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or do not have complete information.<br>
If you are a California resident under the age of 18, and a registered user of our website, California Business and Professions Code Section 22581 permits you to request and obtain removal of content that you have publicly posted.
To make such a request, please send an email with a detailed description of the specific content to us via the email address set forth in Section 7.
Please be aware that such a request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information that you have posted and there may be circumstances in which the law does not require or allow removal even if requested.</p>
