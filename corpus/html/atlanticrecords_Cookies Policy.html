<p>There are other technologies we use on the Site that work in a similar way to cookies by storing or accessing information on a user’s device, such as:</p>

<li>Local Shared Objects – this is commonly called a “Flash cookie” and is a piece of data that websites which use Adobe Flash may store on a user's computer, typically to support website advertisements and videos.</li>
<li>Device fingerprinting – this is a way of identifying a unique device by combining certain attributes of the device, without necessarily having to know the IP address or setting cookies.</li>
<li>Scripts – these are lists of commands executed by programs or scripting engines, which are used to generate Web pages and to automate computer processes.</li>
<li>Tracking pixels / web beacons – these are small pieces of code loaded when a user visits a website, which can be used to track site visits, user behaviour, ad impressions and other online activities.</li>
