Agreement to Arbitrate<p>This Section titled “Dispute resolution by binding arbitration” is referred to in this Agreement as the “Arbitration Agreement.” You&nbsp;agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Grammarly, whether arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including any alleged breach thereof), the Site, Software or Services, any advertising or any aspect of the relationship or transactions between us, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify.
Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf.
You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and Grammarly are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.
Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury.
The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.</p>b.
Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief<p>YOU AND GRAMMARLY AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.
UNLESS BOTH YOU AND GRAMMARLY AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING.
ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).</p>c.
Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution<p>Grammarly is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer’s satisfaction by emailing customer support at support@grammarly.com.
If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a&nbsp;party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a&nbsp;written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”).
The Notice to Grammarly should be sent to 548 Market Street, #35410, San Francisco, CA 94104, Attn: Operations Department (“Notice Address”).
The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought.
If Grammarly and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Grammarly may commence an arbitration proceeding.
During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Grammarly or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Grammarly is entitled.</p>d.
Arbitration Procedures<p>Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association’s (“AAA”) rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), as&nbsp;modified by this Arbitration Agreement.
For information on the AAA, please visit its website, https://www.adr.org.
Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA’s consumer arbitration page, https://www.adr.org/consumer_arbitration.
If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration.
The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of this Agreement as a court would.
All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement.
Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under this Agreement and applicable law.
Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.</p>
<p>Unless Grammarly and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a&nbsp;reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances.
If the parties are unable to agree on a&nbsp;location, the determination shall be made by AAA.
If your claim is for $10,000 or less, Grammarly agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.
If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.</p>e.
Costs of Arbitration<p>Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the “Arbitration Fees”) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement.
If the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, at your request, Grammarly will pay all Arbitration Fees.
If the value of relief sought is more than $75,000 and you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, Grammarly will pay your portion of such fees.
In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Grammarly will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.
Finally, if the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, Grammarly will pay reasonable attorneys’ fees should you prevail.
Grammarly will not seek attorneys’ fees from you.
But, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 in relief, the payment of attorneys’ fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.</p>f.
Confidentiality<p>All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.</p>g.
Severability<p>Without limiting the severability provision in the Section titled “General Provisions” of this Agreement, if a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration&nbsp;Agreement other than clause (b) of this Arbitration&nbsp;Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified.
If a court decides that any of the provisions of clause (b) of this Arbitration Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to claims for public injunctive relief.
The remainder of this Agreement will continue to apply.</p>h.
Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement<p>Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, Grammarly agrees that if it makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a user of the Services, you may reject any such change by sending Grammarly written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above.
By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement.</p>General provisions<p>This Agreement shall be&nbsp;governed&nbsp;by, and construed in&nbsp;accordance with, the laws of&nbsp;the State of&nbsp;California, without regard to&nbsp;any choice of&nbsp;law, conflicts of&nbsp;law or&nbsp;other principles that would result in&nbsp;the applicable of&nbsp;the laws or&nbsp;regulations of&nbsp;any other jurisdiction.
Subject to&nbsp;the section titled “Arbitration”, any legal action or&nbsp;proceeding relating to&nbsp;this Agreement shall be&nbsp;instituted in&nbsp;a&nbsp;state or&nbsp;federal court in&nbsp;San Francisco County, California.
You and Grammarly agree to&nbsp;submit to&nbsp;the jurisdiction&nbsp;of, and agree that venue is&nbsp;proper&nbsp;in, these courts in&nbsp;any such legal action or&nbsp;proceeding.</p>
<p>This Agreement and the rights and obligations herein are personal to&nbsp;you, and you may not assign or&nbsp;otherwise transfer this Agreement or&nbsp;any of&nbsp;your rights or&nbsp;obligations hereunder, by&nbsp;operation of&nbsp;law or&nbsp;otherwise, without the prior written consent of&nbsp;Grammarly.
Grammarly may freely assign this Agreement, including, without limitation, in connection with a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, reorganization, or sale of some or all of our assets or stock.</p>
<p>If&nbsp;any one or&nbsp;more of&nbsp;the provisions of&nbsp;this Agreement are for any reason held to&nbsp;be&nbsp;invalid, illegal or&nbsp;unenforceable by&nbsp;a&nbsp;court of&nbsp;competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions of&nbsp;this Agreement shall be&nbsp;unimpaired and shall remain in&nbsp;full force and effect, and the invalid, illegal or&nbsp;unenforceable provision(s) shall be&nbsp;replaced by&nbsp;a&nbsp;valid, legal and enforceable provision or&nbsp;provisions that comes closest to&nbsp;the intent of&nbsp;the parties underlying the invalid, illegal or&nbsp;unenforceable provision(s).</p>
<p>The failure of&nbsp;either party to&nbsp;exercise in&nbsp;any respect any right provided for herein shall not be&nbsp;deemed a&nbsp;waiver of&nbsp;any further rights hereunder.
A&nbsp;waiver by&nbsp;either party of&nbsp;any term or&nbsp;condition of&nbsp;this Agreement or&nbsp;any breach thereof, in&nbsp;any one instance, will not waive such term or&nbsp;condition or&nbsp;any subsequent breach thereof.</p>
<p>If&nbsp;Grammarly is&nbsp;unable to&nbsp;perform any obligation under this Agreement because of&nbsp;any matter beyond its reasonable control, such as&nbsp;lightning, flood, exceptionally severe weather, fire, explosion, war, civil disorder, industrial disputes (whether or&nbsp;not involving employees of&nbsp;Grammarly), acts of&nbsp;local or&nbsp;central government or&nbsp;other competent authorities, problems with telecommunications providers, hostile network attacks or&nbsp;other events beyond Grammarly’s reasonable control (each, a&nbsp;“Force Majeure Event”), Grammarly will have no&nbsp;liability to&nbsp;you for such failure to&nbsp;perform.
provided, however, that Grammarly shall resume performance promptly upon removal of&nbsp;the circumstances constituting the Force Majeure Event.
If&nbsp;any Force Majeure Event continues for more than sixty (60) days, either Grammarly or&nbsp;you may terminate this Agreement by&nbsp;delivery of&nbsp;written notice to&nbsp;the other party.
You will remain responsible for all Fees incurred through the last day the Services were available.</p>
<p>If&nbsp;you and Grammarly have executed a&nbsp;separate Subscription Agreement applicable to&nbsp;your access to&nbsp;and use of&nbsp;the Site, Services and/or Software, then the terms and conditions of&nbsp;such Subscription Agreement shall prevail to&nbsp;the extent of&nbsp;any conflict with the terms and conditions of&nbsp;this Agreement.
In&nbsp;all other cases, this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Grammarly and you with respect to&nbsp;its subject matter, and supersedes all prior communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral or&nbsp;written, between Grammarly and you.
No&nbsp;waiver or&nbsp;modification of&nbsp;any of&nbsp;the provisions of&nbsp;this Agreement shall be&nbsp;binding unless in&nbsp;writing and signed by&nbsp;a&nbsp;duly authorized representative of&nbsp;each party.</p>Notice for California users<p>Under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, users of&nbsp;the Site, Software or&nbsp;Services from California are entitled to&nbsp;the following specific consumer rights notice: The Complaint Assistance Unit of&nbsp;the Division of&nbsp;Consumer Services of&nbsp;the California Department of&nbsp;Consumer Affairs may be&nbsp;contacted in&nbsp;writing at&nbsp;1625 North Market Blvd., Suite N&nbsp;112, Sacramento, CA&nbsp;95834, or&nbsp;by&nbsp;telephone&nbsp;at (916) 445-1254&nbsp;or (800) 952-5210.
