         IBM Privacy Statement <p>
<strong>This Privacy Statement is effective as of 01 December 2020.</strong>
</p>
<p>The previous version of this Statement is available here.</p>
<p>At IBM we recognize the importance of protecting your personal information and are committed to processing it responsibly and in compliance with applicable data protection laws in all countries in which IBM operates.</p>
<p>This Privacy Statement describes IBM's general privacy practices that apply to personal information we collect, use and share about our clients, business partners, supplier and other organizations with which IBM has or contemplates a business relationship as well as the individuals working for them.
This Privacy Statement does not apply to the extent IBM processes personal information on behalf of clients for their benefit and under their control (as a “processor”), such as Cloud Services or applications (“apps”).
It may apply to collection of information related to authorized users of such services to the extent IBM processes this information for its own interests (as “controller”).</p>
<p>This Privacy Statement is supplemented by the IBM Online Privacy Statement, which provides more information in the online context, including recruitment.
We may provide additional or more specific information on the collection or use of personal information on websites or related to a specific product or service.</p>
<p>
<strong>Why and how we collect and use your personal information </strong>
</p>
<p>We may collect your personal information as an individual for various purposes, such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Access and use of websites or other online service</b>
<strong> (including “apps”)</strong>
<br> When entering one of our websites, or using an online service (where references to online services include desktop or mobile applications or “apps”), we will record information necessary to provide you with access, for the operation of the website and for us to comply with security and legal requirements in relation to operating our site, such as passwords, IP address and browser settings.

<br> When you contact us (online or offline) in connection with a request for information, to order a product or service, to provide you with support, or to participate in a forum or other social computing tool, we collect information necessary to fulfill your request, to grant you access to the product or service, to provide you with support and to be able to contact you.
For instance, we collect your name and contact information, details about your request and your agreement with us and the fulfillment, delivery and invoicing of your order and we may include client satisfaction survey information.
We retain such information for administrative purposes, defending our rights, and in connection with our relationship with you.<br>

</ul>
<p>Where we reference that we use your personal information in connection with a request, order, transaction or agreement (or preparing for the same), or to provide you with services that you requested (such as a website), we do this because it is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you.</p>
<p>Where we reference that we use your personal information in relation to marketing, improvement or development of our products or services, for reasons of safety and security, or regulatory requirements other than in connection with your agreement or request, we do this on the basis of our or a third party’s legitimate interests, or with your consent.
When we collect and use your personal information subject to the EU Privacy Legislation this may have consequences for your rights.<br>
<br>
<strong>Sharing of Personal Information</strong>
<br>
<br>
As a global organization offering a wide range of products and services, with business processes, management structures and technical systems that cross borders, IBM has implemented global policies, along with standards and procedures, for consistent protection of personal information.
As a global company, we may share information about you with our subsidiaries world-wide and transfer it to countries in the world where we do business in accordance with this Privacy Statement.<br>
<br>
Between IBM controlled subsidiaries we only grant access to personal information on a need-to-know basis, necessary for the purposes for which such access is granted.
In some cases, IBM uses suppliers located in various countries to collect, use, analyze and otherwise process personal information on its behalf.<br>
<br>
Where appropriate, IBM may also share your personal information with selected partners to help us provide you, or the company you work for, products or services, or to fulfill your requests, or with your consent.
When selecting our suppliers and partners, we take into account their data handling processes.<br>
<br>
If IBM decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries, such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of such information from sellers.
It is IBM's practice to require appropriate protection for personal information in these types of transactions.<br>
<br>
Please be aware that in certain circumstances, personal information may be subject to disclosure to government agencies pursuant to judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process.
We may also share your personal information to protect the rights or property of IBM, our business partners, suppliers or clients, and others when we have reasonable grounds to believe that such rights or property have been or could be affected.</p>
<p>
<strong>International Transfers</strong>
<br>
<br>
The international footprint of IBM involves a large number of transfers of personal information between different subsidiaries, as well as to third parties located in the countries where we do business.
Some countries have implemented transfer restrictions for personal information, in connection with which IBM takes various measures, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where required, IBM implements Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the EU Commission, or similar contractual clauses in other jurisdictions.
This includes transfers to suppliers or other third parties.
You can request a copy of the EU Standard Contractual Clauses&nbsp;here.</li>
<li>IBM complies with the APEC Cross Border Privacy Rules&nbsp.
(CBPR) system.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the EU-U.S.&nbsp;and Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework may no longer be used or relied upon for transfer of personal information, IBM continues to comply with all EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework and&nbsp;Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework obligations.

<strong>Information Security and Accuracy</strong>
<br>
<br>
We intend to protect your personal information and to maintain its accuracy.
IBM implements reasonable physical, administrative and technical safeguards to help us protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use and disclosure.
For example, we encrypt certain sensitive personal information such as credit card information when we transmit such information over the Internet.
We also require that our suppliers protect such information from unauthorized access, use and disclosure.</p>
<p>
<strong>Retention Period</strong>
<br>
<br>
We will not retain personal information longer than necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it is processed, including the security of our processing complying with legal and regulatory obligations (e.g.
audit, accounting and statutory retention terms), handling disputes, and for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims in the countries where we do business.</p>
<p>Because the circumstances may vary depending on the context and the services, the information provided in&nbsp;Online Privacy Statement&nbsp;or provided in a specific notice may provide more detailed information on applicable retention terms.</p> &nbsp.
