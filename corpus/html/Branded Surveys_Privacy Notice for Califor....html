<p>
<strong>Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights</strong>
</p>
<p>You have the right to request that Branded disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months.
Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see <em>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</em>), we will disclose to you:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
The categories of personal information we collected about you.</p>

If we disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, we will identify the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained.</p>
<p>
<strong>Deletion Request Rights </strong>
</p>
<p>You have the right to request that Branded delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions.
You have access to your personal information and you may delete your member information and email preferences at any time.&nbsp.
You may also email us at compliance@gobranded.com.
Once we receive your request via email and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see <em>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</em>), we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.</p>
<p>We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.</p>

seq.</em>).</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research's achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.

<p>
<em>
</em>
<strong>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</strong>
</p>
<p>To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
Emailing us at compliance@gobranded.com.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
Logging on to your password-protected account with us.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
Writing to us at: Attn: Data Protection Officer, 343 4th Ave, Suite 201, San Diego, CA 92101.</p>
<p>Only you, an authorized agent, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information.
You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.</p>
<p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.
The verifiable consumer request must:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative, usually by sending us an email from the account in our records or by submitting a request through your password-protected account.&nbsp.
If you submit a written request through the mail, please provide your name, email, mobile number, account name, and specify your request.
We may need to further verify your written request before we can respond.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</p>
<p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.</p>
<p>Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.
However, we do consider requests made through your password-protected account sufficiently verified when the request relates to personal information associated with that specific account.</p>
<p>We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.</p>
<p>For instructions on exercising sale opt-out rights, see Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>Response Timing and Format</strong>
</p>
<p>We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt.
If we require more time, up to 45 additional days, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.</p>
<p>We will deliver our written response electronically via the email address you provided to us.</p>
<p>Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt.
The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.
For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>
<p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.
If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights</strong>
</p>
<p>We do not allow consumers of less than 16 years of age to register with our site and therefore do not sell this information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us to not sell your personal information at any time (the "right to opt-out").
If you make a request to opt-out of the sale of your personal information, due to the nature of our business, we will be required to delete your Branded account.&nbsp.
Choosing to opt-out of the sale of your data and thereby delete your Branded account cannot be undone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To exercise the right to opt-out, you (or your authorized representative) may submit a request to us by visiting our Do Not Sell My Personal Information.</p>
<p>If you make a request to opt-out of the sale of your personal information, due to the nature of our business, we will be required to delete your Branded account.&nbsp.
Choosing to opt-out of the sale of your data and thereby delete your Branded account cannot be undone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you change your mind and would like to opt back in to personal information sales, you may create a new account with us at https://surveys.gobranded.com/users/sign-up/.</p>
<p>You do not need to create an account with us to exercise your opt-out rights.
We will only use personal information provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>Non-Discrimination</strong>
<u>
</u>
</p>
<p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.
Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deny you goods or services.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.</p>
<p>However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that&nbsp;<strong>can result&nbsp;</strong>in different prices, rates, or quality levels.
Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information's value and contain written terms that describe the program's material aspects.
Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.</p>
