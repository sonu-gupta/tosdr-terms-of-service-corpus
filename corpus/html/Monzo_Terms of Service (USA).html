No class action or other representative or joint action is allowed in arbitration.
You can find more information on arbitration by contacting customer support in the app.

<strong>Pots 🍯</strong>
</p>
<p>You can set up a Pot in your Monzo app.
You can move money into and out of Pots in your Monzo account.
There are no fees, and no limits on the number of transfers you make.
You can create and use Pots to save money for different purposes.
Pots aren’t savings accounts, don’t have their own account numbers, and don’t earn interest.
The money in a Pot is protected by the same FDIC insurance that protects your Monzo account.</p>
<p>You can only add money to, or withdraw money from, a Pot through your Monzo account.
Money in your Pots won’t be included in your available balance, and you won’t be able to spend it.
If you find yourself low on money you can always move money from a Pot back into your main account.</p>
<p>Money in a Pot is not part of your “available balance”, which you can see in the Monzo app, and is not available to pay card transactions, direct debits, or automatic or scheduled transfers.
Those transactions will be declined if there are insufficient funds in your main Monzo account, regardless of balances in Pots.
To access money in a Pot, you must first transfer the money from the Pot to your main Monzo account, which you may do at any time.
You should keep enough money in your main Monzo account to cover all anticipated expenses.</p>
<p>If you switch on the “Round up transactions” feature, we’ll round your card payments up to the nearest dollar and automatically transfer the difference from your main Monzo account to your Pot.
You can only turn on this feature for one Pot at a time.
The “Round up transactions” feature won’t work if you don’t have enough money in your main Monzo account.
You can turn off the feature at any time.</p>
<p>You can close a Pot at any time after.
We’ll automatically transfer any money in the Pot back to your main Monzo account.</p>
