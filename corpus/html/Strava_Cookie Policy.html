<p>Most browsers allow you to choose whether you wish to accept cookies.
Different browsers make different controls available to you and so we provide links below to popular browser instructions on how you can do this.
Generally, your browser will offer you the choice to accept, refuse or delete all cookies, or third-party cookies on a website, or those from specific websites.
However, if you restrict our capability to set cookies, you may limit the full functionality of Strava, which will make some of our services and features unavailable to you.</p>

<li>Internet Explorer</li>
<li>Firefox</li>
<li>Safari</li>
<li>Opera</li>

<p>In some cases, you can manage third-party cookies on a cookie-by-cookie basis.
Learn how to manage your Google ads personalization setting, your Google Analytics setting, and your Branch cookies setting.</p> Do Not Track (DNT)
<p>We may not recognize Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) signals from your web browsers or device.
This is because there is not yet a universally accepted standard on how to interpret and respond to DNT signals, which often conflict with other settings.
If and when a standard is established, we will re-examine how we can appropriately respond to DNT signals.</p> Changes to this policy
<p>This policy may change from time to time, so it should be reviewed frequently for the most up to date cookie information.
We will notify you of any changes by updates to this page.</p>
