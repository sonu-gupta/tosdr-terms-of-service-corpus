</p> Information collection
<p>Vanguard collects and processes both Personal Data and Other Data.
For purposes of this Policy, “Personal Data” is any information that alone or together with other information in Vanguard’s possession relates to an identified or identifiable natural person, such as name, phone number, email address, financial account information, and online identifiers and account information such as user name and password.
“Other Data” is any additional information that is not Personal Data.
In this section, we describe our information-collection practices, including the types of Personal and Other Data that we collect.
In subsequent sections of this Policy, we describe how we use and disclose Personal and Other Data.</p>
<p>We may combine the Personal and Other Data we collect directly from you with information collected from or about you in other contexts, such as on the Sites.
This may include information collected online, such as through our email exchanges with you.
from publicly available sources, such as your company website if you are a financial adviser.
from the registrar for our exchange-traded funds so that we can provide information about products or services that may be of benefit.
or from offline sources, such as information that we collect when you establish your account with us or call customer service.
We will treat such combined information in accordance with this Policy.
If you do not wish to provide information to Vanguard, we may be unable to provide certain products or services to you, and if we or a fraud prevention agency determine that you pose a fraud or money laundering risk, we may refuse to provide or stop providing the services you have requested.</p>

Use, legal basis, and disclosure
How do we use Personal and Other Data?
<p>We use the Personal and Other Data that we collect for the purposes described in this Policy, for the purposes for which it was provided to us, as required by law, and for our business purposes, including:</p>

in this regard, we and fraud prevention agencies may also enable law enforcement agencies to process your Personal Data to prevent, detect, and investigate crime;</li>

For example, if you consent, we will use your Personal Data, such as your email address, to send you news and newsletters, or to otherwise contact you about Vanguard products or information we think may be of interest to you.

</ul>
Legal bases for using Personal Data

in these cases we will process your Personal Data at all times in a way that is proportionate and respects your privacy rights, and you have a right to object to this processing as explained in the section below titled Your legal rights.</li>

We may provide our clients’ or prospective clients’ contact details to market research companies to undertake research on behalf of Vanguard, in accordance with applicable law.
For example, we may run client satisfaction surveys or run focus groups on proposed products.</p>
<p>
<em>Direct sharing through third-party websites and services</em>: The Sites may enable you to share information directly with websites or online services operated by third parties.
For example, the Sites contain features that allow you to share articles or content through Facebook, Google Plus, Twitter, LinkedIn, and other services, and to view content through video players and other services (such as the YouTube video player).
If you choose to use these features, you may disclose information to those websites or services and their users, and to the public more generally.
These websites and services may also set and/or access a cookie on your device.&nbsp.
Because these third-party websites and services are not operated by Vanguard, we are not responsible for the content or practices of those websites or services.
The collection, use, and disclosure of information through these websites and services will be subject to the privacy policies of the third-party websites or services, and not this Policy<em>.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Competitions, contests, and promotions</em>: Vanguard may use an agency to run competitions, contests, or promotions on the Sites or elsewhere, and if you choose to participate, we or third parties may request your name, address, telephone number, email address, and other information where it is necessary to ensure your eligibility and to comply with lottery and gaming regulations.
In compliance with the relevant regulations, it may also be necessary to publish details of the winners of competitions in appropriate news media.</p>
<p>
<em>Aggregated information</em>: From time to time, Vanguard may share aggregated information about users of the Sites or Vanguard’s products and services, such as sharing reports on the usage of the Sites or Vanguard’s services for regulatory reporting or marketing purposes.</p>
Website analytics and Interest-Based Advertising
<p>We partner with third parties to collect the Other Data discussed above to engage in Site analysis, auditing, research, and reporting.
When you visit our Sites, these third parties may set and access cookies on your computer or other device and may use web beacons to collect information about your activity on the Sites.
We use these cookies to identify you as having confirmed your eligibility to enter and use our Sites, and to make sure you connect to the right service on our Sites when we make any changes to the way the Sites work.
These cookies are also used to help us improve how our Sites work and understand what interests our users, and for error management, to help us improve our Sites by measuring any errors that occur.&nbsp.
In particular, the Sites use Adobe Analytics&nbsp;to help collect and analyse certain information for the purposes discussed above.
The information generated about your use of the Sites may be transmitted to and stored by Adobe Analytics on servers outside your country of residence.
You may opt out of the use of cookies by Adobe Analytics here.</p>
<p>We also partner with third-party service providers, including social networks, to provide targeted advertising services that are customised based on your online activities over time and across unaffiliated websites (Interest-Based Advertising) and to help us measure brand awareness and the effectiveness of our online advertising.
If you provide your consent on our Sites, these service providers may use cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies to collect information about your activity on our Sites, and they may combine it with information about your activity on other, unaffiliated websites.
We and our service providers may use data collected on our Sites or when you open emails from Vanguard, together with other information we have about you and your Vanguard relationships, to serve Vanguard ads to you on other sites as you browse the web.
For example, third parties may use the fact that you visited the Sites to target ads for Vanguard products and services to you on non-Vanguard websites.
In addition, our third-party advertising providers might use information about your use of the Sites to help target non-Vanguard advertisements based on your online activity in general.</p>
<p>For more information about Interest-Based Advertising and how to opt out, please visit the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out page&nbsp.
(available in 27 languages).</p>
<p>Although our Sites currently do not respond to "do not track" browser headers, you can limit tracking by taking the steps discussed above.
The use of online tracking mechanisms by third parties is subject to those third parties' own privacy policies, and not this Policy.</p>
Cross-border transfer of information
<p>Vanguard generally maintains centralised servers and systems in the United States and may maintain servers and systems elsewhere.
These servers and systems are managed by or on behalf of The Vanguard Group, Inc., or Vanguard Affiliates located in or outside the United States.
Vanguard also may subcontract the processing of your information to, or otherwise share your information with, other third parties in the United States or countries other than your country of residence.
As a result, where the Personal and Other Data that we collect is transferred to and processed in the United States or anywhere else outside the European Economic Area (EEA) for the purposes described above, we will take steps to ensure that the information receives the same level of protection as if it remained within the EEA, including entering into data transfer agreements, using the EU Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses, or relying on certification schemes such as the EU-US Privacy Shield.
You may have a right to details of the mechanisms under which your data is transferred outside the EEA.</p>
Personal Data quality
<p>Vanguard relies on the accuracy of the information provided by its clients and others.
We take reasonable efforts to ensure that Personal Data collected by us or on our behalf is accurate, up to date, and complete, in accordance with applicable law.
If any information about you changes or you have any concerns regarding the accuracy of information about you held by Vanguard, you should contact us at the address provided in the Contact us section below.</p>
Information security and retention
<p>We use commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your Personal Data from loss, misuse, and unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction in accordance with applicable law.
Please be aware that despite our best efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security all of the time.
If you have online account access, we recommend that you take steps to protect against unauthorised access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your user name and password private.
For additional information, see our Online Security Policy.</p>

<li>to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject.</li>

or</li>
<li>for the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims.</li>
</ul>
Right to restrict the processing of your Personal Data
<p>You can ask us to restrict your Personal Data, but only where:</p>
<ul>
<li>its accuracy is contested, to allow us to verify its accuracy.
or</li>
<li>the processing is unlawful, but you do not want it erased.
or</li>

</ul>
<p>We can continue to use your Personal Data following a request for restriction:</p>
<ul>
<li>where we have your consent.
or</li>
<li>to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.
or</li>
<li>to protect the rights of another natural or legal person.</li>

and</li>
<li>the processing is carried out by automated means.</li>
</ul>
Right to object to the processing of your Personal Data
<p>You can object to any processing of your Personal Data which has our legitimate interests as its legal basis, if you believe your fundamental rights and freedoms outweigh our legitimate interests.</p>
<p>If you raise an objection, we have an opportunity to demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate interests which override your rights and freedoms.</p>
Right to object to how we use your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes
<p>You can request that we change the manner in which we contact you for marketing purposes.</p>
<p>You can request that we not transfer your Personal Data to unaffiliated third parties for the purposes of direct marketing or any other purposes.</p>

<p>We may ask you for additional information to confirm your identity and for security purposes, before disclosing the Personal Data requested to you.
We reserve the right to charge a fee where permitted by law, for instance if your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.</p>
<p>Subject to legal and other permissible considerations, we will make every reasonable effort to honour your request promptly or inform you if we require further information in order to fulfil your request.&nbsp.
We may not always be able to fully address your request, for example if it would impact the duty of confidentiality we owe to others, or if we are legally entitled to deal with the request in a different way.</p>
