<p>Email: privacy@segment.com</p>Important Information for California Residents<p>This section applies only to California residents.
It describes how we collect, use and share Personal Information of California residents in operating our business, and their rights with respect to that Personal Information.
For purposes of this section, “<b>Personal Information</b>” has the meaning given in the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“<b>CCPA</b>”) but does not include information exempted from the scope of the CCPA.</p>Your California privacy rights.<p>You have the rights listed below.
However, these rights are not absolute, and in certain cases we may decline your request as permitted by law.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<b>Information.</b> You can request the following information about how we have collected and used your Personal Information during the past 12 months:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The categories of Personal Information that we have collected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The categories of sources from which we collected Personal Information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The business or commercial purpose for collecting and/or selling Personal Information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The categories of third parties with whom we share Personal Information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether we have disclosed your Personal Information for a business purpose, and if so, the categories of Personal Information received by each category of third party recipient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether we’ve sold your Personal Information, and if so, the categories of Personal Information received by each category of third party recipient.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Access</b>.
You can request a copy of the Personal Information that we have collected about you during the past 12 months.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Deletion.</b> You can ask us to delete the Personal Information that we have collected from you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Nondiscrimination.</b> You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination.
This means that we will not penalize you for exercising your rights by taking actions such as denying you services.
increasing the price/rate of services.
decreasing service quality.
or suggesting that we may penalize you as described above for exercising your rights.</p>
</li>
</ul>How to exercise your information, access and deletion rights.<p>You may submit a request to exercise your information, access or deletion rights by visiting emailing privacy@segment.com or emailing us toll-free at (866) 538-5962.
We will need to verify your identity to process your information, access and deletion requests and we reserve the right to confirm your California residency.
Government identification may be required.
If you wish to designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf, we will need to verify both your and your agent’s identities and your agent must provide valid power of attorney or other proof of authority acceptable to us in our reasonable discretion.
We cannot process your request if you do not provide us with sufficient detail to allow us to understand and respond to it.
In certain cases, we may be required or permitted by law to deny your request.</p>We do not sell your personal information.<p>Based on our current understanding of the CCPA, we do not “sell” your personal information as defined in the CCPA.
However, like many companies online, Segment uses services provided by Google, Facebook and other advertising companies that track website visitor activity to help deliver interest-based ads to those visitors.
We describe this in more detail in the section above entitled Interest-based advertising.
Use of these services may constitute a “sale” of Personal Information under the CCPA where the user has not opted into the tracking.
We no longer permit these services to track your use of the Site for interest-based advertising unless you opt-in, and you can always opt-out in our Website Data Collection Preferences center.
