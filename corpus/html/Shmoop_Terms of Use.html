</strong>
</p> I.
Agreement <p>Welcome to Shmoop! We know...reading the fine print isn't as fun as reading Shmoop's sparkling analysis about "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds," but please read through these carefully.</p>
<p>This Terms of Use (this “Agreement”) constitutes a legally binding contract between Shmoop University, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Shmoop,” “we,” “us,” “our”), and you (“User,” “you,” or “your”) with respect to your use of our website at www.shmoop.com (the “Site”) and the services, products, and software we offer through the Site (collectively, the “Services”).</p>
<p>IF YOU ACCESS AND USE THE SITE OR THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.
IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SITE OR ANY OF THE SERVICES.</p> II.
Updates and Revisions <p>From time to time, Shmoop may need to update or revise this Agreement.
This may include revisions to reflect changes in our Services, changes in the law, or changes in our pricing and other terms.
We will call these “Modifications.” We will notify Users of the Modifications by posting the updated Agreement on our Site and to the email address you provided when registering for the Services.
You agree that your continued use of the Site and Services after such Modifications are posted constitute your acceptance of such changes.
Your sole recourse if you do not agree to the Modifications is to stop using the Site and the Services.</p>
<p>In addition, unless explicitly stated otherwise, all new Shmoop and Shmoop-related products, services, tools, enhancements, and modifications to Shmoop are subject to this Agreement, unless otherwise stated on the Site.</p>
<p>Shmoop reserves the right, at any time, and for any reason, from time to time, to modify, suspend, or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Shmoop Services (or any part thereof) with or without notice.
User acknowledges and agrees that Shmoop is not liable to User or any third party for such suspension, modification, or discontinuance.
Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to obligate Shmoop to maintain and support the Site or Services, or any part or portion thereof, for any specific term.</p> III.

The Site and Services may include written, audio, video, photographic, artistic, and other content and material (collectively, “Shmoop Content”).
We may add, remove, revise, suspend, terminate, or modify any of these Services or Shmoop Content at any time in our sole discretion.
If we add any Services, they will be subject to this Agreement, unless we state otherwise on our Site.</p> IV.

If you are a minor in the jurisdiction where you live, you must have the consent of your parent or legal guardian to use the Site and Services.
If you are under 13 in the United States and under 16 in the European Union, we will need to obtain parental consent before we can let you register and use the Services.</p>
<p>The Shmoop Services are provided from the United States and Shmoop makes no guarantees that its Services or the Shmoop Content is appropriate for use from locations outside the United States.
For those Users using Shmoop outside of the United States, the User is responsible for complying with any local laws in User’s jurisdiction that might impact User’s right to use the Services.
Use of Shmoop in geographic areas in which such use is illegal is prohibited (and we reserve the right to exclude use of the Services from such jurisdictions).
In addition, a User may not use the Site if he or she is a resident of a country embargoed by the United States, or is a foreign person or entity blocked or denied by the United States government.</p>
<p>You must complete a registration form to register for and use the Services.
In connection with the registration or creation of a user account and profile as a Shmoop user, User must provide certain personal information to Shmoop, such as your name and email address.
User affirms that the personal information provided about User is correct, accurate, and true as of the time of registration or creation of the user profile.
User will update personal information on the Shmoop website on a regular basis.</p>
<p>You will also need to create a username and password to access your account.
We call these your “Account Credentials.” User is responsible for keeping the Account Credentials confidential and not sharing them with any other person, except that a parent may share Account Credentials with a child that has created an account through the parent.
Shmoop will not be held responsible for misuse or unauthorized use of User’s Account Credentials.</p>
<p>User may log in to a user account via a third party network, such as a sign-in through your Google account.
If User does so, User hereby authorizes Shmoop to pre-populate the relevant information fields of User’s account and/or to use such third party network credentials to log User into the Site and Services.</p>

Privacy and Security
<p>We collect, use, and disclose certain personal information from Users, including children, as set forth in Shmoop’s Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”).
This information is used to provide the Services to you and your child.
In the case of our Heartbeat tool, we are collecting responses to questions to assess a student’s emotional, academic, and cognitive skills.
In some cases, your or your child’s personal information, such as essays, answers to test questions, and responses to Heartbeat questions, might be shared with others, such as teachers, schools, and school districts if you are using the Shmoop Services through a School &amp.
District Plan (as defined below).</p>
<p>Before using Shmoop Services, Shmoop encourages Users to review the Privacy Policy, which explains Shmoop’s collection and use of personal information.
By using the Site and Services, you are agreeing to the collection and use of your personal information under the Privacy Policy.
Please note that if you are located outside the United States, you agree that your personally identifiable information may be transferred to the United States, which may have less protections or offer less rights than your jurisdiction of residence.</p>
<p>We also follow special procedures when collecting information from children.
For children in the United States that are under the age of 13, we follow the requirements of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”).
If you are a child under 13, you may not register an account for the Site without consent and approval from your legal parent or guardian.
Consistent with COPPA, Shmoop may ask for a User’s age and if we determine a User is under the age of 13, we will ask for a parent or guardian’s email address in order to obtain parental consent before Shmoop collects any personal information from the child.</p>
<p>If you are a resident of the European Union (“EU”), consistent with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), you may not register an account with the Site if you are under 16 without consent and approval from your legal parent or guardian.
We will follow a similar procedure for verifying parental consent for EU Users under 16 to the extent required and permitted under GDPR.</p>
<p>If you, as the User, are a parent or legal guardian of a child under the age of 13 in the United States or 16 in the EU, who you allow to access or use the Site and Services, you hereby give your express consent for that child to use the Site and Services, which includes all the features and functionality pertaining to your registration and subscriptions, including social media/community features.
You represent and warrant that you will not allow a child under the age of 13 (or 16 if you are a resident of the EU) to use the Site or Services if you do not agree to provide such express consent.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that Shmoop may choose, but is not obligated, to make any inquiries, either directly or through third parties, that Shmoop deems necessary to validate your registration information.
Shmoop reserves all rights to take legal actions against anyone who misrepresents personal information or is otherwise untruthful about their identity.
NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SHMOOP CANNOT GUARANTEE THE ACCURACY OF ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY YOU AND SHMOOP IS NOT OBLIGATED TO VERIFY YOUR IDENTIFY OR TO VERIFY THAT A PARENT IDENTIFIED BY YOU DURING REGISTRATION IS YOUR ACTUAL PARENT OR GUARDIAN, EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</p> VII.
Subscriptions, Payments, and Cancellations <br>
<ol>
<li>Subscriptions</li>
</ol>
<p>Users may subscribe to access any of the Services offered through the Site.
Shmoop offers subscriptions for the Services on a paying basis (“Paid Subscription”):</p>
<ul>
<li> Paid Subscriptions: We charge a subscription fee for many of the Services on the Site.
You can pay for these Subscriptions on a monthly or annual basis (“Subscription Term”).
The Subscription Term starts on the date you register for the Service and for monthly subscriptions, ends at the end of each month or for annual subscriptions, ends at the end of the month one year after the initial registration.
we do not pro-rate for partial monthly or annual periods.
For example, if you started a monthly plan on September 15, 2020, the initial Subscription Term would end September 30, 2020.
if you started an annual plan on September 15, 2020, the initial Subscription Term would end on September 30, 2021.
If you register for a Paid Subscription, we will ask you to provide a valid credit card for payment of the subscription fees.
By providing your credit card, you authorize us to charge your credit card the subscription fees on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the plan you selected.
</li>
<li> School &amp.
District Plans: Schools and school districts can contact Shmoop to arrange for a plan to be provided to students and teachers of that school or school district (“School &amp.
District Plans”).
Such plans are negotiated on an individual basis and subject to separate agreements, except that any authorized user under a School &amp.
District Plan must agree to this Agreement in using the Site and Services provided under that plan.
</li>
<li> Authorized Users: Any Paid Subscription may only be accessed by the User who has registered for that subscription and may not be transferred to any other person or User without the written permission of Shmoop, except a parent or legal guardian may allow the child that they have registered to access and use their Shmoop Account and Account Credentials to access the Services.
In the case of School &amp.
District Plans, the school or school district is responsible for designating the authorized Users.
no person may use the Services under a School &amp.
District Plan without first being designated by the school or school district.
The number of authorized Users under any single Subscription may not exceed the number of permitted seats paid under that Subscription (“Maximum Seats”).
If an authorized User breaches this Agreement, Shmoop may terminate that authorized User’s access to the Services.
Any use of the Services by a User not authorized under this Agreement or in excess of Maximum Seats shall constitute a breach of this Agreement, entitling Shmoop to terminate access by that User.
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ol>
<li>Pricing and Payments</li>
</ol>
<p>Except in the case of School &amp.
District Plans, the fees (“Subscription Fee”) for Paid Subscriptions will be set forth on the page where you register for the Paid Subscription.
Shmoop may change the Subscriptions Fee for Paid Subscriptions from time to time, and will communicate any such price changes to User.
Subscription Fee changes for Paid Subscriptions will take effect at the start of the next Subscription Term following the date of the price change.
By continuing to use the Shmoop Service after the Subscription Fee change takes effect, User accepts the new Subscription Fee (e.g., in the case of a monthly plan, the increase will take effect the following month.
in the case of an annual plan, the increase will take effect on the next annual period).
If a User does not agree to the Subscription Fee change, it should cancel the subscriptions on the User’s account before the end of the current Subscription Term.</p>
<p>Our Paid Subscriptions renew automatically and so a User’s payment to Shmoop for Subscription Fees will automatically renew at the end of each applicable Subscription Term, unless the Paid Subscription is cancelled by User through User’s subscription page before the end of the current Subscription Term.
The cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current Subscription Term However, if User cancels User’s payment and/or terminates before the end of the Subscription Term, Shmoop will not refund any Subscription Fees already paid to Shmoop.
Subscription Fees are non-refundable.</p>
<p>User agrees to provide Shmoop with valid, up-to-date, and complete debit/credit card, contact, and billing details to make any payments for Paid Subscriptions.
User further authorizes Shmoop to bill such debit/credit card on activation of the Paid Subscription and on the renewal of each Subscription Term.
If, for any reason, User’s credit/debit card company refuses to pay the amount billed for the Services, User agrees that Shmoop may, at its option, suspend or terminate User’s subscription to the Services and require User to pay the overdue amount by other means acceptable to Shmoop.
Shmoop may charge a fee for reinstatement of suspended or terminated accounts.
User agrees that until its subscription to the Services is properly terminated, it will continue to accrue charges for which it remains responsible, even if it does not use the Services.
In the event legal action is necessary to collect on balances due, User agrees to reimburse Shmoop for all expenses incurred to recover sums due, including attorney fees and other legal expenses.
Unless otherwise expressly stated, all fees are stated in United States dollars.</p> VIII.

User acknowledges and accepts that Shmoop retains the right to deactivate or terminate User profiles or accounts at its discretion for reasons including, but not limited to, inactivity or inappropriate activity.

Dispute Resolution <br>
<ol>
<li>Arbitration</li>
</ol>
<p>The parties shall make a good faith attempt to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement prior to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.
Except for disputes relating to Shmoop’s intellectual property (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents), or if User opts out of this agreement to arbitrate as set forth in subsection D, all claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement and User’s use of the Site shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by JAMS in accordance with either the JAMS Streamlined (for claims under $250,000) or the JAMS Comprehensive (for claims over $250,000) Arbitration Rules and Procedures in effect at the time of filing of the demand for arbitration, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.
The arbitration shall take place in Santa Clara County, California unless otherwise agreed to by the parties.</p>
<p>The arbitrator, and not any court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable.
The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court.
provided, however, that the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies, or awards that conflict with this Agreement.
The arbitrator’s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, Shmoop will pay the additional cost.
User agrees not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person’s account, if Shmoop is a party to the proceeding.
This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
<p>The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.
They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and that the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</p>
<br>
<ol>
<li>Class-Action Waiver</li>
</ol>
<p>The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only, and not as a class action or other representative action.
If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this section is void or unenforceable for any reason, or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</p>
<br>
<ol>
<li>Exception- Litigation of Small-Claims-Court Claims</li>
</ol>
<p>Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction.</p>
<br>
<ol>
<li>30-Day Right to Opt Out</li>
</ol>
<p>User has the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and class-action waiver provisions set forth in this section by sending written notice of User’s decision to opt out to the following address: Shmoop University, Inc., PO Box 15550, Scottsdale, AZ 85267.
The notice must be sent within 30 days of registering to use the Site.
otherwise, you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with this Agreement.
If you opt out of these arbitration provisions, Shmoop also will not be bound by them.
In addition, if you elect to opt out of these arbitration provisions, Shmoop may terminate User’s use of the Site.</p>
<br>
<ol>
<li>Time Limitation on Claims</li>
</ol>
<p>User agrees that any claim User may have arising out of or related to User’s relationship with Shmoop and this Agreement must be filed within one year after such claim arose.
otherwise, User’s claim is permanently barred.</p> XX.
Governing Law <p>TThis Agreement shall be subject and interpreted in accordance with the law of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
IT WILL NOT BE GOVERNED BY THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS.

User consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located in the Northern District of California.</p> XXI.
Severability <p>If any provision in this Agreement is held unenforceable or illegal by an adjudicatory body of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be modified to the extent necessary to render it enforceable without altering its intent, or severed from this Agreement should no modification be possible, and the other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.</p> XXII.
Headings <p>The headings in this Agreement are applied for reference and convenience only, and shall have no meaning or substantive impact on the interpretation of this Agreement.</p> XXIII.
