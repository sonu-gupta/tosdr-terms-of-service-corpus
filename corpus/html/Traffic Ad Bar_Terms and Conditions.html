Refunds and cancelations<ul>

If you cancel a subscription due to us making a change to our terms that materially affects you to your detriment then you will receive a refund for any whole unused months remaining in your subscription period.</li>
<li>16.2 We will assess refund or credit requests on their merits.

<li>16.4 Disputes lodged with payment agents:<br>
<br>If, as a Subscriber, you lodge a dispute with a payment agent, this will result in a freezing of your Traffic Ad Bar subscription and your Traffic Ad Bar account until the dispute raised with the payment agent has been cancelled.
