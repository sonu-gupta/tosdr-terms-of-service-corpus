</i> ðŸŒˆ About Me Good evening, I'm Connor Slade.
I am just some random kid with way too much free time.
Anyway, welcome to my website connorcode.com <em>V6.0.0</em>! <br>
<br> I'm interested in Photography, Software development and <em>some</em> Web development.
My favorite The Best programming language is Rust! Like just look at the cute mascot.
I use it for most of my projects.
In fact, I'm hosting this site with Rust and my dependency free web server framework afire.
<br>
<br> I started my <em>programming journey</em> around 2014 with C++ on the Arduino.
Then I learned how to make basic websites with HTML and CSS, and then how to make it interactive with JavaScript.
After that, I learn Python and eventually started to learn much more including Docker, NodeJS, Nim, Assembly, C#, Java, Kotlin, Ruby, Lua and of course <em>Rust</em>.
It turns out, after getting the fundamentals picking up other languages is not too hard ðŸ™‚.
