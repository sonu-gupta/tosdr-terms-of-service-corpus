<strong>Manage Downloads</strong>.&nbsp.
The BitTorrent Client is a software application on your machine that manages downloads.
The BitTorrent Client downloads files quickly by trading pieces with other users who are also downloading (or have downloaded) the same content.
Your use of the BitTorrent Client to download files will, in turn, enable other BitTorrent Client users (or users of other clients that communicate using the BitTorrent Client protocol, including clients that are unaffiliated with BitTorrent) to download pieces of those files from you.
Although your IP address is associated with your piece of the file, we will not give other users access to any personal information about you.
However, we would encourage you to exercise caution when sharing content to ensure the content you share does not contain personal information about you or others.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<p>We do not track which files you transfer with the BitTorrent Client.
Merely using the BitTorrent Client does not cause a record of which files you transfer to be kept by BitTorrent or BitTorrent on behalf of any third party.</p>
