<br>
</p>
<p>Wise uses small files (known as cookies) to see how you use our site and products.
We put them on your computer when you visit our site, and use them to recognise you and store information in between visits.</p>
<p>With cookies we can give you a better browsing experience, improve the quality of our products, and keep our marketing costs down.
They let us make it easier to log in, and they show us where you might be having trouble with our products.
Without them, we’d have no way to remember anything about you, such as whether you’re logged in.</p>
<p>In this policy, we’ve explained how and why we use cookies, and what each of them do.
We’ve broken them down into four groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Strictly necessary cookies.</strong> We need these cookies to run our website — they let us save your cookie preferences, and keep the site secure.
They’re always on.</li>
<li>
<strong>Cookies that give you a better browsing experience.</strong> These let us tailor the site to your needs, like displaying it in the same language as your web browser.
We’ll sometimes refer to them as functionality cookies.</li>
<li>
<strong>Cookies that help us improve our products.</strong> These let us use tools that show us how you interact with our products — Mixpanel, for example.
They help us find and fix problems for our customers, and they’re also known as analytical or performance cookies.</li>
<li>
<strong>Cookies that keep our marketing costs down.</strong> These improve our marketing — helping us to spend less on sites like Google and Facebook, and more on charging as little as we can.
When our costs go down, so do our prices.
We share this information in aggregate form with third parties, for the purpose of advertising.</li>

<br>

<strong>Google Analytics</strong>The _gat and gat# cookies are installed by Google Universal Analytics to throttle the request rate to limit the collection of data on high traffic sites.
Session1 minuteWe use the _gid cookie to store information on how visitors use a website and helps in creating an analytics report of how the website is doing.
The data includes the number of visitors, where they came from, and the pages visited in an anonymous form.
Persistent1 dayWe use _ga cookie to calculate visitor, session, campaign data and keep track of site usage for the site's analytics report.
It stores information anonymously and assigns a randomly-generated number to identify unique visitors.

<strong>HotJar</strong>We use the _hjid cookie to see your behaviour for our own statistical and monitoring purposes.
<br>
<br> This cookie lets us identify which users have been randomly selected to take part in a sample to monitor those users’ behaviour on our site.
<br>
<br> Hotjar also provides us with a heatmap of the site which allows us to monitor, for example, how far you’ve scrolled down a page and where you may have hovered.
<br>
<br> With session and screen recording, we’re able to get more context for complicated problems — by observing users going through our flows in an uninterrupted manner, in their real life setting.
This helps us identify subconscious thought patterns users have, which helps us pin-point where customers might struggle in our product.
<br>
<br> We set the _hjClosedSurveyInvites cookie once a visitor interacts with a survey invitation modal popup.
We use it to ensure that the same invite does not reappear if it has already been shown.
<br>
<br> We set the _hjDonePolls cookie once a visitor completes a poll using the Feedback Poll widget.
We use it to ensure that the same poll does not reappear if it has already been filled in.
<br>
<br> We set the _hjMinimizedPolls cookie once a visitor minimises a Feedback Poll widget.
We use it to ensure that the widget stays minimised when the visitor navigates through our site.
<br>
<br> We set the _hjDoneTestersWidgets cookie once a visitor submits their information in the Recruit User Testers widget.
We use it to ensure that the same form does not reappear if it has already been filled in.
<br>
<br> We set the _hjIncludedInSample cookie to let Hotjar know whether that visitor is included in the sample, which lets us generate funnels.
<br>
<br> We set the _hjShownFeedbackMessage cookie when a visitor minimizes or completes Incoming Feedback.
We do this so that the form will be minimised immediately if they navigate to another page where it is set to show.
<br>
<br> The _hjRecordingLastActivity cookie should be found in sessionStorage (as opposed to cookies).
This gets updated when a visitor recording starts and when data is sent through the WebSocket (the visitor performs an action that Hotjar records).
<br>
<br> We use the hjTLDTest cookie when the Hotjar script executes and we try to determine the most generic cookie path we should use, instead of the page hostname.
We do this so that cookies can be shared across subdomains (where applicable).
To determine this, we try to store the _hjTLDTest cookie for different URL substring alternatives until it fails.
After this check, the cookie is removed.
<br>
<br> We use the _hjUserAttributesHash cookie as user attributes are sent through the Hotjar Identify API are cached for the duration of the session in order to know when an attribute has changed and needs to be updated.
<br>
<br> The _hjCachedUserAttributes cookie stores User Attributes which are sent through the Hotjar Identify API, whenever the user is not in the sample.
These attributes will only be saved if the user interacts with a Hotjar Feedback tool.

<em>iz_sd_ss</em> and <em>iz_uh_ps</em>
</strong>We use the <em>iz_sd_ss</em> cookie to store data about a visitor in order to make decisions about when to show a survey, like the number of site visits and survey views.
We ask users to complete a survey from time to time in order to help Wise improve its pages and services.
For example, we might ask users whether they could find the information they were looking for, or ask users what products and services they are interested in.
We use survey responses in order to make content on our site more relevant and helpful to the individual user.
We do not study individuals during this process.SessionWe use the <em>iz_uh_ps</em> cookie to store data about a user relating to the number of site visits and survey views, which enables us to make a decision about whether we should undertake a survey about the use of our site.Persistent1 yearInformizelyhttps://www.informizely.com/data-protection
<strong>Mixpanel</strong>The mp_#_mixpanel cookie is an analytical cookie that helps us understand how you move through the website.
This data is shared with Mixpanel in order to help us improve our site.
With it we can measure visits to parts of our site, track the success of flows within our site, understand where the failures or dropoffs are, and measure the success of changes to the site.
As well as referral source information, it contains a randomly assigned number in order to associate events belonging to the same session, and if logged in, the Wise customer number.
It also allows us to determine the customer numbers of a group of users that may have been affected by a fault of our site.
Access to separate internal tools would be needed to query customer information from that customer number.Persistent1 yearMixpanelhttps://mixpanel.com/legal/privacy-policy/

<strong>COOKIES THAT KEEP OUR MARKETING COSTS DOWN</strong>
<strong>Facebook</strong>The fr, _fbp, _tr, AA003 and ATN cookies are used by Facebook to obtain encrypted data about visitors and users of our website for the purposes of measuring advertising effectiveness, showing relevant advertising to certain groups of users and excluding other groups of users from seeing irrelevant advertising.
<br>
<br> For example, if a user registers on wise.com, the cookie will share with Facebook encrypted emails used to register with Wise in the form of a hash.
If you have an account with Facebook, Facebook will be able to identify you as the same user on Facebook that has registered for Wise.
If you don’t have an account, this hash renders useless, and as such ‘new’ information previously unknown to Facebook is not shared with Facebook.
<br>
<br> In this example, we can measure the effectiveness of our Facebook advertising.
It helps us understand how many users have registered with Wise via Facebook.
This is important as it means we can make informed investment decisions about our advertising.
This may help us contribute to our overall mission of reducing prices for customers over time.
<br>
<br> This can also help us prevent advertising irrelevant content to users, e.g.
advertisements encouraging users to sign up to Wise when they have already done so.Persistent3 monthsFacebookhttps://en-gb.facebook.com/policy.php

How to control cookies
<p>The UK Information Commissioner’s Office has provided the following guidance on controlling cookies:</p>
<ul>
<li>A number of websites provide detailed information on cookies, including AboutCookies.org and AllAboutCookies.org.</li>
<li>The European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance website Your Online Choices allows you to install opt-out cookies across different advertising networks.
Google has developed a browser add-on to allow users to opt-out of Google Analytics across all websites which use it.
This is also available in the Chrome web store.</li>
<li>Some browsers include a feature known as ‘Do Not Track’ or DNT.
This allows you to indicate a preference that websites should not track you.
However, whilst DNT is available in many browsers, websites are not required to recognise its request, so it may not always work.
You can get help on how to use DNT in Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and Opera.</li>
<li>For more information on how private browsing works as well as its limitations, visit the support pages for your browser: Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari (IOS mobile and desktop) and Opera.</li>

<p>If you are concerned about online tracking then we can recommend you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install a privacy-friendly browser on your device, such as Mozilla Firefox, Firefox Focus or Brave;</li>
<li>Install anti-tracking and ad-blocking plug-ins on that browser, such as uBlock, Ghostery or PrivacyBadger.
