<strong>C.
INFORMATION 508 SOFTWARE COLLECTS</strong>
<br>
<p>
<strong>
<u>Information 508 Software Collects Through the Website</u>
</strong>
</p>
<br>
<p>The Website does not collect Personal Information from Your computer when You browse the Website and request pages from 508 Software’s servers.
This means that, unless You voluntarily and knowingly provide 508 Software with Personal Information, 508 Software will not know Your name, email address, or any other personally identifiable information.</p>
<br>
<p>When You request a webpage from the 508 Software Website, 508 Software’s servers log the information provided in the HTTP request header, JavaScript or similar technical tools, including the IP address, the time of the request, the URL of the request, and other technical information.
508 Software collects this information in order to make its Website function correctly and to provide You the functionality that You see on the Website, as 508 Software’s servers use this information to deliver the Internet pages You request.
508 Software also uses this information to better understand how visitors use the Website and how 508 Software can better tune its Website, contents, security, and functionality to best meet Your needs.
However, this information is separate from any other personally identifiable information of persons browsing the Website.</p>
<br>
<p>When You use the Website, 508 Software, or trusted authorized third parties, may also collect certain technical and routing information about Your computer (also known as environment variables) to facilitate Your use of the Website and Products enabled thereby.
When You browse the Internet, Your Internet browser (such as Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, or Microsoft Internet Explorer) automatically transmits some information to 508 Software every time You access content on one of 508 Software’s Internet domains.
Examples of such information include the URL of the particular web page You visited, the IP address of the computer You are using, or the browser version that You are using to access the Website.
All of this information may be collected by 508 Software and used to help improve its offerings to You.</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>
<u>User Content</u>
</strong>
</p>
<br>
<p>User Account holders, if and as applicable, may be permitted to upload certain content onto the Website and Products (<i>
<strong>“User Content”</strong>
</i>).
This information shall be private and, except in accordance with the Privacy Policy, will not be disclosed to third parties without Your prior permission.</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>
<u>Providing Your Information to 508 Software</u>
</strong>
</p>
<br>
<p>You never have to provide Personal Information to 508 Software.
However, should You choose to withhold certain required information, 508 Software may not be able to provide You with some or all of the Products.
Some of the information 508 Software asks You to provide may be identified as mandatory or optional.
If You do not provide the mandatory information with respect to a particular activity, You may not be able to engage in that activity or make such a purchase.
508 Software will inform You of the mandatory or optional nature of the requested or required information.</p>
<br>
<p>508 Software is the sole owner of the information it gathers on the Website and Products.
508 Software will only share Your information with outside parties in ways that are described in the Privacy Policy if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law, to cooperate with law enforcement agencies, to comply with a legal process served on 508 Software, or to otherwise comply with any current or future laws and regulations applicable to 508 Software.</p>
<br>
<p>You may be provided an opportunity on the Website to allow 508 Software to contact You from time to time regarding 508 Software news and Product updates.
In order to do so, You may be required to provide certain Personal Information to 508 Software.
508 Software will treat this information in accordance with the policies set forth in the Privacy Policy.</p>
<br>
<p>When You submit Personal Information to 508 Software through the Website, You understand and <strong>
<u>AGREE</u>
</strong> that this information may be transferred across national boundaries and may be stored and processed in any of the countries in which 508 Software and its affiliates and subsidiaries maintain offices.
You also <strong>
<u>ACKNOWLEDGE</u>
</strong> that in certain countries or with respect to certain activities, the collection, transferring, storage, and processing of Your information may be undertaken by trusted affiliates of 508 Software.
508 Software may use affiliates to aid in the facilitation of technical support services that may potentially receive limited access to Your Personal Information.
Though these affiliates may change from time to time, such affiliates are bound by contract to only process information per 508 Software’s instruction, to provide appropriate measures to protect Personal Information against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss alteration, and unauthorized disclosure or access, to assist 508 Software in responding to individuals exercising their rights under the Framework, and for understanding on whether onward transfers of data is allowed.</p>
<br>
<p>508 Software may establish relationships with various service providers whose services may become available to You from the Website or from other websites linked therewith.
Typically, these providers would offer services that 508 Software customers might find useful, such as those that can be used in conjunction with the Website or Products.
In order to use these other-website services, You may be required to provide Personal Information to such services providers.
Unless expressly provided to the contrary, Personal Information that You provide while You are visiting a provider's website will be subject to the privacy policy posted on such website.
additionally, Personal Information that You provide while on the 508 Software Website in conjunction with a provider’s service may also be subject to that service provider’s Privacy Policy.
For example, credit card information entered while populating a purchase form or registration process on the Website is collected by a third-party registration service and subject to their respective privacy policy, and not 508 Software.
You should be aware that 508 Software’s agreements with these service providers often provide that they will share with 508 Software Personal Information collected from You.
In such instances, 508 Software may use this information in a manner consistent with the Privacy Policy.</p>
<br>
<p>Payoneer, PayPal, Tipalti, 2Checkout, and any other third-party payment service providers designated by 508 Software are responsible for payment information You provide 508 Software, which will be subject to their respective privacy policies, such as:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Payoneer Privacy Policy</li>
<li>PayPal Privacy Policy</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Tipalti Privacy Policy</li>
<li>2Checkout Privacy Policy</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>508 Software may also use third-party platforms to sell its Products, such as Amazon, cleverbridge, Digital River, eBay, StackSocial and other third-party platforms authorized by 508 Software to offer its Products.
These third-party platforms may change from time to time, however, regardless of the platform 508 Software chooses to offer its Products through, the safety of Your Personal Information will be paramount and handled in accordance with the Privacy Policy.</p>

<strong>
<u>Information Relating to Children (COPPA)</u>
</strong>
</p>
<br>
<p>The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) was passed by the U.S.
Congress in November 1998.
COPPA provides parents with specific rights regarding their children's privacy.
For additional information and resources on COPPA, please visit the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) website.
The 508 Software Website and any Products available therewith are not directed at children under 13 years of age and, therefore, COPPA does not apply.
However, 508 Software recognizes that children under the age of 13 may potentially access the Website and subscribe to the newsletter, purchase software and Products, or download software programs.
Parents and Legal Guardians may request 508 Software to review, delete or stop the collection of any personally identifiable information of their child(ren).
You may do so by contacting 508 Software by email at help@cleverfiles.com.</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>
<u>Cookies and Web Beacons</u>
</strong>
</p>
<br>
<p>The Website uses “cookie” and “web beacon” technology.
“Cookies” are short pieces of data generated by a web server that a website stores on a user’s computer.
Certain pages on 508 Software’s Website may require the use of a cookie for purposes of keeping information You enter on multiple pages together.
Cookies also enable 508 Software to customize the Website and offerings to Your needs and provide You with a better online experience with 508 Software.
In addition, cookies are used to:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Measure usage of various pages on 508 Software’s Website to help make 508 Software’s information more pertinent to Your needs and easier for You to access;</li>
<li>Identify and categorize the Internet webpages from which a visitor came to the Website and in order to observe browsing patterns.
and</li>
<li>Provide functionality such as online orders, 508 Software Products, and other functionalities that 508 Software believes would be of interest and value to You.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>The types of cookies that 508 Software uses are referred to as “session” cookies and “persistent” cookies.
Session cookies are temporary and are automatically deleted once You leave the Website.
Persistent cookies remain on Your computer hard drive until You delete them.
508 Software does not use cookies to gather information concerning Your visits to other websites, nor ascertain any Personal Information about You apart from what You voluntarily provide in your dealings with 508 Software.
Cookies do not, under ordinary circumstances, corrupt or damage Your computer, programs, or computer files.</p>
<br>
<p>In addition, any service providers 508 Software may use to serve and host advertisements may use session or persistent cookies to track the number of times the Website is accessed and whether the Website was accessed via an ad.
There are no automatically-placed cookies within these ads, a cookie is placed on Your computer only if and when You click on an advertisement.
The cookie generated from the advertisement does not contain any personally identifiable information and will remain on Your hard drive until You delete it.
Furthermore, 508 Software may use email tracking services in order to receive read receipts and related information when sending emails, however, these services are used by 508 Software for these reasons and not to collect any Personal Information about You.</p>
<br>
<p>You may set your browser to block cookies (consult the instructions for Your particular browser on how to do this), although doing so may adversely affect Your ability to perform certain transactions, use certain functionalities, and access certain content on the 508 Software Website.</p>
<br>
<p>Web beacons are used in combination with cookies to help website operators understand how visitors interact with their websites.
A web beacon is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1-pixel x 1-pixel) that is placed on a website.
As opposed to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
These web beacons are not tied to personally identifiable information.
The use of web beacons allows a website to measure the actions of the visitor opening the page that contains the web beacon.
It makes it easier to follow and record the activities of a recognized browser, such as the path of pages visited on a website.
508 Software uses the information provided by web beacons to develop a better understanding of how the Website’s visitors use the Website, and to facilitate those visitors' interactions with the Website.
508 Software may make the aggregate data obtained from web analytics (including from its third-party analytics providers, if applicable) publicly available.
If this data is made publicly available, none of the information will be personally identifying information or potentially-personally identifying information.</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>
<u>Targeting Cookies</u>

</p>
<br>
<p>508 Software may use targeting cookies to record Your Website visits, the pages You viewed and the hyperlinks You followed.

<br>
<p>508 Software’s trusted advertising affiliates help it place advertisements on and off the Website and perform analytics.

<br>
<p>508 Software may partner with third-party advertisers to provide information about the third-party’s goods and services that may be of interest to You.
These third-party advertisers may use cookies and/or web beacons or other tracking technologies to collect information about You when You use the Website.
They may collect information about Your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services.

508 Software security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary, and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by 508 Software users.
508 Software takes steps to ensure that Your Personal Information is treated securely and in accordance with the Privacy Policy.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed secure.
As a result, while 508 Software strives to protect Your Personal Information, it cannot guarantee the security of any information You transmit to 508 Software or from the Website or Products.
Your use of the Website and Products is at Your own risk.</p>
<br>
<p>508 Software treats the information You provide to 508 Software as confidential information.
which is, accordingly, subject to 508 Software’s company security procedures and corporate policies regarding protection and use of confidential information.
After personally identifiable information reaches 508 Software it is stored on a server with physical and electronic security features as customary in the industry, including utilization of login/password procedures and electronic firewalls designed to block unauthorized access outside of 508 Software.
Because laws applicable to Personal Information vary by country, 508 Software offices or other business operations may put in place additional measures that vary depending on the applicable legal requirements.
Information collected on the sites covered by the Privacy Policy is processed and stored in the U.S.
and possibly other jurisdictions and also in other countries where 508 Software and its service providers conduct business.
All 508 Software affiliates, agents, and employees are aware of 508 Software privacy and security policies and are required by 508 Software to abide by these policies.
Your information is only accessible to the affiliates, agents, and employees who need it in order to perform their specific jobs.</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>
<u>Change of Control</u>
</strong>
</p>
<br>
<p>In the event that all or substantially all of 508 Software’s stock and/or all or substantially all assets are transferred or sold to another entity, 508 Software may transfer personally identifiable information to the acquiring entity.
If, as a result of such a business transition, Your Personal Information will be used in a materially different manner, You will be given notice as to these different manners and the opportunity to re-consent or object to such material new purposes.</p>

<strong>E.
DATA CHOICES AVAILABLE TO YOU</strong>
<br>
<p>
<strong>
<u>Opt-In and Disclosure</u>
</strong>
</p>
<br>
<p>You may always choose whether or not to disclose Personal Information and that choice will not prevent You from using the Website and having limited access to the Website and Products.
Please note, however, if You should choose to withhold certain requested information, 508 Software may not be able to provide You with some or all of the Products dependent upon the collection of this information.
You will be given an opportunity to “opt-in” and select Your preference choices for any items that are optional and which are not prerequisite for 508 Software rendering of services.</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>
<u>Opt-Out Options</u>
</strong>
</p>
<br>
<p>You can choose at any time to opt-out of receiving emails from 508 Software by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any email You receive from 508 Software or by contacting 508 Software directly at help@cleverfiles.com.
If You elect to opt-out, 508 Software will not, as applicable, share Your Personal Information with third parties or send You emails.

<strong>
<u>Registration Email and Contact by 508 Software</u>
</strong>
</p>
<br>
<p>508 Software reserves the right to send a one-time registration or payment confirmation email, and infrequent service alert messages to users to inform them of specific changes that may impact their ability to use Products or a service that they have previously signed up for, purchased, or used, regardless of email contact opt-in status.
508 Software also reserves the right to contact You if compelled to do so as part of a legal proceeding or if there has been a violation of any applicable licensing, warranty, or purchase agreements.
508 Software is retaining this right because in limited cases 508 Software feels that it may need to contact You as a matter of law or regarding matters that will be important to You.
This does not allow 508 Software to contact You to market a new or existing Products if You have asked 508 Software not to do so, and issuance of these types of communications are rare.</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>
<u>User Account Preferences</u>
</strong>

<br>
<p>If and as applicable, when You create a User Account with 508 Software and/or provide Your email address and other personal identification information, subject to Your personal preferences, You <strong>
<u>CONSENT</u>
</strong> to allowing 508 Software to periodically contact You via email and provide information about special offers and promotions that may be of interest to You.
These communications will relate to 508 Software offers and/or the promotions of select, reputable third parties with whom 508 Software has a strategic marketing relationship because they offer products or services that 508 Software believes would be of interest to You.
508 Software may use a third-party email service provider to send emails to You.
This service provider is prohibited from using Your email address for any purpose other than to send 508 Software-related emails.
If You do not wish to receive emails with updates and information please unsubscribe by sending an email to help@cleverfiles.com.
In addition, every time You receive an email, You will be provided the choice to opt-out of future emails by following the “unsubscribe” (or similar) instructions provided in the email.
You may also opt-out online by updating Your User Account as described under the subheading “User Account” in <u>Section C</u>, above.</p>
<br>
<p>To ensure that Your request is honored, You must provide 508 Software with information sufficient for 508 Software to accurately identify and access Your records.
The information 508 Software requires is Your full name, address, telephone number, and/or the email address You provided to 508 Software when You requested the pertinent Products.
The information requested, or any other information per each individual case, is viewed as sufficient for 508 Software to ensure You are who You proclaim to be.
508 Software reserves the right to contact You to verify that it has accurately identified Your record.</p>

RIGHTS OF EUROPEAN USERS UNDER THE GDPR</strong>

<br>
<p>508 Software complies with the principles of <i>Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation)</i> (GDPR).
If You are a natural person of the EU within the meaning of the GDPR (<strong>
<i>“Qualified Individual”</i>
</strong>), You are afforded certain additional rights by the GDPR as further described within this Section.</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>
<u>Data Controller</u>
</strong>
</p>
<br>
<p>If and when 508 Software receives Your Personal Information directly from You via its Website or Products, it performs the functions of a ‘data controller’, as defined by the GDPR, and has the ability to determine how personal information is collected, for what purposes, and how this data is to be processed.
As the data controller, 508 Software has implemented many technical and operational measures to ensure the most complete protection of Personal Information processed through its Website and Products.</p>

<br>
<p>
<strong>
<u>Legal Basis for Processing</u>
</strong>
</p>
<br>
<p>Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which 508 Software obtains consent for a particular purpose.
If the processing of Personal Information is necessary for the performance of a contract to which You are a party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for a particular Product, the processing is based on Art.
6(1)(b).
The same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries or functionality reviews concerning 508 Software Products or services.
If 508 Software is subject to a legal obligation by which processing of Personal Information is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art.
6(1)(c).
If the processing of Personal Information is necessary to protect Your vital interests or that of another Qualified Individual, then the processing is based on Art.
6(1)(d).
Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1)(f) if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by 508 Software or by a third party, except where such interests are prohibited or overridden by Your fundamental rights and freedoms under the GDPR.</p>
