         Refund Policy <p>At Pexgle, we offer a 7-day money back guarantee.
If you sign up for Pexgle and find that it’s not a perfect fit, please send a cancellation request by email to&nbsp;support@pexgle.com&nbsp;from the registered email address</p>
<p>A cancellation means that no future payments are charged to the customer’s account.
The cancellation of a recurring billing product does not generate a refund – it will only stop any future payments.</p>
<p>To cancel your subscription, we will need the following information: your billing information (name, transaction ID, etc.), email address, login name, and a brief comment explaining if you would like a refund.</p>
<p>If your cancellation request comes from the email address other than registered email address we will ask you additional information including but not limited to: registered email, last 4 digits of the credit card associated with the account, billing date etc.</p>
<p>We will refund your money if a request is made within 7 days after your billing date.</p>
<p>Your refund request will typically be processed within 10 days of receiving it.
The refund for the net price of your claim will be processed through the same method as the original payment.</p>
<p>Customers requesting serial or repeated returns may be blocked from making further purchases using the Pexgle services.</p>
