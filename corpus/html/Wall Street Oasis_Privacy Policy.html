<p>We may collect information using "cookies." Cookies are small data files stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website.
We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site.</p>
<p>We use two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which we use to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Site.
and (2) third party cookies, which are served by service providers on our Site, and can be used by such service providers to recognise your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites.</p>Cookies we use<p>Our Site uses the following types of cookies for the purposes set out below:</p>Essential Cookies<p>These cookies are essential to provide you with services available through our Site and to enable you to use some of its features.
Without these cookies, the services that you have asked for cannot be provided, and we only use these cookies to provide you with those services.</p>Analytics and Performance Cookies<p>These cookies are used to collect information about traffic to our Site and how users use our Site.
The information gathered may include the number of visitors to our Site, the websites that referred them to our Site, the pages they visited on our Site, what time of day they visited our Site, whether they have visited our Site before, and other similar information.
We use this information to help operate our Site more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information and to monitor the level of activity on our Site.</p>
<p>We use Google Analytics for this purpose.
Google Analytics uses its own cookies.
It is only used to improve how our Site works.
You can find out more information about Google Analytics cookies here and about how Google protects your data here.</p>Social Media Cookies<p>These cookies are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or "like" button on our Site, visit a specific page or you link your account or engage with our content on or through a social networking website such as Facebook or Twitter.
