<dt>Automated Information Collection</dt>
<dd>

If we are able to identify you as a Target Guest we may, for example, link your activity on our website to your activity in a Target store or on one of our mobile applications.
This allows us to provide you with a personalized experience regardless of how you interact with us – online, in store, mobile, etc.
</p>
<p>In order to provide the best Guest experience possible, we also use automated information collection technologies for reporting and analysis purposes.
We examine metrics such as how you are shopping on our website, in our stores, and on our mobile applications, the performance of our marketing efforts, and your response to those marketing efforts.
</p>
<p>
<b>Third-party automated collection</b>
</p>
<p>We and our service providers use anonymous identifiers such as cookies and other technologies to collect and store certain types of information (e.g.
click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over, hardware/software information, cookie and session ID) whenever you interact with us or third-parties that use our services.
</p>

<dd>
<p>The help function of your browser should contain instructions on how to set your device to accept all cookies, to notify you when a cookie is issued or to not receive cookies at any time.
If you set your device to not receive cookies at any time, certain personalized services cannot be provided to you, and accordingly, you may not be able to take full advantage of all of our features.
</p>
<p>To opt-out of the vendors we use for cross-device linking, go to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Choices page at www.aboutads.info/choices and perform a global opt-out on each browser and device that you would like to be opted out on.
Opting out in this manner means that the browser on the device from which you opt-out will no longer receive information collected on devices linked to it, that devices linked to it will not receive information collected from the opted-out device, and that the vendor will not transfer information collected from the opted-out device to a third party.
Please note that this will not opt you out of cross-device linking or advertising across linked devices based solely on your visits to Target websites or apps, or your interaction with advertisements for Target delivered by Target.
</p>
