Applicable Law.
</strong>If you and Vercel cannot resolve a Claim, within sixty (60) days of the receipt of the notice, then you agrees that that any such Claim and all other disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration relating to your use of the Services, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court.
The FAA, not state law, shall govern the arbitrability of such disputes, including the class action waiver below.
However, you and Vercel agree that California state law or United States federal law shall apply to, and govern, as appropriate, any and all Claims or disputes arising between you and Vercel regarding this Agreement and the Services, whether arising or stated in contract, statute, common law, or any other legal theory, without regard to choice of law principles.

However, an arbitrator must follow the terms of this Agreement as a court would.
THIS SECTION, INCLUDING THE PROVISIONS ON BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER, SHALL SURVIVE ANY TERMINATION OF YOUR ACCOUNT OR THE SERVICE.</small>

You or Vercel may also seek relief in small claims court for Claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction.
In the event that the arbitration provisions above are found not to apply to you or to a particular Claim, either as a result of your decision to opt-out of the arbitration provisions or as a result of a decision by the arbitrator or a court order, you agree that the venue for any such Claim or dispute is exclusively that of a state or federal court located in San Francisco County, California.
You and Vercel agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within San Francisco County, California for the purpose of litigating all such Claims or any other disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement or your use of the Services in the event that the arbitration provisions are found not to apply.
In such a case, should Vercel prevail in litigation against you to enforce its rights under this Agreement, Vercel shall be entitled to its costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys' fees (whether incurred at or in preparation for trial, appeal or otherwise) incurred in resolving or settling the dispute, in addition to all other damages or awards to which Vercel may be entitled.</small>
