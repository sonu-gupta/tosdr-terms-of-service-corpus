</p>
<p>EOM Commerce Inc.
and its affiliates (collectively, the “<b>Company</b>”) is committed to protecting your privacy.
We have prepared this Privacy Policy to describe to you our practices regarding the personal information we collect from users of our websites and applications that link to this Privacy Policy, including tanga.com, bellechic.com, and lolshirts.com (each, a “<b>Site</b>” and collectively, the “<b>Sites</b>”), our mobile applications (each, an “<b>Application</b>”), and our online services (the “<b>Services</b>”, which term includes Site and Application).</p>

<p>
<b>Questions.

Alma School #250<br> Chandler, AZ 85224<br> (435) 688-9595 </p>
</li>
<li>
<b>A Note About Children.</b> We do not intentionally gather personal information from visitors who are under the age of 13.
If a child under 13 submits personal information to the Company and we learn that the personal information is the information of a child under 13, we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible.
If you believe that we might have any personal information from a child under 13, please contact us at: www.tanga.com/support.</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Types of Data We Collect.</b> We collect personal information from users, as described below.</p>
<p>
<b>(a) Information You Provide to Us.</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>We may collect personal information from you, such as your first and last name, e-mail, phone number, username and password when you create an account to log in to our Services (“<b>Account</b>”).</li>
<li>We will collect payment information necessary to complete transactions, including your name, credit card information, shipping information and billing information.</li>
<li>We collect your birthdate in order to send you special offers and customized product recommendations on your birthday.</li>
<li>If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply.</li>
<li>If you sign up for our newsletter we will collect your email address.</li>
<li>When you participate in any quiz or survey on our Services, we will collect your answers and add it to your profile.</li>
<li>If you participate in a sweepstakes, contest or other promotion on our Services, we may ask you for your e-mail address and/or home number (to notify you if you win or not).
We may also ask for first and last name, and sometimes postal address to verify your identity.
In some situations, we may need additional information as a part of the entry process, such as a prize selection choice.
These sweepstakes and contests are voluntary.
We recommend that you read the rules for each sweepstakes and contest that you enter.</li>
<li>We also collect personal information at other points in our Services that state that personal information is being collected.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>(b) Information Collected via Technology.</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<u>Log Files.</u> As is true of most websites and mobile applications, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.
This information includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (“<b>ISP</b>”), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.
We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Services, track users’ movements around the Site or Application, gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor our Services to our users’ needs.</li>
<li>
<u>Mobile Services.</u> We may also collect non-personal information from your mobile device if you have downloaded any of our Applications.
For example, in the event our Applications crash on your mobile device, we will receive information about your mobile device model software version and device carrier, which allows us to identify and fix bugs and otherwise improve the performance of our Applications.</li>
<li>
<u>Cookies.</u> Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information.
“<b>Cookies</b>” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the Site.
We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Services.
This type of information is collected to make the Services more useful to you, to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs, and to deliver advertising tailored to your interests.</li>
<li>
<u>Pixel Tags.</u> In addition, we use “<b>Pixel Tags</b>” (also referred to as clear Gifs, Web beacons, or Web bugs).
Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to Cookies that are used to track online movements of Web users.
In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in Web pages.
Pixel Tags also allow us to send e-mail messages in a format users can read, and they tell us whether e-mails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users.
We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user.</li>
<li>
<u>Collection of Data by Advertisers.</u> We may also use third parties to serve ads on the Services.
Certain third parties may automatically collect information about your access to our Services, your IP address, your ISP, the browser you use to visit our Site (but not your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number).
They do this by using Cookies, Pixel Tags, or other technologies.
Information collected may be used, among other things, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests and to better understand the usage and visitation of our Services and the other sites tracked by these third parties.
This policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, Cookies or Pixel Tags in third party ads, and we encourage you to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of Cookies and other technologies.
If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here: http://www.aboutads.info/choices.</li>
<li>
<u>Traffic Analytics.</u> We use a number of third party service providers, such as Google Analytics, to help analyze how users use the Services (“<b>Analytics Companies</b>”).
These Analytics Companies uses Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Services, what features they use on our Applications, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Site.
We use the information we get from these Analytics Companies to improve our Site, Applications and Services.
These Analytics Companies collect the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Services, rather than your name or other personally identifying information.
We do not combine the information generated through the use of our Analytics Companies with your personal information.
Although these Analytics Companies may place a persistent Cookie on your web browser or mobile device to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Services, the Cookie cannot be used by anyone but the Analytics Company that placed the applicable Cookie.
This Policy does not apply to and we are not responsible for the Cookies used by these Analytics Companies.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>(c) Information Collected via Social Networking Sites.</b> The Services may allow you to log in through social networking sites, such as Facebook and Google Plus (each an “SNS”).
By logging in to the Services through an SNS, you consent to our collection of information from the SNS.
Any information that we collect from an SNS may depend on your then-current SNS privacy settings, so please consult the SNS’ privacy and data practices and edit privacy settings in the SNS if you choose.</p>
