Definitions
<p>‘NONPERSONAL DATA’ (NPD) is information that is in no way personally identifiable.</p>
<p>‘PERSONAL DATA’ (PD) means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’).
an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified directly or indirectly by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that natural person.
PD is in many ways the same as Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
However, PD is broader in scope and covers more data.
(GDPR) means General Data Protection Regulation.
<b>Even though the definition of personal data is broad, we only collect your first name, last name and email address to use the product.
However, if you buy from our website we may be provided with additional information by the payment processor.
All your secured data like logins, credit cards or any kind of data that you store in our platform is stored locally and is never sent to our servers encrypted or unencrypted.</b>
