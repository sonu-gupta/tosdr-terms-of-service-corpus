<p>Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy</p>
<p>Notice and Takedown Procedure</p>
<p>
It is our policy to expeditiously respond to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).
This page describes the information that should be present in these notices.
It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to TVTropes.org ("TVTropes") as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify.
The form of notice specified below is consistent with the form suggested by the DMCA (the text of which can be found at the U.S.
Copyright Office Web Site, http://www.copyright.gov), but we will respond to notices of this form from other jurisdictions as well.
</p>
<p>
It is expected that all users of any part of TVTropes will comply with applicable copyright laws.
However, if TVTropes receives proper notification of claimed copyright infringement, our response to these notices will include removing or disabling access to material claimed to be the subject of infringing activity and/or terminating subscribers, regardless of whether we may be liable for such infringement under United States law or the laws of another jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>
If we remove or disable access in response to such a notice, we will make a good-faith attempt to contact the owner or administrator of the affected site or content so that they may make a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA.
We may also document notices of alleged infringement on which we act.
