&nbsp;We typically collect this information through a variety of tracking technologies, including cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, file information, and similar technology (collectively, "<strong>tracking technologies</strong>").</p>
<p>We, and our third-party partners, use tracking technologies to automatically collect usage and device information, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information about your device and its software, such as your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, device type/model/manufacturer, operating system, date and time stamp, and a unique ID that allows us to uniquely identify your browser or your account (including, for example, a persistent device identifier), and other such information.</li>

Data Retention and Security#<p>We will retain your personal information for the length of time needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
We store data on servers in the U.S.
or any other country in which Supabase or its affiliates, subsidiaries, agents or contractors maintain facilities.
If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S.
law, please note that your personal information may be transferred to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction.
When you register for use with Supabase you have the option of where you store your information and we will not transfer it without providing information to you in advance.</p>
<p>Supabase cares about the security of your information and uses commercially reasonable physical, technical and organizational measures designed to preserve the integrity and security of all information we collect.
However, no security system is impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the security of our systems 100%.
In the event that any information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and where appropriate, notify those individuals whose information may have been compromised and take other steps, in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations.</p>6.
Links to Third-Party Websites and Services#<p>For your convenience, our Site may provide links to third-party websites or services that we do not own or operate.
We are not responsible for the practices employed by any websites or services linked to or from the services, including the information or content contained within them.
Your browsing and interaction on any other website or service are subject to the applicable third party’s rules and policies, not ours.
If you are using a third-party website or service, you do so at your own risk.
We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any site or service before providing any personal information.</p>7.
Children’s Privacy#<p>Our services are not intended for children under the age of 13.
We do not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from children under the age of 13.

<p>This Privacy Notice was last modified on 27th March 2021</p>Privacy disclosures for the European economic area, United Kingdom, and Switzerland.#<p>While we are primarily based in the United States, Supabase maintains operations in Europe and may direct our services to individuals located in the European Economic Area ("<strong>
<em>EEA</em>
</strong>"), United Kingdom and Switzerland, including through our Site supabase.io (collectively, our "<strong>
<em>European Services</em>
</strong>").
The following disclosures ("<strong>
<em>Privacy Disclosures</em>
</strong>") apply to our processing of personal data in connection with our European Services.</p>
<p>Supabase, Inc.
is the data controller responsible for the processing of personal data in connection with our European Services.
This means that we determine and are responsible for how your personal information is used.</p>
<p>
<strong>Personal Data:</strong> When we use the term "personal data" in this section, we mean information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.</p>1.
Personal data we collect from you when you use the Supabase European Services, and how we use it.#<p>We collect the categories of personal data that you voluntarily submit directly to us when you use the European Services, as set forth in our Privacy Notice under the section entitled <strong>Information We Collect and Our Use</strong>.
The table at <strong>Annex 1</strong> sets out in detail the categories of personal data we collect about you and how we use that information when you use the European Services, as well as the legal basis which we rely on to process the personal information and recipients of that personal information.</p>2.
Information we collect about you automatically.#<p>We also automatically collect personal information indirectly about how you access and use the European Services, and information about the device you use to access the European Services.
For example, we may collect:</p>
<p>(a) information about the features you use and the pages you view on the European Services;</p>
<p>(b) information about your device (such as your IP address, device identifier, device type, model and manufacturer).
and</p>
<p>(c) information about your usage patterns (such as how often you use the Supabase European Services and your language settings).</p>
<p>We use this information to provide you the features and functionality of the European Services, to monitor and improve the European Services and to develop new services.</p>
<p>The table at <strong>Annex 2</strong> sets out further information about the categories of personal information we collect about you automatically and how we use that information.
The table also lists the legal basis which we rely on to process the personal information and recipients of that personal information.</p>
<p>We may link or combine the personal information we collect about you and the information we collect automatically.</p>
<p>We may anonymise and aggregate any of the personal information we collect (so that it does not directly identify you).
We may use anonymised information for purposes that include testing our IT systems, research, data analysis, improving the Supabase European Services.
We may also share such anonymised and aggregated information with others.</p>3.
How long will we store your personal information#<p>We will usually store the personal information we collect about you for no longer than necessary for the purposes set out in Annex 1 and Annex 2, in accordance with our legal obligations and legitimate business interests.</p>
<p>The criteria used to determine the period for which personal information about you will be retained varies depending on the legal basis under which we process the personal information:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong> Where we are processing personal information based on our legitimate interests, we generally will retain such information for a reasonable period of time based on the particular interest, taking into account the fundamental interests and the rights and freedoms of data subjects.</li>
<li>
<strong>Consent.</strong> Where we are processing personal information based on your consent, we generally will retain the information until you withdraw your consent, or otherwise for the period of time necessary to fulfill the underlying agreement with you or provide you with the applicable service for which we process that personal information.</li>
<li>
<strong>Contract.</strong> Where we are processing personal information based on contract, we generally will retain the information for the duration of the contract plus some additional limited period of time that is necessary to comply with law or that represents the statute of limitations for legal claims that could arise from the contractual relationship.</li>
<li>
<strong>Legal Obligation.</strong> Where we are processing personal information based on a legal obligation, we generally will retain the information for the period of time necessary to fulfill the legal obligation.</li>
<li>
<strong>Legal Claim.</strong> We may need to apply a "legal hold" that retains information beyond our typical retention period where we face threat of legal claim.&nbsp.
In that case, we will retain the information until the hold is removed, which typically means the claim or threat of claim has been resolved.</li>
</ol>
<p>In all cases, in addition to the purposes and legal bases, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information, as well as the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information.</p>4.
Recipients of Personal Information#<p>In addition to the recipients listed in Annexes 1 and 2, we may also share your personal information with the following (as required in accordance with the uses set out in Annexes 1 and 2):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Service providers and advisors</strong>: we may share your personal information with third party vendors and other service providers that perform services for us or on our behalf, which may include providing professional services, such as legal and accounting services, mailing, email or chat services, fraud prevention, web hosting, or providing analytic services.</li>
<li>
<strong>Affiliates</strong>.
Other companies owned by or under common ownership as Supabase, including our subsidiaries (i.e., any organisation we own or control) and our ultimate holding company (i.e., any organisation that owns or controls us) and any subsidiaries it owns.

<li>
<strong>Purchasers and third parties in connection with a business transaction</strong>: your personal information may be disclosed to third parties in connection with a transaction, such as a merger, sale of assets or shares, reorganisation, financing, change of control or acquisition of all or a portion of our business.</li>

and/or (iii) exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Supabase, its users or others.</li>
</ol>5.
Marketing and Advertising#<p>From time to time we may contact you with information about our services, including sending you marketing messages and asking for your feedback on our services.
Most marketing messages we send will be by email.
For some marketing messages, we may use personal information we collect about you to help us determine the most relevant marketing information to share with you.</p>
<p>We will only send you marketing messages if you have given us your consent to do so.
You can withdraw your consent at a later date by clicking on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of our marketing emails or by updating your preferences via your account on the Site.</p>6.

<p>
<strong>International Transfers of your Personal Information</strong>.
The personal information we collect may be transferred to and stored in countries outside of the jurisdiction you are in where we and our third party service providers have operations.

<p>In the event of such a transfer, we ensure that: (i) the personal information is transferred to countries recognised as offering an equivalent level of protection.
or (ii) the transfer is made pursuant to appropriate safeguards, such as standard data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission.</p>
<p>If you wish to enquire further about these safeguards used, please contact us using the details set out at the end of these Privacy Disclosures.</p>7.
Profiling#<p>We may analyze personal data we have collected about you to create a profile of your interests and send product updates.
We may also use personal data about you to detect and reduce fraud.</p>8.

Tracking technologies used in our emails#<p>Our emails may contain tracking pixels that identify if and when you have opened an email that we have sent you, how many times you have read it and whether you have clicked on any links in that email.
This helps us measure the effectiveness of our marketing email campaigns, make the emails we send to you more relevant to your interests and to understand if you have opened and read any important administrative emails we might send you.</p>
<p>Most popular email clients will allow you to block these pixels by disabling certain external images in emails.
You can do this through the settings on your email client – these generally give you the option of choosing whether emails will display "remote images", "remote content" or "images" by default.</p>
<p>Some browsers also give you the option of downloading and installing extensions that block pixels and other tracking technologies.</p>Annex 1 – Personal information you provide to us#<strong>Category of Personal Information</strong>
