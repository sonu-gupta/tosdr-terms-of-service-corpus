We adopt this notice to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) and any terms defined in the CCPA have the same meaning when used in this notice.</p>Rights and Choices<p>The CCPA provides consumers located in the state of California with certain rights regarding their personal information and data.
The following section describes those rights and explains how to exercise them:</p>Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights<p>You have the right to request that the company disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months.
