<strong>2.Categories of cookies and purposes</strong>
</p>
<p>Depending on their function and purpose, cookies can be divided into five categories: </p>
<p>a) strictly necessary cookies<br> b) performance cookies<br> c) functional cookies<br> d) targeting cookies<br> e) social media cookies </p>
<blockquote>
<p>2.1.
Strictly necessary cookies </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strictly necessary cookies are necessary for the proper functioning and optimization of the website and cannot be deactivated.
They are normally only set in the course of user actions, for example as a result of logging in, setting user preferences, ordering processes or filling in forms.
</p>
<p>These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information.
The data collected in this way is not used to create user profiles.
As a rule, these cookies are only stored on your end device during the current browser session.
However, some elements of our website require that the calling browser can be identified even after a page change.
</p>
<p>We do not pass on the data to third parties unless this is done within the scope of so-called order processing by our service providers, whereby these are contractually bound and we remain responsible for the processing of the data in this respect.
</p>
<p>You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will then not work.
These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2.2.
Performance cookies </p>
</blockquote>
<p>These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site.
They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site.
All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous.
If you do not allow these cookies, we will not know when you have visited our site, and will not be able to monitor its performance.
</p>
<p>Cookie settings </p>
<blockquote>
<p>2.3.
Functional cookies </p>
</blockquote>
<p>These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalisation.
They may be set by us or by third party providers whose services we have added to our pages.
If you do not allow these cookies then some, or all of these services may not function properly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2.4.
Targeting cookies </p>
</blockquote>
<p>These cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners.
They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites.
They do not store directly personal information, but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device.
If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.</p>
<p>Cookie settings </p>
<blockquote>
<p>2.5.
Social media cookies </p>
</blockquote>
<p>These cookies are set by a range of social media services that we have added to the site to enable you to share our content with your friends and networks.
They are capable of tracking your browser across other sites and building up a profile of your interests.
This may impact the content and messages you see on other websites you visit.
If you do not allow these cookies, you may not be able to use or see these sharing tools.
