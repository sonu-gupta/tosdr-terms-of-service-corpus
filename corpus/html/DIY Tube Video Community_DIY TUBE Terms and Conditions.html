As with any site which pays its members, some personal information is required for payment purposes.</p>

DIY Tube Video Community cannot be held responsible for lost or missing payments due to incorrect personal information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>Rewards And Payments</strong>
</p>
<p>After October 10, 2019,&nbsp.
DIY Tube Coin will be launched on our own blockchain.
DIY Tube Coins are rewards for members of the DIY Tube Video Community website.
Once DIYT Coin is openly trading on exchanges, it will have real value and can be traded or sold or exchanged for fiat currency.&nbsp.
For this reason each member is responsible for maintaining their personal information and protecting their passwords and usernames.
DIYT Coins should be treated as money due to their value on the coin exchanges and for use inside the community.</p>
<p>Members are paid for video views, comments and thumbs up on both their comments and their videos.
Payments are made every 24 hours inside the DIY Tube Video Community.</p>
<p>DIY Tube Video Community will take every precaution to protect its members personal information and rewards.
DIY Tube cannot be held liable for loss of data or theft due to hacked accounts or weak passwords.</p>
<p>DIY Tube Video Community reserves the right to close any account found violating these terms and conditions, including the freezing of assets or returning any earned rewards to the community pool wallet.
This will only happen under extreme circumstances and after multiple fair warnings.
Frozen accounts will be retained for a period of time in order to allow the member to later return after a suspension.
Only after multiple warnings and suspensions for violation of these terms will an account be fully closed and its funds returned to the pool.
This is an extreme situation and not the norm.</p>
<p>DIY Tube Video Community reserves the right to immediately terminate an account without warning for the protection of the community as a whole, if needed.
This situation could occur, for example, when a member uploads copyrighted materials and DIY Tube receives a copyright complaint from the original content owner.</p>
<p>Copy/paste spam, comment spam or manipulation of video views in order to falsely increase earnings will result in immediate termination of a member’s account, thereby freezing all earnings in the virtual wallet.
This includes, but is not limited to, the use of bots or other programs or apps which are used to falsely increase video views or generate comments.
DIY Tube Video Community software searches for patterns of abuse which are then confirmed by a live administrator.</p>
<p>Since early 2018 members have been receiving virtual DIY Tube Coins inside DIY Tube Video Community.
Virtual DIY Tube Coins have been a sort of IOU for the launch of the official blockchain and DIY Tube Coin.
DIY Tube Video Community cannot predict the future nor guaranty success and can therefore make no promises on the future value of DIYT Coin and the blockchain.
We can, at this time, only offer hope that as we grow together, we can all share the wealth in the future.</p>
<p>Together we can grow the value of the DIY Tube Video Community and the value of DIY Tube Coins by uploading videos, commenting, interacting and spreading the word.
As the community grows, so will its value.</p>
<p>No guaranty of DIYT Coin value will be made at this time, nor can it be guaranteed in the future.
The success of the community depends on its overall growth and future coin value.
DIYT Coins are useful inside the community for purchasing perks and upgrades, trading and tipping others for a good video.
Other uses for internal virtual DIYT and more perks are planned for the future as well as an internal store where members will be able to purchase items with their DIYT Coins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>Spam, Plagiarism, Harassment or Abuse</strong>
</p>
<p>Spam, plagiarism, or other copyright violations will not be tolerated.
Videos portraying parodies of another member of the DIY Tube Video Community will be removed without notice.
Harassment, trolling or other related behavior is not acceptable and may get your account suspended.
Copy/paste comments will be removed without notice by the DIY Tube team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>Freedom Of Speech</strong>
</p>
<p>DIY Tube Video Community supports the freedom of speech as long as that freedom does not impinge on another member’s freedom.
Members are free to upload content or leave comments as long as they do not violate the terms and conditions in this contract.</p>
<p>Channel owners and video owners reserve the full right to modify, filter or delete any comments or content on their own channel which they deem unfit or in violation of their own freedom.</p>
<p>In the DIY Tube Video Community the freedom of speech does NOT imply the ability to slander, harass or otherwise violate the freedom of another member of the community.</p>
<p>Simply stated: Your freedom ends when it impinges on another member’s freedom or rights.</p>
<p>A channel is a member’s personal space.
Consider this: If you came to my house and spray painted vulgar obscenities about my family on my house – do I not have the right to remove it?</p>
<p>DIY Tube is intended to be a family oriented community and all state and federal laws apply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>Other</strong>
</p>
<p>Violation of any of these terms may result in termination of your account.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to amend or modify these terms without prior notice.
Although the DIY Tube Video team will attempt to contact members about major changes to these terms, there is no guaranty we can reach everyone due to a full inbox, incorrect email addresses or other issues.
It is the responsibility of the individual to read these terms and check back from time to time for updates.</p>
