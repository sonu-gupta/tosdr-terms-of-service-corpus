        OPT-OUT CHOICES AND CALIFORNIA CONSUMER RIGHTS <br>FOR INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING<p>
<em>
<br>Effective Date: January 1, 2020&nbsp;</em>
</p>Changing Privacy Standards and CCPA<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”), effective as of January 1, 2020, was enacted to provide California consumers with greater transparency and control over their personal information.
This law is shaping US-based privacy guidelines for digital advertising – in particular, interest-based advertising – and your rights as a consumer.</p>
<p>TRUSTX is a signatory of the IAB’s CCPA Compliance Framework for Publishers &amp.
Technology Companies.
Under this framework, TRUSTX operates as a limited service provider for publishers, and follows the Supply-Side Platform (“SSP”) requirements for real-time bidding and consumer opt-out, as specified in the IAB technical specifications for interest-based advertising.</p>What is Interest-Based Advertising?<p>As discussed in our Privacy Policy, the TRUSTX Digital Advertising Marketplace uses cookies, Web beacons, pixels, and similar technologies to give Publishers and Advertisers the ability to transact and show targeted ads.
Some of the ads may be customized based on interests generated from a consumer’s visits to different websites in a browser or on other devices they may use.
This type of customization is sometimes called “online behavioral advertising” or “interest-based advertising”.</p>
<p>Interest-based advertising is beneficial because it helps to support the free content you get on the digital properties of Web publishers.
As part of the programmatic ad delivery process, Web publishers may collect personal information such as IP address, location or browsing habits that they pass or “sell” to supply-side partners like TRUSTX in order for their tailored advertising buys to be executed through real-time bidding mechanisms.
Under California law, consumers have the right to opt out of the “sale” of their information by contacting publishers directly, or through the opt-out processes outlined below.</p>Opt-Out Choices<p>TRUSTX offers all consumers the right to opt-out of interest-based advertising and the sale of their personal information.
You may exercise these choices in a variety of manners, including directly with TRUSTX via the links on this page.</p>Opt-out of Interest-based Advertising<p>You may opt-out directly with TRUSTX by clicking this Do Not Deliver Interest-Based Advertising link, which will set a TRUSTX opt-out cookie on your browser.
The opt-out cookie is unique to the device through which you have opted-out, and there are cases where the cookie may not function properly if you have configured your browser to reject certain cookies.
Further, if you change browsers or your device, or delete the cookies on your device, you will need to opt-out again</p>
<p>You may opt-out with the Digital Advertising Alliance to opt-out of interest-based advertising from companies participating in the AdChoices self-regulatory program.
The DAA provides more information about interest-based advertising across sites and the opt-out choices they provide on this AdChoices page.</p>
<p>You may utilize the Network Advertising Alliance’s opt-out page to learn more about NAI members who deliver tailored online ads and your choices to opt-out of receiving them.</p>
<p>Although TRUSTX does not currently operate outside of North America, European Union residents may opt-out of interest-based advertising with companies participating in the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance Online Ad Choices page.</p>Opt-out of Sale of Personal Information<p>In the traditional sense of the word “sell,” TRUSTX does not sell personal information.
However, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”) defines the word “sell” as any exchange of personal information for something of value, such as the delivery of an interest-based ad.</p>
<p>Our publishers may use our technology to sell personal information as defined by California law.
If you wish to opt out of the use or “sale” of your personal information for interest-based advertising purposes, you may opt-out by clicking Do Not Sell My Personal Information.
When you select this option, TRUSTX will set an opt-out cookie on your browser.
The opt-out cookie is unique to the device through which you have opted-out, and there are cases where the cookie may not function properly if you have configured your browser to reject certain cookies.
Further, if you change browsers or your device, or delete the cookies on your device, you will need to opt-out again.</p>Results of Opting Out<p>If you opt-out, you still may receive advertising from the TRUSTX Ad Marketplace when you visit websites of a publisher who uses our Services – but such advertising will not be targeted to you.</p>
<p>Note that we have retained the services of select third-party vendors for measurement, fraud and malware prevention and ad verification purposes.
We have agreements with these third-party vendors that compel them to treat information we share with them as confidential, and to process such information solely to provide us with the services we have contracted.
For a list of the third-party service providers we use in connection with the Services, please contact us at privacy@trustx.org</p>
<p>These vendors, and ad buyers that participate in the TRUSTX Ad Marketplace, may also use their own cookies and other ad technologies to display and track ads.
We do not control and are not responsible for such third-party partners’ information practices or their use of cookies and other ad service technologies.
To learn more about the practices of these companies, please read their privacy policies.</p>
<p>In the event that you opt-out of the sale of data for purposes related to CCPA, but you do not opt-out of interest-based advertising more generally, you may continue to receive ads tailored to your interests through other companies.
These ads may be based upon personal information (a) not sold by TRUSTX-related publishers.
(b) sold to third parties at least ninety (90) days before you opted out.
or (c) sold by other sources from which you have not opted out.</p>Right to Know and Delete<p>If you are a California resident, you have the right to know certain information about our data practices in the preceding twelve months.
In particular, you have the right to request the following from us:</p>

<li>The categories of personal information we have collected about you;</li>

</ul>
