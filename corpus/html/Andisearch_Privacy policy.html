What we do to try to protect you

</li>
</ul>
Earning trust
<p>We know we have to earn our customers' trust through our actions.
Our mission is to protect privacy, and we're trying to do it in a practical and useful way that's accessible to as many people as possible.</p>
<p>While we're in early test stages (alpha and beta) our privacy technology and systems will be evolving, and we expect to make changes and try different things, based on the principles here.
We're only a small team, but we are committed to our mission.
We're actively seeking feedback from our community about doing privacy right.
We support the principles of GDPR, and before we move out of prototype stage and release commercially, we will implement a fully GDPR-compliant privacy policy.</p>
<p>We commit to having our privacy systems, practices and technology audited by a reputable firm and the results made public before we leave beta testing.</p>
<p>We welcome feedback, help and suggestions! Email us at info@andisearch.com.</p>AboutPrivacyHelpMade with ❤️ by the Andi team
