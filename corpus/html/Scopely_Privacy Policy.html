For more information on these rights, please refer to the additional disclosures below.</p>
<p>
<b>Data Retention</b>
</p>
<p>We may retain personal information where required by law or where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so.
For example, we may retain such information to provide you a service you have requested, to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements, or where necessary for fraud prevention, dispute resolution, enforcement of our contracts and terms, or for safety reasons (e.g., we may retain certain information about an Account to prevent that user from opening a new Account).</p>
<p>
<b>Security</b>
</p>
<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards and maintain reasonable safeguards designed to secure the information in our possession, and only those at Scopely with a legitimate business need to access your personal information are permitted to do so.
We also take reasonable steps to assure that third parties to whom we transfer information will provide protections appropriate to that type of information.
If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please immediately contact us.</p>
<p>
<b>Use by Minors</b>
</p>
<p>We do not knowingly collect or process personal data from or about, or direct or target interest-based advertising to, anyone under the age of 13 (or under the age of 16 for those in the EEA, United Kingdom, or Switzerland), nor do we knowingly allow such individuals to use our Services.
If you believe we might have any data from or about a child under this age, please contact us.
If we learn that we have inadvertently gathered such information, we will delete it.</p>
<p>
<b>Additional Information for Residents of the EEA, United Kingdom, and Switzerland</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Rights and Choices Available to EEA Residents</b>
</p>
<p>If you are a resident of a member country of the European Economic Area (“EEA”), the United Kingdom, or Switzerland, you may have the following rights with respect to any information about you that constitutes “personal data” under EEA law:</p>
<p>Access your personal data: You may have the right to obtain confirmation regarding whether we process your personal data and obtain a copy of the personal data we have collected about you.
(Note that this right only applies to personal information relating to you, and not to any other player.)</p>
<p>Rectify or correct your personal data: You may have the right to correct your personal data where it contains inaccuracies.</p>
<p>Request erasure (deletion) of your personal data: You may have the right to request that Scopely delete your personal data in certain cases, for example when it is no longer necessary to fulfill the purposes for which Scopely collected it.
This right may be limited to the extent that Scopely is permitted or required by applicable law to retain the data.
(Note that if you request deletion of your personal data, you may no longer be able to use or access the Services.
If you share devices with someone else who uses the Services, that person may also lose game progress or related account information and access.
If you decide to use or access the Services again, Scopely may consider this a new Account and may collect personal data associated with that Account in accordance with this Privacy Policy.)</p>
<p>Restrict or object to the processing of your personal data: In certain cases, you may have the right to object to Scopely’s processing of your personal data, or request that Scopely restrict that processing.
Because the data that Scopely collects is generally required to provide the Services to you, if you object to the processing of your personal data, this may have the same effect as requesting deletion of this data.
This right may be limited to the extent that Scopely is permitted or required by applicable law to continue processing the data.
(Note that if you object to the processing of your personal data, you and others who use your devices to access the Services may no longer be able to use or access the Services.)</p>
<p>Request a portable copy of your personal data: In certain limited cases, you may be able to request that Scopely provide you with a copy of your personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format so that you can transmit it elsewhere.</p>
<p>To protect the privacy of your information, Scopely verifies your identity and processes all rights requests through our in-game help ticket system.
If you wish to exercise any of the rights described above, please follow the instructions below and do not delete the game until your request is fulfilled:</p>
<ol>
<li> Open the Scopely game(s) for which you wish to exercise your rights, and open an in-game help ticket via the Help section for that game.
(If you have played multiple Scopely games and want to exercise rights as to all of them, please open a help ticket directly in-game via the Help section for each of those games.)</li>
<li> Once you have opened a help ticket, please clearly state which right(s) you wish to exercise for that game.
For example, you can say “I want to delete my personal data,” or “please provide me with access to my personal data.” We cannot begin processing your request until you have clearly stated which right(s) you wish to exercise.</li>
<li> Make sure to include your city and country of residence in your request.
We cannot begin processing your request until you have confirmed your residence.
We will only use this information in order to fulfill and document your request.</li>
<li> Repeat the above steps for any other games for which you would like to make a request.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have trouble with any of the steps described above, you can contact privacy@scopely.com for help.
We may contact you to confirm your choices and to ask for additional information as needed to verify your identity and process your request.</p>
<p>In addition to the rights described above, if we have collected and process certain types of personal data with your consent, you may withdraw that consent in the manner described when you provided consent.
Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing conducted prior to then, nor will it affect any processing based on lawful grounds other than consent.</p>
<p>In some cases, you may have the right to file a complaint with a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal data.
For more information, contact your local data protection authority.
We will cooperate with the appropriate governmental authorities to resolve any privacy-related complaints that cannot be amicably resolved between you and us.</p>
<p>
<b>Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data</b>
</p>
<p>If you are from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland, our legal basis for collecting and using your personal data will depend on the type of information and the context in which we collect it.
In general, we collect personal data from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need it to perform a contract with you, or where it is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.
In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal data from you or may otherwise need it to protect your vital interests or those of another person.
If you have questions about the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal data, please contact us.</p>
<p>
<b>EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles</b>
</p>
<p>We comply with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles regarding the collection, use, sharing, onward transfer, and retention of personal data received from the European Union (EU), the United Kingdom, and Switzerland, as described in our EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield certifications.
To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, visit the U.S.
Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List.
[https://www.privacyshield.gov/list].
Privacy Shield participants are subject to the regulatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission and other authorized statutory bodies.
Under certain circumstances, participants may be liable for the transfer of personal data from the EU or Switzerland to third parties outside the EU and Switzerland.</p>
<p>If you have a Privacy Shield-related complaint, please contact us.
If you feel your complaint remains unresolved after doing so, you may contact our US-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.
Under certain conditions more fully described at https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint, you may be entitled to invoke the Privacy Shield binding arbitration process when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.
In certain situations, Scopely may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>
