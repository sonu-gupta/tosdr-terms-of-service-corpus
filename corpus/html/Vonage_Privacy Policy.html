<strong>Communications usage information.&nbsp;</strong>This includes information about your communications delivered via our platform such as the time and duration of usage, source and destination identifiers, completion status, location, IP address, and amount of usage.</li>
<li>
<strong>Communications content.&nbsp;</strong>To enable you to send and receive communications via our platform, we need to be able to handle the content of the messages, calls, and other communications channels used by you.
This also includes, for example, voicemails and call recordings recorded via our services.</li>
<li>
<strong>Device information.</strong>&nbsp;Where we have provided end user equipment to you, such as an analog telephone adapter or a VoIP phone, or you have installed our software on your device, we collect device-specific information from you.

We may use your contact list information to facilitate certain services where selected by you such as to enable you to make calls easily and to facilitate calls, texts, and other services.
We may also facilitate the delivery of messages to individuals in your contact list that you wish to invite to download our mobile apps so that you can utilize our services with these selected individuals, although it is always your choice to send invites to such individuals.
We will not use your contact list information for other purposes without first notifying you of the proposed use.

<strong>Your location information.</strong>&nbsp;If your mobile device is equipped with GPS or can connect with wireless access points or hot spots, or if your mobile device is also a phone that communicates with cell towers or satellites, then your mobile device is able to use these features to determine its precise geographic location.
You may use the mobile app to do a one-time share of your precise geographic location through a message in a chat session by pressing the location attachment button within the mobile app (a “Location Share Event”).

<p>
<br>
</p>How we protect your information<p>Vonage has implemented administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to help protect the personal data that we transmit and maintain.

<p>
<br>
</p>Where we store your information and international transfers<p>Personal information held by Vonage is stored on and processed on computers situated in the United Kingdom, the EEA, the United States, and in other jurisdictions.
We and/or our service providers also process data in some other countries for customer care, account management and service provisioning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are an EEA resident, your personal data held by Vonage may be transferred to, and stored at, destinations outside the EEA that may not be subject to equivalent data protection laws, including the United States.
When you sign up for service with Vonage or inquire about our services, we transfer your information to the United States and other countries as necessary to perform our agreement with you or to respond to an inquiry you make.
It may also be processed by staff situated outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>Accordingly, by using our services, you authorize the transfer of your information to the United States, where we are based, and to other locations where we and/or our service providers operate, and to its (and their) storage and use as specified in this Privacy Policy and any applicable terms of service or other agreement between you and Vonage.

The United States and other countries where we operate may not have protections for personal information equivalent to those in your home country.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>International transfers within Vonage and its corporate affiliates.&nbsp;</strong>To facilitate our global operations, we transfer information among our corporate affiliates in countries whose privacy and data protection laws may not be as robust as the laws of the countries where our customers and users are based.
We utilize standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission and rely on the European Commission’s adequacy decisions about certain countries, as applicable, for data transfers from the EEA to the United States and other countries.</li>
<li>
<strong>International transfers to third parties.</strong>&nbsp;Some of the third parties described in this Privacy Policy, which provide services to us under contract, are based in other countries that may not have equivalent privacy and data protection laws to the country in which you reside.
When we share information of users in the EEA or Switzerland with such third parties, we shall make use of legally-recognized data transfer mechanisms, which may include the EU-U.S.
and Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield Frameworks, the European Commission’s standard contractual clauses, binding corporate rules for transfers to data processors, or other appropriate legal mechanisms to safeguard the transfer.</li>
<li>

Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss - U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S.
Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and the United Kingdom, and/or Switzerland to the United States, respectively.
Please note that for individuals located in the EEA or the UK, the term Personal Information used in this statement is equivalent to the term “personal data” under applicable European and UK data protection laws.
Vonage has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement for such personal information.
If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.&nbsp;To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, please visit&nbsp;https://www.privacyshield.gov/.
To view Vonage’s certification on the Privacy Shield list, please visit&nbsp;https://www.privacyshield.gov/list.
As required under the principles, when Vonage receives information under the Privacy Shield and then transfers it to a third-party service provider acting as an agent on Vonage’s behalf, Vonage has certain liability under the Privacy Shield if both (i) the agent processes the information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield and (ii) Vonage is responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</li>

<strong>Your California Rights</strong>
</p>
<p>You have certain rights regarding the personal information we collect or maintain about you.
Please note these rights are not absolute, and there may be cases when we decline your request as permitted by law.</p>
<ul>
<li>The right of access means that you have the right to request that we disclose what personal information we have collected, used and disclosed about you in the past 12 months.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The right of deletion means that you have the right to request that we delete personal information collected or maintained by us, subject to certain exceptions.&nbsp;</li>

<li>“California's “Shine the Light” law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California consumers asking about the businesses' practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes.

<strong>Google Tag Manager</strong>&nbsp;is a third-party service provider that allows us to manage website tags via an interface.
Tags are small elements of code that are used, for example, to measure traffic and visitor behavior, to understand the effect of online advertising and social channels, to set up remarketing and orientation towards target groups, and to test and optimize websites.
Google Tag Manager only implements tags.
This means that no cookies are used and, as a result, no personal data is recorded.
We list it here for completeness and to be transparent about the tools we use.
If deactivation has been performed at a domain, page, event or 3rd party script level, this remains in place for all tracking tags if these are implemented with Google Tag Manager.</p>
