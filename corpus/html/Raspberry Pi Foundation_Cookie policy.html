<strong>Where Hotjar is in use:</strong>
</p> Cookie Name Purpose Expires _hjClosedSurveyInvites Hotjar cookie that is set once a user interacts with an External Link Survey invitation modal.
It is used to<br> ensure that the same invite does not reappear if it has already been shown.
365 days _hjDonePolls Hotjar cookie that is set once a user completes a survey using the On-site Survey widget.
It is used to<br> ensure that the same survey does not reappear if it has already been filled in.
365 days _hjMinimizedPolls Hotjar cookie that is set once a user minimizes an On-site Survey widget.
It is used to ensure that the<br> widget stays minimized when the user navigates through your site.
365 days _hjShownFeedbackMessage Hotjar cookie that is set when a user minimizes or completes Incoming Feedback.
This is done so that the<br> Incoming Feedback will load as minimized immediately if the user navigates to another page where it is set to<br> show.
365 days _hjSessionTooLarge Causes Hotjar to stop collecting data if a session becomes too large.
This is determined automatically by a<br> signal from the WebSocket server if the session size exceeds the limit.
Session _hjid Hotjar cookie that is set when the customer first lands on a page with the Hotjar script.
It is used to<br> persist the Hotjar User ID, unique to that site on the browser.
This ensures that behavior in subsequent<br> visits to the same site will be attributed to the same user ID.
365 days _hjRecordingLastActivity This should be found in Session storage (as opposed to cookies).
This gets updated when a user recording<br> starts and when data is sent through the WebSocket (the user performs an action that Hotjar records).
Session _hjTLDTest When the Hotjar script executes it tries to determine the most generic cookie path to use, instead of<br> the page hostname.
This is done so that cookies can be shared across subdomains (where applicable).
To<br> determine this, it stores the _hjTLDTest cookie for different URL substring alternatives until it fails.<br> After this check, the cookie is removed.
Session _hjUserAttributesHash User Attributes sent through the Hotjar Identify API are cached for the duration of the session in order to<br> know when an attribute has changed and needs to be updated.
Session _hjCachedUserAttributes This cookie stores User Attributes which are sent through the Hotjar Identify API, whenever the user is not<br> in the sample.
These attributes will only be saved if the user interacts with a Hotjar Feedback tool.
Session _hjLocalStorageTest This cookie is used to check if the Hotjar Tracking Script can use local storage.
If it can, a value of 1 is<br> set in this cookie.
The data stored in_hjLocalStorageTest has no expiration time, but it is deleted almost<br> immediately after it is created.
Under 100ms _hjIncludedInPageviewSample This cookie is set to let Hotjar know whether that user is included in the data sampling defined by your<br> site’s pageview limit.
30 minutes _hjIncludedInSessionSample This cookie is set to let Hotjar know whether that user is included in the data sampling defined by your<br> site’s daily session limit.
30 minutes _hjAbsoluteSessionInProgress This cookie is used to detect the first pageview session of a user.
This is a True/False flag set by the<br> cookie.
30 Minutes _hjFirstSeen This is set to identify a new user’s first session.
It stores a true/false value, indicating whether this was<br> the first time Hotjar saw this user.
It is used by Recording filters to identify new user sessions.
Session _hjViewportId This stores information about the user viewport such as size and dimensions.
Session _hjRecordingEnabled This is added when a Recording starts and is read when the recording module is initialized to see if the user<br> is already in a recording in a particular session.
