<li> The Scrolls of Lankhmar and yours truly, the curator of the Scrolls, has no interest in collecting or selling or giving away your personal information.
This site exists as a resource to everyone.
It is a public service and a labor of love.
You may create an account if you would like to contribute or subscribe to an email digest containing updates to the wiki.
You may even contribute to discussions.
Either way, your email address, and name or username will be saved on our server to provide that service.
That is all we need it for.

<li> The Scrolls of Lankhmar uses “cookies” in order for the software to provide you a seamless experience.
That is all.
If you decline the use of cookies, the software should still be able to function.
</li>
<li> In the past, I have used “Google Analytics” and briefly installed “DISQUS”.
I have since removed all third-party applications that I know to be capable of tracking your use (excepting Cloudflare, see below).
</li>
<li> This site is powered by the open source, wiki engine, Dokuwiki.
</li>
<li> This site is subject to an extreme volume of 'bot' traffic, and as such, in order to keep the server costs affordable, all traffic is routed through the services of cloudflare.com whose privacy policy is posted.
Their policy for “End Users” is the only one that would impact visitors to this site.
