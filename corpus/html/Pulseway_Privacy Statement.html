Security <p>

<p> Pulseway takes information security seriously and uses reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access.
When you place orders on our websites, all of your order information, including your credit card number and delivery address, is transmitted through the Internet using Transport Layer Security (TLS) technology.

We use a variety of security technologies depending on the situation to help protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure, such as physical access controls, TLS, Internet firewalls, and network monitoring.
However, no security system is 100% secure, and therefore we cannot guarantee the security of your information or assume liability for improper access to it.
If you use a password to help protect your information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential, change the password frequently and use a strong password.
We strongly recommend that you do not share this password with anyone.
