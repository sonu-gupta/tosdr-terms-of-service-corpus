<li>we may assess any possible risks for users (and in particular, for children) from third parties when they use any interactive service provided on Our Websites, and we will decide in each case whether it is appropriate to use moderation of the relevant service (including what kind of moderation to use) in the light of those risks.

We advise parents who permit their children to use an interactive service that it is important that they communicate with their children about their safety online, as moderation (if undertaken) is not fool-proof.

<li>where we do moderate an interactive service, we will normally provide you with a means of contacting the moderator, should a concern or difficulty arise.</li>
