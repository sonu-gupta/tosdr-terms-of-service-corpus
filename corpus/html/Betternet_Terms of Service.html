<p>
<b>5.4 Recurring Payments for Paid Service using Betternet Software.
</b> When you purchase a subscription to Pango’s Paid Service in connection with your use of the Betternet Software, Pango will automatically renew your subscription to the Paid Service at the end of its initial term and at the end of each term thereafter.
The renewal term will be for the same period of time as the initial term.
This period of time is known as the Subscription Period.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of each subscription term, you will automatically be billed for the Paid Service for a renewal subscription term lasting a period of time equal to the Subscription Period.
The Paid Service fee is non-refundable except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.
Taxes may apply on the subscription fee.
You agree to pay for the subscription that you select for the Paid Service and you authorize us to automatically charge the payment method our service provider has on file for your recurring payments.</p>
<p>If the payment mechanism (such as a credit card) we have on file for you is declined for payment of your Paid Service subscription fee, we may retry the payment mechanism at the same or lower rate.
If we do not obtain payment, your Paid Service subscription will be canceled.
If you provide us with a new form of payment and are successfully charged within 30 days after the renewal date, your new Paid Service subscription term will be based on the original renewal date and not the date of the successful charge.
If your Paid Service is terminated, you may be entitled to a refund, subject to limitations provided in Section 9 of this Agreement.</p>
<p>You are responsible to canceling your subscription regardless of whether you receive any notice from Pango about the renewal of that subscription.
In the event that your payment mechanism expires prior to the renewal date of your subscription, you are responsible for updating a new payment mechanism in your Pango account before the renewal date of your subscription to the Paid Service.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, Pango makes no representations or warranties about the continued availability of any particular form of payment method made available for use with the Service.</p>
<p>Several methods of cancelling the automatic renewal of your Paid Service subscription are available to you, and are described at the website https://support.betternet.co/hc/en-us.
Once you have cancelled your automatic renewal, recurring subscription fees for Paid Service fees will no longer be charged to the payment method we have on file for your account, and your subscription will remain active only until the end of the term for which you have fully paid the Paid Service fee.
</p>
<p>
<b>Unless you notify us before a charge that you want to cancel or do not want to auto renew, you understand your paid service subscription will automatically renew periodically and you authorize us to collect the then-applicable paid service subscription fee plus any applicable taxes, using any payment method we have on record for you.</b>

We may, but are not required to, pay certain fees at our sole discretion.

Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</b>

<b>15.1 Generally.</b> In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Pango in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Pango agree that any and all disputes arising out of or relating in any way to this Agreement or your use of the Service shall be resolved by binding arbitration.
Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.
Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts.
Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.
Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of this Agreement, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of this Agreement.
You understand and agree that, by entering into this agreement, you and Pango are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.</p>
<p>
<b>15.2</b> Notwithstanding Section 15.1, you and Pango agree that nothing herein shall be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.</p>

If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in the United States Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the Rules.
In such case, you agree to reimburse Pango for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the Rules.

Additional Terms for Betties</b>
</p>
<p>These Additional Terms for Betties apply to your use of the Betternet app (“Betternet”) and form a part of the Betternet Terms at https://www.betternet.co/terms/.
Capitalized terms that are otherwise undefined in these Additional Terms have the meanings given to them in the Betternet Terms.
These Additional Terms relate to <b>“Betties”</b> - the name we give to points that you can acquire and use in Betternet.
</p>
<p>
<b>B1.
Betties.</b> Betternet includes points called <b>“Betties”.</b> Betties can be acquired by performing certain actions or by purchase through Betternet.
You agree that once acquired, Betties have no monetary value and can never be exchanged for real money, real goods or real services from us or anyone else.
Any balance of Betties does not reflect any stored value.
Betties are not transferable to anyone else.
You do not own Betties but instead acquire a limited personal revocable license to use them.
Unless otherwise specified or required by applicable law, unused Betties may expire 12 months after they are acquired, except for those Betties you have purchased.
</p>
<p>
<b>B2.
Sales.</b> You agree that all sales by us to you of Betties are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise required by applicable law.
If you reside in the European Union, you have certain rights to withdraw from distance purchases.
However, when you purchase a license to use Betties from us, you agree that we will begin the provision of the Betties to you promptly once your purchase is complete (i.e.
when our servers successfully process your payment and Betties are credited to your device) and therefore your right of withdrawal is lost at this point.</p>
<p>
<b>B3.
Betties are Device Specific.</b> Betties are acquired for, and can only be used by, the device you use to acquire them.
The data associated with Betties is stored locally on that device and is not synced between different devices even though you may use Betternet on multiple devices.
If your device is damaged or lost, we will not be able to restore any lost Betties associated with that device.
Accordingly, the risk of Betties which you acquire from us is transferred to you upon completion of such acquisition.
For the purposes of this section, an <b>“acquisition”</b> is completed when Betties are credited to your device after you complete the action required to acquire them (such as making a payment or completing some other action).</p>
<p>
<b>B4.
Use of Betties is Device Specific.</b> Betties may be used in Betternet to access additional functionality in Betternet, such extending time limits imposed on VPN connections.
The access to such additional functionality is only available on the device with which you used the Betties.
The data associated with such access is stored locally on that device and is not synced between different devices even though you may use Betternet on multiple devices.
If your device is damaged or lost, we will not be able to restore any lost additional functionality associated with that device.</p>
<p>
<b>B5.
Use of Betties.</b> We may change what you may use Betties for, or how many Betties must be used to access certain additional functionality in Betternet, without liability at any time.</p>
<p>
<b>B6.
Acquiring Betties.</b> You may only acquire Betties from us, and not in any other way.
We may limit the total amount of Betties you may acquire at any one time or through a single acquisition method.
If we give you the option to purchase Betties using money, we may revise the pricing for Betties at any time.
If we give you the option to acquire Betties through other methods, we may revise those methods at any time.</p>
<p>
<b>B7.
Forfeiture.</b> Unless prohibited by applicable law, and without limiting any other rights we may have, we may remove Betties from your device or account (without compensating or refunding you for such loss): (a) if we elect to remove Betties completely from Betternet, upon reasonable advance notice.
(b) if you breach the Betternet Terms (including these Additional Terms).
(c) if you engage in fraud or abusive behavior in the course of acquiring Betties.
or (d) if Betties reach their expiry date (if any).</p>
