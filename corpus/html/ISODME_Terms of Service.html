Suspected abuse can be reported by email abuse@isodme.com.</p> 9.

<ul>
<li>You shall be solely responsible for any and all of your User Content or User Content that is submitted through your Account, and the consequences of, and requirements for, distributing it.</li>

</li>
<li>
ISODME may be working on the same or similar content, it may already know of such content from other sources, it may simply wish to develop this (or similar) content on its own, or it may have taken / will take some other action.
</li>
<li>
ISODME shall own exclusive rights (including all intellectual property and other proprietary rights) to any User Submissions posted to this Site, and shall be entitled to the unrestricted use and dissemination of any User Submissions posted to this Site for any purpose, commercial or otherwise, without acknowledgment or compensation to you or to anyone else.
</li>
<li>
With Respect to User Content (Other Than User Submissions).
</li>
</ul>
<p> If you have a website or other content hosted by ISODME, you shall retain all of your ownership or licensed rights in User Content.<br> By posting or publishing User Content to this Site or through the Services, you authorize ISODME to use the intellectual property and other proprietary rights in and to your User Content to enable inclusion and use of the User Content in the manner contemplated by this Site and this Agreement.
You hereby grant ISODME a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable (through multiple tiers), and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, combine with other works, display, and perform your User Content in connection with this Site, the Services and ISODME’s (and ISODME’s affiliates’) business(es), including without limitation for promoting and redistributing all or part of this Site in any media formats and through any media channels without restrictions of any kind and without payment or other consideration of any kind, or permission or notification, to you or any third party.

<br> You also authorize ISODME to use your user content in any promotional material.

BACKUPS <p>While we do have weekly backups, these are solely for acts of god.

Being a user, you cannot access these.

<br>Thus, it is extremely important that you conduct weekly backups of your own data as well for your own use.
</p> 12.
MONITORING OF CONTENT AND ACCOUNT TERMINATION <p>ISODME generally does not pre-screen User Content (whether posted to a website hosted by ISODME or posted to this Site).

ISODME may remove any item of User Content (whether posted to a website hosted by ISODME or posted to this Site) and/or terminate a User’s access to this Site or the Services found at this Site for posting or publishing any material in violation of this Agreement, or for otherwise violating this Agreement (as determined by ISODME in its sole and absolute discretion), at any time and without prior notice.
ISODME may also terminate a User’s access to this Site or the Services found at this Site if ISODME has reason to believe the User is a repeat offender.
