<p>As regards personal data collected and processed via video surveillance, we keep the data for no longer than ninety (90) days, unless the data is necessary to establish, exercise or defend against legal claims.
Backup files of video surveillance data may however be kept for longer.</p>
<p>We keep personal data collected via our visitor management system data, and the confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements signed in that system, for as long as we deem necessary based on the nature of our relationship with you.</p> How Is Your Data Protected? <p>We take precautions to protect your personal data from loss, unauthorized access, copying, use, modification or disclosure.</p>

Furthermore, you may under certain circumstances and where technically feasible, have the right to request us to transfer your personal data to a third party.</p>
<p>You may also have the right to request us to restrict the processing of your personal data, for example if you object to its processing, but prefer the data not to be erased.</p>
<p>If the processing of your personal data is based on CCP’s legitimate interests, you have the right to object to the processing, following which we must stop the processing unless we demonstrate a compelling legitimate ground for the processing which override your interests.</p>
<p>In certain instances, you have the right to have your personal data erased, such as where the data is no longer necessary in relation to the purpose for which they were collected or otherwise processed, or if you withdraw your consent for the processing of your personal data.</p>
<p>Your rights to access, erasure, restriction and portability of data are however not absolute.
In those instances where we cannot accept your request, we will inform you of the reasons why, subject to any legal or regulatory restrictions.</p>
