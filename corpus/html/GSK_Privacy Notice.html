<p>&nbsp;</p> In what instances do we transfer your personal information outside of your home country? <p>This website and Privacy Notice are intended only for individuals within the United States.
However, GSK works all over the world.
Therefore, we may need to transfer and use your personal information outside of the United States.
We implement appropriate measures to protect your personal information when we transfer your personal information outside of your home country such as data transfer agreements that incorporate standard data protection clauses.
