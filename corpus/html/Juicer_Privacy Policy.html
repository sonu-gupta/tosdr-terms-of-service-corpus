<p>3.
<strong>Information We Collect</strong>.
We collect two basic types of information from our Users:</p>
<p>(a) <strong>Personal Data</strong>:</p>
<p>(i) <strong>What is Personal Data?</strong> Personal Data is information that pertains to you specifically, and can help identify you as a person.
In some cases, we may ask (or require) you to provide us with some elements of Personal Data (such as your email address and password) when you establish your account.
In other cases, you may provide certain types of Personal Data to us (and other users) when you use the Service.</p>
<p>(ii) <strong>When and How do we collect it?</strong> We collect Personal Data from Users when they establish and use their Juicer accounts.
We do not collect Personal Data from Viewers.
We may collect Posts as part of the aggregation process.
These Posts were made public by the Content Creators and generally do not contain Personal Data.</p>
<p>
<strong>Establishing an Account:</strong> When you establish an account you must provide us with an email address and a password.
If you sign up for a paid account, you must also provide your name and payment information (i.e., credit card or Paypal account ID).
We do not, however, store or “see” payment information, as it is passed directly to the applicable payment processing company listed in Section 4(a) of this policy.</p>
<p>
<strong>Using the Service:</strong> In the case where you are a User and a Content Creator, you may also disclose Personal Data to us (and others) in the content of your Posts.
In addition, when you link your Social Media Network accounts to your Juicer profile, you are granting us permission to access and use certain information about you as permitted by the Social Media Network APIs.
For example, if you link your Facebook account, it may provide us with access to whatever information you choose to include in your Social Media Network public profile and Posts (via your Settings on the respective Social Media Network), such as friends’ names, pictures, genders, user Ids, connections, and any other shared content, and you will be making this information available to other Viewers regardless of whether they are connected to you via Facebook.</p>
<p>When you (the User) logs on to your Juicer account, we will record your IP address and/or unique mobile device identifier and may tie it to your specific account.
Under ordinary circumstances, an IP address recorded in isolation is not Personal Data under the standard definition of the term.
However, it may become Personal Data when it is combined with other information.</p>
<p>When you embed a Juicer feed into your site, Viewers will be served static assets (image and video files) directly from the Social Media Networks servers.
While Juicer does not transfer any personal data to the Social Media Networks, the data that the Social Media Networks record while serving static assets to the Viewer is subject to the Social Media Network's privacy policy</p>
<p>(iii) <strong>How do we use Personal Data</strong>? We do not use Personal Data for marketing or advertising purposes, nor do we share it with third parties for that purpose.
We use your email and password to enable you to create and log in to your Juicer account, and use the Service.
We also use your email address to send you account related notices and other information that we believe may be of interest to our Users.
We use your IP address to identify your location in order to provide you with notices and other information that may be required by your local regulatory authority.</p>
<p>(iv) <strong>Where is Personal Data Stored</strong>? All Personal Data collected from Users outside and within the United States will be transferred and to and stored on servers located in the State of Virginia, USA.</p>
<p>(b) <strong>General Information</strong>: General Information consists of information that is anonymous in nature and does not identify you as an individual.
This includes your computer IP address, unique mobile device identifier, browser type, ISP or carrier name, and the URL of the last webpage you visited before visiting our website.
This information gives us insights on how our users use our site and our other products.
We collect this information by using “cookies”, which are small bits of computer code that are transferred to your computer’s hard drive via a web browser, which enable us to record the general information described above.
We use this information to ensure that our service continues to appeal to our users.</p>
<p>(i) <strong>How do we use General Information</strong>? General Information gives us insights on how people use the Service, and helps us to maintain, modify, and enhance it.
We use cookies to help us customize your experience when using the Service.
For example: (1) we use “session information” cookies to keep you logged in when using the Service.
(2) we use “preferred feed” cookies allow you to return to the latest Feed you modified.
and (3) we use “referral user” cookies to enable us to track how a User found our Service, (e.g.
whether by referral link, through another feed, or through a reseller).
We also use services provided by Cloudflare, Google Analytics, New Relic, and Zendesk, which set cookies for each User when they visit our site or use our Service.
Social Media Networks such as YouTube may also set cookies when a Viewer views a video on a Feed.
None of these cookies collect Personal Data.</p>
<p>(ii) <strong>Where is General Information Stored</strong>? All General Information collected from Users outside and within the United States will be transferred and to and stored on servers located in the State of Virginia, USA.</p>
