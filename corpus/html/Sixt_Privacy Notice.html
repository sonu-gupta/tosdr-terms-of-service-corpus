A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected deviceto uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings inthe browser.
A “web beacon,” also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, is used to transmit information back to a web server.
Our emails may also contain web beacons.</p>
<p>We also may use third-party website analytics tools (such as Omniture and Google Analytics), that collect information about visitor traffic on our sites and mobile applications.
The information we may collect by automated means includes:</p>
