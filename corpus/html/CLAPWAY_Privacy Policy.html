</ul>
<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:&nbsp;<strong>CLAPWAY@GMAIL.COM</strong>.</p>
Personally Identifiable Information <p>Personally Identifiable Information is any information that concerns you individually and would permit someone to contact you, for example, your name, address, telephone/fax number, email address or any information you submit to the Web Sites that identifies you individually.</p>
<p>The Web Sites will not collect any personally identifiable information about you unless you provide it.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you do not want us to obtain any personally identifiable information about you, please do not submit it to us.</p>
<p>You can visit and browse the Web Sites without revealing personally identifiable information about yourself, but not all functions will be available to you.
You may also choose to disclose personally identifiable information about yourself, which may be maintained as described below.
The Web Sites may collect personally identifiable information about you by methods such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Registration Forms – If you are offered the opportunity to enter a promotion, to become a member of the Web Sites, or to register, you must fill out certain registration forms on the Web Site.
This requires you to fill out the registration form on the Web Site.
This form requires certain personally identifiable information that may include, without limitation, your name, email address, postal address, telephone number, areas of interest, product usage, credit/debit card number(s) with associated expiration date(s), CVV and billing zip code(s), and/or a unique individual password.</li>
