AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE<p>Except where and to the extent prohibited by law, which may include the province of Quebec,&nbsp.
Aura and/or You may elect to resolve any and all claims and disputes relating in any way to the Sites and these Terms of Use or any of our dealings with one another (“Claims”), except for Claims concerning the validity, scope or enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement (“Arbitration Agreement”), through BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION.&nbsp.
This Arbitration Agreement involves interstate commerce and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.
§§ 1-16 (“FAA”), and not by state law.
If you or we elect to resolve a dispute by arbitration, neither you nor we will be able to have a court or jury trial or participate in a class action or class arbitration.
Other rights that you and we would have if you or we went to court will not be available or will be more limited in arbitration, including discovery and appeal rights.
You and we each understand and agree that by allowing each other to elect to resolve any dispute through individual arbitration, WE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A COURT OR JURY TRIAL.
IF ANY PARTY ELECTS ARBITRATION, THAT DISPUTE SHALL BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND NOT AS A CLASS ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY SIMILAR PROCEEDING.
The arbitrator(s) may not consolidate the claims of multiple parties.
Arbitrations shall be administered by the JAMS (“JAMS”) pursuant to the applicable JAMS rules in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated.
You may obtain information about arbitration, arbitration procedures and fees from JAMS by calling 800-352-5267 or visiting http://www.jamsadr.com.
&nbsp.
If JAMS is unable or unwilling to arbitrate a dispute, then the dispute may be referred to any other arbitration organization or arbitrator we both agree upon in writing or that is appointed pursuant to section 5 of the FAA.
The arbitration shall take place at a location that is reasonably convenient for you.
The arbitrator shall be authorized to award any relief that would have been available in court, provided that the arbitrator’s authority is limited to you and us alone, except as otherwise specifically stated herein.
No arbitration decision will have any preclusive effect as to non-parties.
The arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding.
You and we agree that this Arbitration Agreement extends to any other parties involved in any Claims, including but not limited to affiliated companies and vendors.
This Arbitration Agreement shall take precedence over the rules of the arbitration organization or arbitrator in the event of any conflict.
We will be responsible for paying all arbitration fees other than the lower amount of filing fees you would have incurred in a state or federal court.
Notwithstanding any other provision herein, you or we may seek relief in a small claims court for Claims within its jurisdiction.
In addition, you and we each may exercise any lawful rights to seek provisional remedies or self-help, without waiving the right to arbitrate by doing so.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the foregoing class action waiver and prohibition against class arbitration is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, then this entire Arbitration Agreement shall be void.
If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement other than the class action waiver and prohibition against class arbitration is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it shall not invalidate the remaining portions of this Arbitration Agreement.
This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of these Terms of Use, your fulfillment or default of your obligations under these Terms of Use, and/or your or our bankruptcy or insolvency (to the extent permitted by applicable law).
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REJECT THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, BUT YOU MUST EXERCISE THIS RIGHT PROMPTLY.

You must send your request to: Customer Service, P.O.
Box 222455, Chantilly, VA 20153-2455.
The request must include your full name, address, account number, and the statement “I reject the Arbitration Agreement contained in the Website Terms of Use.” If you exercise your right to reject arbitration, the other terms of these Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect as if you had not rejected arbitration.</p>18.
Termination<p>We shall have the right to immediately terminate these Terms of Use with respect to any user which we, in our sole discretion, consider to be unacceptable, or in the event of any breach by you of these Terms of Use.
The provisions of Sections 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 10, 11, 16, 17, and 18 shall survive termination of this agreement.</p>19.
