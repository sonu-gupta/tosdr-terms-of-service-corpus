<p>
<strong>4.
Restrictions.</strong> The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:</p>
<ol>
<li>You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License.
You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform.
You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License.
You may not sublicense the Work.
You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform.
When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License.
This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License.
If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.
If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.</li>
<li>You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms of: (i) this License.
(ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License.
(iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)).
(iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License.
If you license the Adaptation under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that license.
If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"), you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform.
(II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License.
(III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform.
(IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License.
This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.</li>
<li>If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties.
(ii) the title of the Work if supplied.
(iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work.
and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author").
The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner.
provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors.
For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.</li>
<li>Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation.
Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g.
Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.</li>

</ol> ODC Open Database License (ODbL) Preamble <p>The Open Database License (ODbL) is a license agreement intended to
allow users to freely share, modify, and use this Database while
maintaining this same freedom for others.
Many databases are covered by
copyright, and therefore this document licenses these rights.
Some
jurisdictions, mainly in the European Union, have specific rights that
cover databases, and so the ODbL addresses these rights, too.
Finally,
the ODbL is also an agreement in contract for users of this Database to
act in certain ways in return for accessing this Database.</p>
<p>Databases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images,
audiovisual material, and sounds all in the same database, for example),
and so the ODbL only governs the rights over the Database, and not the
contents of the Database individually.
Licensors should use the ODbL
together with another license for the contents, if the contents have a
single set of rights that uniformly covers all of the contents.
If the
contents have multiple sets of different rights, Licensors should
describe what rights govern what contents together in the individual
record or in some other way that clarifies what rights apply.</p>
<p>Sometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be
covered by other rights not addressed here (such as private contracts,
trade mark over the name, or privacy rights / data protection rights
over information in the contents), and so you are advised that you may
have to consult other documents or clear other rights before doing
activities not covered by this License.</p>
<p>The Licensor (as defined below)</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>You (as defined below)</p>

<p>“Convey” – As a verb, means Using the Database, a Derivative Database,
or the Database as part of a Collective Database in any way that enables
a Person to make or receive copies of the Database or a Derivative
Database.

computer network, or creating and Using a Produced Work, where no
transfer of a copy of the Database or a Derivative Database occurs.
“Contents” – The contents of this Database, which includes the
information, independent works, or other material collected into the
Database.

Database, or this Database as part of a Collective Database.</p>

either more than 50% ownership or by the power to direct their
activities (such as contracting with an independent consultant).</p>

views, accesses, interacts with, or is otherwise exposed to the Produced
Work aware that Content was obtained from the Database, Derivative
Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, and that it
is available under this License.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
a.
Example notice.
The following text will satisfy notice under Section 4.3:</p>
<code> Contains information from DATABASE NAME, which is made available here under the Open Database License (ODbL).
</code>
<p>DATABASE NAME should be replaced with the name of the Database and a
hyperlink to the URI of the Database.
“Open Database License” should
contain a hyperlink to the URI of the text of this License.
If
hyperlinks are not possible, You should include the plain text of the
required URI’s with the above notice.</p>
<p>4.4 Share alike.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
a.
Any Derivative Database that You Publicly Use must be only under the terms of:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
i.
This License;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
ii.
A later version of this License similar in spirit to this License.
or</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
iii.
A compatible license.</p>
<p>If You license the Derivative Database under one of the licenses mentioned in (iii), You must comply with the terms of that license.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
b.
For the avoidance of doubt, Extraction or Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents into a new database is a Derivative Database and must comply with Section 4.4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
c.
Derivative Databases and Produced Works.
A Derivative Database is Publicly Used and so must comply with Section 4.4.
if a Produced Work created from the Derivative Database is Publicly Used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
d.
Share Alike and additional Contents.
For the avoidance of doubt, You must not add Contents to Derivative Databases under Section 4.4 a that are incompatible with the rights granted under this License.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
e.
Compatible licenses.
Licensors may authorise a proxy to determine compatible licenses under Section 4.4 a iii.
If they do so, the authorised proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a compatible license grants You permission to use the compatible license.</p>
<p>4.5 Limits of Share Alike.
The requirements of Section 4.4 do not apply
in the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
a.
For the avoidance of doubt, You are not required to license Collective Databases under this License if You incorporate this Database or a Derivative Database in the collection, but this License still applies to this Database or a Derivative Database as a part of the Collective Database;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
b.
Using this Database, a Derivative Database, or this Database as part of a Collective Database to create a Produced Work does not create a Derivative Database for purposes of Section 4.4.
and</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
c.
Use of a Derivative Database internally within an organisation is not to the public and therefore does not fall under the requirements of Section 4.4.</p>
<p>4.6 Access to Derivative Databases.
If You Publicly Use a Derivative
Database or a Produced Work from a Derivative Database, You must also
offer to recipients of the Derivative Database or Produced Work a copy
in a machine readable form of:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
a.
The entire Derivative Database.
or</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
b.
A file containing all of the alterations made to the Database or the method of making the alterations to the Database (such as an algorithm), including any additional Contents, that make up all the differences between the Database and the Derivative Database.</p>
<p>The Derivative Database (under a.) or alteration file (under b.) must be
available at no more than a reasonable production cost for physical
distributions and free of charge if distributed over the internet.</p>
<p>4.7 Technological measures and additional terms</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
a.
This License does not allow You to impose (except subject to Section 4.7 b.) any terms or any technological measures on the Database, a Derivative Database, or the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents that alter or restrict the terms of this License, or any rights granted under it, or have the effect or intent of restricting the ability of any person to exercise those rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
b.
Parallel distribution.
You may impose terms or technological measures on the Database, a Derivative Database, or the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents (a “Restricted Database”) in contravention of Section 4.74 a.
only if You also make a copy of the Database or a Derivative Database available to the recipient of the Restricted Database:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
i.
That is available without additional fee;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
ii.
That is available in a medium that does not alter or restrict the terms of this License, or any rights granted under it, or have the effect or intent of restricting the ability of any person to exercise those rights (an “Unrestricted Database”).
and</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
iii.
The Unrestricted Database is at least as accessible to the recipient as a practical matter as the Restricted Database.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
c.
For the avoidance of doubt, You may place this Database or a Derivative Database in an authenticated environment, behind a password, or within a similar access control scheme provided that You do not alter or restrict the terms of this License or any rights granted under it or have the effect or intent of restricting the ability of any person to exercise those rights.</p>
<p>4.8 Licensing of others.
You may not sublicense the Database.
Each time
You communicate the Database, the whole or Substantial part of the
Contents, or any Derivative Database to anyone else in any way, the
Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Database on the same
terms and conditions as this License.
You are not responsible for
enforcing compliance by third parties with this License, but You may
enforce any rights that You have over a Derivative Database.
You are
solely responsible for any modifications of a Derivative Database made
by You or another Person at Your direction.
You may not impose any
further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed
under this License.</p> 5.0 Moral rights <p>5.1 Moral rights.
This section covers moral rights, including any rights
to be identified as the author of the Database or to object to treatment
that would otherwise prejudice the author’s honour and reputation, or
any other derogatory treatment:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
a.
For jurisdictions allowing waiver of moral rights, Licensor waives all moral rights that Licensor may have in the Database to the fullest extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
10.4;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
b.
If waiver of moral rights under Section 5.1 a in the relevant jurisdiction is not possible, Licensor agrees not to assert any moral rights over the Database and waives all claims in moral rights to the fullest extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4.
and</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
c.
For jurisdictions not allowing waiver or an agreement not to assert moral rights under Section 5.1 a and b, the author may retain their moral rights over certain aspects of the Database.</p>
<p>Please note that some jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver of moral
rights, and so moral rights may still subsist over the Database in some
jurisdictions.</p> 6.0 Fair dealing, Database exceptions, and other rights not affected <p>6.1 This License does not affect any rights that You or anyone else may
independently have under any applicable law to make any use of this
Database, including without limitation:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
a.
Exceptions to the Database Right including: Extraction of Contents from non-electronic Databases for private purposes, Extraction for purposes of illustration for teaching or scientific research, and Extraction or Re-utilisation for public security or an administrative or judicial procedure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
b.
Fair dealing, fair use, or any other legally recognised limitation or exception to infringement of copyright or other applicable laws.</p>
<p>6.2 This License does not affect any rights of lawful users to Extract
and Re-utilise insubstantial parts of the Contents, evaluated
quantitatively or qualitatively, for any purposes whatsoever, including
creating a Derivative Database (subject to other rights over the
Contents, see Section 2.4).
The repeated and systematic Extraction or
Re-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the Contents may however amount
to the Extraction or Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of the
Contents.</p> 7.0 Warranties and Disclaimer <p>7.1 The Database is licensed by the Licensor “as is” and without any
warranty of any kind, either express, implied, or arising by statute,
custom, course of dealing, or trade usage.
Licensor specifically
disclaims any and all implied warranties or conditions of title,
non-infringement, accuracy or completeness, the presence or absence of
errors, fitness for a particular purpose, merchantability, or otherwise.
Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so
this exclusion may not apply to You.</p> 8.0 Limitation of liability <p>8.1 Subject to any liability that may not be excluded or limited by law,
the Licensor is not liable for, and expressly excludes, all liability
for loss or damage however and whenever caused to anyone by any use
under this License, whether by You or by anyone else, and whether caused
by any fault on the part of the Licensor or not.
This exclusion of
liability includes, but is not limited to, any special, incidental,
consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages such as loss of revenue,
data, anticipated profits, and lost business.
This exclusion applies
even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such
damages.</p>
<p>8.2 If liability may not be excluded by law, it is limited to actual and
direct financial loss to the extent it is caused by proved negligence on
the part of the Licensor.</p> 9.0 Termination of Your rights under this License <p>9.1 Any breach by You of the terms and conditions of this License
automatically terminates this License with immediate effect and without
notice to You.
For the avoidance of doubt, Persons who have received the
Database, the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, Derivative
Databases, or the Database as part of a Collective Database from You
under this License will not have their licenses terminated provided
their use is in full compliance with this License or a license granted
under Section 4.8 of this License.
Sections 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 and 10 will
survive any termination of this License.</p>
<p>9.2 If You are not in breach of the terms of this License, the Licensor
will not terminate Your rights under it.</p>
<p>9.3 Unless terminated under Section 9.1, this License is granted to You
for the duration of applicable rights in the Database.</p>
<p>9.4 Reinstatement of rights.
If you cease any breach of the terms and
conditions of this License, then your full rights under this License
will be reinstated:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
a.
Provisionally and subject to permanent termination until the 60th day after cessation of breach;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
b.
Permanently on the 60th day after cessation of breach unless otherwise reasonably notified by the Licensor.
or</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
c.
Permanently if reasonably notified by the Licensor of the violation, this is the first time You have received notice of violation of this License from the Licensor, and You cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.</p>
<p>Persons subject to permanent termination of rights are not eligible to
be a recipient and receive a license under Section 4.8.</p>
<p>9.5 Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release
the Database under different license terms or to stop distributing or
making available the Database.
Releasing the Database under different
license terms or stopping the distribution of the Database will not
withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as
stated above.</p> 10.0 General <p>10.1 If any provision of this License is held to be invalid or
unenforceable, that must not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of the terms and conditions of this License and each
remaining provision of this License shall be valid and enforced to the
fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
<p>10.2 This License is the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the rights granted here over the Database.
It replaces any
earlier understandings, agreements or representations with respect to
the Database.</p>
<p>10.3 If You are in breach of the terms of this License, You will not be
entitled to rely on the terms of this License or to complain of any
breach by the Licensor.</p>
<p>10.4 Choice of law.
This License takes effect in and will be governed by
the laws of the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are
sought to be enforced.
If the standard suite of rights granted under
applicable copyright law and Database Rights in the relevant
jurisdiction includes additional rights not granted under this License,
these additional rights are granted in this License in order to meet the
terms of this License.</p>
