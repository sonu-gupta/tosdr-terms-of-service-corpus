Cookies allow sites and advertisers to “remember” users across pages of a site and across multiple visits to a site.
We use session and persistent cookies for remembering user preferences and current session information.
Because of our use of cookies, we can deliver faster service, more consistent, updated results, and a more personalized site.

</ul>
<p>You have certain options to control or restrict which information we share with advertisers, Ad Networks or other Third Party Services (as defined in Section X (Third Party Services)).

Our website is equipped to respond to these signals.
There are also available mechanisms created for the digital advertising industry, where you can register your intent not to receive targeted advertising, located at http://www.aboutads.info/choices, http://optout.networkadvertising.org/ and http://www.youronlinechoices.com.</p>

<p>
<strong>Sharing for Direct Marketing</strong>
</p>
<p>A.
A California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (“California customer”) is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes.
In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request by a California customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed.</p>

Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right.</p>
<p>C.
California customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing support@tvtime.com.
