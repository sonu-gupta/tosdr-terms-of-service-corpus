We also may use cookies to help us offer you products, programs, or items that may be of interest to you and to deliver relevant advertising.</p>

If our practices change, we will do so in accordance with applicable laws and will notify you in advance.
California law requires that operators of online services disclose how they respond to a Do Not Track signal.
Some browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” features.
Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the online service that a user visits, indicating that the user does not wish to be tracked.
We do not currently respond to Do Not Track signal.</p> EU Users' Rights <p>This section of our Privacy Policy applies to the users of our platform in the EU.
We would like to inform you about your EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rights and how we safeguard them.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<em>Your GDPR rights to be informed, to access, rectify, erase or restrict the processing of your personal information.</em> You have the right to receive free information about what personal data we have obtained about you, where it is stored, for how long, for what purposes it is used, to whom it was disclosed.
You have the right to require that we, without undue delay, rectify of inaccurate personal data concerning you.
That means you can request we change your personal data in our records, or have you incomplete personal data completed.
You have the “right to be forgotten,” i.e.
to have us delete your personal information, without undue delay, if the data is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected.
However, GDPR gives us the right to refuse erasure if we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for keeping your information.</li>
<li>
<em>GDPR gives you the right to restrict processing</em> if any of the following applies: <ol>
<li>If you contest the accuracy of your personal data, we will restrict processing it for a period enabling us to verify its accuracy.</li>
<li>The processing is unlawful and you oppose its erasure and request instead the restriction of its use.</li>
<li>We no longer need your personal data for the purposes of the processing, but you require us to restrict processing for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.</li>
<li>You have objected to processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR pending the verification whether our legitimate grounds override yours.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<em>Right to data portability.</em> Upon request, we will provide you your personal data in our possession, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.
You have the right to transmit that data to another controller if doing so does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.</li>
<li>
<em>Right to object.</em> You can object, on grounds relating your particular situation, at any time, to processing of your personal information, if based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR.
We will then have to stop processing, unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing.
If you object to the processing for direct marketing purposes, we will have to stop processing for these purposes.</li>
<li>
<em>Right to withdraw consent.</em> GDPR grants you the right to withdraw your earlier given consent, if any, to processing of your personal data at any time.</li>
<li>
<em>Rights related to automated decision making.</em> As a responsible business, we do not rely on any automated decision making, such as profiling.</li>
</ol> Data Retention <p>We retain your personal data for as long as your account is active or for as long as we need it to fulfill the purposes for which we have initially collected it, unless otherwise permitted or required by law.
We will retain and use information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our rights.
We will cease to retain your personal data, or remove the means by which the data can be associated with you, as soon as it is reasonable to assume that such retention no longer serves the purpose for which the personal data was collected, and is no longer necessary for legal or business purposes.</p> Access to and/or Modification of Your Information <p>If you access the Web site or otherwise access the Services and volunteer personally-identifiable information, you may modify, update or delete such information by sending us an email at support@wemod.com.
You should be aware, however, that it is not always possible to completely remove or modify information in our databases.
In addition, please be aware that your ability to opt out from receiving marketing and promotional materials does not change our right to contact you regarding your use of the Services.</p> Children's Privacy <p>Protecting children's privacy is important to us.
For that reason, we do not collect or maintain information on the Web site or otherwise provide Services to those persons we actually know are under the age of thirteen (13) nor is any part of the Web site or Services targeted to attract anyone under the age of thirteen (13).
We request that all users of the Web site and/or Services who are under the age of thirteen (13) not disclose or provide any personally-identifiable information.
If we discover that a child under thirteen (13) has provided us with personally-identifiable information, we will delete that child's personally-identifiable information from our records, unless it is necessary to retain this information for legal reasons.</p>
<p>We do not knowingly process data of EU residents under the age of 16 without parental consent.
If we become aware that we have collected data from an EU resident under the age of 16 without parental consent, we will take reasonable steps to delete it as quickly as possible.
We also comply with other age restrictions and requirements in accordance with applicable local laws.</p> Data Security <p>We take reasonable steps to maintain the security of the personally-identifiable information that we collect, including utilizing SSL certificates for data encryption, PCI Scanning, S-HTTP and management-only password-secured access limited to two (2) managers.
however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure.
Accordingly, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us, so you do so at your own risk.
Please note, that non-encrypted communication using email is not secure.
Thus, we cannot guarantee data security in email communication and, therefore, recommend using physical mail for confidential information.</p> International Transfer <p>We operate globally so it is necessary to transfer your information internationally.
In particular, <strong>your information will likely be transferred to and processed in the State of New York, USA</strong>, where many of our central databases operate.
The data protection and other laws of other countries may not be as comprehensive as those in your country.
Please be assured that we take reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy is protected.
<strong>By accessing our Web site or otherwise using our Services you consent to your information being collected, used and transferred as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</strong>
