DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION.
CLASS ACTION WAIVER</strong>
</p>
<p>4.1 You and Company agree to arbitrate any and all disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of, in connection with, or relating to this Agreement, Company’s business, any of the Programs or the Company Properties, and relationship with you, including any claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.
This agreement to arbitrate includes any claims against Company’s employees, agents or any subsidiaries of Company.
Arbitration is a method of claim resolution that is less formal than a traditional court proceeding in state or federal court.
It uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury and the arbitrator’s decision is subject to limited review by courts.</p>
<p>4.2 All disputes concerning the arbitrability of a claim (including disputes about the scope, interpretation, breach, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of this Agreement) shall be decided by the arbitrator.
The arbitrator shall also decide whether any claim is subject to arbitration.
You further agree that the U.S.
Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law shall govern the interpretation and enforcement of this agreement to arbitrate.</p>
<p>4.3 <strong>CLASS ACTION WAIVER: YOU AND COMPANY ALSO AGREE THAT EACH IS GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, CONSOLIDATED ACTION, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION</strong>.
This means that neither you nor Company can seek to assert class or representative claims against each other either in court or in arbitration and no relief can be awarded on a class or representative basis.
The arbitrator also may not consolidate or join another person’s claim with your claim or issue an order that would achieve the same result.
You and the Company further agree that if the provisions of this paragraph, known as the “Class Action Waiver,” are found to be unenforceable, it cannot be severed from this arbitration agreement and the entire provision compelling arbitration shall be null and void.</p>
<p>4.4 To the extent possible under your local law, the arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those rules or pursuant to JAMS' Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“Rules”).
The Rules are available online at www.jamsadr.com.
The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement.
If your claim in arbitration is for less than $10,000, Company will reimburse you for filing and arbitrator fees at the conclusion of the proceeding unless your claim is found to be frivolous by the arbitrator.
The exclusive venue for any dispute or issue arising out of this Agreement shall be held in San Francisco County, California.</p>
<p>4.5 Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you agree that if we make any future, material change to this arbitration provision, you may reject any change by sending us written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to Ebates Performance Marketing, Inc.
DBA Rakuten Rewards, 800 Concar Drive, Suite 175, San Mateo, CA 94402, Attn: Legal.
Your decision to reject changes in a new arbitration provision, however, does not affect any prior arbitration provisions to which you have already agreed, which would still remain in effect.</p>
<p>4.6 This arbitration provision is optional.
You may decline or opt out of this agreement to arbitrate by sending written and signed notice to Ebates Performance Marketing, Inc.
dba Rakuten Rewards, 800 Concar Drive, Suite 175, San Mateo, CA 94402, Attn: Legal within thirty (30) calendar days of enrolling as a Member or accessing a Company Property for the first time.</p>
<p>4.7 Judgment upon the arbitration award may be entered in a court having jurisdiction, or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be.</p>
