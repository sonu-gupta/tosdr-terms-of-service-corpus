MyAnimeList may change the fees or benefits associated with the premium features from time to time with reasonable advance notice.
provided, however, that no advance notice will be required for temporary promotions, including temporary reductions in the fees associated with the premium features.</p>
<p>You may submit your debit card, credit card, or other payment information ("Payment Information") via our Service to purchase premium features or other paid products or services.
We use third-party service providers to process your Payment Information.
If you submit your Payment Information, you agree to pay all costs that you incur, and you give us permission to charge you when payment is due for an amount that includes these costs and any applicable taxes and fees.

<p>If you sign up for a monthly subscription service, you will be charged your first monthly subscription fee and any applicable taxes on the date you purchase your subscription or, if your subscription includes a free trial, on the day after your free trial ends.
Your subscription will automatically continue on a monthly basis, and you will continue to be charged on a monthly basis at the then-current price (including any applicable taxes), until you cancel your subscription or we terminate it.
If you sign up for the yearly subscription service, you will be charged your first upfront, non-refundable (except as described below) yearly subscription fee and any applicable taxes on the date you purchase your subscription or, if your subscription includes a free trial, on the day after your free trial ends.
Your subscription will automatically continue on a yearly basis at the then-current price (including any applicable taxes), and you will continue to be charged on a yearly basis, until you cancel your subscription or we terminate it.
You can find your monthly and/or yearly subscription billing date in your account settings.</p>
<p>If your subscription includes a free trial, you will not be charged the applicable fee during your free trial.
To obtain the free trial you will be required to provide a credit card in order to ensure uninterrupted access to the premium features and services and continued use after the expiration of the free trial.
Upon completion of your free trial, your subscription will automatically convert into a paid monthly subscription and your payment method will be charged the applicable fee unless you have cancelled that subscription.
You may cancel your monthly subscription as described below.
You agree that your payment method may be authorized for up to approximately one month of charges of service as soon as you subscribe.
In some instances, your available balance or credit limit may be reduced to reflect the authorization.
however, no charges will be made against the payment method unless you do not cancel prior to the end of your free trial.
You may not receive a notice from us that your free trial has ended or that the paying portion of your monthly subscription has begun.
You are only permitted one free trial.
If your monthly subscription is ever terminated for any reason, and you purchase an additional monthly subscription, you shall not be eligible for a free trial on any subsequent monthly subscriptions.</p>
<p>We may change the subscription terms or fees at any time on a going forward basis in our discretion.
If the pricing for your subscription increases, we will notify you, and provide you an opportunity to change your subscription before applying those changes to your account or charging your payment details in connection with an automatic renewal.
If we notify you in advance of at least fifteen (15) days, your continued use of the premium features or other products and services associated with your monthly subscription after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes.
If you do not wish to continue subscribing with the new fees or features, you may cancel your subscription.
If you accept the new subscription, its terms and conditions will apply for that renewal and all renewals going forward.
For information on the monthly and yearly subscription fees and terms, please visit our Customer Support.</p>
<p>You may cancel your subscription service at any time in your account settings or by contacting us via our Help Center.
