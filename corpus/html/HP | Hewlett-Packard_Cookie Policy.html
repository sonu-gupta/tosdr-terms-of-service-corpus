<strong>ONLINE AUTOMATIC DATA COLLECTION TOOLS</strong>
</p>
<p>When you visit any HP website, it may store or retrieve information on your browser, mostly in the form of cookies.
This information might be about you, your preferences or your device and is mostly used to make the site work as you expect it to and can give you a more personalized web experience.</p>
<br>
<p>HP uses Automatic Data Collection Tools for the following reasons:</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Strictly Necessary Tools:</strong> These are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off.
Without these, the website or service you are requesting would be impossible to provide essential functionalities (like checkout) or display appropriate content based on the type of device you are using.</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Performance and Analytics Tools:</strong> These tools collect aggregated, statistical-type information to enable HP to measure, optimize and improve the content, quality and performance of its websites.</p>
<p>We use our own and/or third-party Automatic Data Collection Tools to see how you use our websites and services in order to enhance their performance and develop them according to the preferences of our customers and visitors.
For example, Automatic Data Collection Tools may be used to: test different designs and to ensure that we maintain a consistent look and feel across our websites.
track and provide trend analysis on how our users interact with our websites and communications.
track errors and measure the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns.
We use third party tools to track website usage and activity.</p>
<br>
<p>The data collected will generally be aggregated to provide trends and usage patterns for business analysis, site/platform improvement and performance metrics.
Our Automatic Data Collection Tools or the resulting analysis may be also shared with our business partners.
The type of information we collect includes how many visitors visit our websites, how many customers log in, when they visited, for how long and which areas of our websites and services but is generally not used to identify you individually.
We may also receive similar information about visitors to our partner websites.</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Personalization Tools:</strong> These allow us to remember choices you make on our websites (such as your preferred language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personalized features.
These technologies are also used to provide content that aligns to your past behavior or interests.</p>
<br>
<p>We also use Automatic Data Collection Tools to change the way our websites behave or look in order to personalize your experience from information we infer from your behavior on our websites or information we may already know about you because, for example, you are a registered customer.
These may be used to tailor the services you receive from us or the content, look and feel delivered to you on subsequent sessions to our websites.
For example, if you personalize webpages, or register for products or services, Automatic Data Collection Tools help our webpage server recall your specific information.
When you next visit our websites, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the website features that you previously chose.
If you use more than one device or computer on a regular basis, we may link Automatic Data Collection Tools together so you will still receive a personalized online experience.
We can also personalize the information you see based on what we already know about you, so that you spend less time looking for things.
With the use of Automatic Data Collection Tools, each visitor to our site can have a web experience which is unique to them.</p>
<br>
<p>

These may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us (e.g.
