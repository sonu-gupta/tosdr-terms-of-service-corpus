Credit Accounts And Licensing <br> Listia may charge fees to acquire or use Credits from time to time, and these fees may change at any time.
Credits are purchased or distributed at Listia's discretion and are not redeemable for monetary value from Listia.
<br>
<br> When you receive a Credit, Listia hereby grants you a limited license ("Credit License") to use the Credit as a virtual token to be held, bartered, traded and/or transferred on the Service with other users (and/or Listia), in exchange for permission to access and use content, applications, services, and various user-listed items, in accordance with these Terms of Service.
The Credit License is transferable by the holder to any other user, provided that both users comply with these Terms of Service and maintain their Accounts in good standing.
Except as expressly permitted by this Agreement or otherwise expressly permitted by Listia, the Credit License may not be sublicensed, encumbered, conveyed or made subject to any right of survivorship or other disposition by operation of law or otherwise, and you agree that any attempted disposition in violation of these Terms of Service is null and void.
Listia may revoke the Credit License at any time without notice, refund or compensation in the event that: (i) the Credit program is suspended or terminated.
(ii) Listia determines that the Account holder has committed fraud or other illegal conduct.
(iii) Listia imposes an expiration date on usage of Credits in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
(iv) the holder's Account is terminated for violation of these Terms of Service.
or (v) the holder ceases to maintain an active Account or terminates this Agreement.

You agree that Listia has the right to manage, regulate, control, and/or modify the license rights underlying such Credits as it sees fit and that Listia will have no liability to you based on its exercise of this right.
Listia makes no guarantee as to the nature, quality or value of the features of the Service that will be accessible through the use of Credits, or the availability or supply of Credits.
Listia may modify, revalue, or make the Credits and Services more or less common, valuable, effective, or functional.
<br>
<br> When you win a listing, your winning bid amount in Credits will be subtracted from your Account.
When another user wins your listing, you get the winning bid amount in Credits added to your Account, less any stated transaction fees.
Credits may also be purchased for a fee from Listia.
Credits may be held by Listia in a pending state or in escrow while both parties confirm that the items in the listing have been delivered and received.
<br>
<br> You acknowledge that except as set forth in this Agreement, purchases of Credits or other goods, content and features of the Service are final, non-refundable, have no monetary value (i.e.
are not a cash account or equivalent) and are purchases of only a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-assignable, personal, and non-transferable license to use, even if they come with a durational term (e.g.
a monthly subscription).
Notwithstanding any agreement by Listia to provide a discretionary pro-rata refund or credit in certain circumstances, you have no property, proprietary, intellectual property, ownership, economic, or monetary interest in your Account, Credits, content or subscriptions, which remain the exclusive property of Listia.
<br>
<br> Dormant Accounts <br> An Account may be deemed "dormant" when no items have been listed or bids placed within any 1 year period.

</li>
<li> 7.
PROPS.
<br> 7.1.
Access.
In order to receive any benefits on the Service from holding cryptographic tokens issued by Listia ("Props"), you must (a) complete the Approval Process described in 7.4 below, (b) link a digital wallet (such as MyEtherWallet, Metamask, or Mobile Wallet) (a "Wallet") to your Account by following the instructions we provide to you in the Service and (c) associate a certain Props balance (such balance may change from time to time) with the Wallet that you linked to your Account.
Props may be associated with the Wallet that you linked to your Account either (i) upon receiving Props into that Wallet from an external source such that the Props were transferred to your Wallet by third parties or (ii) upon earning Props by taking certain actions as described below under "Earning Props" such that we send Props to the Wallet you associated with your Account.
If You connect a Wallet with your Account, you provide Listia with the public address of your Wallet and authorize us to use that public address in connection with our provision of the Service, including to read the balance of Props therein, display the balance of Props in such Wallet to you through the Service or display to other users of the Service that you hold Props, and to send all Props you earn in connection with the Service to that Wallet.
Listia will send Props you may receive as rewards under these Terms only to this Wallet.
You acknowledge that any balance of Props displayed does not refer to any credit balance of real currency, Credits, virtual currency, or its equivalent.
By linking a Wallet to your Account, You represent and warrant that you are the exclusive owner and controller of such Wallet and the contents of the Wallet, including all Props associated with that Wallet and all Props that we send to that Wallet, and have all necessary permissions to authorize us to access such Wallet as contemplated by us, the Service, and these Terms.
You cannot sell, purchase, exchange, or grant Props through the Service.
Further, by agreeing to the Terms, You agree to not transfer your Account to anyone else.
<br>
<br> 7.2.
Rewarding Activities.
We may reward certain activities that you may perform while using the Service, which may include without limitation: (1) selling an item successfully with positive feedback, (2) buying an item and giving the seller a feedback rating, (3) earning badges, which generally includes engaging with the Service in defined and meaningful ways, (4) completing goals that are set and determined by Listia, and (5) certain one-time events, such as competitions and bonuses.
The specific amount of any rewards to you after performing any of these activities will be determined in Listia's sole discretion.
In addition, Listia may in its sole discretion adjust the circumstances and types of activities that are rewarded in the app.
The specific amount of rewards is determined by a formula that Listia may modify at any time in its sole discretion.
You understand and agree that the amount of any rewards depends, in part, on the volume, audience, and nature of items listed, bought, and sold by other users on the same calendar period and, thus, the same activities may not have the same rewards on different calendar periods.
Further, you agree that you are not entitled to earn or receive any rewards of any kind in connection with your activity on the Service or your listings and content or use of the Service in any of the following circumstances: (a) you are not at least 18 years of age or older (b) if one or more third parties claim rights to certain elements of your content or listings.
(c) if the ability to receive rewards is disabled on your Account by either you or Listia.
or (d) Your Listia Account is suspended, banned, erased, or terminated.
The Company will use reasonable efforts to notify you if any of these circumstances should occur.
<br>
<br> 7.3.
Pending Props.
If you perform an activity that we determine to reward, the performance of this activity alone does not entitle you to receive Props.
If you perform one of these actions, we may indicate that you are provisionally entitled to receive Props by associating "Pending Props" with your Listia Account.
Pending Props are not Props or other cryptocurrencies and are only accounting mechanisms used by Listia to signify who is provisionally entitled to receive Props Tokens because they have completed certain in-app activities.
Pending Props are not transferrable, and you may not transfer any Pending Props associated with Your Listia Account.
If we determine, in our sole discretion, that you have violated these Terms, in our sole discretion, we may cause you to forfeit all of the Pending Props associated with your Listia Account.
<br>
<br> 7.4.
Receiving Props.
In order to receive Props, You must comply with these Terms.
Pending Props may only become Props when (i) you have verified your identity with us through a KYC verification process and gone through an AML check, each as described below, (ii) you have supplied all tax forms requested by us and completed any other documentation requested by us in our sole discretion, (iii) you have linked a Wallet to your Listia Account by following the instructions we provide to you, (iv) we have completed all fraud checks or other checks we deem necessary to confirm that rewards are validly issued pursuant to these Terms, and (v) Listia determines, in its sole discretion, that you are eligible to receive Props (collectively, (i) through (v) are the " Approval Process").
In connection with the operation of the Service, Listia collects information from users that Listia deems necessary to collect in order to complete know-your-client (KYC) verification and anti-money laundering (AML) checks.
We may require that you provide all information that we, in our sole discretion, deem necessary in order to allow us to complete these checks.
In addition, we may require that you have a minimum number of Pending Props, which number Listia can adjust from time to time, before you can complete these required KYC and AML verifications.
As a result, You must have a minimum level of Pending Props to any Props in connection with your use of the Service.
<br>
<br> 7.5.
If You fail to provide all information and documentation requested by us in connection with the Approval Process within 120 days following the date that we associated a Pending Prop with your user account, or if Listia determines, in its sole discretion, that you are not eligible to receive Props, we may cancel the Pending Props, and you will not be entitled to receive any Props in connection with any such Pending Props.
<br>
<br> 7.6.
Transfer of Props.
If Listia determines you are eligible to receive Props, we may reward Your activities with Props in an amount equal to the number of Pending Props for which all of the above-described steps have completed.
In order to complete a reward of Props, Listia will initiate a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain that will cause the requisite number of Props to be associated with your Wallet.
In order to minimize costs associated with effecting transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, Listia may effect these transactions on a weekly, monthly, or less frequent, basis and any issuance to you will occur only in connection with the next-occurring issuance or, if the award cannot be made at the next-occurring issuance in a commercially reasonable manner, then the award will be effected as soon as reasonably practicable.
Upon the initiation of this transaction, the corresponding Pending Props will be cancelled in your Account.
<br>
<br> 7.7.
Props Functionality / Props Benefits.
Props may provide users with premium functionality within the Service.
These functionalities may include, without limitation: (1) Level Status: the more Props a user has, the higher their status level display associated with that user within the service is.
and (2) Bonuses and discounts: users on Listia who have a certain balance of Props may receive discounts and bonuses for activities such as purchasing Credits, completing offers for Credits, or reduced transaction fees for selling items in the marketplace.
These benefits may vary based on the level of Props holdings that a user has.
For example, users with more Props will be afforded higher "Level Status" within the app and may receive higher discounts and bonuses..
For purposes of making the calculation of how many Props you have, Listia may count Pending Props together with Props for these benefits.
As a result, for example, in order to determine your "Level Status" in the app, we count both Props and Pending Props.
<br>
<br> 7.8.
We may in our sole discretion modify these functions for your Props.
For example, we may adjust how "Level Status" is displayed, the varying levels of statuses, what benefits are afforded to these statuses, when discounts and bonuses are given to users, and the specific amount of the discounts and bonuses afforded to any users.
We may add to or remove these basic functionalities for Props in the app in the future.
For purposes of all functionalities in the future, we may in our sole discretion determine to count or not count Pending Props together with Props when making the calculation of how many Props You have.
Pending Props will not necessarily always entitle you to the same functionality that Props entitle you to in the app.
<br>
<br> 7.9.
Notwithstanding anything in these Terms to the contrary, if You violate these Terms, we reserve the right in our sole discretion to remove you from the Service and deny Y=you the benefits of these functions in their entirety.
As a result, if you violate these Terms, you may not ever enjoy the benefits we afford to other users who hold Props and have Pending Props associated with their user account.
In addition, if Listia discontinues or ceases providing the Service, or substantially reduces the functionality of the Service, for any reason, then you may not be able to continue enjoying the benefits associated with Props.
<br>
<br> 7.10.
Listia may terminate your eligibility to receive rewards in connection with your activity or your listings and content or the Service for any reason without prior notice to you.
If You decide to terminate your Listia Account or participation in this rewards program, Listia may NOT be able to complete any pending rewards to you, and for the avoidance of doubt, you will have no right to receive any rewards and your Pending Props may be cancelled.
Additionally, Listia may suspend or terminate your Listia Account, or otherwise terminate Your participation in the rewards program or in connection with the Service, immediately and without notice if Listia determines or suspects, in its sole discretion, that you have violated the Terms or any other agreement between you and, on the other hand, Listia or any of its affiliates.
Upon termination of your Listia Account or your participation in the rewards program, all other rights and duties of the parties toward each other shall cease.
