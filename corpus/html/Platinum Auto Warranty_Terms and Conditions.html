and (b) you agree to first commence a formal dispute proceeding by completing and submitting an Initial Dispute Notice which can be found Here.
We may choose to provide you with a final written settlement offer after receiving your Initial Dispute Notice (“Final Settlement Offer").

Any award rendered shall be final and conclusive to the parties and a judgment thereon may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Nothing contained herein shall be construed to preclude any party from: (i) seeking injunctive relief in order to protect its rights pending an outcome in arbitration.
and/or (ii) pursuing the matter in small claims court rather than arbitration.
Although we may have a right to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses if we prevail in arbitration, we will not seek such an award from you unless the arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous.</strong>

You agree to pay the attorney’s fees and court costs that Company incurs in seeking such relief.
This provision preventing you from bringing, joining or participating in class action lawsuits: (A) does not constitute a waiver of any of your rights or remedies to pursue a claim individually and not as a class action in binding arbitration as provided above.
and (B) is an independent agreement.
You may opt-out of these dispute resolution provisions by providing written notice of your decision within thirty (30) days of the date that you first access the Site.</strong>
