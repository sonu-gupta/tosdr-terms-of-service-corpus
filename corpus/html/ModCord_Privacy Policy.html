</ul>Privacy Policy<p>We really value your privacy and we place a lot of time and effort into keeping it secure, below you will find everything about the information that we store.</p>
<br>Data we collect when you invite the bot to your server<p>When you invite the bot to your server, your member list (id, permission bitfield), role list (id, name, hexadecimal color), channel list (id, name), guild name and id are inserted into our caching infrastructure which uses Redis as a broker to centralize and supply information about guilds to the dashboard.
The data is deleted once the bot is offline and is re-collected each time the bot restarts, the data cannot be accessed outside the internal infrastructure.</p>
<p>When you visit our website, CDN or hastebin service (https://modcord.xyz or https://cdn.modcord.xyz or https://haste.modcord.xyz), Cloudflare, a service provider we utilise, sets an identification cookie that is used to make sure that you don't abuse or perform dangerous actions towards them or us.
This cookie is necessary to keep our website safe from automated systems/bots/users that have bad intentions.
You can read more on that cookie here: https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170156-What-does-the-Cloudflare-cfduid-cookie-do- However, if you don't want to receive this cookie, you may use a so-called "cookie blocker" although this may impact the functionality of the website or give your various challenge messages.
Therefore usage is at your discretion.
In addition to this cookie, CloudFlare might save and use your data for analytical purposes, this includes, but it's not limited to: which URLs do you visit, what you or your browser downloads, where did request come from (Country, IP) and others.
We anonymize all analytical data, so we are unable to track a single user based on the data Cloudflare collects.
On top of cloudflare's identification cookie, we also place a session identification cookie to keep track of what account is authenticated in the browser and to be able to have you logged in for extended periods of time, however, the cookie is used internally in our infrastructure and we cannot trace actions the user performs based on their session identification cookie.</p>
<br>Data we collect when you use the commands of the bot<p>When you use our bot (as in running commands) we store the command names that are ran together with the user id of the user and the guild id they're being executed from, for an indefinite amount of time, in order to get insights to improve our service and prevent abuses from happening.
Additionally when a command fails in an error, we store diagnostic data (user id, guild id, message contents, client's permissions in the guild, user's permissions in the guild, type of the prefix used, name of the command, the timestamp, the settings of the guild, the permission level of the user, the command flags specified and the argument list) in order to address the issue and prevent that error from happening in future, the data is deleted manually from our infrastructure as soon as the command has been addressed a fix.
</p>
<br>Data we collect when you change the settings for your server (guild)<p>When you change settings for your guild, and you select a role or a channel we store a representation of the data (snowflakes also known as discord ids) which is processed internally to pinpoint channels and roles specified.
When you change the prefix, join and leave messages they are stored in plain text.
<br>In case of other data, we store a plain-text representaton of it.
The data is stored indefinitely, a request can be forwarded to our support team (from guild's owner) to have your guild data removed.
</p>
<br>Data we collect when you use temporary mute and temporary ban features<p>The data we collect when you use temporary mute and temporary ban features is the id of the user banned/muted, the duration of the mute/ban and the end time of ban/mute in form of an unix timestamp, that data is removed once the user's mute/ban ends or is removed automatically using the integrated commands.</p>
<br>Data we collect when you use the moderation log<p>When you have the moderation log enabled and someone in server performs a moderation action within the discord interface or integrated commands, the bot is going to process the information and compile it into an embed, a copy of it it's stored as a "case" in database, the information stored in the database includes the guild id, user id that performs the action, the action performed (executor), the user that action was performed on (target), the reason, the duration, the amount and the time the action was performed at in form of an unix timestamp, depending on the action performed only available parts of that information is stored in database otherwise the field is marked as being blank.
The data is stored indefinitely, a request can be forwarded to our support team (from guild's owner) to have your guild data removed.</p>
<br>Data we collect when you use the invite log<p>The data we store on our infrastructure when you enable invite log is composed of every invite's existent in your guild information.
The data is stored in the process cache of the bot, the information is cached when the feature becomes enabled or the bot restarts and it is updated when invites are created or deleted.
The data is discarded automatically as soon as the bot goes offline or the feature becomes disabled for your guild.</p>
