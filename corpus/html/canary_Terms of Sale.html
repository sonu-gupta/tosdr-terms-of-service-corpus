Your purchase from the Store constitutes your agreement to be bound by these terms of sale ("Terms") and the provisions of the Limited Warranty applicable to our Products.
The Products may include a device or other equipment, that we refer to collectively as "Equipment," and we may sell equipment to you or provide it to you as part of our services.
If we include equipment in our services, it may remain our property and we may require you to return it upon termination of your service plan, subject to the terms of the service plan you selected at the time of purchase.
Products may also include software in any form which is only licensed to you, not sold, and only in accordance with Canary's End User License Agreement, as will be provided to you with the Product.</p>
<p>If you are a resident of the US or Canada, these Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you and Canary Connect, Inc.
From all other locations, these Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you and Canary Technology Europe Limited.
When these Terms refer to "Canary," "us," "we" or "our" each should be understood to refer to either Canary Connect, Inc.
or Canary Technology Europe Limited, as appropriate to your location.</p>
<p>Although our Store is accessible worldwide, the Products offered <u>are not designed and tested for use in all countries</u>.
If you choose to make a purchase from our Store or to use our Products outside the United States, Canada, or the European Union ("EU"), you understand and agree that you are doing so on your own initiative and perhaps at your own peril in terms of the functionality and legality of your purchase and intended use, and that you are solely responsible for complying with all applicable local laws in your country.</p>
<p>Your purchase may be made through an online store hosted by a Canary third party ecommerce partner, such as Digital River, or any other online or offline reseller.
In such cases, your order may be subject to separate and additional terms.
provided that in case of any conflict between such separate terms and these Terms, these Terms shall prevail.</p>Orders<p>When you place an order through Canary's Store we will ask you for certain personally identifiable information, including your name, phone number, email address, shipping and billing address, and other information so as to allow us to properly fulfill your order.

Subject to this prohibition on resale, and terms applicable to Additional Services set forth below, you may freely transfer (such as by gift) your Equipment.
provided that Products subject to a minimum contract period cannot be transferred unless the transferee is acceptable to us in our sole discretion and the transferee enters into a new contract with us based on these Terms and agrees to assume the balance of your contract period.
<br>
<br> You should be sure to deactivate your Equipment prior to initiating any transfer for data privacy and security purposes.
<b>Please note that for security reasons, Canary will not determine or change control of Equipment for any reason without the express written consent of the individual designated as the "Location Owner" at the time of Equipment setup.</b> We reserve the right to refuse any order placed with us for any reason, including a reasonable suspicion that any order appear to be intended to result in a resale.
Therefore, in our unilateral discretion, we may limit, cancel or reject quantities purchased on a per person, per household, or per order basis, in our sole discretion.
Such determinations to restrict orders may include orders placed by or under the same customer account, the same credit card, and/or orders that use the same billing and/or shipping address on a one-time or serial basis.</p>
<p>In the event that we limit, cancel or reject an order, we may attempt to notify you by contacting the email and/or billing address and phone number provided at the time the order was made.
We reserve the right to limit or prohibit orders that, in our sole discretion, appear to be placed by dealers, resellers or distributors or persons or entities we believe are purchasing with the intention of reselling.
We also reserve the right to limit the sales of our Products to any person, geographic region or jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Any offer for any Products made on this site is void where prohibited.</p>Shipping and Returns<p>Canary will pack the Equipment in accordance with its standard practices.
You may be able to choose the method of shipment and timing of delivery for Equipment ordered.
Unless otherwise specified in a written promotion, we will charge you for shipping and handling.
Scheduled shipment and arrival dates are estimates only.
Canary will make reasonable efforts to meet the scheduled shipment and arrival dates, but in no event will Canary be liable for any loss, damage, or penalty resulting from any delay in shipment or delivery.</p>

Refund Policy.</p>Additional Services and Premium Services<p>At the time of your purchase of our Products and thereafter (in our app, on our website and/or at our authorized resellers and sales partners), you will have the opportunity to elect to purchase one or more additional subscription services, which may be sold a-la-carte or in a bundle ("Additional Services", previously also known as our "Premium Services Program").
There are certain terms and conditions which pertain to the purchase, use and termination of these Additional Services that are in addition to other terms governing the use of Canary's systems generally.</p>
<p>One form of Additional Services is our "Premium Services".
Each of the Basic and Premium Services currently offered by Canary is explained at this link.
Premium Services may include items such as access to full recorded videos for a predetermined timeframe (e.g., 30 days).
access to certain exclusive Premium Services software features such as a web-based video viewing experience and two-way talk functionality.
an extended Equipment warranty.
and customer service support in the event of a home security incident.</p>
<p>Use of all Additional Services is governed by all relevant Canary terms and conditions including, without limitation, the Canary System Terms &amp.
Conditions, Canary's Privacy Policy, Canary's End User License Agreement (for software embedded in the Product) and these terms, including the terms applicable to your selected service plan.</p>
<p>Full recorded videos are available to Premium Services subscribers and will remain available for the predetermined timeframe applicable to your selected plan.
Video previews previously captured prior to an upgrade to Premium Services will not be replaced by full videos if you upgrade to Premium Services.</p>
<p>Your selected plan may include an Extended Warranty.
The Extended Warranty includes the same provisions of Canary's standard Limited Warranty but adds additional time (e.g., twelve (12) months) from the date of purchase.
The Extended Warranty must be in place for the relevant Equipment at the time the Equipment fails to be potentially eligible for an Extended Warranty claim.</p>
<p>Outside the United States, subscribers to Premium Services will receive full video and timeline access as set forth in the documentation applicable to the user's country of residence, and other features of our Premium Services (such as extended warranty or incident support) may not be available in certain countries outside the United States.</p>
<p>Purchase of Canary's Premium Services or Professional Monitoring includes the features described on our Premium Services FAQ page and Professional Monitoring FAQ page, respectively, at the time of your purchase and are subject to change (including during the period of your Additional Service) on notice to you.
Canary reserves the right to limit certain Premium Services functionality, such as video uploads and access, web-based video viewing experience, and two-way talk, or Professional Monitoring functionality, such as escalating events for review or first responder dispatch, immediately upon notice to you if, in our sole discretion, your use of the applicable Additional Service is inconsistent with the purpose or manner in which it is intended to be used.
No refunds will be offered in connection with any such limitation.</p>
<p>Additional Services and the rights and privileges provided to an Additional Services subscriber are personal and non-transferable by assignment, sale or otherwise, each of which is specifically prohibited.
If you give your Equipment to another person (e.g., as a gift), you are not permitted to transfer your activated Additional Services with the Equipment for that person's use.
The person who receives your Equipment must purchase his or her own Additional Services.
provided that for Products with a minimum contract period, if the person who receives the Equipment is acceptable to us in our sole discretion, we may permit them to enter into a new contract with us with a contract period that is equal to the balance of your remaining contract period.
You will not receive a refund, pro-rated or otherwise, if, as a result of giving your Equipment to another person, you deactivate your account.</p>
<p>All fees for and payments for Additional Services are in US Dollars unless otherwise noted at the time of purchase.
Additional Services are billed on a per-location or a per Equipment (device) basis depending on the plan you selected at the time of purchase.
The price of your Additional Services is subject to your selected plan and may also depend on the amount of Equipment (number of devices) registered with your Additional Services at each physical location on your account.
If a physical location has Additional Services activated, we may require that all Equipment at that location must be activated for the same Additional Services.
In the event that the amount of Equipment (number of devices) changes during the course of a month or year, depending on which plan you selected, we may adjust your bill on a pro-rated basis to reflect any changes.</p>
<p>When you purchase Additional Services that includes "free" Equipment, you do not purchase the Equipment outright and instead it remains in our ownership.
Title to and ownership in this Equipment shall not transfer to you, and your payments shall be for your right to use our Products.
This means that you cannot sell, rent, mortgage or otherwise encumber our Equipment unless we agree in writing.
At the end of any Additional Services plan, we have the right to require that you return the Equipment to us.
Failing to return an applicable Equipment to us within 14 days following our instructions to do so violates these Terms, and we may continue to charge your Additional Services plan fees until you return the Equipment to us and/or we may take legal or other collection action against you.
This could mean you have to pay our costs and expenses, including collections and legal costs, with interest added daily as described in the "Payment" section below.</p> Canary Professional Monitoring Services and Emergency Button Services <p>If you subscribe to Canary's professional monitoring or emergency button services (collectively, "<b>Professional Monitoring</b>"), the additional terms in this section captioned "Canary Professional Monitoring Services and Emergency Button Services" apply to your use of Professional Monitoring (the "<b>Monitoring Terms</b>").

<p>
<b>No Warranties in Noonlight Services.</b> Canary does not make any warranties on behalf of Noonlight, and HEREBY DISCLAIMS ON BEHALF OF NOONLIGHT, ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES, WITH RESPECT TO THE NOONLIGHT SERVICES.
NOONLIGHT SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LOST PROFITS) AND SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS NOONLIGHT'S DIRECT LIABILITY TO YOU.</p>Payment<p>The initial price for the Additional Services you choose is posted on Canary's website on the date that you subscribe.
Canary reserves the right to change your Additional Services terms and prices with appropriate notice to you.
We do not provide upward or downward price protection or refunds in the event of promotions or price decreases offered after the date on which you subscribe.</p>
<p>You may pay for your Additional Services with a major credit or debit card, or any other payment method accepted by our third party payment processor at the time of purchase ("Payment Method").
We will charge your credit or debit card or account for your first Additional Services fee on the date that we process your order for your Additional Services and on or about each monthly or annual anniversary.
If you purchase Additional Services with a minimum committed contract period (e.g., 24 months), after your applicable contract period, we will continue your Additional Services on a month-to-month or annual Additional Services plan (based on your latest selected payment period), and will charge you at our then-current rates.
Once your credit or debit card or account is charged the first Additional Services fee, you will receive a confirmation email.
If you have any dispute with any such charge, you must notify us in accordance with our Cancellation requirements, set forth below.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that the amounts billed each billing period may vary for reasons that may include differing amounts due to promotional offers, changing your Additional Services plan (where permitted) and changes in the amount of taxes we collect.
You authorize Canary to charge your Payment Method for such varying amounts, or to provide you a credit, on your next billing cycle.
Payments for our Additional Services are processed through our third party payment processors.</p>
<p>If you purchase Additional Services with a minimum contract period, you are committing to the minimum contract period specified at the time of your order (e.g., 24 months).
You may cancel your Additional Services plan with a minimum contract period at any time, subject to your payment to us at the time of cancellation an early termination fee equal to the entire amount that you would have paid to us if you had completed the remainder of your minimum contract period.
For example, if your Additional Services with a minimum contract period is billed at $14.99 monthly + tax and includes a 24-month contract, and you cancel in month 14, your early termination fee would be $149.90 + tax due at the time of cancellation.</p>
<p>We may evaluate your credit history before modifying or providing you Additional Services, including obtaining a report from a consumer credit agency or exchanging information with our affiliates in connection with determining your creditworthiness.
If you fail to pay your bill, we may submit a negative credit report to a credit reporting agency, which will negatively affect your credit report.</p>
<p>If a payment for Additional Services with a minimum contract period is not successful, you remain responsible for any unpaid amounts, and after a grace period that we determine of at least 30 days, we may consider that you have canceled your Additional Services plan, in which case an early termination fee will apply, due at the time of cancellation or deemed cancellation, equal to the entire amount that you would have paid to us if you had completed the remainder of your minimum contract period specified at the time of your order (see the sample calculation above).
Imposing an early termination fee does not affect our right to take legal or other collection action against you for non-payment, to charge you interest, or to request that you return to us Equipment that we own.
If you are past due on amounts owed to us for Additional Services with a minimum contract period, we may also temporarily or permanently remotely disable your Equipment so that it will not operate, even if you give or otherwise transfer it.</p>
<p>If you purchase Additional Services with a minimum contract period and you do not make any payment due to us by the due date for payment, we may also charge interest to you on the overdue amount at the rate of the lesser of (a) 6% a year above the "prime rate" as reported by the Wall Street Journal or any successor publication and (b) the maximum interest rate allowed by law.
This interest shall accrue on a daily basis from the due date until the date of actual payment of the overdue amount, whether before or after judgment.
You will be required to pay interest together with any overdue amount unless you dispute a request for payment in good faith and contact us to let us know promptly after you have received a payment request of your dispute, in which case we may choose not to apply interest for the period of the dispute.</p>
<p>In addition to any early termination or other fees that apply, you also agree to reimburse us for our reasonable costs, fees and expenses in connection with any collection activities we undertake arising from your failure to pay us any amounts owed when due, including our reasonable attorneys fees and collection agency fees.
If you fail to pay on time and we refer your account(s) to a third party for collection, we may assess a collection fee that will be due at the time of the referral to the third party.
The fee will be calculated at the maximum percentage permitted by applicable law, but not to exceed 18 percent per annum of the amount due.</p>Free Trials<p>Your Canary Additional Services may begin with a free trial for a limited period of time.
If you receive a free trial, the specific offer terms will be stated in the material describing the free trial offer.
Free trials are for new Canary customers only.
We will not combine free trials with any other offers.
When a free trial ends, if authorized by you during the registration process, your paid Additional Services will begin and we will charge your payment method accordingly.
Canary reserves the right to determine and limit eligibility for any free trial.</p>
<p>Once your free trial period ends, we will begin billing your Payment Method for the monthly or annual Additional Services fees corresponding to the Additional Services you chose at the time of purchase (plus any applicable taxes), unless you cancel in a timely manner according to our policies prior to the end of your free trial.
For that reason, unless otherwise indicated in the free trial description, you may be asked to set up a valid Payment Method for continuation charges when redeeming a free trial offer.
If you wish to avoid charges to your Payment Method, you must cancel your Additional Services prior to the last day of your free trial period.
You may cancel your Additional Services at any time as described in the Cancellation section of these Terms.</p>Billing<p>CANARY WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW YOUR ADDITIONAL SERVICES ON OR ABOUT EACH MONTHLY OR ANNUAL ANNIVERSARY OF THAT DATE THAT CANARY FIRST CHARGES YOU FOR THE FIRST ADDITIONAL SERVICES FEE.</p>

The fees for Products (including, without limitation, Additional Services) are based solely upon the services provided by Canary, and is premised and conditioned upon Canary's (and, in the case of Professional Monitoring, Noonlight's) limitation of liability and other rights arising under the risk allocation clauses contained in these Sales Terms.
Accordingly, you should maintain insurance in an amount and with coverages sufficient to provide full and complete coverage for any loss, damage or expense that may be sustained by you, your family or others who may be on or adjacent to the Premises, including medical insurance, disability insurance, life insurance and property insurance.</p>Limitation of Liability<p>Nothing in these Terms, and in particular within this "Limitation of Liability" section, shall attempt to exclude or limit liability that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.</p>
<p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES,</p>
<p>(A) IN NO CASE SHALL THE CANARY REPRESENTATIVES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES RESULTING FROM YOUR PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS OR DISPLAYING, COPYING, OR DOWNLOADING ANY CONTENT TO OR FROM OUR PRODUCTS, EVEN IF CANARY KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
AND</p>
<p>(B) IN NO CASE SHALL THE CANARY REPRESENTATIVES BE LIABLE FOR ANY BODILY INJURY OR HARM TO PROPERTY , OR ANY OTHER LOSS, CLAIM, OR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUE, LOST SAVINGS, LOSS OF DATA, REPLACEMENT COSTS, OR ANY SIMILAR DAMAGES, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, AND WHICH ARISE FROM OR ARE OTHERWISE ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR USE OR OWNERSHIP OF THE EQUIPMENT, OR ARISING FROM YOUR PURCHASE FROM OUR STORE, USE OF OUR PRODUCTS OR RELATED IN ANY WAY TO YOUR USE OF THE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN ANY CONTENT, OR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE USE OF THE PRODUCTS OR ANY CONTENT POSTED, TRANSMITTED, OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE VIA THE PRODUCTS, EVEN IF CANARY KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN ADVISED OF SUCH A POSSIBILITY.</p>
<p>Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states or jurisdictions, the Canary Representatives' liability (and the Noonlight Representatives' liability, with respect to the Noonlight Services) shall be limited to the maximum sum of $25.00 collectively.
In the event that you wish to increase the maximum amount of such limited liability, you may, as a matter of right, obtain a higher limit by contacting legal@canary.is to arrange paying an additional amount for the increase in such limit of liability, but this payment shall in no way be interpreted to hold Canary or Noonlight, and their Representatives as an insurer.</p>General<p>Canary controls and operates its Service from its headquarters in the United States.
If you use this Service outside the United States of America, you are solely responsible for following applicable local laws.
In the event that any provision of these Terms is determined to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, such provision shall nonetheless be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and the unenforceable portion shall be deemed to be severed from these Terms, such determination shall not affect the legality, validity and enforceability of any other remaining provisions.</p>
