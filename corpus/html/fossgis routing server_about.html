<p>This server provides route instructions for a few select modes
of transportation.
It uses free and open data from the
collaborative OpenStreetMap project
with the routing engine OSRM.
The servers
are sponsored by FOSSGIS.</p>
Contact
<p>Map related questions are best asked at one of the places

mailinglist osrm-talk</p>
<p>You can contact the system administrators at

Privacy
<p>Your request for a route is sent to our server (because the route is
calculated on the server and only displayed in your browser) and is saved
in the server log file.
