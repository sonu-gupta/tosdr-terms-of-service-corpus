<b>Disabling cookies</b>
<br>If you do not agree to the use of these cookies please disable them by following the instructions for your browser set out here.
Please note that some of the services may not function if cookies are disabled.<br>
<br>Where the organisation setting the cookie provides an automated disabling tool in respect of its cookie(s) we list the name of that organisation, and the category of cookies it sets together with a link to its automated disabling tool.
In all other cases, we list the names of the cookies themselves and their source at the date of this Cookies policy so that you can easily identify and disable them if you want through your browser controls.<br>
<br>Some browsers make it possible for you to signal that you do not want your internet browsing activity to be tracked.

<b>What are cookies?</b>
<br>Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your device when you visit a website.
Cookies are then sent back to the originating web domain on your subsequent visits to that domain.
Most web pages contain elements from multiple web domains so when you visit the Website, your browser may receive cookies from several sources.<br>
<br>Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognise a user’s device.
Cookies allow you to navigate between pages efficiently, remember preferences and generally improve the user experience.
They can also be used to tailor advertising to your interests through tracking your browsing across websites.<br>
<br>Session cookies are deleted automatically when you close your browser and persistent cookies remain on your device after the browser is closed (for example to remember your user preferences when you return to the site).<br>
