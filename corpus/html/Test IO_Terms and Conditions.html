<br>1.
test IO GmbH (hereinafter “test IO”) provides contractors the opportunity to work as “testers”.
In concrete terms, this means that test IO gives testers the technical means to register on a website as testers by creating a login (“account”), so that they can process end customer jobs (“test runs”) independently.
As such, testers can decide for themselves when, where, and how often they complete jobs for test IO.
Testers are compensated for their work according to the compensation table applicable to that particular test run.
Testers are independent contractors and are not employees or agents of test IO.<br>
<br>1.1 These terms and conditions regulate the framework conditions for testers’ work for test IO.
Acceptance of a tester’s offer to perform a test run constitutes an individual contractual relationship governed by the conditions specified at the time of job assignment and accepted by the tester.
In submitting an offer to perform a test run, the tester pledges to conduct the research and work relevant to that job carefully, conscientiously, and in accordance with the principles of test IO.<br>
<br>2.
These terms and conditions are applicable to all contractual relationships between test IO and testers.
It replaces all previous agreements, effective as of the moment at which these terms and conditions are accepted.
The tester’s own terms and conditions do not apply regardless of whether test IO expressly objects to them or not.<br>
<br>2.1 test IO reserves the right to modify these terms and conditions at any time.
At the time of his or her next login, the tester will be notified of the change and provided the new terms and conditions in a save- and print-ready format.
The tester may then accept the new terms and conditions, and confirms having understood and accepted the terms by clicking the confirmation field.<br>
<br>2.2 Side agreements made orally have no legal validity.
Any changes to these terms and conditions must be made in writing, including but not limited to emails, faxes, or texts posted online and made available for the recipient to save and print.
This also applies to agreements setting aside the written-form requirement.<br>
<br>2.3 In order to be able to work as testers, users must go through a one-time process of setting up a free user account and having that account activated by test IO.
Testers must be at least eighteen years old to set up a user account.
test IO is not legally obligated to activate user accounts.
Testers are under no obligation to provide any services and can close their accounts at any time.<br>
<br>3.
When setting up user accounts, testers are obligated to provide the requested information completely, correctly, and in the appropriate format.
In individual cases, test IO reserves the right to make account activation contingent upon the provision of suitable proof demonstrating the accuracy of the information given.
Testers are obligated to keep this user information up-to-date, and to use the editing function to make any necessary changes without delay.
Should test IO be unable to contact the tester as a result of the tester’s failure to update this information as necessary, test IO accepts no liability for the situation.
The tester is obligated to compensate test IO for any damages it incurs as a result of the tester having provided false, inaccurate, or incomplete data.<br>
<br>3.1 Users are to select a user name and a password of their choice when setting up an account.
Selected user names must not violate any rights, especially third party naming or trademark rights, and must not violate common decency.
Passwords have to be kept secret and shall not be disclosed to any third party.
<br>
<br>3.2 Generally speaking, registering user accounts for third parties is not permitted.
Testers are also forbidden from maintaining multiple user accounts.<br>
<br>3.3 test IO will conduct an anti-money laundering, sanctions and terrorist watch list screening of the testers in relation to restrictions and sanctions to satisfy test IO’s own compliance with applicable law.
For this purpose test IO will check the testers information against official lists or use third parties to do so.
(“Screening”)<br>
<br>3.4 test IO reserves the right to delete a tester’s user account and/or terminate its contractual relationship with the tester if the tester violates these terms and conditions or any other obligations arising from this contractual relationship or if the Screening as stated above will not be passed.
In such cases, the tester will receive payment for any accepted work he or she has already performed for test IO.
Testers may have their accounts deleted at any time by sending an email to support@test.io.
Information and data subject to compulsory record retention regulations (e.g., invoices/credit vouchers) will only be deleted following expiry of the relevant retention period.
All other data will be deleted at the time of the account’s deletion.<br>
<br>3.5 Accounts will only be activated for job processing after the tester successfully performs an unremunerated warm-up test run.
The tester will receive an invitation to the warm-up test run once he or she has successfully registered as per the specifications listed above.
Testers have no legal claim to invitations to warm-up test runs.<br>
<br>3.6 Once a tester has registered an account and test IO has activated that account, test IO may contact the tester under the email he or she has provided in order to solicit an offer for the performance of a concrete test run.
This constitutes only an “invitation to bid” (invitatio ad offerendum).
Testers can use the reply function to send test IO a quote for the performance of the test run under the conditions specified in the project description.
test IO is under no obligation to accept these quotes.
as such, test IO’s inquiry does not represent a legally binding offer.<br>
<br>3.7 Should test IO accept the tester’s quote for performance of a test run, the information required to perform the test run will be made available to the tester shortly before the test run is activated.
The tester’s acceptance of a test run does not give test IO any legal right to have the tester work through the test run as per the conditions specified.
Conversely, test IO is under no obligation to accept the tester’s work if it is not done in accordance with the conditions and requirements indicated in the project description, and if the tester’s work qualifies as misperformance.
In particular, work will no longer be accepted once test IO’s previously specified deadline for service performance has passed.<br>
<br>3.8 The tester shall be paid for each error he or she discovers while performing the test run.
Testers report each discovered error using the form provided by test IO.
The tester lists a description of the error on the form and assigns the error to one of three categories: Low, High, or Critical.
This assessment is only for purposes of initial orientation.
it is not binding for the tester’s claim to compensation.
test IO will then check the error.
The tester shall not receive compensation for the error if:<br>
<br>1.
sequential error log numbering makes it evident to test IO that the report is a duplicate, and that the error has previously been discovered by another tester, or <br>
<br>2.
the error cannot be reproduced by test IO, and is thus not demonstrably present.<br>
<br>3.
test IO will also check the tester’s labeling of the error as Category Low, High or Critical, and change this assignation if necessary.
As per § 317 of the German Commercial Code, test IO’s end customer is responsible for making final determinations regarding error categories.<br>
<br>4.
For certain test runs, the tester shall receive lump sum compensation for completing one or more jobs defined by test IO, either in addition to or instead of compensation per error discovered.
Such compensation may be provided for jobs such as (for example) research tasks, answering questionnaires, or working through so-called test cases.<br>
<br>4.
Testers shall be specially informed as to the exact rate of compensation per error discovered (as per Section 1) or per job (as per Section 3.8 (4)) for each job.
When test IO sends the tester an email requesting that the tester submit a quote for test run performance, the email will specify a concrete amount of compensation per error discovered during the test run/per job.
the tester shall then apply this compensation rate when submitting his or her offer.<br>
<br>1.
Job orders for performance of test runs are assigned exclusively to the tester who submitted the corresponding offer.
Job orders may only be forwarded to third parties with test IO’s express written permission.
<br>
<br>2.

<br>2.
Under no circumstances shall the tester commercialize, nor allow others to commercialize, deliverables created in the course of their work as per Section 5.1.<br>
<br>3.
Insofar as the tester creates a program as defined under § 69a Section 1 of the German Copyright Act in fulfillment of his or her contractual relationship with test IO, or in accordance with the written job specifications provided by test IO, the rights are transferred as described under § 69b of the German Copyright Act.
The rights are transferred at the time the deliverables are created.<br>
<br>4.
To the extent the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of deliverables cannot be transferred to test IO the tester shall grant to test IO an irrevocable, exclusive right of use and exploitation for all known types of use which shall be unlimited as to duration and territory.

<br> 7.
Exclusive usage rights are transferred to test IO upon completion or termination of the work.
Payment of the agreed compensation amount also satisfies any other claims of ownership.<br>
<br>8.
The tester attests that none of the work he or she creates for test IO contains illegal content, especially content that violates the ownership, personality, or other intellectual property rights of any third party, or content that is criminally relevant in any way.
The tester is obligated to reimburse any expenses justifiably incurred by tester through third parties as a result of objections to content created by the tester.
This does not apply if the tester is not liable for the legal violation.
It is hereby expressly noted that test IO checks testers’ work as a quality assurance measure, in particular for copyright-related violations.<br>
<br>6.
As soon as the compensation due the tester as per Sections 3.7 and 4 has been established, but no later than two weeks after job order processing has finished, the corresponding credit voucher shall be issued to the tester’s account as per the payment conditions specified in the job description.
No interest is paid on the credit vouchers.<br>
<br>1.
Testers may check the status of their credit vouchers at any time.
