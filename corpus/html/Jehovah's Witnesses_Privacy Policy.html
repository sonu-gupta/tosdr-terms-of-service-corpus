This Policy sets out the basis on which any personal data that we collect from you or that you provide to us will be processed on our website.
We keep certain basic information when you visit our website and recognize the importance of keeping that information secure and letting you know what we will do with it.
You may choose to provide us with information that is considered personal data.
The term “personal data” as used in this Policy refers to information such as your name, e-mail address, mailing address, telephone number, or any other data that can be used to identify you.
You are not required to provide any personal information to browse the public areas of this website.
The term “website” includes this website and our associated sites, such as apps.jw.org, ba.jw.org, stream.jw.org, and wol.jw.org.</p> &nbsp;DATA CONTROLLER INFORMATION <p>This website is owned by Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc.
(“Watchtower”), a New York not-for-profit corporation that supports the activities of Jehovah’s Witnesses and their Bible education.
If you voluntarily decide to open an account, make a donation, request a visit, or otherwise take any action that involves providing personal data, you consent to this Policy, as well as to the storage of your data on servers located in the United States of America and to the collection, processing, transfer, and storage of your personal data by Watchtower and cooperating organizations that support Jehovah’s Witnesses in various countries as needed to process your requested action.
The religious organization operates globally through various local entities.
For data protection purposes, these may include local congregations, branch offices, and other similar cooperating organizations of Jehovah’s Witnesses.</p>
<p>The data controller for your personal data varies depending on the nature of your interaction with the website.
For example, if you donate to a legal entity in a particular country, your name and contact information will be provided to that legal entity as identified to you during the donation process.
As another example, if you request a visit, your name and contact information will be provided to a local branch office and congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses to fulfill your request.</p>
<p>To assist you, if the country you reside in has applicable data protection laws, you may find the contact information for the country you reside in on the Data Protection Contacts page.</p> &nbsp;DATA SECURITY AND CONFIDENTIALITY <p>We take the security and confidentiality of your personal data very seriously.
We use up-to-date data storage and security techniques to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, improper use or disclosure, unauthorized modification, unlawful destruction, or accidental loss.

Additionally, you may receive e-mails or text messages through a third party based on a request you make through this website for information, including notification of activities you have requested information about.
At the time the third parties are selected, and periodically thereafter, their privacy and data protection policies are inspected to ensure that they meet the same standards we use for our own policies.
However, these third parties provide apps and services whose programming, terms of use, privacy policies, and general conditions we cannot control.
For this reason, your use of those apps and services on this website is subject to the current terms of service and general conditions set by the third party.
We are not informed of updates, so please review the terms before using the third-party service.
