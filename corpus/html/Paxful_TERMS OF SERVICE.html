TERMS OF SERVICE Effective Date: March 4, 2021 <p>THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS, AS WELL AS CONDITIONS, LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS THAT MIGHT APPLY TO YOU.
PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY.</p>
<p>These Terms of Service and any amendments and restatements hereof (the “<strong>Agreement</strong>”) form a legal agreement covering the provision of services from Paxful to you, including offering a marketplace to enable buyers and sellers of “Digital Assets” (such term to be broadly understood to include digital currencies such as Bitcoin, Tether, and others, supported by a Paxful wallet) to engage in transactions with each other (the “<strong>Marketplace</strong>”), offering hosted digital wallet services, holding and releasing Digital Assets as instructed upon completion of a purchase of Digital Assets and any other services described in this Agreement (collectively the “<strong>Services</strong>” and individually, a “<strong>Service</strong>”) provided by Paxful, Inc.
and all of its affiliates, including but not limited to Paxful USA, Inc.(collectively, “<strong>Paxful</strong>” or “<strong>we</strong>” or “<strong>us</strong>” or the “company”) to you as an individual (also referred to as a “<strong>user</strong>” or “<strong>you</strong>”).
Paxful.com and its related Services are owned and operated by Paxful.
Your use of the Services will be governed by this Agreement, along with our Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, and E-Sign Consent.</p>
<p>THESE TERMS REQUIRE THE USE OF ARBITRATION TO RESOLVE DISPUTES RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS.</p>
<p>By signing up to use an account through paxful.com, or any associated websites, APIs, or mobile applications, including any URLs operated by Paxful (collectively the “<strong>Paxful Website</strong>” or the “<strong>Website</strong>”), you agree that you have carefully and thoroughly read, understand, and accept all of the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement including our Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, and E-Sign Consent.</p>
<p>THE VALUE OF DIGITAL ASSETS CAN GO UP OR DOWN AND THERE CAN BE A SUBSTANTIAL RISK THAT YOU LOSE MONEY BUYING, SELLING, HOLDING, OR INVESTING IN DIGITAL ASSETS.
YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER WHETHER TRADING OR HOLDING DIGITAL ASSETS IS SUITABLE FOR YOU IN LIGHT OF YOUR FINANCIAL CONDITION.</p> About Paxful and its Services <p>Paxful is a leading peer-to-peer marketplace to facilitate the purchase and sale of Digital Assets with sellers accepting more than 300 payment methods in exchange for their Digital Assets.
Payment methods are negotiated and exchanged on a peer-to-peer basis between the buyers in the Marketplace (“<strong>Buyers</strong>”) and sellers in the Marketplace (“<strong>Sellers</strong>”).
Our users agree upon which payment methods to use to complete a transaction and are fully responsible and liable for using such payment methods in a lawful manner.</p>
<p>Paxful also offers hosted digital wallet services through a leading global digital asset wallet provider.
Our worldwide userbase is able to post offers to either buy or sell Digital Assets in a variety of convenient methods.
The creator of the offer is responsible for listing terms of the transaction, including the payment methods the Seller will accept.
Once an offer is selected by another Paxful user, the Seller’s Digital Assets are locked as part of our transaction procedures (which we refer to as “Paxful Escrow”) until all conditions necessary to consummate the transaction have occurred.
The sale is complete and Digital Assets are unlocked and released to the Buyer by the Seller once the Buyer has completed the terms of the transaction and payment has been confirmed valid and received by the Seller.
PAXFUL DOES NOT ACT AS A PAYMENT PROCESSOR.
ALL LIABILITY FOR SENDING AND RECEIVING PAYMENT AND CONFIRMING THE VALIDITY OF THE TRANSACTIONS LIE BETWEEN THE BUYER AND SELLER.
The Digital Assets we lock are released back to the Seller if the Buyer chooses to cancel the transaction.
The Seller may not cancel the transaction at any point.
The Seller only has the option to unlock the Digital Assets and release it to the Buyer.
This is for the security protection for the Buyer.
Should a Seller need to cancel the transaction due to a Buyer not following the terms of the transaction, they must start a dispute and provide a reason for doing so as further described in Section 8 of this Agreement.
Transactions on our Website are conducted between the Buyers and Sellers.
Accordingly, Paxful is not a party to any transaction.</p>
<p>The hosted digital currency wallet service provided by Paxful is a secure method of storing, sending, and receiving digital currency.
Paxful does not store or custody any Digital Assets.
Digital Assets are always stored on its respective networks or blockchains.
All digital currency transactions occur within the digital currency network, not on Paxful.
There are no guarantees that the transaction will process on the digital currency network.
Paxful reserves the right to refuse to process any transaction if required by law or if we deem the transactions to be against our terms and conditions in this Agreement.
You hereby accept and acknowledge that you take full responsibility for all activities that occur under your wallet and accept all risks of any authorized or unauthorized access to your wallet, to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>

<li>
<p>Arbitration.
You and Paxful agree that any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Services, shall be finally settled in binding arbitration, on an individual basis, in accordance with the American Arbitration Association’s rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes (accessible at https://www.adr.org/rules).
Subject to applicable jurisdictional requirements, consumer claimants (individuals whose transaction is intended for personal, family, or household use) may elect to pursue their claims in their local small-claims court rather than through arbitration so long as their matter remains in small claims court and proceeds only on an individual (non-class or non-representative) basis.</p>
<p>
<u>CLASS ACTION WAIVER: TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, ALL CLAIMS WILL ONLY BE BROUGHT ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE ACTION, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING (COLLECTIVELY “CLASS ACTION WAIVER”).
THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS OR ENGAGE IN ANY CLASS ARBITRATION.
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT, BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, YOU AND PAXFUL ARE EACH WAIVING ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND YOU ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST PAXFUL.</u>
</p>
<p>The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.
§§ 1-16, fully applies to the arbitration.
The arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator and shall take place in the State of Delaware, or another mutually agreeable location, in the English language.
The arbitrator may award any relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could award, including attorneys’ fees when authorized by law, and the arbitral decision may be entered as a judgement and enforced in any court of law.
At your request, hearings may be conducted in person or by telephone and the arbitrator may provide for submitting and determining motions on briefs, without oral hearings.
The prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce this Agreement shall be entitled to costs and attorneys’ fees.</p>
<p>If the arbitrator(s) or arbitration administrator would impose filing fees or other administrative costs on you, we will reimburse you, upon request, to the extent such fees or costs would exceed those that you would otherwise have to pay if you were proceeding instead in a court.
We will also pay additional fees or costs if required to do so by the arbitration administrator’s rules or applicable law.
Apart from the foregoing, each party will be responsible for any other fees or costs, such as attorney fees that the party may incur.</p>
</li>
<li>If any part of this Agreement is held by any arbitrator or court of United States to be invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part, the validity or enforceability of the other sections of these terms and conditions shall not be affected.

<li> DISPUTING TRANSACTIONS VIA PAXFUL’S DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS <ol>
<li>Disputing Transactions.
In most cases, the easiest way to settle a dispute is for Buyers and Sellers to communicate, work together to figure out what happened, and come to an agreeable solution.
When a Buyer and a Seller cannot come to an agreeable solution, Paxful’s support team (“<strong>Paxful Support</strong>”) can help.
Either party can initiate the dispute resolution process (“<strong>disputed transaction</strong>” or “<strong>dispute</strong>”) with respect to a transaction.
Disputes can only be initiated on transactions that are marked as fully paid by the Buyer.
Transactions that are not marked as fully paid by the Buyer, cancelled by the Buyer, automatically cancelled due to expiration of the timeframe set forth in the offer, already disputed and resolved or where the Seller has released the Digital Assets to the Buyer generally cannot be disputed, reversed, or altered.</li>
<li>
<p>
<u>Dispute Resolution Process.</u> Below are the steps Paxful Support takes in the event of a dispute.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
<em>Initiation</em>
</p>
<p>You can initiate a dispute by logging into your Paxful Account, opening the transaction you would like to dispute and selecting the “dispute” button.
The “dispute” button will only appear active if the transaction has been marked as fully paid by the Buyer.
Once you initiate a dispute, you will select the type of dispute from the options presented and describe the issue giving rise to your dispute.</p>
<p>The options presented for describing your dispute if you are a Seller are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coinlocker (i.e.
an unresponsive Buyer) – the Buyer has marked the transaction as fully paid, but is unresponsive and inactive.</li>
<li>Payment issue – the Buyer is active and has attempted to pay, but there are issues with the payment.</li>
<li>Other – an open option where you can describe what issue gave rise to the dispute.
The Buyer will be able to view your description.</li>
</ul>
<p>The options presented for describing your dispute if you are a Buyer are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unresponsive vendor – you have paid, but the Seller is unresponsive and inactive.</li>
<li>Payment issue – you have made the payment, but the Seller claims there are issues with the payment and refuses to release the Digital Assets.</li>
<li>Other – an open option where you can describe what issue gave rise to the dispute.
The Seller will be able to view your description.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<em>Notification</em>
</p>
<p>Once a dispute has been submitted, Paxful Support will provide the other party with notification by email and by sending a message through the transaction chat feature available to Buyers and Sellers in the Marketplace alerting such party that a dispute has been initiated.
If one of your transactions is being disputed, Paxful Support will tell you which transaction is being disputed and why the transaction is being disputed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<em>Response</em>
</p>
<p>Review the dispute and provide Paxful Support with an explanation of what happened.
Include any evidence you have to support your explanation, such as proof of payment, proof of ownership or proof that you have or have not received payment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<em>Paxful Review</em>
</p>
<p>Disputed transactions will be investigated by Paxful Support and a decision will be made based upon evidence provided by both parties.
Paxful Support resolves disputes by evaluating various factors as described below in Section 8.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<u>Dispute Review</u>.
During a dispute review, Paxful Support may give you instructions that you are required to follow.
The instructions given to you may require you to provide additional evidence, such as additional ID verification, proof of payment, any photo, audio, or video evidence, or any other documents deemed relevant by Paxful and may require you to provide such evidence within a specified timeframe.
Failure to follow the instructions may lead to the dispute being resolved against you.
Paxful Support will typically provide notice of its decision via the transaction chat feature in the Marketplace within 30 days of receiving the dispute, but under some circumstances, it may take longer.</li>
<li>
<u>Unresponsiveness</u>.
When you are involved in a transaction, it is important that you remain active and available from the time the transaction is started to the time that the transaction is completed, canceled, or resolved.
This means that you must be able to provide a response to a request by Paxful Support in a disputed transaction within the time specified by Paxful Support or you may be deemed as unresponsive and the dispute may be resolved against you.</li>
<li>
<u>Chargebacks</u>.
A party may face additional risks depending on the payment method used for the transaction even if Paxful’s dispute resolution process finds in favor of such party.
The dispute resolution process set forth in this Agreement is separate from any remedies a Buyer or Seller may have through the payment method used in connection with a transaction.
Paxful is not obligated to initiate or handle chargebacks and is not liable if a party reverses, charges back, or otherwise disputes a transaction via an avenue made available to the party through the payment method used in the transaction, including after a dispute is closed.</li>
<li>
<p>
<u>Dispute Resolution</u>.
A disputed transaction is most commonly resolved by Paxful Support moving the Digital Assets subject to the dispute to the Buyer or the Seller of the disputed transaction once the dispute resolution process is complete.</p>
<p>Below are selected situations to provide you with insight as to how Paxful may resolve a disputed transaction.
This is not meant to be an exhaustive list.
The resolution of any dispute will be impacted by the specific facts of the dispute and evidence provided by the users.</p>
<p>Paxful Support may resolve a dispute in the Buyer’s favor when at least one of the following criteria are met:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Buyer has made payment according to the initial instructions provided by the Seller pursuant to the transaction offer and the Buyer has provided sufficient proof that the payment was made according to these instructions.
It is a violation of this Agreement for a Seller to refuse to complete a transaction once the Buyer has satisfied all of the Seller’s terms and conditions as posted at the time the Buyer accepted and paid for the transaction.</li>
<li>The Seller has become unresponsive and has not provided a sufficient response within the timeframe requested by Paxful Support.</li>
<li>The payment is made to a third party to the transaction or the payment is made to a payment account not registered in the name of the Seller.</li>
</ul>
<p>Paxful Support may resolve a dispute in the Seller’s favor when one of the following criteria are met:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Buyer has not provided payment, not provided payment in full or not provided payment according to the initial instructions provided by the Seller pursuant to the transaction offer.</li>
<li>The payment made by the Buyer has been held, suspended, frozen or stopped by the payment provider or processor.
This includes situations in which the Buyer has charged back or disputed a payment via its bank or payment card issuer.</li>
<li>The Buyer has become unresponsive and has not provided a sufficient response within the timeframe requested Paxful Support.</li>
<li>The payment is made by a third party to the transaction or the payment is made from a payment account not registered in the name of the Buyer.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the Buyer or the Seller of a disputed transaction provides fraudulent information or fraudulent documents or makes false claims or otherwise uses deceptive tactics, the dispute may be immediately resolved against such user and such user’s account may be immediately suspended or terminated at the sole discretion of Paxful Support.</p>
<p>In some situations where neither party fulfills the criteria, or it is in other ways unclear or not possible to determine which party has fulfilled the dispute resolution criteria in Paxful’s sole and absolute discretion, Paxful may decide to resolve the dispute by splitting the Digital Assets subject to the dispute between the Buyer and the Seller evenly or unevenly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<u>Appeal</u>.
If you believe Paxful has resolved a dispute in a way which is not in accordance with this Agreement, you have a right to request an appeal.
To request an appeal, you need to promptly notify us in writing by contacting Paxful customer support no later than 10 calendar days after notice of Paxful Support’s decision is delivered to you and provide us with sufficient details and evidence supporting your case for request.
Your appeal should specifically identify how you believe Paxful incorrectly resolved the dispute as per the terms of this Agreement and provide evidence of such incorrect decision.</p>
<p>Please be reminded that whether during the dispute process or generally any time when using our Services, you are obligated to keep a civil tone and be respectful to other users and Paxful Support.
See generally, “Section 13 - Prohibited Use”.</p>
