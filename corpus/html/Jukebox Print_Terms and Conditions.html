If a refund is requested 24 hours after the date it was purchased then a 5% transaction fee will apply regardless if any files have been uploaded.
This is to offset the transaction fee Jukebox needs to pay its merchant.
Custom orders that require a specialty order for a paper stock or other material that is not kept in stock will not qualify for a complete refund.
The customer will either need to pay a restocking fee of 25% of the order or need to pay for the entire contents of the specialty material if it can not be returned.</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colour Shift: You acknowledge and agree that JukeBox will not be responsible for any color shift that occurs in conversions from RGB to CMYK or PMS Pantone colors to CMYK color modes.

<p>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colour Proofing &amp.
Ink Matching: JukeBox is not responsible for matching color or ink density on the Products to the Product Proofs.
While Product Proofs will predict design layout, text accuracy, image proportion and placement, they cannot be used to assess color or ink density in the Products.
You acknowledge and agree that the Product Proofs do not show transparency and over print issues, and they do not reflect colour change from RGB to CMYK.
Proofing does not check for hidden layers artwork and JukeBox will not be responsible for any print issues resulting from hidden layers.
You acknowledge and agree that JukeBox may produce the Products with other products ordered by other customers, and as such, there may be deviation in colour or ink density in the Products when compared to the Product Proofs.
JukeBox accepts no responsibility for color variations between submitted images and the actual artwork or product they represent.&nbsp.
Jukebox does not print using pantones or specialty inks, as it only uses CMYK to process print jobs.

<p>(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order Approval: You are responsible for reviewing each Order and the Product Proof provided to you prior to making an Order.
JukeBox will not accept changes to Orders you have placed.
In the event you accidentally made an incorrect Order, including, without limitation, the uploading of the wrong file, JukeBox will charge a $10 re-submission fee, although you may still have to bear the cost of the initial Order as JukeBox may have already processed the Order and began production.
In the event Jukebox already started production of the Products, JukeBox, in its absolute discretion, has the right to reject any re-submissions.&nbsp.
Where you fail to review the Product Proof and ask JukeBox to print the Products without review or approval of the Product Proof, you will do so your own risk, and JukeBox will not be responsible for any errors, problems, or other issues with the Products where the Product Proof has not been reviewed.

JukeBox does not represent or warrant that the Product produced on a re-order will be identical to the Products produced under the original Order.</p>
<p>(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order Cancellation: An Order cannot be cancelled or modifed once it has gone into production, and JukeBox is not responsibile for any refunds once the Order has gone into production.
If an Order is a Custom Print and stock, materials or procedures need to be conducted specifically for this order, a full refund will not be able even if the order has yet to go into production.
JukeBox is not responsible for any duplicated orders that are placed on the Website.</p>
<p>(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warnings: Jukebox sends out warnings before emailing proofs, about potential problems that may occur during printing.
These messages are sent during the proofing process and it is your responsibility to read these warnings before accepting the proof.
If you accept the proof without changing these potential problems then JukeBox is not responsible if this error(s) occurs during printing.
A reprint will not be honored in such situations.
Some of the most come warnings are: text too close to edges, boarders, fraying of cards when dark colours are used, low resolution and colour matching (most common ones are: blood red, navy blue and specific greys).</p>
<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reprints: A reprint will only be honoured if a shipping error or printing error occurs.
Shipping errors occur if a package is damaged or lost after being picked up by a shipping provider.
Since these issues are not directly related to issues cause by JukeBox, customers will first need to file the issue with the appropriate shipping provider.
Once this has been done, JukeBox can then file a claim with the shipping provider to receive compensation.
If the claim is not approved by the shipping provide, and JukeBox is not compensated, then it is to the discretion of JukeBox if a reprint can be honoured.
Shipping providers need adequate evidence to approve a claim.
It is the responsibility of the customer to supply the proper proof (pictures, samples, tracking number, etc) for the claim.</p>
<p>Printing errors are classified as misprints or trimming issues that are caused by mistakes in the production process that are outside a machinines error values.
The reason a reprint is offered for these issues is because if the order were printed again using the same conditions, the issue would not happen again.
Machines are maintained and calibrated to the keep them funcitoning properly, but there are still error values associated with each machine, which do not qualify orders for a reprint if they fall within these values.
The purpose of a reprint is to replace a defective product.
however, if a shift occurs on the cards that is within the error values of the machines, this does not qualify as a printing error.
JukeBox asks for .125" of bleed on all print files because of the shifts that can occur when printing and trimming an order.
If there is a shift (off center) of 0.0625 inches or less, this will not be classified as a printing error and will not qualify for a reprint.
Depending on when a card is printed, there can be similar colour shifts that occur from one press run to the next.
If the same CMYK values are used for printing multiple orders on separate press runs (ordered at different times), there is a potential&nbsp.
colour shift of 10% between runs.
An order will not qualify for a reprint if there is a 10% colour variation or less from the previous order.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The exact same file will need to be used for the reprint process.
If a client requests to change their file, this will be considered a new order.
Any design errors will not be given a reprint as it is the responsibility of the client to look over their proof before approving it to print.
“File error” and other warning messages are sent out for this reason.
If the client decides to proceed with an order without changing their design, then they take complete responsibility if such error occurs.<br>
The only way a reprint will be able to be considered is if Jukebox (1) 5% of the finished product is return with the same printing error on all the card or (2) a claim is granted by Jukebox’s shipping provider for any lost or damaged package(s).
It is in the sole discretion of JukeBox to request more than 5% of the order, including the whole order, if the entire order needs to be reprinted.
Reprints will only be honoured if a request is submitted within 14 days after receiving your product.
Reprints for shipping errors will take two weeks before getting approved or declined as shipping claims take two weeks to be processed.
If a reprint is being shipped out for a second time and the price of shipping exceeds 20% of the product cost before taxes, then the customer must pay for 50% for the shipping cost.
Customers will have to pay for shipping in full when an order has been shipped out more than twice.</p>
<p>(j)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Design Orders: Design quotes are based on the estimated time it will take to complete.
In some cases, this time will be over or under estimated.
however, the price will remain the same once the design quote has been accepted by the customer.
A design service does not include the printing price unless stated.<br>
A design order will be completed once you have accepted your design proof.
If you are unhappy with the finished design(s) then another design quote will be sent out for any changes that JukeBox needs to make.
If the changes are minor, and if Jukebox has not gone over their estimated time to complete such design, a change may be made with no additional fee under the discretion of JukeBox.
A DESIGN ORDER CAN NOT BE CANCELLED OR PARTIALLY REFUNDED ONCE THE FINAL DESIGN HAS BEEN SENT TO THE CUSTOMER.
If you decide to cancel a design order after being paid for and before being completed, then you will need to pay for services rendered, which is a minimum of $75 per hour.
If no design work has been done when an order is cancelled, then the customer will only need to pay a 5% transaction fee on the price of their order, if cancelled later then the date of purchase.</p>
<p>(k)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
<u>Sample Packs</u>: Sample packs are sent out to provide an idea of what a finished product may look like.
JukeBox does not guarantee stock or coating consistency of a finished product.
Various seasonal and economical factors may affect the printing process, and for this reason, finished products may vary from the samples received.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(l)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
<u>Finished Product:</u> Jukebox will not offer a reprint or compensation if less than 5% of the product quantity is missing or defective.
This is because specific bindery services can damage products, limiting the number of the finished product.</p>
<p>For orders that have been selected as "pick up", the customer will need to pick these orders up within 6 months of the order being ready.
Due to the large volume of products and limited inventory space, cards may be removed and recycled after this time.</p>
<p>(m)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
<u>Sale Items:</u>&nbsp;No other promotions, promo codes, in-store credits, customer discount levels, sponsorship discounts or other discounts can be used on sale items.
All files for sale item orders are required to be proof accepted within one week (7 days) from the date the sale expires, unless otherwise stated.
If the files on the order are approved after thiese 7 days, the customer will need to pay the regular price of the cards as it is listed on the website for the same product.
For regularly priced cards, customers will have 6 months&nbsp;to approve their file(s) to guarantee no price change.
If the files are uploaded after this time then the person will need to pay the price of the cards as listed on our website.
Sale items can only be rushed to meet a deadline if the regular price of the item is paid for plus any applicable rush charges.</p>
<p>Sale prices can only be honoured during the designerd sale time.
Products placed before the sale date can only be honoured during the sale if the order has yet to go into "prepress".
If the order is in "prepress", or has previously been in prepress, than the sale price can not be honoured.</p>
<p>Promotional products that are ordered, or given away, at no charge to the customer, do not qualify for any form of compensation if there is an error with printing, designing, shipping, etc.</p>
<p>(n)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
<u>Saved Designs:</u> Due to the large volume of files received, Jukebox does not save files internally.
Files attached to orders will be removed 1 month after the file is uploaded.
For designs that Jukebox Print creates, files may be able to be found on internal hardware, but this can not be guaranteed.
All customers are responsible for saving all completed designs on thier computers.</p>
<p>Saved designs using our online card creator will only be saved for 6 months.
These designs will need to be downloaded as a pdf and saved on the customer's computer to access them after 6 months.
It is also not the responsibility for Jukebox to fix any design errors that occured when making a card on the online card creator.</p>
<p>o)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.
<u>In-Store Credits:</u> An in-store credits can be offered only if an order is cancelled before being put into "prepress" - to avoid cancellation fees- or may be offered as a form of compensation.
The amount of compensation is solely based on JukeBox's discretion.
An in-store credit will not be issued for any order that was paid for using an existing credit.
however, the order may qualify for a reprint, but only at the discretion of JukeBox.</p>
<p>To claim an in-store credit a customer must supply their previous order number that the compensation was meant for.&nbsp.
This is the only way the compensation can be confirmed by JukeBox.
Emails will not be sufficient enough to validate an in-store credit.
Promo codes with be generated for customers to redeem their in-store credits.
Promo codes will only be valid until their expiry date.
When an order is cancelled, or compensation is given, a promo code will be sent to the customer's account email (or the email that is on the order being compensated if the customer does not have an account).
In-store credits are valid for a maximum of one year from the date the promo code is issued.&nbsp.
If a customer does not use their credit within the year, or has only used a portion of it by the expiry date, the remaining amount will be forfeited.</p>
<p>If the amount of a promo code exceeds the cost of the product, then two smaller promo codes may be issued instead BUT ONLY if the initial promo code has yet to be used.
If a promo code has already been used then no more credit will be issued.</p>
<p>p) <u>Custom Jobs</u>: Custom jobs are generated internally by staff of JukeBox and are therefor subject to human error.
If an error occurs with pricing, stock, coating, turnaround time or any other specification on the order, JukeBox has the right to cancel the order and refund the customer.
Also, any miss communication that occurs between JukeBox estimators and customers during the quoting process will not qualify the customer for a reprint.
It is the responsibilty of the customer to check the accuracy of the quote before proceeding with payment.
JukeBox will only be responsible for printing what is listed on the customer's invoice and reserves the right to cancel the order at any time regardless of the error that was made.
Any cancellation of an incorrect quote will still be subject to the same pentalies as listed under "Product Proof and No Refunds".</p>
<p>q) <u>Rush Orders:</u> Rush Orders are the only way to guarantee a completion date, otherwise all Order completion dates are estimates, which depends on how large the print queue is.
If a deadline is required then it will need to be speified before an Order is placed.
In most cases a rush fee will be able to be added to the Order to guarantee the deadline.
Rush fees can only be added to Orders before they go into production.
however, the shipping method can still be upgrade to a faster service until the Order is shipped.
If an Order does not meet the Rush deadline specified then the customer is entitled to only the rush charge refunded and not the standard cost to produce the Order.</p>
<p>r) <u>Gift Cards:</u> Gift cards from Jukebox can be used towards the purchase of any product on www.jukeboxprint.com.
For sale items and custom jobs, gift card promo codes will need to be applied manually by a Customer Service Representative: our customer service team can be reached at 888 667 0067 or via email at contact@jukeboxprint.com.</p>
<p>Gift cards cannot be exchanged for cash and have no cash value.
Lost or stolen cards will not be replaced.

In the event of such delay, JukeBox may, in its discretion, refund or waive any rush fees applicable to an Order.
