</ul> English, not Legalese <p>Most Terms of Service and Privacy Policy documents are unreadable.
They are written by lawyers and for lawyers, and in our opinion are not very effective.
</p>
<p>Because we believe in establishing long-term relationships with our customers, we decided to use plain English instead, to make our terms as clear as possible.
</p>
<p>Please don’t forget that we are real people: take a look at our about page to get to know us a little.
We are not perfect, but we’re trying our hardest, because we genuinely care about your success.
</p>
<p>When you read Orr Group or "we" below, it refers to The Orr Group, LLC, its affiliates, and agents.
</p>

</p>
<p>We do not collect Credit Card information directly.

Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.
We may also collect information that your browser automatically sends when you visit the Roll20 site or when you use Roll20, such as your IP address, “cookie information, and the pages you visit.
We use this information to gather general statistics on your usage and for abuse prevention.
Your internet browser must be enabled to accept cookies from roll20.net in order for you to use Roll20.
Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether.
For more information about cookies, see the Unofficial Cookie FAQ at cookiecentral.com.
You can opt out of certain internet advertising through the Network Advertising Initiative’s (NAI) Opt Out Tool (http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices) and in the EU at http://www.youronlinechoices.com/.
We, and third-party vendors acting on our behalf use web tools like first-party and third-party cookies, tracking pixels, and scripting techniques to gather and store anonymous analytics and statistics about the Roll20 and how it is being used so we can improve it.
</p> California Disclosures <p>The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 ("CCPA") requires us to provide additional privacy-related information and rights to residents of California.
The section above What personal information do we collect and why? lists the categories of personal information we have collected and used from and about California residents in the preceding 12 months.
</p>
<p>The section below How is my data shared? lists who we have shared personal information with in the preceding 12 months for the following purposes: 1) to provide and improve the Roll20 site and products.
2) to communicate with you for Roll20 support, including with helpdesk tickets.
3) for payment processing.
4) for security and compliance reasons, including monitoring forum posts, in-game chat logs, private messages and wish lists.
and 5) to meet our legal requirements.
The personal information we collect, use and share correspond with the following categories of personal information provided under the CCPA:
</p>
<p>•	Identifiers including name, username, IP address, email address and account number.
•	Information that identifies or is capable of being associated with under the California Customer Records statute (Cal.
Civ.
Code § 1798.80(e)).
•	Commercial information about Roll20 products purchased and Paizo products purchased (if you connect your Paizo account to Roll20).
•	Internet and network activity information.
and
•	Inferences drawn from any of your personal information collected reflecting your preferences and profile.
</p>
<p>Subject to certain exceptions, California residents have the right to: (i) request access to your personal information.
and (ii) request deletion of your personal information.
If you want to exercise your CCPA rights, please visit our web form or contact us and include “CCPA Request” in the subject line of your email at:
</p>
<p>Attn: Data Protection Officer Jeffrey Lamb team@roll20.net
</p>
<p>We try to respond to all requests within 10 days.
To protect your privacy, we may need additional information so we can verify your identity before fulfilling your request.
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.
</p> Who can see my password? <p>No-one.
We never store your password unencrypted, so no-one can read it.
</p>
<p>It is your sole responsibility to keep your email, password and other sensitive information confidential.
If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security, you shall notify Orr Group immediately.
</p>
<p>If you forget your password, we send you a secure link via email that lets you reset it.
</p> Who can see my credit card number? <p>No-one at Orr Group.
We use the very trustworthy and secure Stripe payment service.
Read about their security measures on the Stripe Terms of Service (in short, they encrypt your credit card info using industry-standard practices).
</p> Our Commitment to Children’s Privacy <p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important.
For that reason, minors in the US who are under 13 and minors in the EU who are under 16 cannot use Roll20.
If you are a minor, you can only use Roll20 with your parents or guardians.
We never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are minors.
If we learn that a minor has provided personal information to us without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information.
</p> How can I access or correct my information? <p>You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by logging in to Roll20 and visiting the My Account page.
</p> Who can access my campaigns and other content? <p>By default, all campaigns and other assets that you create or upload to Roll20 are private.
However, if you invite players to join your game, or choose to share your campaigns with other Roll20 users, then they will have access to view those specific campaigns and any assets used in those campaigns.
Any assets that you upload to the Roll20 Marketplace will also be made public under the license that you select when the asset is submitted.
</p> What are the guidelines Orr Group follows when accessing my data? <p>•	We restrict who at Orr Group can access customer data on as needed basis.
</p>
<p>•	We only do it in response to a customer support question, or to look at issues affecting the entire Roll20 application.
</p>
<p>•	We only do it in order to debug and fix the issue.
</p>
<p>•	We never make changes to anything unless explicitly requested by a user.
</p>
<p>•	We never ever ever share what we see with other customers or the general public.
</p>
<p>•	We might give access to US authorities if requested in writing.
We’ll try not to, but we don’t have the resources to fight the government.
We’ll also keep the account owner informed as much as we can if this happens.
</p> How is my data protected from another customer’s data? <p>All of our customers’ data resides in the same database.
We use software best practices to guarantee that only people who you designate as viewers of your data can access it.
In other words, we segment our customer data via software.
We do our best and are very confident we’re doing a good job at it, but, like every other web app that hosts their customers data on the same database, cannot guarantee that a sophisticated hacker cannot access other people’s data.
If you believe that your data is no longer secure, please contact us immediately.

</p>

</p> How is my data shared? <p>We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to others and have not done so in the past 12 months.

2) with our third-party service providers to perform tasks on our behalf, including hosting, database, network, payment processing, and relate services to support Roll20.
and 3) if we sell all or part of our business, make a transfer pursuant to a merger, or are involved in a bankruptcy.
If we want to share your personal information for another purpose not covered by this Privacy Policy, then we will provide you with notice explaining this new sharing and obtain your consent (if applicable) prior to doing so.

</p> Governing Law and Jurisdiction <p>The Roll20 service (excluding linked sites) is controlled by The Orr Group, LLC from its offices within the state of Kansas, United States of America.
By accessing Roll20, you agree that all matters relating to your access to, or use of, Roll20 shall be governed by the statutes and laws of the State of Kansas, without regard to the conflicts of laws principles thereof.
The parties specifically disclaim the U.N.
Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.
You also agree and hereby submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of the Superior Court of Sedgwick County and the United States District Court for the 18th Judicial District of Kansas with respect to such matters.
</p> General <p>The Terms of Service and other rules, guidelines, licenses and disclaimers posted via Roll20 or in connection with the Materials and Services constitute the entire agreement between Orr Group and you with respect to your access to or use of the Roll20 service and materials superseding any prior agreements between you and Orr Group on such subject matter (including any prior versions of the Terms of Service).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that any terms set forth in the Terms of Service expressly contradict any terms of a written agreement between you and Orr Group regarding the use of specific Services or Materials (including Service-specific Terms of Service and Software-specific licenses) (“Executed Agreement”), such contradictory terms set forth in the Executed Agreement shall govern.
You may also be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use other Orr Group services, third party content or third party software.
You may not assign or otherwise transfer the Terms of Service nor any right granted hereunder without Orr Group’s prior written consent.
If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of the Terms of Service, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties as reflected by that provision, and the remainder of the Terms of Service shall continue in full force and effect.
Any failure by Orr Group to enforce or exercise any provision of the Terms of Service or related right shall not constitute a waiver of that right or provision.
The section titles used in the Terms of Service are purely for convenience and carry with them no legal or contractual effect.
