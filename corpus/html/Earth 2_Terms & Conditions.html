        Introduction<p>Earth 2 is a futuristic concept for a second earth, a meta-verse, between virtual and physical reality in which real-world geolocations on a sectioned map correspond to user-generated digital virtual environments.
Once fully developed, these environments will be able to be owned, bought, sold and deeply customised and will evolve over time limited only by users’ imaginations.</p>
<p> Earth 2 will be a digital and virtual world being a 1:1 scale of the planet Earth, which will then set a stage on which a much wider set of activities besides world-building can take place.
We are undertaking this massive project in two stages.
</p>Stage 1<p> In Phase 1 (Stage 1), we will launch our Website which will include a global trading platform for ownership of Virutal Land inside Earth 2.
It will enable users to explore the concept, and buy, sell, trade, bid, search and select Virtual Land to purchase in Earth 2.
</p>Stage 2<p> In Stage 2, we will go live with the interactive Earth 2 platform, and players can interact with one another inside the Earth 2 environment.
We currently expect the Earth 2 environment to be launched in the near future with a firm release date pending.
</p>
<p>These Website terms and conditions are made up of three parts:</p>
<ol>
<li> Part A – which applies to all users of our Website, whether you are just browsing, or are a registered user capable of buying and selling Virtual Land.

</p>Part C - Buying and Selling Virtual Land in Earth 2<p> A key aspect of the Earth 2 platform will be the ability for registered users to buy and sell land tiles (<b>Virtual Land</b>).
</p>
<p> To be eligible to buy and sell Virtual Land, you must first register as a user of the Website as set out in Part B above.
</p>
<p> Each tile of Virtual Land will be a virtual equivalent to a real-world measurement of approximately 10x10m, although they may not all be of exactly identical size.
The size and positioning of the Virtual Land is established and controlled by us in our sole discretion.
</p>
<p> The first-sale of each tile of Virtual Land will be based on a value that we assign to it in USD.
Future sales between registered users will be struck at a price agreed between those users.
</p>
<p> All subsequent sales of Virtual Land between registered users must be conducted through the marketplace that we provide on the Website for that purpose (Marketplace).
We do not promise that the Marketplace will be always available, or that there will be an uninterrupted connection between the Marketplace and any Payment Account.
</p>
<p> Sales of Virtual Land will be conducted in credits on the Website that are equivalent to USD.
It is each user’s responsibility to ensure they have sufficient credits to perform any transaction.
Transactions made using credits are ultimately settled through payments of USD amounts equivalent to the Website credits, between Payment Accounts, credit cards, or any other method that we accept from time to time (for instance, we may in the future expand to accept payment in one or more crypto-currencies).
</p>
<p> Each registered user must maintain a valid Payment Account, linked and valid credit card (or other approved method from time to time) through which payments for Website credit-based transactions can be made, and must ensure the details of that account are kept up to date within the Website.
</p>
<p> The Website will maintain a register of account balances (credits) for convenience, but the accounts behind the payment methods are operated separately from us and we are not responsible for their operation, balances or accuracy.
</p>
<p> If the registered user who holds the rights in any Virtual Land (Seller) wishes to sell that Virtual Land, it can place the land for sale on the Marketplace.
Other registered users can bid on that Virtual Land, and the successful buyer (as determined by the Seller) will become eligible to take ownership of the Virtual Land (Buyer), subject to paying the agreed price to the Seller for the relevant Virtual Land, and payment to us of the relevant transaction fee (which is listed in the Marketplace) (Transaction Fee).
</p>
<p> Without limiting any aspect of Part B of these terms, you must not acquire Virtual Land for the purpose of inciting religious or racial tensions, or engage in any conduct or behavior in connection with Virtual Land that is designed or is likely to incite religious or racial tensions.
In addition to other rights we may have under these terms and under applicable law (including the right to cancel your membership without compensation), we may elect to compulsorily acquire Virtual Land from you without notice (for the same price as you first paid for that Virtual Land) if we reasonably consider that you have breached this clause or clause 5 of Part B of these terms.
Payment of that amount is your sole and exclusive remedy in respect of our election to acquire that Virtual Land and is reasonably designed to protect our legitimate interests in operating Earth 2.
</p>
<p> The Buyer must pay the agreed price for the relevant Virtual Land in USD (or other method that we accept from time to time), together with our Transaction Fee.
Ownership in the Virtual Land will pass on confirmation to our satisfaction of successful and complete payment of the agreed sale price and our Transaction Fee.
If payment is not successfully received, then the sale will not proceed.
</p>
<p> We will settle any disputes in relation to any ownership of Virtual Land according to the process that we maintain for that purpose from time to time.
</p>Nature of rights in Virtual Land<p> The value of Virtual Land that is not yet assigned to ‘ownership’ by any particular user is set by us in our discretion, including by the use of algorithms that respond to various factors including the apparent supply and demand and desirability of particular lots.
</p>
<p> There is no inherent value in any Virtual Land and the value in particular blocks of Virtual Land, and in the Virtual Land generally, may fluctuate in value from time to time by various factors including user demand and our algorithmic determination of land values.
</p>
<p> Your rights in any Virtual Land are not ‘ownership’ and are conferred by contract only for the purposes of transacting within the Website as a registered user.
Those rights are expressly subject to all of the terms that apply to use of the Website, and require you to remain a registered user of the Website.
</p>
<p> We reserve the right in the future to convert your holding of Virtual Land (or any equivalent credits held in the Earth 2 platform) to an equivalent value of a crypto-currency that we may create in the future.
Any conversion would be conducted at a valuation reasonably determined by us.
</p>
<p> Rights in Virtual Land are not assignable from your account to any other account (other than by ‘sale’ as contemplated by these terms).
If your membership is cancelled in accordance with these terms, or you cancel your use of the website for any reason, you forfeit any Virtual Land assigned to your account and we are not liable to you in any way (including without limitation for the payment of any amount in respect of the relevant Virtual Land).
Any Virtual Land so forfeited returns to ownership by us, and will be made available for sale to other users at the price determined by us.
</p>
<p> If we have converted Virtual Land holdings to a separate crypto currency (as permitted by these terms), then you will maintain your rights to that crypto currency separately from your registration to the Website, in accordance with the terms that govern that crypto currency.
Those </p>Tax<p> Transactions involving Virtual Land, between us and any registered user, and between registered users, may be subject to tax.
A user is responsible for all of the taxation consequences of its use of the Website.
</p>Fund Transactions<p>To deposit or withdraw funds you must provide us with current, complete and accurate information.

</p>(e) Later GST change<p> For clarity, the GST payable under subclause (c) is correspondingly increased or decreased by any subsequent adjustment to the amount of GST for the Supply for which the Supplier is liable, however caused.
</p>(f) Reimbursement or indemnity<p> If either party has the right under this document to be reimbursed or indemnified by another party for a cost incurred in connection with this document, that reimbursement or indemnity excludes any GST component of that cost for which an Input Tax Credit may be claimed by the party being reimbursed or indemnified, or by its Representative Member, Joint Venture Operator or other similar person entitled to the Input Tax Credit (if any).
</p>(g) Progressive or Periodic Supplies<p> Where a Supply made under or in connection with this document is a Progressive or Periodic Supply, subclause (c) applies to each component of the Progressive or Periodic Supply as if it were a separate Supply.
