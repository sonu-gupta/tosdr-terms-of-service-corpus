The terms and conditions for consummating any Tokens Transactions are set forth here and may be amended in connection with any particular item and/or features (e.g., Tickets, Assets) available for a Tokens Purchase.
Alight Creative Tokens associated with your account may only be redeemed for Tokens Transactions through your account, and Alight Creative Tokens associated with multiple accounts cannot be combined for any Tokens Transaction, even if those accounts belong to or are controlled by you.
You may review the number of Alight Creative Tokens in your account by the My Account screen in any Alight Creative branded application that provides Token Purchase.</p>
<p>10.1.&nbsp;Alight Creative Tokens have no cash value, cannot be tendered for any cash amount, are non-transferable and may specify an expiration date, after which such Alight Creative Tokens are void.

In no event shall Alight Creative provide you with any monetary refund for the portion of a purchase paid with Alight Creative Tokens.
When Alight Creative Tokens associated with your account are used in a Tokens Transaction, you will be deemed by Alight Creative to have caused that Tokens Transaction, inasmuch as the username and password for that account are required in order to consummate the Tokens Transaction.
Accordingly, Alight Creative will not reinstate any Alight Creative Tokens once they have been applied, and Alight Creative shall not have any liability for such use, even where you claim such use was unauthorized.</p>
<p>10.3.&nbsp;Alight Creative does not authorize the use of Alight Creative Tokens to obtain any product, service or other items from any party other than Alight Creative, and Alight Creative shall not provide any third party any compensation or items of value on account of any Alight Creative Tokens you may provide to such third party.

Promotional Code.
Alight Creative may from time to time make available, directly or through a third party, gift cards or promotional codes or coupons that are redeemable for a specified Paid Service for a fixed period of time (individually, a “Promotional Code” and collectively, “Promotional Codes”), or which can be exchanged for Alight Creative Tokens, as described in more detail below.
We use the term “Promotional Subscription” to describe the specific subscription to a subscription basis Paid Service obtained with the Promotional Code and the term “Promotional Period” to describe the duration of a Promotional Subscription.
A Promotional Code may specify an expiration date (“Expiration Date”), after which such Promotional Code shall be void.
Alight Creative is under no obligation to accept an expired or otherwise invalid or void Promotional Code.
Promotional Codes have no cash value and, except where expressly permitted by Alight Creative, are non-transferrable.
Alight Creative is under no obligation to provide any compensation in connection with a Promotional Code.
In order to obtain a Promotional Subscription, you must be a registered Alight Creative Account holder and use the registration or redemption process, and satisfy any eligibility requirements, established by Alight Creative in connection with the Promotional Code.
At the conclusion of the Promotional Period, you will be required to pay the then-applicable charges for the Paid Service in order to continue using such Paid Service.
</p>
<p>Unless you have a separate contract with Alight Creative permitting you to distribute Alight Creative Tokens or Promotional Codes, you are prohibited from selling or otherwise distributing or transferring Alight Creative Tokens or Promotional Codes.
Alight Creative reserves the right to invalidate any Alight Creative Tokens or Promotional Codes that have been improperly issued or distributed, and we do not owe you any compensation with respect to such Alight Creative Tokens or Promotional Codes.
If a Promotional Code has been distributed to you by a third party (for example, connection with a third-party promotion), Alight Creative has no responsibility with respect to any third party product or service provided, or any marketing claims or promotional offers made, by the third party.
Alight Creative has no obligation to provide you with any compensation, or to modify the Promotional Subscription or the Promotion Requirements in connection with any Promotional Codes you obtained from a third party that was acting improperly.</p>
