<p>TERMS &amp.
CONDITIONS OF SERVICE </p>
<p>These Standard Terms &amp.
Conditions of Service apply to the services provided by Armed Forces Mobile Inc.
(“the Company”).
The Company may modify these Terms and Conditions from time to time at its discretion or as may be required by applicable law.
Any changes or modifications to these Terms and Conditions will be binding once posted on the Company’s website at www.myafmobile.com, subject to any applicable prior notification requirements required by applicable law.
By subscribing to, or using or attempting to use the Company’s service, you will be deemed to be in agreement with, and bound by, these Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p>
<b>Please note that these Terms and Conditions include A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION WITH A CLASS WAIVER, A REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WAIVER, AND A JURY WAIVER</b>
</p>
<p>If you do not want to accept these Terms and Conditions, notify the Company immediately at Support@myafmobile.com or 800-929-5416 to cancel your service and discontinue all further use of the Company’s service and any Company-provided handset not purchased by you.</p>
<p>
<b>COVERAGE AREA.</b> The Company’s wireless service can be used only within areas served by the Company’s underlying network provider and other networks allowing your use.
Various factors may affect or limit actual coverage within these areas.
The Company’s coverage maps depict approximations of outdoor coverage and may include areas for which the Company’s service is not available or does not work properly.
Actual coverage may differ substantially from the area shown on the maps, as coverage may be affected by terrain, weather, foliage, buildings and other construction, signal strength, customer equipment and other factors.
The Company does not guarantee coverage or network availability.</p>
<p>
<b>SERVICE LIMITATIONS.</b> This Service if for business use only.
The Company’s service uses radio transmissions and therefore may be interrupted, delayed, or otherwise limited for a variety of reasons, including environmental conditions, unavailability of radio frequency channels, system capacity, priority access by National Security and Emergency Preparedness personnel in the event of a disaster or emergency, coordination with other systems, equipment modifications and repairs, and problems with the facilities of interconnecting carriers.
Service may be affected by conditions beyond the Company’s control, including atmospheric, geographic, or topographic conditions, or if your handset is damaged.
Gaps in coverage within our estimated coverage areas, along with other factors both within and beyond the Company’s control, may result in service interruptions, slower data speeds, or lower quality of service.
Therefore, using the Company’s service outdoors even under optimal conditions does not always mean that service will always be available under all circumstances, at all times or without interruption.
For example, if a cellphone transmitter station loses commercial or back-up power, you may not be able to make a call even if your handset is fully charged and you are in a location where you can usually make calls.</p>
<p>THIS MEANS THAT THE COMPANY CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT IF A 911 CALL IS PLACED BY YOU THE CALL WILL BE COMPLETED.
AND, EVEN IF YOU CAN COMPLETE A 911 CALL, EMERGENCY RESPONSE PERSONNEL MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO DETERMINE YOUR LOCATION.
Wireless handsets can often be located using satellite signals or other special wireless technologies.
However, the same types of conditions that can interfere with your ability to complete wireless calls can also interfere with these handset locating capabilities.
For example, although you may be able to make an emergency call while indoors, your handset may not be able to connect to the satellite signal that is needed to locate you.
Also, some emergency response agencies may not have the ability to utilize wireless locator technologies.
Therefore, you should ALWAYS BE PREPARED TO PROVIDE YOUR ACTUAL LOCATION WHEN MAKING AN EMERGENCY CALL.
</p>
<p>
<b>CREDIT FOR OUTAGES.</b> If your service is interrupted for 24 or more continuous hours by a cause within the Company’s control, the Company will issue you, upon written request, either a credit equal to a pro-rata adjustment of any recurring charge (if applicable) for the time period the service was unavailable, not to exceed the charges collected for the period of interruption, or an extension of the expiration period of usage allowances.
The Company’s liability to subscribers for any service failures is limited solely to the credit set forth above.</p>
<p>
<b>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
</b> THE COMPANY MAKES NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, SUITABILITY, OR PERFORMANCE REGARDING ANY SERVICES OR HANDSETS, AND IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COMPANY BE LIABLE, WHETHER OR NOT DUE TO ITS OWN NEGLIGENCE, for any: (a) act or omission of a third party.
(b) damage or injury caused by the use of service or device, including use in a vehicle.
(c) mistakes, omissions, interruptions, errors, failures to transmit, delays or defects in the service provided by or through us.
(d) claim against you by third parties.
(e) damage or injury caused by a suspension or termination of service by the Company.
or (f) damage or injury caused by failure or delay in connecting a call to 911 or any other emergency service.</p>
<p>In no event, will the Company be liable for any indirect, special, punitive, incidental, or consequential losses or damages you or any third party may suffer by use of, or inability to use, service or any device provided by or through the Company, including loss of business or goodwill, revenue or profits, or claims of personal injuries.</p>
<p>NO DISCLAIMER OR OTHER LIMITATION OF ANY LIABILITY IN THIS AGREEMENT IS INTENDED TO APPLY TO THE EXTENT IT IS CONTRARY TO LAW OR PUBLIC POLICY.
</p>
<p>The foregoing disclaimers and limitations of liability will survive termination or expiration of your service with the Company.
</p>
<p>
<b>INDEMNITY.</b> To the full extent allowed by law, you hereby release, indemnify, and hold the Company and its members, officers, directors, employees, and agents harmless from and against any and all claims of any person or entity for damages of any nature arising in any way from or relating to, directly or indirectly, service provided by the Company or any person’s use thereof (including, but not limited to, vehicular damage and personal injury), INCLUDING CLAIMS ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN PART FROM THE ALLEGED NEGLIGENCE, ACTIVE OR PASSIVE, OF THE COMPANY.
This obligation shall survive termination or expiration of your service with the Company.</p>
<p>
<b>SEVERABILITY.
</b>In the event that all or any portions of the foregoing Limitation of Liability and Indemnity provisions are unenforceable as contrary to law or public policy, such unenforceable provision or portions thereof shall be deemed severed from the agreement between the parties and shall not affect the enforceability of any other provision or portions thereof.</p>
<p>
<b>DISPUTES:</b> YOU MUST NOTIFY THE COMPANY IN WRITING WITHIN (90) DAYS OF THE DATE OF ANY EVENT GIVING RISE TO ANY DISPUTE INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, A DISPUTE OVER ANY CHARGES, ANY SERVICE PROVIDED, OR ANY EQUIPMENT PROVIDED TO YOU, OR YOU WILL HAVE WAIVED YOUR RIGHT TO DISPUTE THE CHARGES (OR RAISE DISPUTES RELATING TO SERVICES, OR EQUIPMENT) AND WAIVED YOUR RIGHT TO BRING, OR PARTICIPATE IN, ANY LEGAL ACTION RAISING ANY SUCH DISPUTE.

<p>
<b>DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION.
</b> All disputes and claims that arise between you and the Company can only be resolved through binding arbitration and not a court trial or other action in any court of general jurisdiction.
<b>The sole remedy for any dispute or claim shall be binding arbitration on an individual basis, rather than by a jury trial or class action.
Binding arbitration limits the remedies available to you in the event of a dispute or claim.
Binding arbitration is on an individual basis exclusively and class arbitrations, class actions, or other representative actions are hereby excluded as a remedy.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>The Company and you agree that each is waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action and that the Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of any dispute or claim brought by you or the Company.</b>
</p>
<p>This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted.
It includes, but is not limited to, disputes or claims arising out of or based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, disputes or claims relating to advertising, or any other legal theory, and disputes or claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class.
The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.
YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
Further, unless both you and the Company agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s disputes or claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>
<p>Either party who intends to seek binding arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”).
The Notice to the Company must be sent to:</p>
<p>Armed Forces Mobile Inc.</p>
<p>5621 Palmer Way Ste G</p>
<p>Carlsbad, CA 92010</p>
<p>The Notice must (1) contain a description of the facts and basis of the claim or dispute.
and (2) the specific relief the party is seeking.
If the Company Wireless™ and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the dispute or claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or the Company may commence a binding arbitration proceeding.
During the binding arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by either party shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which the other party is entitled.
The binding arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and will be administered by the AAA.
The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-888-804-1448, or by writing to the Notice Address.
The arbitrator is bound by these terms and conditions.
The only issues that are outside the scope of the arbitrator are issues, if any, relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision.
If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the filer’s claim or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of any fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.</p>
<p>Any arbitration award may be enforced through an action brought in a court of appropriate jurisdiction.</p>
<p>These binding arbitration provisions shall survive termination or expiration of your service with the Company.</p>
<p>
