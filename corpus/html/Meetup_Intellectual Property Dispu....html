Our Terms of Service prohibit posting content that violates another party's intellectual property rights.
As indicated in our Terms of Service, we may, in appropriate circumstances and in our discretion, remove or disable access to, material that we believe may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, and restrict or terminate access to our Platform for those who may be repeat infringers.</p>
<p>The two most common types of intellectual property disputes that arise on our Platform are disputes regarding copyrights and trademarks.
For more information regarding copyrights and trademarks, see the&nbsp;Legal FAQs, including&nbsp;What's the difference between copyright and trademark?.</p>
Copyright Policy
<p>We have adopted a copyright policy consistent with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act to block access to or remove content that we believe in good faith may be infringing based on a bona fide notification that complies with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.</p>
<p>Note that under 17 U.S.C.
ยง 512(f), you may be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys' fees incurred by us or our members, if you knowingly materially misrepresent that content or activity is infringing.
If you are unclear whether the content at issue is infringing, you should consider contacting an attorney.</p>
<p>To report copyright infringement, please follow the instructions in the following section, 'What should I do if I see material that I believe infringes on someone's intellectual property rights?'</p>
Trademark Policy
<p>We may, as a courtesy to trademark owners, conduct a limited inquiry of reasonable complaints of trademark infringement.
Our determination of whether the reported content is a violation of our trademark policy depends on both the content that is being used and the context in which it is being used.</p>
<p>Using a business name, logo, or other protected content in a way that is confusing or misleading may be a violation of our trademark policy.
