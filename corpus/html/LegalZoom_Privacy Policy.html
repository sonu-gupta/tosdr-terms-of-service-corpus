To learn more about which categories of information we collect from which source, please refer to the chart in the section below entitled&nbsp;<strong>
<u>Summary of LegalZoom’s Practices Regarding Consumer Information</u>
</strong>.</p>
<p>
<strong>Consumers</strong>:&nbsp.
The vast majority of the information that LegalZoom collects comes directly or indirectly from the consumer that it relates to.&nbsp.
Information that is collected directly from you is information that you provide when you complete a form online, use a chat feature, or speak to us on the phone.&nbsp.
We may also collect information indirectly about you when you interact with our website, through the use of cookies and other tracking technologies.&nbsp.
Indirect collection is described in more detail in the section below called “How LegalZoom Uses Cookies and Similar Technologies.”</p>
<p>
<strong>Related Consumers</strong>: We may collect information about you from someone you know.&nbsp.
For instance, if you are a shareholder in a business that is formed through LegalZoom, we may be given information about you in order to complete the formation.</p>
<p>
<strong>Employers</strong>: We may collect information about you from your employer if your employer has elected to provide you with employment benefits through LegalZoom.&nbsp.
For instance, your employer will tell LegalZoom when you are first eligible to receive services from LegalZoom as part of your benefits.</p>
<p>
<strong>Service Providers</strong>: We may collect information about you from our Service Providers.&nbsp.
As used in this Privacy Policy, Service Providers means entities that LegalZoom has contracted with to provide us with services to help fulfill our business needs.&nbsp.
An example of the type of information that we may receive from a Service Provider is information about whether any Legal Mail has been received as part of our Registered Agent services.&nbsp.

An example of the type of information that we may receive from these professionals includes the fact that a consult has occurred.&nbsp.
While we cannot control what information legal plan attorneys share with us, LegalZoom does not intend to collect any information from attorneys where the collection would result in a waiver of the attorney-client privilege.</p>
<p>
<strong>Business Partners and Affiliates:</strong>&nbsp.
We may collect information about you from our business partners and affiliates.&nbsp.

If such an event occurs, your information may be treated like any other LegalZoom asset and sold, transferred, or shared with third parties, or used in ways not contemplated or permitted under this Privacy Policy.
In this case, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our site of any change in ownership or uses of your Personal Information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your Personal Information.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> How LegalZoom Uses Cookies and Similar Technologies.
<p>This section expands on how LegalZoom uses internet technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about consumers.</p>
<p>
<strong>Cookies</strong>.&nbsp.
LegalZoom and its partners may use the standard cookie feature of major browser applications and third-party service providers, including Google Analytics features (Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager Integration and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting), or employ internally developed cookies and tracking codes, that allow LegalZoom to store a small piece of data on a visitor's computer, or any other device a visitor uses to access our website, about his or her visit to the website or use of other plug-ins exchanging information with LegalZoom.&nbsp.
We also use similar technologies, such as JavaScripts or ETags, to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” directory.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also control which cookies are placed on your browser when you visit LegalZoom’s website through our cookie preference center.
If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such order forms, will be limited.</p> My options <p>
<strong>Web Beacons</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a.
web beacons), that help us track referrals from our partners and affiliates and better manage content on our website.&nbsp;&nbsp;Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users.&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.</p>
<p>
<strong>3rd Party Tracking.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of tracking technologies by our service providers, technology partners or other 3rd party assets (such as social media links) on the site is not covered by our Privacy Policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;These 3rd parties may use cookies, clear gifs, images, and scripts to help them better manage their content on our site.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not have access or control over these technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>Partner and Affiliate Tracking.&nbsp;</strong>Our partners and affiliates, including Google Analytics (Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager Integration, and Google Analytics and Interest Reporting), may use cookies and web beacons to collect information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.
This means that these partners and affiliates may show our ads on sites across the Internet based upon your previous visits to our website.
Together with our partners and affiliates, we may use these cookies and web beacons to report how your ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to your visits to our site.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you would like to learn more or opt out of receiving online display advertising tailored to your interests, please visit the Networking Advertising Initiative at&nbsp;www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp&nbsp;or the Digital Advertising Alliance at&nbsp;http://aboutads.info/choices.&nbsp.
If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking&nbsp;here.&nbsp.
Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.&nbsp.
You will continue to receive generic ads.
If you delete your cookies, use a different browser, or buy a new computer, you will need to renew your online display advertising opt-out choice.
You may also learn more about how Google Analytics uses your information by visiting Google’s page&nbsp;How Google Uses Information From Sites or Apps That Use Our Service.&nbsp.
You may also visit Google Analytics’&nbsp;Ads Settings&nbsp;to opt out of Google’s use of cookies and customize Google Display Network ads, and Google Analytics’&nbsp;Opt Out Browser Add-on for the web.</p> Third Party Links <p>
<strong>Third-Party Websites.</strong>&nbsp;LegalZoom may maintain links to other websites and other websites may maintain links to LegalZoom’s websites.
This Privacy Policy applies only to LegalZoom.com and not to other websites accessible from LegalZoom or that you use to access LegalZoom, each of which may have privacy policies materially different from this Privacy Policy.&nbsp.
For instance, when using Identity Protection products (including Business Data Protection and LegalZoom Identity Protection), you will visit websites maintained by LegalZoom’s partner Experian, and the Experian privacy policy will govern the information you provide on that website.
&nbsp;If you visit other websites, LegalZoom is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of those sites.
It is your responsibility to review the privacy policies of non-LegalZoom websites to confirm that you understand and agree with them.</p>

These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and&nbsp;may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.
Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our website.
Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p> How You Can Control The Information LegalZoom May Have About You.
<p>This section describes how you can access and control the information that LegalZoom may have about you.&nbsp.
It applies to all consumers worldwide, including individuals who have purchased from LegalZoom or who believe that information about them may have been provided to us by a third party.&nbsp.

<strong>California Resident Rights</strong>

This includes the specific pieces and categories of Personal Information that the business has collected about the consumer, the categories of sources for that information, the business or commercial purposes for collecting the information, and the categories of third parties with which the information was shared.</p>
<p>California residents also have the right to submit a request for deletion of information under certain circumstances.&nbsp.
This is not an absolute right and, in some circumstances, LegalZoom may decline to delete the information, such as when LegalZoom has an on-going business relationship with you, when we have a continued need to use the information for purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, or when we are legally required to retain the information.&nbsp.
