&nbsp;</p> Privacy&nbsp;policy <p>The eSafety Commissioner is responsible for promoting online safety for all Australians.</p>
<p>This policy describes how the eSafety Commissioner and staff assisting her (eSafety) handles, manages and protects personal information.</p>
<p>The Privacy Act 1988 (Cth)&nbsp;(the Privacy Act) contains 13 Australian Privacy Principles (the APPs) that regulate how private sector organisations and government agencies collect, use, disclose, hold and de-identify or destroy personal information, and how individuals may request to access and correct their personal information.</p>
<p>The Privacy Act defines personal information as information or an opinion about an identified individual or an individual who is reasonably identifiable.
It also defines sensitive information, which is a subset of personal information that is generally afforded a higher level of protection than personal information.
This includes health information and information relating to a person’s racial or ethnic origin and sexual orientation or practices.</p>
<p>The eSafety Commissioner is covered by the Privacy Act.</p>
Collection of personal&nbsp;information
<strong>Purposes of&nbsp;collection</strong>
<p>eSafety collects personal information if it is reasonably necessary for, or directly related to, one or more of the eSafety Commissioner’s functions or activities.</p>
<p>
<strong>The main reasons we would collect personal information would be to:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>handle a complaint or manage a report</li>
<li>provide education</li>
<li>conduct communication and awareness campaigns</li>
<li>run our website, or</li>
<li>correspond and engage with you through newsletters and social media.</li>
</ul>
<strong>How personal information is&nbsp;collected</strong>
<p>eSafety collects personal information by lawful and fair means.
eSafety usually collects personal information directly from you, for example, when you provide us your details in relation to a complaint or report through an enquiry form.</p>
<p>
<strong>However, eSafety may obtain information about you from third parties in certain circumstances, including where:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>the eSafety Commissioner is required or authorised by law, for example, obtaining information for the purposes of handling a complaint or report (from a complainant, parent, guardian or school)</li>
<li>the eSafety Commissioner has your consent to do so, or</li>
<li>it is not reasonably practicable to collect the information from you.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Kinds of personal information collected and&nbsp;held</strong>
<p>eSafety collects personal information to enable us to carry out our regulatory functions and activities.</p>
<strong>Complaints and&nbsp;reports</strong>
<p>eSafety investigates complaints in relation to cyberbullying and in relation to offensive and illegal content.
It also manages complaints in relation to image-based abuse.</p>
<p>The kinds of personal information collected in order to investigate these complaints and reports varies between the schemes, but generally includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>your name (you may choose to make some complaints and reports anonymously)</li>
<li>your contact details (unless you choose not to provide your name)</li>
<li>your images</li>
<li>whether you reside or are a business in Australia, and/or</li>
<li>a URL that may lead to images that are personal information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Personal information collected may also relate to the person making the complaint or report or to other parties involved, including the person alleged to have posted the material.</p>
<p>Investigating complaints and managing reports may require eSafety to collect sensitive information about you.
This will only occur if you have consented or if the collection is otherwise permitted under the Privacy Act or the Enhancing Online Safety Act 2015.</p>
<strong>Procurement</strong>
<p>eSafety collects and holds personal information as part of our procurement processes.
This includes the names and contact details of tenderers or contracting parties and is done to ensure we comply with the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (the PGPA Act) and the Commonwealth Procurement Rules.</p>
<p>More information on the PGPA Act and the Commonwealth Procurement Rules is available at the Department of Finance’s PGPA associated instruments and policies page.</p>
<strong>Public consultation and&nbsp;engagement</strong>
<p>eSafety engages with the public and our stakeholders through a number of mediums, including consultations, surveys, conferences and forums.</p>
<p>When eSafety undertakes formal consultation, the documentation will make clear the purpose of the consultation and the purpose of the collection of personal information.
Generally, eSafety publishes the submissions we receive, including any personal information, unless otherwise claimed as confidential.</p>
<p>If you wish to make a submission anonymously or through the use of a pseudonym, you should contact eSafety to see whether it is practicable to do so.
Each confidentiality claim is assessed by eSafety on a case-by-case basis.</p>

Anonymity and use of&nbsp;pseudonym
