Important Disclaimer </b>
</p>
<p>FREEWILL IS NOT A LAW FIRM, INVESTMENT ADVISORY FIRM, OR AN ACCOUNTING FIRM, AND DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY LEGAL, TAX OR ACCOUNTING ADVICE.
FREEWILL PROVIDES ACCESS TO SOFTWARE AND SELF-HELP MATERIALS.
ALTHOUGH FREEWILL STRIVES TO ENSURE THAT ITS AUTOMATED SERVICES ARE COMPLETE AND UP-TO-DATE, THEY ARE MEANT PURELY AS SELF-HELP FORMS.
THE SERVICES ARE NOT SUBSTITUTES FOR THE ADVICE OF AN ATTORNEY, INVESTMENT ADVISOR OR ACCOUNTANT.
NO ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP, OR OTHER SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP, IS CREATED BETWEEN YOU AND FREEWILL OR ITS PARTNERS THROUGH THE USE OF FREEWILL.
ANY AND ALL COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN YOU AND FREEWILL ARE PROTECTED BY OUR PRIVACY NOTICE BUT NOT BY ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE OR AS ATTORNEY WORK-PRODUCT.
YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR OWN TAX, LEGAL AND ACCOUNTING ADVISORS BEFORE ENGAGING IN ANY TRANSACTION.</p>
<p>FreeWill will not provide clarifications, advice, orientation, or opinions about the potential legal or tax issues, or other consequences arising from the execution of self-help documents and other materials made available through the Site (the “Materials”), or solutions for issues you may encounter in attempting to use the Materials.
FreeWill will not review any part of your Materials for completeness, spelling, or internal consistency of identifiers (such as names and addresses).
Likewise, FreeWill will not provide clarifications, advice, or opinions regarding your particular situation, or apply any legal, tax or accounting expertise tailored to your situation.
FreeWill provides general information that is found in statutes and case law, which are fully available to the public.
You acknowledge that such information will never be specific to a particular user’s situation or request and that FreeWill therefore does not engage in the practice of law or in the business of a law firm.</p>
<p>FreeWill strives to keep all Materials available through the Services – including any descriptions, information and other help resources – current and up-to-date.
This, however, is not the same as personalized legal, tax or accounting advice.
Furthermore, the law changes rapidly, varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and may be subject to varying interpretation by different courts.
Therefore, if you want help understanding how the law applies to your particular circumstances or deciding which estate planning documents are best for you and your family, you should consider seeing a qualified attorney, investment advisor or accountant.
Similarly, if you need legal advice for a specific problem, or if your specific circumstances are too complex to be addressed by our Services, you should consult a licensed attorney in your area.</p>
<p>The materials on the Site are provided “as is.” FreeWill and its partners make no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaim and negate all other warranties, including without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights.
Any documents you make using the Services are yours, and it is your responsibility to be sure they reflect your intentions and are binding under applicable law.
Further, neither FreeWill nor its partners warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the use of the materials on the Site or otherwise relating to such materials or on any sites linked to the Site.

<b> 4.
Liability Limitations </b>
</p>
<p>In no event, and to the maximum extent authorized by law, shall FreeWill, the nonprofit organizations it partners with, or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, direct, punitive, incidental or consequential damages, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the Materials on the Site, even if FreeWill or a FreeWill authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage.
This paragraph does not apply to North Carolina consumers.

<p>
<b> 9.
Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration </b>
</p>
<p>Please carefully read this part of the Terms of Service.
It contains important information about how disputes, claims, and controversies in relation to the use of FreeWill’s Services shall be resolved.
If you don’t understand the meaning or extent of this provision, you should seek the opinion of independent counsel.</p>
<p>It is our goal to resolve through negotiation any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, or to the use of FreeWill’s Services.
In case we fail to reach a resolution of the dispute, claim or controversy, you and FreeWill agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration, in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth below (the “Arbitration Agreement”).</p>
<p>Arbitration is a much less formal dispute resolution process in which no judge or juries will adjudicate or find the facts in dispute.
Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator to give the final decision (technically called an “award”), has a much simpler discovery process, and is subject to very limited review by the courts.
Additionally, arbitration awards are normally not appealable, and, therefore, it is normally faster and less expensive method of dispute resolution.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Binding Arbitration and Rules: </b> You and FreeWill agree that any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service or FreeWill’s Site, or the breach thereof, shall be settled by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules and Consumer Arbitration Rules and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
You can find the AAA arbitration rules and forms on their website: consumer arbitration rules, commercial arbitration rules, and consumer filing forms.
You can also call AAA for further information on 1-800-778-7879.
These Terms of Service may change the AAA rules expressly or by necessary implication.
The Federal Arbitration Act shall govern the interpretation and applicability of this Arbitration Agreement.
Further, You and FreeWill agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts is excluded and not applicable to this relation.</li>
<li>
<b>Arbitration Initiation: </b> The Party initiating the proceedings must provide a written notice to the other Party in accordance with the AAA rules and forms.
You can find the AAA arbitration rules and forms on their website: consumer arbitration rules, commercial arbitration rules, and consumer filing forms.
The written notice must be addressed to FreeWill Co., Attn: Legal Dep’t, 175 Greenwich St., 38th Floor New York, NY 10007.</li>
<li>
<b>Single Arbitrator: </b> Claims shall be heard by a single arbitrator, unless both Parties expressly agree otherwise.
The arbitrator will be selected by the Parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators, and if the Parties fail to agree on the arbitrator appointment the AAA rules will govern the arbitrator’s choice.</li>
<li>
<b>Venue: </b> The place of arbitration shall be New York City, New York.
Hearings will take place pursuant to the standard procedures of the Commercial Arbitration Rules that contemplate in-person hearings.</li>
<li>
<b>Arbitrator Limitations: </b> To the maximum permitted by law and coherent to these Terms of Service: (i) the arbitrator will have no authority to award punitive or other damages not measured by the prevailing Party’s actual damages, except as may be required by statute.
(ii) the arbitrator shall not award consequential damages in any arbitration initiated under this section.
(iii) any award in an arbitration initiated under this clause shall be limited to monetary damages and shall include no injunction or direction to any party other than the direction to pay a monetary amount.</li>
<li>
<b>Class Action, Jury and Bench Trial Waiver: </b> You and FreeWill hereby agree that in no circumstance any dispute, claim, or controversy between the Parties will be subject to a jury or bench trial in any court or tribunal.
Both Parties, therefore, renounce the right to jury trial.
Furthermore, You and FreeWill expressly waive any rights to join a class action, as a plaintiff or class member, and that unless both Parties expressly agree, the arbitrator will not be allowed to consolidate more than one person’s claims in the arbitration proceedings;</li>
<li>
<b>Fees: </b> Each Party has the responsibility to pay the filing fees, administrative expenses and arbitrator fees in accordance to the effective AAA rules.
If your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, and is not ruled as frivolous or based on improper purpose (as set forth in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 11(b)) by the Arbitrator, FreeWill will pay all such fees.</li>
<li>
<b>Award: </b> The award shall be rendered in accordance with the AAA rules timeframe.
Any award: (i) will be limited to the Parties in the dispute.
(ii) will not affect third parties.
(iii) will include findings and conclusions.
(iv) will not be appealable.
(v) will be coherent to these Terms of Service.
FreeWill waives the right to recover expenses and attorney fees if it prevails in the arbitration procedure.</li>
<li>
<b>Exceptions: </b> You and FreeWill retain the rights to initiate proceedings in any court or tribunal in order to obtain injunctive or equitable relief to protect intellectual property rights, both actual and threatened violations.
Further, each Party retains the right to initiate proceedings in small claims courts.</li>
<li>
<b>Miscellaneous: </b> This Arbitration Agreement will be in full force and effect after the termination of these Terms of Service, meaning that it will continue to govern the dispute resolution for the Parties.
Except as may be required by law, neither a Party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration without the prior written consent of both parties.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b> 10.
Governing Law </b>
</p>
<p>Any claim, dispute, or controversy relating to your use of FreeWill’s Site shall be governed by the Arbitration Agreement comprised in Section 9 above.
If a judicial proceeding is commenced, the claim, dispute, or controversy shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
You and FreeWill agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts is excluded and not applicable to this relation.</p>
<p>You specifically consent to personal jurisdiction in New York in connection with any dispute between you and FreeWill arising out of these Terms of Service or pertaining to FreeWill’s Site.
You agree that the exclusive venue for any dispute between the parties will be in the state and federal courts in New York.
The foregoing paragraph shall not apply to North Carolina consumers.</p>
<p>
<b>11.
