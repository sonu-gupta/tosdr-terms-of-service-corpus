         Screencast Content Deletion Policy We’ll begin deleting inactive content from FREE Screencast accounts <p>
<em>If you're on a FREE Screencast account, learn more about how to keep your content.</em>
</p>
<p>In order to help make platform improvements, we need to delete inactive content in free Screencast accounts.
As you can imagine, more than a decade of content builds up, most of which was only viewed for a short time! To arrive at this retention policy, we sought customer input and chose an approach that impacts as few customers as possible.</p>
<p>We will base retention on usage of the content - if twelve consecutive months have passed without your free content being viewed, we will consider the content inactive and permanently delete it.</p>
<p>
<strong>Starting November 2, 2018 TechSmith will begin deleting free Screencast content not viewed in the past year (twelve months).</strong>
</p>
<p>This means any free Screencast content that hasn’t been viewed since November 2, 2017 will be permanently deleted as soon as November 2, 2018.</p>
<p>Going forward, we’ll continue this practice of deleting inactive free Screencast content on a regular basis.
This means we will store free Screencast content for a minimum of one year after the upload date, but it will be deleted if not viewed for one year.
This deletion will be permanent.</p>
<p>Once it’s deleted, you will not be able to view, download, or access the content in any way, and we will be unable to retrieve it.</p>
<p>If you do not want your inactive content, no further action is needed! We’ll delete it, freeing up additional space in your account.</p> How to avoid losing your content <p>
<strong>If you have a free Screencast account, you must take action by November 2, 2018 to avoid content loss.
