<p>We use cookies and similar technologies on our website (the “<strong>Website</strong>”) and app such as pixel tags and clear GIFs (also known as web beacons), and mobile device identifiers (including advertising identifiers) to store information or gain access to information stored on your device or equipment.
You can find out more about cookies and similar technologies, and how we use them, in the information set out below.</p>
<p>If you do not accept the use of these cookies or similar technologies, please disable them by following the instructions in this policy below or by changing your browser settings so that cookies or similar technologies from our Website or app cannot be placed on your computer or mobile device.</p>
<p>Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Cookie Policy have the meaning given to them in our Terms of Use.</p>
<p>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Welcome, this is our cookies policy (not the yummy kind)</p>
</blockquote> 1.
What are cookies and similar technologies?
<p>
<strong>Cookies.</strong> Cookies are small text files that uniquely identify your browser or device.
The cookie file is stored on your browser.
When you return to that website (or visit websites that use the same cookies) these websites recognize the cookies and your browsing device.</p>
<p>We also use technologies which are similar to cookies such as web beacons/pixels, log files and mobile device identifiers.</p>
<p>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cookies and other technologies collect certain information about how you are using our website.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Web beacons/Pixels.</strong> Web beacons/Pixels are invisible picture files/small portions of code that we use when providing the Services.
We use web beacons to track the online usage patterns of our users.
We also use clear web beacons in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients.
Web beacons collect information such as a record of the page on which they are placed and a timestamp.
We also use web beacons placed by third party advertisers to track whether you have clicked on the adverts they have placed and to measure success.</p>
<p>
<strong>Log files.</strong> Log file information is automatically reported by your browser or mobile device each time you access the Service.
When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information.
These server logs include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.</p>
<p>
<strong>Device identifiers.</strong> Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structure stored on or associated with your mobile device which allow us to uniquely identify your mobile device (including mobile phones, smartphones and tablets).
A device identifier is either data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Canva.
A device identifier conveys information to us about how you browse and use our Service and will remain persistently on your device.
This will help you log-in faster and can be used by us to analyse device related issues related to our service.
Device identifiers used by Canva include the Android Advertising ID and iOS Advertising Identifier.</p>
<p>
<strong>Ad identifiers and other similar technologies.</strong> Our advertising partners use device identifiers and other similar technologies to show you ads that are useful to you.
We may share certain information such as your location, browser and cookie data and other data relating to your use of our Service with our business partners to deliver personalized advertisements (“ads”) that may be of interest to you.
Canva may allow third-party ad servers or ad networks to serve personalized advertisements either on the Service or on third party websites, including Facebook and Google.
These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser or mobile device, these personalized ads and ad links, and will automatically receive your IP address when they do so.
They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, device identifiers, location data, and clear gifs, see above) to compile information about your browser’s or device’s visits and usage patterns on the Service, and to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize the advertising content.
Canva does not sell, rent, or share the information we collect directly from you or about you from third parties with these third-party ad servers or ad networks for such parties’ own marketing purposes.</p>
<p>Please note that an advertiser may ask Canva to show an ad to a certain audience of Users (e.g., based on demographics or other interests).
In that situation, Canva determines the target audience and Canva serves the advertising to that audience and only provides anonymous aggregated data to the advertiser.
If you respond to such an ad, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.</p>
<p>The Canva Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party advertisers.
Please consult the respective privacy policies of such advertisers or contact such advertisers for more information.</p>

Categories of cookies
<p>Cookies do many different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving the user experience.
Cookies can tell us, for example, whether you have visited the Website before or whether you are a new visitor.
They can also help to ensure that adverts you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.</p>
<p>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just like you can get choc-chip, ginger and peanut butter cookies, you can get different types of online cookies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are different categories of cookies, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>First-party cookies</strong>
<br>
First party cookies, which are served directly by us to your computer or device.</li>
<li>
<strong>Third-party Cookies</strong>
<br>
Third-party cookies, which are served by a third party on our behalf.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cookies can remain on your device for different periods of time.
Some cookies are ‘session cookies’, meaning that they exist only while your browser is open.
These are deleted automatically once you close your browser.
Other cookies are ‘permanent cookies’, meaning that they survive after your browser is closed.
They can be used by the Website to recognise your computer when you open your browser and browse the Internet again.</p>
<p>
</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote> 3.
What types of cookies do we use and how do we use them?
<p>The types of cookies and similar technologies used by us and our partners in connection with the Website can be classified into one of five categories, namely ‘essential cookies’, ‘functionality cookies’, ‘analytics and performance cookies’, ‘advertising cookies’, and ‘ social media cookies’.
We have set out some further information about each category, and the purposes of the cookies we and third parties use in the following table.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>Type of cookie</b>
<b>What it does</b>
<strong>Cookies necessary for essential purposes</strong>
These cookies are essential to provide you with the Website and any services available and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas.
Without these cookies, services you have asked for, like transactional pages and secure login accounts would not be possible.
<strong>Functionality Cookies</strong>
Functionality cookies record information about choices you have made and allow us to tailor the Website to you.
These cookies mean that when you continue to use or come back to the Website, we can provide you with our services as you have asked for them to be provided.<p>
</p>
<p>These cookies allow us to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember settings you have applied, such as layout, text size, preferences, and colors;</li>
<li>Show you when you are logged in.
and</li>
<li>Store accessibility options.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Performance Cookies</strong>
We use performance/analytics cookies to measure traffic and usage data and to analyze how the Website is accessed, used, or is performing in order to provide you with a better user experience and to maintain, operate and continually improve the Website.<p>
</p>
<p>We use Google Analytics, which is a web analytics tool that helps us understand how users engage with the Website.
Like many services, Google Analytics uses first-party cookies to track user interactions, as in our case, where they are used to collect information about how users use our site.
This information is used to compile reports and to help us improve our service.
The reports disclose website trends without identifying individual visitors.
For more information on Google Analytics, see here.</p>
<p>You can opt out of Google Analytics without affecting how you visit our site – for more information on opting out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all websites you use, visit this Google page: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.</p>
<p>These cookies allow us to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better understand our Website visitors so that we can improve how we present our content;</li>
<li>Test different design ideas for particular pages, such as our homepage;</li>
<li>Collect information about Website visitors such as where they are located and what browsers they are using;</li>
<li>Determine the number of users of the Website;</li>
<li>Improve the Website by measuring any errors that occur.
and</li>
<li>Conduct research and diagnostics to improve product offerings.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Advertising and Targeting Cookies</strong>
We allow third party companies, including advertising companies, to place cookies on our Website.<p>
</p>
<p>These cookies enable such companies to distinguish and track your activity across various sites so that they can display ads which are relevant to you and record your activities so they can show ads that they consider relevant to you as you browse the Internet.</p>
<p>Cookies also allow us and third parties to know whether you have seen an ad or a type of ad, and how long it has been since you’ve last seen it.
This information is used for frequency capping purposes, to help tailor the ads you see, and to measure the effectiveness of ads.</p>
<p>We can use information from one device to help personalize your experience on another device.</p>
<strong>Social Media Cookies</strong>
On some pages of our Website, third parties that provide applications through our Website will set their own cookies in order to track the success of their applications or customize applications for you.
Because of how cookies work, we cannot access these cookies, nor can the third parties access the data in cookies used by us.<p>
</p>
<p>These cookies are used when you share an article using a social media sharing button on our Website (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn) as the social network that has created the button will record that you have done this.
If you are logged in to your account with the third party, the third party will be able to link information about you with your actions via cookies.</p>
<p>In addition to the cookies we use on this website, we use technologies such as pixel tags in some emails and push notifications which enable us to understand whether you have opened the email and how you have interacted with it.</p>
<p>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clever little cookies can do lots of different jobs.</p>
</blockquote> 4.
How to control or delete cookies and similar technologies
<p>We use cookies on this site to make sure you can use the Website easily and enjoy the Website.
Some of these cookies are essential and we cannot provide our service without them, but there are others that can be turned off (depending on the device you use).
Note that, depending on the type of device you have, it may not be possible to delete or disable tracking mechanisms.

It also disables many of the features available through the Service.</p>
<p>You can change your preferences by changing the settings in your browser.
Your browser will allow you to:<br>
See what cookies or other similar technologies have been dropped on your device;<br>
Block cookies or similar technologies;<br>
Clear cookies or similar technologies from your browser.<br>
Deleting cookies or similar technologies means that any preference settings you have made on a particular website will be lost and the functionality of our Website will be impaired.
We cannot guarantee that your experience on our Website will be as good as it could otherwise be.</p>
<p>If you want to change your settings at any time (for example, if you accept all cookies, but later decide you do not want a certain type of cookie) you’ll need to use your browser settings to remove any third party cookies or similar technologies dropped on your previous visit.</p>
