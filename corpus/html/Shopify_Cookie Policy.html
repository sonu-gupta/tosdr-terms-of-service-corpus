         <p>What are cookies?</p>
<p>A cookie is a small amount of information that’s downloaded to your
computer or device when you visit certain websites.
We use a number of
different cookies on the Shopify website, including strictly necessary,
performance, advertising, and social media or content cookies.
Cookies
make your browsing experience better by allowing the website to remember
your actions and preferences (such as login and region selection).
This
means you don’t have to re-enter this information each time you return
to the site or browse from one page to another.
Cookies also provide
information on how people use the website, for instance whether it’s
their first time visiting or if they are a frequent visitor.
Read more
about cookies (and other similar tracking technologies) and how we use
the data collected through these technologies, in our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>What cookies do we use and why?</p>
<p>Some cookies are necessary to allow you to browse our website, use its
features, and access secure areas.
The use of these cookies is essential
for the website to work.
For example, we use user-input cookies for the
duration of a session to keep track of a user’s input when filling in
forms that span several pages.</p>
<p>We also use functional cookies to remember choices you’ve made or
information you’ve provided, such as your username, language, or the
region you are in.
This allows us to tailor your website experience
specifically to your preferences.
For example, authentication cookies
are functional cookies that are used for the duration of a session (or
persistent, if you agree to the “remember me” function) to allow users
to authenticate themselves on subsequent visits or to gain access to
authorized content across pages.
The functional cookies we use include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>User-centric security cookies to detect authentication abuses for a limited
persistent duration, like repeated failed login attempts.
These cookies are
set for the specific task of increasing thesecurity of the service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multimedia content player session cookies (flash cookies) are used
for the duration of a session to store technical data needed to play
back video or audio content (e.g.
image quality, network link speed,
and buffering parameters).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Load balancing session cookies are used for the duration of the
session to identify the same server in the pool in order for the
load balancer to redirect user requests appropriately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User interface customization persistent cookies are used to store a
user’s preference regarding a service across web pages.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Shopify is dedicated to user experience and we use many tools to help us
improve our website and our commerce platform.
To this end, we use
reporting and analytics cookies to collect information about how you use
our website or our merchants’ storefronts, and how often.
These cookies
only gather information for statistical purposes and only use
pseudonymous cookie identifiers that do not directly identify you.
The
performance cookies we use include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First party analytics cookies - We use these cookies to estimate the
number of unique visitors, to improve our websites and our
merchants’ websites, and to detect the most searched for words in
search engines that lead to a webpage.
These cookies are not used to
target you with online marketing.
We use these cookies to learn how
our websites and our merchants’ websites are performing and make
relevant improvements to improve your browsing experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Third party analytics cookies - We also use Google Analytics and
other third-party analytics providers listed below to help measure
how users interact with our website content.
These cookies
“remember” what our users have done on previous pages and how
they’ve interacted with the website.
For more information on Google
Analytics, visit Google’s information
page.
For instructions on how opt out of Google Analytics, see below.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Advertising cookies are used on our website to tailor marketing to you
and your interests and provide you with a more personalized service in
the future.
These cookies remember that you visited our website and we
may share this information with third-parties, such as advertisers.
Although these cookies can track your device’s visits to our website and
other sites, they typically cannot personally identify you.
Without
these cookies, the advertisements that you see may be less relevant and
interesting to you.
Read more about how companies use cookies to conduct
targeted or retargeted advertising here.
We do
not set advertising cookies through our merchants’ storefronts
ourselves, though merchants may choose to do so independently.</p>
<p>Finally, Social and Content cookies are placed by many social media
plugins (for example the Facebook ’like’ button), and other tools meant
to provide or improve the content on a website (for example services
that allow the playing of video files, or that create comments
sections).
We integrate these modules into our platform to improve the
experience of browsing and interacting with our websites.
Please note
that some of these third party services place cookies that are also used
for things like behavioural advertising, analytics, and/or market
research.</p>
