We are also not responsible for the accuracy, use or misuse of any UGC that you disclose or receive through the Services.
Please see our Terms of Use for further information about the terms that govern the UGC you post.</li>
<li>
<strong>Other Individuals, Services, and Partners at Your Request.</strong>&nbsp;We will share your information with other individuals and services at your request.
<ul>
<li>For example, if you choose to interact with such co-branded products or services using your account information with us, we may share your account information with third parties as required to provide the co-branded product or service that you request, including any information required for contest prize fulfillment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Third Party Contests and Promotions Providers.</strong>&nbsp;In some cases, you may have entered a contest or sweepstakes sponsored by a third party, in which case the information you provide via the contest or sweepstakes may be shared by us with that third party for their use in their discretion, including direct marketing.
Some of our contests and sweepstakes will ask you at the time of entry whether you would like to have your personal information shared with the sponsor, in which case we will honor your selection.
Other contests will not give you that option and in that event, if you do not want your information to be shared, you should not enter the contest.
The privacy policies of such third party companies apply to their use and disclosure of your information that we collect and disclose to such third party companies.</li>
<li>
<strong>Third Party Partners to Provide Co-Branded Products and Services.</strong>&nbsp;Some of our Services may from time to time partner with a retailer or other third party to offer online shopping opportunities, games, services, subscriptions, registration opportunities for our events and summits and other applications on a co-branded or cross-promotional basis (“<strong>Co-Branded Areas</strong>”).

These third parties will use your information in accordance with their own privacy policy.</li>

our Terms of Service),</li>

</ul>
<p>If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “<strong>Contact Us</strong>” section below.</p>
6.
Online Analytics and Advertising
<p>
<strong>Delivery of Advertising and Other Content.&nbsp;</strong>In addition to ads and content that we serve you directly, PMC may use third party advertising companies and marketing services to serve ads and other content when you visit the Services, as well as on other websites you visit and other applications you use.
The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, your searches, demographic data, user-generated content, and other information we collect from you.
These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests.
Third parties, whose products or services are accessible or advertised via the Services, may also place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about you as discussed above.
We also allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google and others) to serve tailored ads to you on the Services, other sites, and in other applications, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services.
We sometimes provide our customer information (such as email addresses) to service providers, who may “match” this information in de-identified form to cookies (or mobile ad identifiers) and other proprietary IDs, in order to provide you with more relevant ads when you visit other websites and mobile applications.</p>
<p>We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on the device you use to access the Services by such non-affiliated third parties.</p>
<p>If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the&nbsp;<strong>Network Advertising Initiative Opt Out Page</strong>, the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link, or&nbsp;<strong>Your Online Choices</strong>&nbsp;to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs.</p>
<p>To learn more about how to manage your preferences regarding our cookie-based advertising, please see the&nbsp;<strong>“Cookie Management” section in our Cookie Notice below</strong>.</p>
<p>To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, visit the&nbsp;<strong>Google Ads Settings page</strong>.
We do not control these opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs.
We are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.</p>
<p>
<strong>Please note that if you exercise the opt out choices above, you will still see advertising when you use the Services, but it will not be tailored to you based on your online behavior over time.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mobile Advertising.</strong>&nbsp;When using mobile applications from PMC or others, you may also receive tailored in-application advertisements.
We may use third-party service providers to deliver advertisements on mobile applications or for mobile application analytics.
Each operating system, iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements.
We do not control how the applicable platform operator allows you to control receiving personalized in-application advertisements.
thus, you should contact the platform provider for further details on opting out of tailored in-application advertisements.
Often, you may opt-out by adjusting the ad tracking settings on your mobile device or resetting the “Advertising Identifier” (like an IDFA) from your mobile device’s settings page, which will prevent continued use of existing behavioral data tied to the previous “Advertising Identifier.” You may review the support materials and/or the device settings for the respective operating systems to opt-out of tailored in-app advertisements.</p>
<p>
<strong>Do Not Track.&nbsp;</strong>PMC does not act on “do not track” requests from your browser because, this way, we are able to personalize your experiences on our Services.</p>
7.
Your Rights &amp.
Your Choices
<p>
<strong>Marketing Emails.&nbsp;</strong>If you want to stop receiving promotional e-mails from us, click on the “unsubscribe” link in any promotional email from us.
Please note that once we receive your request, it may take an additional period of time for your opt-out to become effective.
We may still communicate with you from time to time if we need to provide you with transaction information about the Services you are using, if we need to request information from you with respect to a transaction initiated by you, or for other legitimate non-marketing reasons, for example, if we update this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Service.</p>
<p>
<strong>SMS Text Communications.</strong>&nbsp;You may opt-out of SMS messages from us by following the instructions provided in the message or by texting back STOP to the number we send the text from for that particular SMS message.
When we receive an opt-out message from you for SMS messages, we may send a message confirming our receipt of your opt-out.</p>
<p>
<strong>Privacy Information for California Residents.</strong> If you are a California resident, California law requires us to provide you with some additional information regarding your rights with respect to your “personal information” (as defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”)).
We describe the categories of personal information we collect, the sources and uses of such information and the entities to which we share such information in our <strong>California Privacy Notice</strong>.</p>

B.
Notice of Right to Opt Out of Sale of Personal Information
<p>California residents may opt out of the “sale” of their personal information.
We sell certain of your information to third parties to provide you with offers and promotions and opportunities that may be of interest to you.</p>
<p>Under the CCPA, sale is also broadly defined such that it may include allowing third parties to receive certain information, such as cookies, IP address, and/or browsing behavior, to deliver targeted advertising on the Services or other services.
Advertising, including targeted advertising, enables us to provide you certain content for free and allows us to provide you offers relevant to you.</p>
<p>Depending on what Services you use, we may provide the following categories of personal information to third parties for these purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>For online targeted advertising purposes: demographic and statistical information, user-generated content, device information and identifiers, connection and usage data, geolocation, and social media information.</li>
<li>For sharing with third parties to send you relevant offers and promotions and opportunities: contact information (e.g., name and physical address) and publication subscription information.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you would like to opt out of PMC’s use of your information for such purposes that are considered a “sale” under California law, you may do so as outlined on the following page:&nbsp;<strong>Do Not Sell My Personal Information</strong>.
You can also submit a sale opt-out request by calling us at&nbsp;<strong>(877) 365-3500</strong>.
Please note that we do not knowingly sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age without legally-required affirmative authorization.</p>
<p>Please note that PMC employees who are seeking further information about their legal rights under California law should instead contact their PMC HR representative.
Applicants submitting information on the PMC Careers pages at&nbsp;<strong>pmc.com/careers-listing</strong>&nbsp;should instead consult the Penske Media Corporation Human Resources Privacy Notice referenced therein.</p>
<p>The CCPA further provides you with the right to not be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising your access, deletion or sale opt out rights.</p>
