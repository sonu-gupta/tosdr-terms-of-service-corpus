<p>In Section B, we describe the information that is collected from Users who view videos and ads on a Customer Property.
BridTV Technology collects <strong>Usage Data</strong> and <strong>Tracking Data</strong> from Users.

This information includes a User’s device type, operating system version, and Internet browser type and version.</li>

<strong>Personal Data.</strong> As previously noted, some elements of Usage Data and Tracking Data – for example, a visitor’s full Internet Protocol (IP) address, and the information that we associate with a unique identifier (like a cookie or other tracking technology) – are Personal Data under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and we treat those elements as Personal Data when collected by BridTV Technology from Users whose IP addresses are based in the EEA, Switzerland or the UK.
We will retain those elements of Usage Data and Tracking Data that are Personal Data under the GDPR for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required for the security or integrity of BridTV Services or BridTV Technology, or to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our legal agreements or policies.</li>
<li>
<strong>Legal grounds for processing Personal Data on Customer Properties.</strong> For Users who access the BridTV Technology from IP addresses in the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK, we process the elements of Usage Data and Tracking Data that are considered Personal Data under the GDPR.
The GDPR makes a distinction between organizations that process Personal Data for their own purposes (known as “<strong>data controllers</strong>”) and organizations that process Personal Data on behalf of other organizations (known as “<strong>data processors</strong>”).
When we handle Personal Data strictly on behalf of our customers in order to provide our services to them, as is the case with BridTV Technology, we are a data processor and our customers, as the data controllers, have primary responsibility for your Personal Data and are responsible for obtaining a legal basis to collect such data.
If you have questions about Personal Data that is used primarily by a Customer Property on which BridTV Technology is embedded or utilized, you should contact those companies with your questions about how they handle your Personal Data.</li>
<li>With that in mind, if you have concerns about BridTV, you may contact us, at contact@brid.tv.</li>

<li>As we believe appropriate for Compliance Purposes.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<br>
<ul>
<li>When We May Disclose Usage and Tracking Data.
We may disclose Usage Data and Tracking Data collected by BridTV Technology for the following purposes:</li>

<ol>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Service Providers.</strong> To third-party service providers who provide services such as hosting, data analysis, IT infrastructure, IT services, customer service, auditing, security, fraud, and other similar functions to us or our Customers.

<ol>
<li>
<strong> USER CHOICES FOR BRIDTV TECHNOLOGY</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>For Users who access BridTV Technology from the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK: The Do Not Track Browser Setting.
Certain versions of BridTV Technology support Do Not Track for Users in the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK.
Do Not Track is a preference Users can set in their web browser to inform websites that they do not want to be tracked.
Users can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of their web browser.
We make reasonable efforts to maintain compatibility between our technology and Do Not Track functionality across different web browsers.
However, you should be aware that, despite our reasonable efforts, there may be circumstances in which a particular Do Not Track setting is not recognized and honored.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Note that even if a User enables and BridTV recognizes Do Not Track, BridTV Technology will continue to collect Usage Data about each visit to a Customer Property, because Usage Data are automatically sent by the User’s web browser.
However, the Usage Data will not be associated with any unique identifier, and BridTV Technology will not be able to associate such User Data collected with User.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Check Our Customers’ Privacy Policy.
Users interact with BridTV Technology, because our Customers have implemented BridTV Technology in their Customer Properties.
We recommend that Users check the privacy policy of the Customer Properties that they visit for information about the user choices available from our Customers.
Many Customer Properties use third-party advertising companies for interest-based advertising or online behavioral advertising.
