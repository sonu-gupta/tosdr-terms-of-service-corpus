Introduction
<p>Welcome to IPInfo! Your use of IPInfo’ services, including the services IPInfo makes available through IPInfo.io (the “Sites”), and any other software or services offered by IPInfo in connection with any of those (the “Services”) is governed by these terms of service (the “Terms”), so please carefully read them before using the Services.
For the purposes of these Terms, “we,” “our,” “us,” and “IPInfo” refer to IDB, LLC, the providers and operators of the Services.</p>
<p>In order to use the Services, you must first agree to these Terms.
If you are registering for or using the Services on behalf of an organization, you are agreeing to these Terms for that organization and promising that you have the authority to bind that organization to these Terms.
In that case, “you” and “your” will also refer to that organization, wherever possible.</p>
<p>You must be over 13 years of age to use the Services, and children under the age of 13 cannot use or register for the Services.
If you are over 13 years of age but are not yet of legal age to form a binding contract (in many jurisdictions, this age is 18), then you must get your parent or guardian to read these Terms and agree to them for you before you use the Services.
If you are a parent or guardian and you provide your consent to your child's registration with the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms with respect of your child’s use of the Services.</p>
<p>You agree your purchase and/or use of the Services are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features or dependent on any oral or written public comments made by IPInfo or any of its affiliates regarding future functionality or features.</p>
<p>BY USING, DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING THE SERVICES OR ANY MATERIALS INCLUDED IN OR WITH THE SERVICES, YOU HEREBY AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS.
IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS, THEN YOU MAY NOT USE, DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, OR OTHERWISE ACCESS THE SERVICES.</p>
<p>IF YOU HAVE ENTERED INTO A SEPARATE WRITTEN AGREEMENT WITH IPINFO FOR USE OF SERVICES, THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SUCH OTHER AGREEMENT SHALL PREVAIL OVER ANY CONFLICTING TERMS OR CONDITIONS IN THESE TERMS.</p>
<p>CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE SERVICES OR SITES MAY BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL GUIDELINES, TERMS, OR RULES, WHICH WILL BE POSTED ON THE SERVICE OR SITES IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH FEATURES.
TO THE EXTENT SUCH TERMS, GUIDELINES, AND RULES CONFLICT WITH THESE TERMS, SUCH TERMS SHALL GOVERN SOLELY WITH RESPECT TO SUCH FEATURES.
IN ALL OTHER SITUATIONS, THESE TERMS SHALL GOVERN.</p>
Your Account
<p>In the course of registering for or using the Services, you may be required to provide IPInfo with certain information, including your name, contact information, username and password (“Credentials”).
IPInfo handles such information with the utmost attention, care and security.
Nonetheless, you, not IPInfo, shall be responsible for maintaining and protecting your Credentials in connection with the Services.
If your contact information or other information relating to your account changes, you must notify IPInfo promptly and keep such information current.
You are solely responsible for any activity using your Credentials, whether or not you authorized that activity.
You should immediately notify IPInfo of any unauthorized use of your Credentials or if your email or password has been hacked or stolen.
If you discover that someone is using your Credentials without your consent, or you discover any other breach of security, you agree to notify IPInfo immediately.</p>
Content
<p>A variety of information, messages, comments, posts, text, graphics, software, photographs, videos, data, reviews, recommendations, and other materials may be made available through the Services by IPInfo or its suppliers (“Content”).
While IPInfo strives to keep the Content that it provides through the Services accurate, complete, and up-to-date, IPInfo cannot guarantee, and is not responsible for the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of any Content.
You acknowledge that by using the Services, you may be exposed to materials that are offensive, indecent or objectionable.
Under no circumstances will IPInfo be liable in any way for any such Content.
Furthermore, certain aspects of the Services may function to alert users of potential suspicious activity and threats (“Alerts”).
Such Alerts are opinions generated by the Services.
Accordingly, in no circumstances will IPInfo be liable for defamation, libel, or any similar claim as a result of the Alerts or any components of the Services used to generate Alerts.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that you may also be able to create, transmit, publish or display information (such as data files, written text, computer software, music, audio files or other sounds, photographs, videos or other images) through use of the Services.
All such information is referred to below as “User Content.” You agree that you are solely responsible for your User Content, and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage which IPInfo may suffer) in connection with such User Content.
If you are registering for these Services on behalf of an organization, you also agree that you are also responsible for the actions of associated Users and for any User Content that such associated Users might upload, record, publish, post, link to, or otherwise transmit or distribute through use of the Services.
IPInfo may refuse to store, provide, or otherwise maintain your User Content for any or no reason.
IPInfo may remove your User Content from the Services at any time if you violate these Terms or if the Services are canceled or suspended.
If User Content is stored using the Services with an expiration date, IPInfo may also delete the User Content as of that date.
User Content that is deleted may be irretrievable.
You agree that IPInfo has no responsibility or liability for the deletion or failure to store any User Content or other communications maintained or transmitted through use of the Services.
IPInfo reserves the right (but shall have no obligation) to monitor and remove User Content from the Services, in its discretion.
You agree to immediately take down any User Content that violates these Terms, including pursuant to a takedown request from IPInfo.
In the event that you elect not to comply with a request from IPInfo to take down certain User Content, IPInfo reserves the right to directly take down such User Content.
By submitting, posting or otherwise uploading User Content on or through the Services you give IPInfo a worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, adapt, modify, translate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such User Content for the purpose of enabling IPInfo to provide you with the Services, and for the limited purposes stated in our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, you agree to give IPInfo a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, adapt, modify, translate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display, and distribute any queries that you submit through the Services.</p>
Proprietary Rights
<p>You acknowledge and agree that IPInfo (or IPInfo’s licensors) own all legal right, title and interest in and to the Services and the Content and that the Services and the Content are protected by copyrights, trademarks, patents, or other proprietary rights and laws (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist).<br>
Except as provided in Section 3, IPInfo acknowledges and agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors) under these Terms in or to any User Content that you create, upload, submit, post, transmit, share or display on, or through, the Services, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in that User Content (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist).
Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing with IPInfo, you agree that you are responsible for protecting and enforcing those rights and that IPInfo has no obligation to do so on your behalf.</p>
