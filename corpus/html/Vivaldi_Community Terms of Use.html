Inactive account policy
Vivaldi.net‘s inactive account policy
<p>We encourage people to actively log in and use Vivaldi.net when they register an account.
To keep your account active, be sure to log in at least every 6 months.
Accounts and their contents may be permanently removed due to prolonged inactivity.</p>
How does Vivaldi.net determine inactivity?
<p>Inactivity is based on a combination of participating in community activities (in forum.vivaldi.net or in vivaldi.net blogs), logging in, syncing browser data or using vivaldi.net email service.
Therefore, unconfirmed or mass-produced accounts without virtual practice in any of these community activities are also subject to permanent removal at any time.
Please note that you may not be able to tell whether an account is currently inactive, as not all signs of account activity are publicly visible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Child safety
<p>Vivaldi has a zero-tolerance policy against child sexual abuse imagery.
If we become aware of such content, we will report it to the Norwegian Police Department, as required by law.
We may also take disciplinary action, including termination, against the Vivaldi Mail accounts of those involved.</p>
