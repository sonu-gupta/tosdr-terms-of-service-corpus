If you are a European Economic Area resident and you wish to contact our Data Protection Officer, you can do so via email at dpo-contact@yahooinc.com.
Please note, the platform that Yahoo provides to its consumers to manage and control their use of personal information does not work for VDMS B2B accounts.

<br>
<strong>8.
Our Legal Bases for Processing Information.
&nbsp;</strong>
<br>We mainly rely on three separate bases to lawfully process your information.

Third, in certain cases, we may process your information where necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of third parties, where those legitimate interests are not overridden by your rights or interests.
Occasionally, VDMS may rely on other legal bases to process your information, such as to protect a user’s vital interests (such as where there is a risk of imminent harm) or to comply with a legal obligation.&nbsp;<br>‍<br>
<strong>9.
Data Processing and Transfers<br>‍</strong>
<br>a.
VDMS processes Customer information related to individuals in the EU/EEA/UK and transfers that information from the EU/EEA/UK through various compliance mechanisms, including data processing agreements based on the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses, in accordance with the agreement between Customer and VDMS.&nbsp;<br>‍<br>b.
The United States and other non-EU/EEA/UK countries have different laws on data protection and rules in relation to government access to information.
If you are based in the EU/EEA/UK, when your data is moved from your home country to a third country outside the EU/EEA/UK, some of these countries may not have the same data protection safeguards as your home country.<br>c.
