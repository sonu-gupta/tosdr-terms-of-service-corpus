</p>
<p>
<strong>B.
Community Usage Rules.</strong> As a user of the Service, these Community Usage Rules (“<strong>Rules</strong>”) are here to help you understand the conduct that is expected of members of the Service’s online communities (“<strong>Communities</strong>”).
</p>
<p>
<strong>(i) Nature of Rules.</strong> Your participation in the Communities is subject to all of the Terms, including these Rules: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Your User-Generated Content.</strong> All of your User-Generated Content either must be original with you or you must have all necessary rights in it from third parties in order to permit you to comply with these Terms and any Additional Terms.
Your User-Generated Content should not contain any visible logos, phrases, or trademarks that belong to third parties.
Do not use any User-Generated Content that belongs to other people and pass it off as your own.
this includes any content that you might have found elsewhere on the Internet.
If anyone contributes to your User-Generated Content or has any rights to your User-Generated Content, or if anyone appears or is referred to in the User-Generated Content, then you must also have their permission to submit such User-Generated Content to LCE.
(For example, if someone has taken a picture of you and your friend, and you submit that photo to LCE as your User-Generated Content, then you must obtain your friend’s and the photographer’s permission to do so.)</li>
<li>
<strong>Speaking of Photos: No Pictures, Videos, or Images of Anyone Other Than You and Your Friends and Family.</strong> If you choose to submit photos to the Service, link to embedded videos, or include other images of real people, then make sure they are of you or of you and someone you know – and only if you have their express permission to submit it.</li>
<li>
<strong>Act Appropriately.</strong> All of your Service activities must be venue appropriate, as determined by us.
Be respectful of others’ opinions and comments so we can continue to build Communities for everyone to enjoy.
If you think your User-Generated Content might offend someone or be embarrassing to someone, then chances are it probably will and it doesn't belong on the Service.
Cursing, harassing, stalking, insulting comments, personal attacks, gossip, and similar actions are prohibited.
Your User-Generated Content must not threaten, abuse, or harm others, and it must not include any negative comments that are connected to race, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, or physical handicap.
Your User-Generated Content must not be defamatory, slanderous, indecent, obscene, pornographic, or sexually explicit.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Do Not Use for Commercial or Political Purposes.</strong> Your User-Generated Content must not advertise or promote a product or service or other commercial activity, or a politician, public servant, or law.</li>
<li>
<strong>Do Not Use for Inappropriate Purposes.</strong> Your User-Generated Content must not promote any infringing, illegal, or other similarly inappropriate activity.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Be Honest and Do Not Misrepresent Yourself or Your User-Generated Content.</strong> Do not impersonate any other person, user, or company, and do not submit User-Generated Content that you believe may be false, fraudulent, deceptive, inaccurate, or misleading, or that misrepresents your identity or affiliation with a person or company.</li>
<li>
<strong>Others Can See.</strong> We hope that you will use the Communities to exchange information and content and have venue appropriate discussions with other members.
However, please remember that the Communities are public or semi-public and User-Generated Content that you submit on the Service within a Community may be accessible and viewable by other users.
Do not submit personally identifying information (e.g., first and last name together, password, phone number, address, credit card number, medical information, e-mail address, or other personally identifiable information or contact information) on Community spaces and take care when disclosing this type of information to others.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Don’t Share Other Peoples’ Personal Information.</strong> Your User-Generated Content should not reveal another person’s address, phone number, e-mail address, social security or social insurance number, credit card number, medical information, financial information, or any other information that may be used to track, contact, or impersonate that individual, unless, and in the form and by the method, specifically requested by LCE and with the consent of that other person.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Don’t Damage the Service or Anyone’s Computers or Other Devices.</strong> Your User-Generated Content must not submit viruses, Trojan horses, spyware, or any other technologies or malicious code that could impact the operation of the Service or any computer or other Device.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you submit User-Generated Content that LCE reasonably believes violates these Rules, then we may take any legally available action that we deem appropriate, in our sole discretion.
However, we are not obligated to take any action not required by law.
We may require, at any time, proof of the permissions referred to above in a form acceptable to us.
Failure to provide such proof may lead to, among other things, the User-Generated Content in question being removed from the Service.</p>
<p>
<strong>(ii) Your Interactions With Other Users.
Disputes.</strong> You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Service, whether online or offline.
We are not responsible or liable for the conduct or content of any user.
We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor or become involved in disputes between you and other users.
Exercise common sense and your best judgment in your interactions with others (e.g., when you submit any personal or other information) and in all of your other online activities.</p>
<p>

<p>If you register for any feature that requires a password and/or username, then you will select your own password at the time of registration (or we may send you an email notification with a randomly generated initial password) and you agree that: (i) You will not use a username (or email address) that (1) is already in use, (2) may impersonate another person, (3) belongs to another person, (4) violates the intellectual property or other right of any person or entity, or (5) is offensive.
We may reject the use of any password, username, or email address for any other reason in our sole discretion.
(ii) You will provide true, accurate, current, and complete registration information about yourself in connection with the registration process and, as permitted, continuously and promptly update such information to ensure that it is at all times, accurate, current, and complete.

Without limiting the foregoing, Profiles may not be used to offer anything for sale or conduct commercial activities, including, but not limited to, transactions, advertising, fundraising, contests or other promotions absent our prior written consent.
We may offer you the ability to set preferences relating to your Profile, or Service activities, (e.g., choices about what is displayed to whom) but settings may not become effective immediately or be error free, and options may change from time-to-time.
We assume no responsibility or liability for users’ Profile material.</p>

</p>
<p>Please note that the DMCA provides that any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be subject to liability.</p>
<p>We may send the information that you provide in your notice to the person who provided the allegedly infringing work.

<p>Please note that the DMCA provides that any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification may be subject to liability.</p>
<p>If we receive a DMCA Counter-Notification, then we may replace the material that we removed (or stop disabling access to it) in not less than ten (10) and not more than fourteen(14) business days following receipt of the DMCA Counter-Notification.
However, we will not do this if we first receive notice at the addresses above that the party who sent us the DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice has filed a lawsuit asking a court for an order restraining the person who provided the material from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on the Service.

We may, in our sole and absolute discretion, limit or cancel quantities purchased per person, per household or per order.
These restrictions may include orders placed by or under the same account, the same credit card, and/or orders that use the same billing and/or shipping address.
In the event that we are unable to or choose not to complete an order, you will be notified accordingly and the amount for that order charged to you will be reduced accordingly.</p>

If the Dispute has a claimed value of not more than $250,000, then the arbitration will be heard and determined by a single neutral arbitrator who is a retired judge or a lawyer with not less than fifteen (15) years’ experience as a practicing member of the bar in the substantive practice area related to the Dispute, who will administer the proceedings in accordance with the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes.
If the Dispute has acclaimed value of more than $250,000, or if LCE elects in its sole discretion to bear the costs of arbitration in excess of those that would occur for a proceeding before a single neutral arbitrator, then the arbitration will be heard and determined by a three-member panel, with one member to be selected by each party and the third (who will be chair of the panel) selected by the two party-appointed members or by the AAA in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules.
The arbitrator or arbitration panel, as the case may be, will apply applicable law and the provisions of these Terms and any Additional Terms, will determine any Dispute according to the applicable law and facts based upon the record and no other basis, and will issue a reasoned award.
If you and LCE do not both consent to the arbitration of an Excluded Dispute as set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph of this Section 12.B(i), then this paragraph and the remainder of this Section 12.B will not apply to the Excluded Dispute.</p>
<p> If a party properly submits the Dispute to the AAA for formal arbitration and the AAA is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within sixty (60) days of the filing of a “demand for arbitration,” then either party can elect to have the arbitration administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services Inc.
(“<strong>JAMS</strong>”) using JAMS’ streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, or by any other arbitration administration service that you and an officer or legal representative of LCE consent to in writing.
The substantive practice area requirements for the arbitrator and the $250,000 threshold for a the number of arbitrators assigned to the Dispute set forth in the paragraph above for the AAA arbitration will also apply to any such arbitration under JAMS or another arbitration service.</p>
<p> You can obtain AAA and JAMS procedures, rules, and fee information as follows:</p>

<strong>(ii) Nature, Limitations, and Location of Alternative Dispute Resolution.</strong> In arbitration, as with a court, the arbitrator must honor the terms of these Terms (and any Additional Terms) and can award the prevailing party damages and other relief (including attorneys’ fees).
However, WITH ARBITRATION (A) THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY, (B) THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND ARBITRATION OUTCOME ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY RULES, AND (C) JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATION OUTCOME IS LIMITED.
All parties to the arbitration will have the right, at their own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other advocate of their choosing.
If an in-person arbitration hearing is required, then it will be conducted in the “metropolitan statistical area” (as defined by the U.S.
Census Bureau) where you are a resident, or nearest to your place of residence at the time the Dispute is submitted to arbitration.
You and we will pay the administrative and arbitrator’s fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules.
but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require LCE to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this Section 12 to be enforceable, then LCE will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration, or to decline to do so and have the matter resolved through the courts.
Discovery will be permitted pursuant to the applicable arbitration rules.
The arbitrator’s decision must consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim of the Dispute, and must provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and any award (if any) is based.
Judgment on the arbitration decision and award (if any) may be entered in or by any court that has jurisdiction over the parties pursuant to Section 9 of the Federal Arbitration Act.
</p>
<p>
<strong>C.
Limited Time To File Claims.</strong> TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU OR WE WANT TO ASSERT A DISPUTE (BUT NOT AN EXCLUDED DISPUTE) AGAINST THE OTHER, THEN YOU OR WE MUST COMMENCE IT (BY DELIVERY OF WRITTEN NOTICE AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 12.A) WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE DISPUTE ARISES – OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED.
</p>
<p>
<strong>D.
Injunctive Relief.</strong> The foregoing provisions of this Section 12 will not apply to any legal action taken by LCE to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in connection with, any loss, cost, or damage (or any potential loss, cost, or damage) relating to the Service, any Content, your User-Generated Content and/or LCE’s intellectual property rights (including such LCE may claim that may be in dispute), LCE’s operations, and/or LCE’s products or services.
</p>
<p>
<strong>E.
Small Claims Matters Are Excluded From Arbitration Requirement.</strong> Notwithstanding the foregoing, either of us may bring qualifying claim of Disputes (but not Excluded Disputes) in small claims court, subject to Section 12.G.</p>
<p>
<strong>F.
No Class Action Matters.</strong> Disputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be consolidated with any other arbitration or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party.
But if, for any reason, any court with competent jurisdiction or any arbitrator selected pursuant to Section 12.B(i) holds that this restriction is unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement in Section 12.B to arbitrate will not apply and the Dispute must be brought exclusively in court pursuant to Section 12.G.
</p>
<p>
<strong>G.
Federal and State Courts in Detroit.</strong> For users of the Services who are not individuals resident in Quebec, except to the extent that arbitration is required in Section 12.B, and except as to the enforcement of any arbitration decision or award, any action or proceeding relating to any Dispute or Excluded Dispute may only be instituted in state or federal court in Detroit, MI.
Accordingly, you and LCE consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts for such matters.</p>
