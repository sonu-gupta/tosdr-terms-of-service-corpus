we can only cancel the entire order when it is justified).</p>

In such cases, the amounts paid for the cancelled order will be returned to the Business-maker’s Balance and will be deducted from the Nerd’s Balance or, if there are no sufficient amounts in the Nerd’s Xavio Balance, from future revenues of such Nerds.</p>
<br>
<p> Orders are not eligible to be cancelled based on the quality of service/materials delivered by the Nerd if the service was rendered as described in the project.
Business-makers may rate their experience with the Nerd on the Update page, including the overall level of service quality received.</p>
<br>
<p> Business-makers must use Xavio Issue page to address their concerns and desired resolution related to the service provided by their Nerd prior to contacting Conwire.
