<p>This privacy policy informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information of users of our website and/or services.<strong> We pride ourselves in ensuring that we collect, use, process and erase any personal information in accordance with current applicable laws in the United States of America (USA) and the General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR).</strong> We’ve written a short blog post about our GDPR compliance.</p>
<p>If you have requests or questions concerning your personal information, please contact us at support@hypothes.is</p>
<p>Hypothesis offers annotation services, which you can use by signing up for an account where you will be asked to acknowledge and agree to our privacy policy.
Some parts of those services are also available for anyone to view without an account, such as public annotations.
We also publish an organizational website which in turn includes our annotation services so people can annotate our website.</p>
<p>We do not ask visitors to opt in just to access our organizational website because we have taken specific steps not to collect any personal information on the website using cookies or other means.
The only cookies we use are de-identified, helping us understand how the website is used in general and to make it faster and easier to use.
The website does enable you to opt in separately to do things like file support requests, receive emails, and/or follow our social media accounts, each of which may collect personal information from you to fulfill your request and are outlined below.
Because our annotation services are embedded in our website, and because annotations can in turn embed other media, you may encounter annotations made by visitors that include media or links to other websites that set cookies that collect personal information.
You can adjust your browser to block such cookies before viewing annotations on our website.</p>

However, we do provide API access to our systems to third parties, as described above (Authenticated and Unauthenticated users) who access user information such as annotations (along with username of annotator, URL of annotation source, and text body of annotation) for which they have specific permissions to access.
We do not monetize our user traffic in any way.</p>
Automated Processing of Personal Information
<p>Hypothesis does not engage in any automated processing (i.e.
profiling) of user information at this time.
Users should be aware that third parties with access to our services using our APIs may engage in automated processing of user information.</p>
Securing Your Personal Information
<p>Hypothesis secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure using the following methods:</p>
<p>When personal information is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.</p>
<p>User passwords are salted and hashed using the industry standard “bcrypt” algorithm.
No Hypothesis staff member has access to user passwords.
Hypothesis staff have access to user email addresses only for support purposes.</p>
<p>We retain user IP address information and request information for a strictly limited period for diagnostic purposes only.
We also collect some information in aggregate about your activities within our application from the client.
This de-identified information is used for internal metrics and operational support, but we do not track your individual activity.</p>
Breach of Privacy
<p>In case of a breach of private information, we will notify affected users via the email address associated with their account within 72 hours of uncovering the breach.</p>
International Transfer of Your Personal Information
<p>Hypothesis operates globally so it is necessary to transfer your information internationally.
In particular, your information will likely be transferred to and processed via servers located in the USA.
The USA, European Economic Area (“EEA”) Member States, and other countries all have different laws.
When your information is moved from your home country to another country, the laws and rules that protect your personal information in the country to which your information is transferred may be different from those in the country in which you live.
For example, the circumstances in which law enforcement can access personal information may vary from country to country.
In particular, if your information is in the USA, it may be accessed by government authorities in accordance with laws in the USA.</p>
<p>To the extent that Hypothesis is deemed to transfer personal information outside of the EEA, we rely separately, alternatively, and independently on the following legal bases to transfer your information:</p>
<p>
<strong>Privacy Shield</strong>.
Hypothesis does not participate in Privacy Shield at this time.
However, Hypothesis may rely on the EU-USA Privacy Shield to transfer personal information to some of our third-party service providers in the United States of America, where they are certified to receive such information under the&nbsp;Privacy Shield Program.</p>
<p>
<strong>Necessary for the performance of the contract</strong>.
Hypothesis provides voluntary services.
you can choose whether or not you want to use our services.
However, if you want to use our services, you need to agree to our&nbsp;Terms of Service which set out the contract between Hypothesis and its users.
As we operate in countries worldwide (including in the USA) and may use technical infrastructure in the USA to deliver our services to you, in accordance with the contract between us, we need to transfer your personal information to the USA and to other jurisdictions as necessary to provide our services.</p>
Retention
<p>Hypothesis will keep information provided by users and third-party service providers for no longer than is necessary for operating and improving our services.
Moreover, Hypothesis will respect of rights of individual users who request that their information be removed, updated, etc.</p>
<p>Hypothesis will retain your information for as long as your account is active (i.e.
for the lifetime of your Hypothesis account), as described in this policy, or as needed to provide our services to you.
If you no longer want Hypothesis to use your information to provide our services to you, you may close your account.
Hypothesis will retain and use your information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your information to comply with applicable tax/revenue laws), resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, and as otherwise described in this policy.
We also retain log files for internal analysis purposes.
These log files are generally retained for a brief period of time, except in cases where they are used for site safety and security, to improve site functionality, or when we are legally obligated to retain them for longer time periods.</p>
Your Rights
Right to Access User Information
<p>Users have a right to access their User Information (email, username, number of annotations, group membership, annotations, etc) at any time either through their user settings or by logging into the services.</p>
Right to Update User Information
<p>Users have a right to update their User Information (email, username, number of annotations, group membership, etc) at any time either through their user settings (i.e.
https://hypothes.is/users/[username])) or by contacting Hypothesis at support@hypothes.is and submitting an email request to have their user Information updated.
Hypothesis may request identifying information to confirm the identity of the party requesting an update.</p>
Update or Delete Annotations
<p>Users have a right to update or delete their public, private, and group annotations.
Any update or delete request of public annotations will take affect going forward in our systems, but any prior publication of the “un-edited” public or group annotation captured by third parties with API access (authenticated or unauthenticated) to our systems may still retain the original, unchanged public or group annotation which they may have retrieved prior to the update or delete request.</p>
Ability to Update Privacy Settings Associated with Annotations
<p>Hypothesis annotations have one of three privacy settings: fully public, public within an annotation group, and fully private (visible only to its author).
Annotators can change the visibility (privacy settings) of any of their annotations in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Private annotations can be made more public</em>.
Depending on their context, they can either be made visible publicly or only to members of an annotation group.</li>
<li>
<em>Public annotations and annotations shared with groups can be made private</em>, thereafter visible only to their authors, but others may have seen such annotations and/or captured them via the API while they were more widely available.</li>
</ul>
Right to Erasure
<p>Users have a right to delete their user Information (email, username, active status, number of annotations, group membership, etc) at any time by contacting Hypothesis at support@hypothes.is and submitting an email request to have their user Information deleted.
Hypothesis may request identifying information to confirm the identity of the party requesting an update.</p>
<p>Please note that any annotations captured by our services prior to request for deletion by a user would have been accessible to API users, and we do not have a mechanism to force those API users to remove that information, but we will respect the request of the user and delete it from our services going forward.</p>
Data Portability
<p>Users have the right to receive a copy of the information maintained about them, which they have provided to our services, in a standard format and have the right to transmit the information to another business entity without hindrance from us.
Users can email support@hypothes.is to request a copy of their information.</p>
Right to Restriction of Processing
<p>Users have the right to restrict processing of their personal information.
We will assist users in updating the information maintained about them or assisting them with their subject access requests in a timely manner in order to remedy concerns users have about their personal information.</p>
Right to Object
<p>Our services do not justify data processing on the basis of legitimate interest.
Therefore, this right does not apply to our services.</p>
Right to Not Be Subject to Automated Decision Making
<p>Our services do not provide decisions based solely on automated processing that produces legal effects concerning the user.
Therefore, this right does not apply to our services.</p>
Withdrawing Consent
<p>Where you have provided your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent to our processing of your information and your use of our services.
For example, you can withdraw your consent to email communications by using the unsubscribe links in such emails.
You can choose to withdraw your consent to our processing of your information and your use of our services at any time by closing your account and then emailing support@hypothes.is to request that your personal information be deleted, except for information that we are required to retain.
This deletion is permanent and your account cannot be reinstated.</p>
E-mail Communications &amp.
How to Opt-Out
<p>From time to time, we may contact you via email for the purpose of providing news, announcements, alerts, confirmations, surveys, and/or other general communication.
In order to improve our services, we may receive notifications when you open, forward, or click on links in emails from us.</p>
<p>Please note that email communications from us about our services or annotation beyond the administration of your account are opt-in.
If you would like to stop receiving such email communications, you may opt out using the “unsubscribe” link provided in every email or by contacting us at support@hypothes.is.</p>
<p>Opt-in organizational emails from us may contain tracking facilities within the actual email.
Subscriber activity is tracked and stored in a database for future analysis and evaluation.
Such tracked activity may include but shall not be limited to: the opening of emails, forwarding of emails, the clicking of links within the email content, times, dates and frequency of activity.
This information is used to refine future email campaigns and supply the users with more relevant content based on their activity.</p>
<p>You may also control the receipt of certain types of communications from us.
We may send you messages about our services or your activity.
Some of these messages are required, services-related messages for users (such as transactional messages, email confirmation, replies to annotations, or legal notices).
Other messages are not required, such as newsletters and announcements.
You can control which optional messages you choose to receive via the unsubscribe links in our emails.</p>
<p>If you no longer wish to use our services or receive services-related messages (except for legally required notices), then you may close your account by contacting us at support@hypothes.is.</p>
Additional Information or Assistance
