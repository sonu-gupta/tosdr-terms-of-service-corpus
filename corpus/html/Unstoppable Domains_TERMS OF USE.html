<b>AGREEMENT TO TERMS</b>These Terms of Use constitute a legally binding agreement made between you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity (“you”, “your”, “customer”, “customers”) and Unstoppable Domains, Inc., along with its agents, assigns, and affiliates "<b>Company</b>", “<b>we</b>”, “<b>us</b>”, or “<b>our</b>”), concerning your access to and use of the unstoppabledomains.com website as well as any other media form, media channel, mobile website or mobile application related, linked, or otherwise connected thereto which is controlled by the Company (collectively, the “Site”).
However, please note that blockchain networks, even if Unstoppable Domains publishes Domain Names or other records to them, are controlled by third parties (who may be distributed networks of independent computers), and are therefore not included in the definition of the “Site”.&nbsp.

We reserve the right to limit or prohibit orders that, in our sole judgment, appear to be placed by dealers, resellers, or distributors.&nbsp;<b>REFUND POLICY</b>Unless otherwise stated in this Terms of Service, all fees for domain name registrations and related domain name Service(s) are refundable, for a full refund of the purchase price, within 14 days of purchase, with the exception of those domain name registrations and related domain name Service(s) purchased with crypto, which must have a refund request within 5 days of purchase.
All refunds will be processed with the same payment method used to purchase the domain, at the then-current spot rates for the USD value of your purchase at the time the refund is issued.&nbsp;<strong>Only the purchase price of your domain will be refunded.
any claim fees, blockchain fees or other related fees paid by you will not be refunded.</strong>&nbsp;Unstoppable Domains strongly advises against purchasing any domain that is associated with a trademark, public figure, or with a known brand.
However, in the event that you purchase a domain associated with a trademark, public figure, or a known brand, and wish to return such domain, Unstoppable Domains will refund the full purchase price of the domain regardless of the timing of the refund.&nbsp;Unstoppable Domains reserves the right to refuse, at its sole discretion, to sell a domain name to you for any reason (or to complete such sale once initiated).&nbsp;Domain fees from new domain name registrations may be refundable, at the sole discretion of Unstoppable Domains, in the event of issues arising from actual or prospective trademark infringement or other abuses, “phishing” (the fraudulent practice of sending emails purporting to be from reputable companies or individuals in order to induce individuals to reveal personal information), technical limitations on name resolutions, mispriced sales (i.e., where the price should have been higher), and legal exigencies (i.e., court-ordered blocking or takeover of domain names, law enforcement-related reasons, etc.).&nbsp;All refunds shall be made to your profile on our website in the original payment method used, or in store credit.&nbsp;All payments made by card and Paypal will be refunded and processed in US dollars: you are solely responsible for any fluctuations in the exchange rate between other national currencies or cryptocurrencies between the time period of the original payment and the time that the subsequent refund is issued.&nbsp;All payments made with cryptocurrency will be refunded and processed in the equivalent amount of USD that was received: you are solely responsible for any fluctuations in the exchange rate between other national currencies or cryptocurrencies between the time period of the original payment and the time that the subsequent refund is issued.&nbsp;Once a domain goes live on the blockchain and is transferred to your control (that is, to your crypto-wallet, alterable or transferrable only via a private key you personally hold), it is 100% under your own ownership and custody.
Unstoppable Domains will not be able to refund your purchase funds or repossess the domain name.
However, if you agree to cover the fees associated with transferring the domain back to Unstoppable Domains, we can refund the original purchase once the domain is received, provided the refund is requested within the timelines above.
For the avoidance of doubt, <strong>refunds to the original payment method will only be available on claimed domains if you return the domain to the Unstoppable Domains corporate account, and pay any blockchain fees or gas fees necessary to transfer it back.</strong> Unstoppable Domains will not refund any such fees.&nbsp;If you have received any store credit or promotional credit or items in connection with your purchase of a domain and wish to receive a refund for the original purchase, you must transfer the purchased domain back to our corporate account, and must forfeit any additional promotional items or credits granted in connection with the purchase, including additional domains bought with promotional credit granted by the original purchase.
If you have minted any domains bought with promotional credit granted by the original purchase, you must also return these domains to our corporate account in order to receive a refund.&nbsp;All purchases made with promotional credits are NON-REFUNDABLE, and are not eligible for exchanges under any circumstances.
Domains purchased with promotion credits cannot be exchanged for alternative or equivalent products, even when a typo is made.&nbsp;Any additional fees paid for preorders, “sunrise” registration, or any other early access programs, spent domain minting and twitter verification credits are non-refundable.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES</b>You may not access or use the Site for any purpose other than that for which we make the Site available.

<b>Informal Negotiations</b>&nbsp;To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Terms of Use (each a "Dispute" and collectively, the “Disputes”) brought by either you or us (individually, a “Party” and collectively, the “Parties”), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration.
Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.&nbsp;<b>Binding Arbitration</b>&nbsp;If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.
The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org.
Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.

The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.
Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in Clark County, Nevada.
Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.&nbsp;If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in Clark County, Nevada, and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts.
Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Terms of Use.&nbsp;In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Site be commenced more than one (1) years after the cause of action arose.
If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.&nbsp;<b>Restrictions</b>&nbsp;The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually.
To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding.

and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.&nbsp;<b>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration</b>&nbsp;The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party.
