<li>Updated</li>
</ul> Policy
<p>Guilded appreciates the security community to find vulnerabilities to keep our customers and our business safe.</p>
Response
<p>Guilded will make a best effort to respond to and triage problems brought to our attention.
Our goal is to respond to reports within four days and then triage within an additional four days.</p>
<p>We'll do our best to keep you informed throughout the process.</p>
Disclosure
<p>The goal of this program is to help keep our users and their data safe so when disclosing a vulnerability please follow the rules set out here.&nbsp.
Additionally, make sure to respect our usersâ€™ privacy and ensure your actions do not harm our users.</p>
<p>On our end, we will make an effort to prioritize security and not take punitive action towards researchers that abide by our guidelines to make sure that we encourage reports.</p>
Guidelines
<ul>
<li>Please provide detailed, reproducible steps to construct the vulnerability.</li>
<li>When we receive multiple reports for the same issue, we will not necessarily be able to respond to all reports but will respond to the first report received.&nbsp;</li>
<li>If a single underlying problem causes multiple vulnerabilities, we will consider that a single vulnerability.</li>
<li>Any social engineering (e.g.
phishing) is prohibited.</li>
<li>During your investigations make a reasonable effort to avoid:</li>
<ul>
<li>privacy violations</li>
<li>destruction of data</li>
<li>interruption or degradation of our service</li>
</ul>
<li>Only interact with accounts you own or with the explicit permission of the owner.</li>
</ul>
Recognition and Reward
<p>We will recognize those that help us here and, in some cases, provide a modest reward depending on the scope and severity of the discovered vulnerability.&nbsp.
A report must be the first report we receive for a specific issue to be eligible.</p>

<li>Software version disclosure / Banner identification issues / Descriptive error messages or headers (e.g.
stack traces, application, or server errors).</li>
<li>Public Zero-day vulnerabilities that have had an official patch for less than 1 month will be awarded on a case by case basis.</li>
<li>Tabnabbing</li>
<li>Open redirect - unless an additional security impact can be demonstrated</li>
<li>Issues that require unlikely user interaction</li>
</ul>
Safe Harbor
<p>Any activities conducted in a manner consistent with this policy will be considered authorized conduct.
