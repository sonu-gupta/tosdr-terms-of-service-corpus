</ul>
<br>Transfer of your information out of the EEA<p>We may transfer your personal information to the USA.
This is for the purpose of enabling our third party service providers to access and process the data on our behalf.
In particular, we use the following service providers who process your information in the USA:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mixpanel</li>
<li>Stripe</li>
<li>Cloudflare</li>
<li>Chatra</li>
<li>Postmark</li>
</ul>
<p>The USA does not have the same data protection laws as the United Kingdom and European Economic Area.
Whilst the European Commission has not given a formal decision that the USA provides an adequate level of data protection similar to those which apply in the United Kingdom and EEA, any transfer of your personal information will be subject to safeguards as specified in the General Data Protection Regulation that are designed to help protect your privacy rights and give you remedies in the unlikely event of a misuse of your personal information.
Some of our US-based providers (including Mixpanel, and Stripe, our payment processor) are certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield, a mechanism which permits transfer of personal data to companies in the US who have certified that they meet privacy norms akin to those in the EU.
Our other processors use so-called ‘model clauses’ in our contract with them, which give individual data subjects rights in respect of the provider’s processing of the data and requires the provider to meet certain EU-mandated standard.
A description of the</p>
<p>EU-US Privacy Shield is available here - https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/eu-us-privacy-shield_en.</p>
<p>A description of the Model Clauses is available here - https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en.</p>

<p>We will not otherwise transfer your personal data outside of the United Kingdom or European Economic Area.</p>
