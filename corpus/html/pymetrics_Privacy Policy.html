<p>We retain Personal Information from you with your consent, or where we have an ongoing legitimate business need (for example, to provide you with a service or other information you have requested or to comply with applicable legal requirements).
When we have no on-going legitimate business need to process your Personal Information, we will either delete, de-identify or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your Personal Information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your Personal Information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
