         npm Open-Source Terms
<p>These npm Open Source terms of use (these <em>Terms</em>) govern access to
and use of https://www.npmjs.com (the <em>Website</em>) as well as the
"npm Public Registry" at https://registry.npmjs.org (the <em>Public
Registry</em>), and the discussion forum at https://npm.community
(<em>npm.community</em>).
npm, Inc.
(<em>npm</em>) operates each of those
services.
These terms refer to all of them together as <em>npm Open
Source</em>.</p>
<p>npm last updated these npm Open Source Terms on
December 16, 2019.
You can review prior versions at
https://github.com/npm/policies/commits/master/open-source-terms.md.</p>
Important Terms
<p>
<strong>
<em>These Terms include a number of important provisions that affect your
rights and responsibilities, such as the disclaimers in "Disclaimers",
limits on npm's liability to you in "Limits on Liability", and an
agreement to arbitrate disputes individually in "Arbitration".</em>
</strong>
</p>
Other Terms
<p>npm offers additional, paid services (<em>Paid Services</em>) that are subject
to additional terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Additional terms for npm Paid Services are available at
https://www.npmjs.com/policies/private-terms.</li>
</ul>
<p>npm Open Source and any Paid Services you may agree to use are together
called <em>npm Services</em> throughout these Terms.</p>
Legal Agreement
<p>You may only access or use npm Services by agreeing to these Terms.
If npm adds any additional functionality to npm Services, you must
agree to these Terms to use that new functionality, too.
You show your agreement
with npm on these Terms by creating a user account (your <em>Account</em>)
or by accessing or using npm Services without creating an account.
The agreement between you and npm is a legally binding contract (this
<em>Agreement</em>).</p>
Changes
<p>npm may change these Terms and the additional terms for Paid Services
in the future.
npm will post changes on the Website with a new "last
updated" date.
If you have an Account, npm will notify you of changes
by email to the address provided for your Account, by a message on the
Website, or both.
If you do not have an account, npm may notify you of
changes by a general announcement via the Website, but it is up to you
to check for changes to these Terms.
After receiving notice of changes
to these Terms, you must accept those changes to continue using npm
Services.
You accept changes to these Terms by continuing to use npm
Services.
npm may change, suspend, or discontinue npm Services at any
time without notice or liability to you.</p>
npm Policies
<p>npm respects your privacy and limits use and sharing of information
about you collected by npm Services.
The privacy policy at
https://www.npmjs.com/policies/privacy (the <em>Privacy Policy</em>)
describes these policies.
npm will abide by the Privacy Policy and honor
the privacy settings that you choose via npm Services.</p>
<p>npm respects the exclusive rights of copyright holders and responds
to notifications about alleged infringement via npm Services per
the copyright policy at https://www.npmjs.com/policies/dmca (the
<em>Copyright Policy</em>).</p>
<p>npm resolves disputes about package names, user names, and organization
names in the Public Registry per the policy at
https://www.npmjs.com/policies/disputes (<em>Dispute Policy</em>).
This
includes "package squatting".</p>
<p>Use of all npm Services is governed by the code of conduct at
https://www.npmjs.com/policies/conduct (<em>Code of Conduct</em>).</p>
<p>npm permits use of npm trademarks per the policy at
https://www.npmjs.com/policies/trademark.</p>
Use of npm Open Source
<p>Subject to these Terms, npm grants you permission to use npm Open
Source.
That permission is not exclusive to you, and you cannot transfer
it to anyone else.</p>
<p>Your permission to use npm Open Source entitles you to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You may search for, download, publish, and manage packages of
computer code (<em>Packages</em>) in the Public Registry, and otherwise
interact with the Public Registry, via the command-line tool
published by npm at https://www.github.com/npm/npm (the <em>CLI</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may search for, download, publish, and manage Packages using
software other than CLI via application programming interfaces that
npm publicly documents or makes available for public use (<em>Public
APIs</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may search for and manage Packages in the Public Registry, and
otherwise interact with the Public Registry, via the Website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may update and manage your Account via the Website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may visit, create an account for, and participate in,
discussions on npm.community.</p>
</li>
</ol>
Conditions
<p>Your permission to use npm Open Source, as well as any permission you
may have to use Paid Services, are subject to the following conditions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You must be at least 13 years of age to use npm Services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may not use npm Services after npm says you may not, such as by
disabling your Account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must use npm Services only in accordance with "Acceptable Use".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may access and use data about the security of Packages, such
as vulnerability reports, audit status reports, and supplementary
security documentation, only for your own personal or internal
business purposes.
You may <em>not</em> provide others access to, copies
of, or use of npm data about the security of Packages, directly
or as part of other products or services.</p>
</li>
</ol>
Acceptable Use
<ol>
<li>
<p>You will abide by the
Code of Conduct and the
Dispute Policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not submit material to npm as a package or in any other
form that violates npm's <em>Acceptable Content</em>, described below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not disclose information that you do not have the right to
disclose, such as confidential information of others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not copy or share any personally identifiable information of
any other person without their specific permission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not violate any applicable law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not use or attempt to use another person's Account without
their specific permission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not buy, sell, or otherwise trade in user names,
organization names, names for <em>Packages</em>, or any other names
reserved on <em>npm Services</em>, for money or other compensation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not use <em>npm Services</em>' ability to send e-mail to send
advertisements, chain letters, or other solicitations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not automate access to, use, or monitor the Website, such
as with a web crawler, browser plug-in or add-on, or other computer
program that is not a web browser.
You may replicate data from the
Public Registry using the Public APIs per this Agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not use npm Services to send email to distribution lists,
newsgroups, or group mail aliases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not falsely imply that you are affiliated with or endorsed
by npm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not operate illegal schemes, such as pyramid schemes, via
npm Services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not deep-hyperlink to images or other non-hypertext content
served by npm Services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not remove any marking indicating proprietary ownership
from any material got via npm Services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not display any portion of the Website via an HTML IFRAME.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not disable, avoid, or circumvent any security or access
restrictions of npm Services, or access parts of npm Services not
intended for access by you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not strain infrastructure of npm Services with an
unreasonable volume of requests, or requests designed to impose an
unreasonable load on IT systems underlying npm Services.
This rule
is intentionally loose, to give npm the flexibility it needs to keep
npm Services working for the user community as a whole.
But to draw
one clear line, under no circumstances are five million requests to
npm Services in a single month-long period by any single individual,
organization, or group of affiliated companies remotely reasonable.
If
you have a special need to make lots and lots of requests, our
sales team can help.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not encourage or assist any other person in violation of
"Acceptable Use".</p>
</li>
</ol>
Acceptable Content
<p>Administrators at npm reserve the right to delete content hosted on
the npm Services that they deem unacceptable.
Unacceptable content
can take the form of a package, a README file, a user or organization
name, or any other content submitted to npm Services.
A few examples
of unacceptable content:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Content that is illegal, offensive, or otherwise harmful.
This includes
content that is harassing, inappropriate, or abusive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Content in violation of law, infringing the intellectual property
rights of others, violating the privacy or other rights of others,
or in violation of any agreement with a third party.
This includes
code that violates a public license for others' work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Content containing malicious computer code, such as computer viruses,
computer worms, rootkits, back doors, or spyware.
This
includes content submitted for research purposes unless agreed to
in advance by npm.
Tools designed and documented explicitly to
assist in security research are acceptable, but proof-of-concept
exploits are not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Packages that are not functionally compatible with the npm
command-line client.
For example, a "package" cannot simply be
a PNG or JPEG image, a movie file, or a text document uploaded
directly to the registry.
Using the Public Registry as a general purpose database is not allowed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Content that exists only to "reserve" a name, whether a package name,
user name, or organization name.
The
Dispute Policy governs
how npm handles such cases of "squatting".</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To find out how to report violations of Acceptable Content, refer to the
Code of Conduct.</p>
Commercial Content
<p>The npm Public Registry is about Packages.
All manner of
useful Packages are welcome, from hobby projects to
competitive products, enterprise infrastructure and tooling
to the latest fun hack or work of software art.</p>
<p>At the same time, the npm Public Registry, the Website, and
important conventions like <code>README</code> go beyond just code.
Developers use all of those channels to communicate more
broadly about code, who is developing it, why, and how.</p>
<p>That communication is important, and welcome, so long as it
respects that the npm Public Registry, the website, and npm
Open Source more generally remain neutral.
You are free to
use npm Open Source for commercial projects, to advance your
career, and for other business purposes.
But you may not
leverage content or system conventions to make the npm
Public Registry, Website, or CLI put business before code.</p>
<p>These kinds of commercial content are generally acceptable
in <code>README</code> files and other documentation:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Credits, acknowledgments, attributions, and other
recognitions of contributions to Packages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information on how to pay, donate to, and otherwise
support Package development, Package developers, and
Package steward organizations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Logos from, and links to, organizations developing,
stewarding, or sponsoring Package development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information on paid products and services related to
Packages, such as enhanced versions, add-ons, commercial
license terms, training, integration, or support.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These kinds of commercial content generally <em>aren't</em>
acceptable:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
<code>README</code>, <code>package.json</code>, or other content displaying
advertisements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Packages that display ads at runtime, on installation,
or at other stages of the software development
lifecycle, such as via npm
scripts.
Packages
with code that can be used to display ads are fine.
Packages that themselves display ads are not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Packages that function primarily as ads, with only
placeholder or negligible code, data, and other
technical content.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These examples are just examples.
npm will continue to
apply its judgment when deciding what content is acceptable.
npm will continue to expect you to apply your own judgment
when choosing what you share and how.
</p>
Enforcement of Acceptable Use
<p>npm may investigate and prosecute violations of this Agreement to the
fullest legal extent.
npm may notify and cooperate with law enforcement
authorities in prosecuting violations of this Agreement.</p>
Your Account
<p>You must create and log into an Account to access features of some npm
Services, including npm Open Source.</p>
<p>To create an Account, you must provide certain information about
yourself, as required by the account creation form on the Website or the
CLI.
If you create an Account, you will provide, at a minimum, a valid
email address.
You will keep that email address up-to-date.
You will
not impersonate any other individual.
You may delete your Account at any
time by contacting support.</p>
<p>You will be responsible for all action taken using your account, whether
authorized by you or not, until you either close your account or give
npm notice that the security of your Account has been compromised.
You will notify npm immediately if you suspect the security of your
Account has been compromised.
You will select a secure password for your
Account.
You will keep your password secret.</p>
<p>npm may restrict, suspend, or terminate your Account according to the
Copyright Policy, if npm reasonably believes that you are in breach of
these Terms, or if npm reasonably believes that you have misused npm
Services.</p>
Your Content
<p>Nothing in this Agreement gives npm any ownership rights in intellectual
property that you share with npm Services, such as your Account
information or any Packages you share with npm Services (<em>Your
Content</em>).
Nothing in this Agreement gives you any ownership rights in
npm intellectual property provided via npm Services, like software,
documentation, trademarks, service marks, logotypes, or other
distinguishing graphics.</p>
<p>Between you and npm, you remain solely responsible for Your Content.
You
will not wrongly imply that Your Content is sponsored or approved by
npm.
npm will not be obligated to store, maintain, or provide copies of
your content, except per the Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>npm may remove Your Content from npm Services without notice if npm
suspects Your Content was submitted or used in violation of "Acceptable
Use", as well as per the Copyright Policy.</p>
<p>Your Content belongs to you.
You decide whether and how to license it.
But at a minimum, you license npm to provide Your Content to users
of npm Services when you share Your Content.
That special license
allows npm to copy, publish, and analyze Your Content, and to share
its analyses with others.
npm may run computer code in Your Content to
analyze it, but npm's special license alone does not give npm the right
to run code for its functionality in npm products or services.</p>
<p>When Your Content is removed from npm Services,
whether by you or npm, npm's special license ends when the last copy
disappears from npm's backups, caches, and other systems.
Other
licenses, such as open source licenses, may continue after Your Content
is removed.
Those licenses may give others, or npm itself, the right to
share Your Content with npm Services again.</p>
<p>Others who receive Your Content via npm Services may violate the terms
on which you license Your Content.
You agree that npm will not be liable
to you for those violations or their consequences.</p>
Feedback
<p>npm welcomes your feedback and suggestions for npm Services.
You agree
that npm will be free to act on feedback and suggestions you provide
without further notice, consent, or payment.
You will not submit
feedback or suggestions that you consider confidential or proprietary.</p>
Indemnity
<p>You will indemnify npm, its officers, directors, employees,
representatives, and agents, and hold them harmless for, all liability,
expenses, damages, and costs from any third-party claims, demands,
lawsuits, or other proceedings alleging that Your Content, your use
of npm Services, or both, violate the intellectual property right of
a third party, this Agreement, or applicable law.
You will not settle
any such proceeding without the prior written consent of npm.
npm will
notify you of any such proceeding it becomes aware of.</p>

<p>
<strong>
<em>Neither npm nor any third-party service provider used by npm to
provide npm Services will, under any circumstances, be liable to you

be changed to make it enforceable, that provision should be modified to
the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable.
Otherwise, that
provision should be removed.</p>
<p>You may not assign this Agreement.
npm may assign this Agreement to any
affiliate of npm, any third party that obtains control of npm, or any
third party that purchases assets of npm relating to npm Services.
Any
purported assignment of rights in breach of this provision is void.</p>
<p>Neither the exercise of any right under this Agreement, nor waiver of
any breach of this Agreement, waives any other breach of this Agreement.</p>
<p>This Agreement, together with the additional terms for Paid Services
and npm software that you and npm agree to, embody all the terms of
agreement between you and npm about npm Services.
This Agreement
supersedes any other agreements about npm Services, written or not.</p>
