</p>
<p>
<i>At Walmart, our customers are number one - always.
That's why everything we do is focused on providing excellent customer service and delivering low prices.</i>
</p>
<p>The information you share with Walmart allows us to provide the products and services you need and want while giving you the very best shopping experience.
For example, when you shop on Walmart.com we use what we know about your shopping habits to let you easily reorder products and show you other products that may interest you.</p>
<p>Our founder Sam Walton reminded us that "a promise we make is a promise we keep," and it's our promise to customers that we respect the trust you place in us and the privacy of the information you share.
Part of providing superior customer service includes making sure that we're building a relationship of trust with customers.
Our way of doing that is to let you know in a clear, prominent, and easily accessible way how we collect, use, share, and above all protect your personal information.&nbsp;</p>

<li>How and why we collect your personal information;</li>

</p>
<p>We are careful to share your personal information in ways that respect your privacy and only as described in this Policy.
We view you as a valued customer, not a product, and we do not sell or rent your personal information to others for money.
All of the categories of personal information that we collect have been shared with other companies, including those within our corporate family, for a business purpose.
We may share your personal information in the following circumstances:</p>
<p>
<b>Other Businesses in our Corporate Family</b>
<br>We may share your personal information with other brands and businesses within the Walmart corporate family.
When we do, the information will be used in ways that are consistent with this Policy.</p>
<p>
<b>Service Providers </b>
<br>We share personal information about you with service providers that help with our business activities, including shipping vendors, billing and refund vendors, payment card processors, marketing and advertising vendors, and companies that help us improve our products and services.
We require our service providers to keep your personal information secure.
We do not allow our service providers to use or share your personal information for any purpose other than providing services on our behalf.
Your personal information may be stored and processed by our service providers in the United States or other locations where the service providers or Walmart maintain facilities.</p>
<p>
<b>Products and Services Offered by Other Businesses</b>
<br>We will sometimes enable other businesses to make their products or services available to our customers, such as through Walmart.com Marketplace retailers.
You may purchase products or services from these other businesses at our stores or through our websites or mobile services.
When you purchase these products or services, we identify the other business and share with this business personal information related to your purchase of their products and services.
These other businesses may operate their business in the United States or in other countries.</p>
<p>
<b>Co-Branded Products and Services</b>
<br>We may share your personal information with companies that offer co-branded products or services, such as our co-branded Walmart credit card.
In conjunction with the co-branding program, we may receive compensation from the co-branding activity.
These companies are prohibited from using your personal information for purposes other than offering you, and administering your use of, these co-branded products and services.</p>
<p>
<b>Legal Requirements and Protection of Our Company and Others</b>

We will use reasonable measures to help ensure that any successor treats your information in accordance with this Policy.</p>
<p>
<b>Pursuant to Our Specific Privacy Notices</b>
<br>We have specific privacy notices related to some of our specialized operations.
We may disclose personal information for purposes identified in those notices, which arise in those specialized operational areas.
These specific privacy notices describe additional or different information practices relevant to those operations.
Our specific privacy notices can be found here.
For example, as detailed in the Notice of Privacy Practices, our health services operations will disclose personal information to other health care providers for treatment purposes.</p>
<p>
<b>Deidentified &amp.
Aggregated Personal Information</b>
<br>Walmart continually strives to make customer shopping experiences more relevant and with less friction and may offer related services and insights to its suppliers and others.
As a result, Walmart may share with others insights that combine information from many customers in ways that do not directly identify you.
For example, Walmart may combine your shopping history with that of other customers to deliver generalized insights to Walmart’s suppliers.
These insights do not identify individual customers.
This information helps Walmart suppliers provide products and services relevant to Walmart customers.
Walmart may receive payment for these insights.</p>
<p>To deliver information about products and services that may be of interest to you, we may share information with other companies, such as publishers, advertisers and measurement analytics providers.
For example, we may share device-related data (such as device identifier, type of device, IP address, cookies and other information associated with your browsing and app usage) and individual preferences and characteristics (such as insights and inferences related to shopping patterns and behaviors).
This information does not identify you directly, but is necessary to personalize the advertisements you receive.
Walmart does not receive payment for this information.</p>
<p>We also allow companies that show advertisements on our webpages or our apps to collect information from your browsers or devices via the use of cookies or other technologies.
Like many companies, we may allow cookie matching with select partners.
However, these parties are not authorized to access information from Walmart cookies.
For more information about your choices related to advertising activities see <i>“What are Your Choices?”&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>

Alerts page.

We may also offer additional controls on our use of your mobile location information.</p>
<p>We want to offer you choices about the different ways we collect, use, or share your personal information.
These choices are described below.</p>
<p>
<b>Marketing Preferences</b>
<br>When we are sending marketing communications to you, we use the following standards:<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>We use an opt-in standard for automated phone and text messages, and for sharing personal information with companies outside our corporate family of companies for their use in direct marketing of their products, such as sending you promotions for their products.
Opt-in means we will only conduct the activity with your affirmative consent.
</li>
<li>We use an opt-out standard for email, app notifications, and postal mail.
Opt-out means we may contact you, but will stop upon your request (as described below).
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, these standards may not apply to Walmart-branded credit card offerings because these are provided through associated financial institutions.
However, you can choose to stop receiving certain prescreened offers of credit that originate from participating nationwide credit reporting agencies, including our prescreened offers, by calling the official Consumer Credit Reporting Industry organization at 1-888-567-8688 or by going to www.optoutprescreen.com.
</p>
<p>If you contact us by email or mail, please be sure to include your full name, the types of communications you would like to receive or not receive, and your related contact information.
For instance, if you would like to opt-out of mail, include your mailing address.
Please allow sufficient time for your marketing preferences to be processed.
It may take up to ten days to process your requests related to email and up to 30 days to process your requests related to telephone calls, text messages, app notification and sharing information with your consent.
Please note that postal mailings are often prepared many weeks in advance, and you may continue to receive mail for six to ten weeks.
</p>
<p>Since we do not accept opt-out requests from third parties (except as described in the “<i>What are Your California Privacy Rights?” </i>section),<i>
</i>such as catalog opt-out services, please communicate your request directly to us through one of the mechanisms mentioned above.</p>
<p>Please know that, even if you opted out of receiving marketing communications from us, we may still contact you for transactional or informational purposes.
Some examples are contacts for customer service, product information, service or reminder notices, or recalls.
We may also need to contact you with questions or information regarding your order.
</p>
<p>
<b>Interest-Based Advertising Preferences </b>
<br>We personalize your experience on our sites and mobile services by showing you advertisements that are tailored to your interests.
For example, if you browse or shop for electronics with us or on other sites, we may show you ads for electronics as you continue to browse the Internet.
For more information about browsing information see <i>“Information We Receive from You.” </i>
