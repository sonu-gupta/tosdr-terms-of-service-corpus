<b>How We Use Your Information</b>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>At Hallmark, we are committed to the security and privacy of your information.
</b>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>When you provide us with information about yourself, we only share that information with our partners, like the businesses which help process your orders, service providers (like delivery companies), and contractors.
We give them this information to help fulfill your orders, offer you products and services, and other consumer service-based needs.
Likewise, these companies provide information to us so we can provide you with product or service suggestions we think you might be interested in.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hallmark allows certain companies to place tracking technologies like cookies and pixels on our sites, which allow these companies to receive information about your activity on our websites.
Those companies may use that data to show you more relevant advertisements and promotions.
Learn more about your ability to control privacy settings at the companies we work with, which include but are not limited to, Adobe, Facebook/Instagram, Verizon, LiveRamp, Pinterest and Google/YouTube.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>You always have control over whether these technologies work on your devices.
You can disable them entirely by opting-out of third-party cookies or using your mobile device ID for targeted advertising.
You can also use preferences or settings on your device(s) to manage your privacy controls.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Any non-Hallmark company we work with is contractually not allowed to use this information in any other way.
We value the trust you place in us, and this is one way we strive to preserve it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>Security </b>
<b>
</b>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>To protect your information, we use the same technology your bank uses to protect your information.
For added security, we also use a digital secure server ID to protect you when you use our sites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In other words, the parties to whom we provide your information are people that help us help you.
And we require them to join us in keeping your information safe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>While we are careful with how your information is treated and are selective when choosing other companies and websites with which we interact, any site Hallmark links to is out of our control.
So when interacting with sites outside of Hallmark, please make sure to read their Privacy Policy before sharing your information with them.</p>

You must also describe your request with enough detail so that we can understand, evaluate and respond to it.

Making such a request does not require you to create an account with us, and we will only use the information you provide in a request to verify your identity.
Authorized representatives must provide a signed, written permission to make such requests or power of attorney.
You may also make a request on behalf of your minor child.
</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>

Your personal information may be shared with third parties for business purpose (“service providers”).
Service providers are required to keep the personal information confidential and not use it for any purpose other than what is specified in what is outlined in our contract with them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>Right to Know</b>
</p>
<p>In accordance with the CCPA, you have the right to know what information we have collected about you.
You can request us to disclose this personal information no more than twice in a 12-month period.
This information will be provided in an accessible format that allows you to transmit your data from one entity to another.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>

Visit Customer Care or call 1-877-203-2262 to proceed with this request.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>Right to Delete</b>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Do Not Sell</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In accordance with the CCPA, if you are 16 years or older, you have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information.
Consumers who we know are under 16 are already opted-out of this sale of information, unless they have specifically exercised their right to opt-in.
A parent or guardian must provide an opt-in for consumers less than 13.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Hallmark does not now, nor have we in the past, sell consumer information to third parties for financial gain.
What we sometimes do is to track your device by sending non-identifying information to partners, who then use it to provide you relevant marketing messages.
When we do this, your personal information (name, phone number, etc.) is not shared with them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Under the CCPA, sharing data for online advertising like this may be considered a “sale” of information, and we are required to allow you to opt out of selling your information.
To help you manage the tracking of your information, including browsing history and targeted marketing efforts, you can take action by opting out of cookies and device ID tracking.
Please read the “How We Use Your Information” section of the policy for more information on how you can manage your privacy via third parties.
You can also manage privacy options directly in your device preferences or settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>Other California Privacy Rights</b>
</p>
<p>California’s “Shine the Light” law (Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as S.B.
27) allows customers to opt out of having your personal information shared for direct marketing purposes.
